We went to the \"Syndicate: The Relic Heist\" room tonight, and it was a wonderful experience. The staff is friendly, the room is beautiful, the riddles are interesting and challenging. You have to have at least 4 people as everyone will be busy with one thing or another, and although we didn't get out, we enjoyed it for sure. I want to explore other rooms there! :)
