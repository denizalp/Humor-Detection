This place is bizarre. What's with the huge curtain upon entry that serves no purpose and is just in the way of the line of people ordering. The service? Totally unengaging, unfriendly, and unhelpful. The system they have going on is completely unorganized and inefficient. I found the food very bland. And the atmosphere was what it is, an old car garage with new white paint. I will not be returning.
