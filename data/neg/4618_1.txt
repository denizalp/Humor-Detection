Stopped by on the way to a work event after being trapped underground on the TTC during a power outage. WHEEEE!!\n\nWas rushing to get to work and walked by this cute little shop.\n\nI went inside and selected a coffee and cronut to go.\n\nThe person working inside was super sweet and we had a quick little chat before I left.\n\nNice experience and good coffee, would return!
