We found Carpet Monkeys online and based on the reviews we called for an appointment.  Joe arrived on time...actually he called and let us know he'd be a little early.  He was very professional and did a great job!  It's been awhile since we had it cleaned, but when he was done it looked brand new!  Very reasonable!  We will definitely call again and won't wait as long!  Thank you Carpet Monkeys
