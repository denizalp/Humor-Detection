This place was awesome\nInstead of people watching we couldn't stop staring at all the food coming out going to other peoples tables. Great presentation and our nachos were perfect bite on every chip, even the ones at the bottom. \nTacos just as yummy , lots of food, friendly smiling service . Can't go wrong here !
