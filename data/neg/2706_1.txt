I was tired of paying such a high interest on my car loan I decided to refinance. My own banker at Wells Fargo was no help at all so I went to this location and met with Marco Wibowo. He answered all of my questions and made the entire process quick and easy! They offer great incentives and I walked out with a super low rate. Staff is very helpful and super friendly
