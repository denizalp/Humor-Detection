Great food I always come here when I'm at that side of town plus they're always busy but today I came in at 1:30 p.m. and it wasn't busy which I like and the food the food is awesome and delicious Chris, Guy and the owner very helpful and understanding plus they work with the customers a little bit on the pricey side but still worth it
