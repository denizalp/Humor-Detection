The mango lassi could've been better. \nThe malai kofta had a slight ketchup taste. The kofta balls could've been better. But it was okay overall. \nThe naan bread basket was good. \nMost Indian restaurants give complimentary pappad while we wait (just like the Italian ones give Ciabatta bread) but we weren't offered any pappad here. \nAmbiance was fine.
