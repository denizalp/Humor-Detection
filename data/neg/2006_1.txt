Absolutely amazing time! When you decide to have dinner in complete darkness, that should mean that you're open to the experience and if you're open I have no doubt that you'll enjoy it. The best part, the food! So delicious and full of flavor, despite the fact that it's vegan and the fear it won't be tasty, was not the case. We could not have enjoyed the food more and our server Anthony was wonderful!
