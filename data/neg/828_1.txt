Chynna was really great - she was able to fix the bright yellow home bleaching disaster I created myself and actually make it look pretty! The receptionist wasn't particularly friendly when I called, and the salon has a strange setup (color chairs in the middle of the room, with no station or mirror?) but because Chynna did a great job I will be back. I wish I knew about the Free Awapuhi treatment with color deal, I paid for mine.
