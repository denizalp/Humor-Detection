My family and I came here for a small family reunion.  It was long wait time,and I had Fried Seafood Platter. The platter was cold ,and the bread the waiter served was hard as a rock.  One good thing I can say is I like big portion that they gave,just not cold. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
