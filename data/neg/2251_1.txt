I can understand your server quitting, but being a manager and believing in customer service, the serverice is horrible from waiting over 10 mins before being acknowledged, then almost an hour before order was taken. Top it off with the kitchen blasting loud hard metal music. Not even once did the manager come to apologise nor offer some type of discount for the poor services.
