I'm not a fan of fancy Mexican food. I don't think we need it to contain beets or whatnot. It is very pricy and in a state where Mexican food is so prevalent I feel like they are trying to make themselves look better than what they are. Save your money and go to the tacos stand down the street you'll be happier.
