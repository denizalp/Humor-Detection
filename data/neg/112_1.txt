Came in Friday 10\/24\/14. Got there before it opened because of what I've read on previous yelp reviews. Once we got in I waited for about an hour ,but it was totally worth the wait. I got my cut by Martin. Told him what I wanted even showed him some pics and he nailed it! I've gotten several compliments since. They don't rush it . Will definitely come back soon!
