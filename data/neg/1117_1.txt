They now make you pay up front, before beginning any work. You have to choose everything (colors, designs, shape of nail, etc) & pay before you even sit down. I don't know what happens if you change your mind before any designs are done, etc. but I have never run into the whole pay up front thing before. They did so-so work, not work the money that I paid. It's not often that I decide to treat myself so it really sucks not having a good experience when I do.
