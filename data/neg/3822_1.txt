Last few times were ordered online and picked up in person 10-20 minutes later. Quick service. Pizza was hot. Decent amount of toppings. Can't really complain much (esp if most recent one was free due to T-Mobile Tuesdays). Comes with 1 pepper and 1 garlic butter. Garlic butter consistency varies. Had it completely liquid before. Was solidified this time.
