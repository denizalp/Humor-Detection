Love my church, I have been going since 2004 and have learned so much about God's plan and direction for my life. I recommend attending and going to the Growth Track classes they have. They help you learn about the church and their beliefs and vision for the church.\nFriendly people and lots of groups and ministries to attend and be a part of. Thanks Grace Walk staff and volunteers for making my experience awesome!
