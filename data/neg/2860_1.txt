Ate here twice on our 5 day trip! Once for lunch and once for dinner. The food is absolutely amazing! I got a 1\/4 dark meat with rice and salad along with a Sumol drink (orange soda) and it was so lovely. The meat was tender and flavourful and the staff were very friendly. The one problem was that when they asked to pay debit or cash, I asked if they took credit and the lady responded \"we do but I prefer debit\" was sort of odd... but the nonetheless everything else was great!
