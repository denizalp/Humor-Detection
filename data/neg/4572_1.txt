Wonderful food and outstanding service. French onion soup was the best I have ever had full of sweet onions, flavorful broth, hearty bread and cheese. Oysters were fresh and tender. Shared the larger size beef tartare. The portion was actually rather small but came with fries so was more than enough. Casual yet trendy European feel.
