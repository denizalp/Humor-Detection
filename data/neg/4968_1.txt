Yet another one:\n\nI stopped by on the way from A to B to refill my coffee and use the restroom.\n\nUh-Oh\n\nRestroom is locked after 10 PM. No, I can't borrow the key. Because of problems. \n\nProblems with:\n1. Rideshare drivers?\n2. Veterans?\n3. People wanting a coffee refill and to use the restroom?
