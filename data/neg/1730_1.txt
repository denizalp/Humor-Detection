Wow what a selection of hot dogs and unique food items they have here! We ordered the angry burrito, Carne asada fries, bulgogi dog, and the bacon macaroni and cheese quesadillas. We definately left with a couple leftover boxes. There's about 6 more items on the menu we want to try so we will for sure be back!
