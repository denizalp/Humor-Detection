Went during \"restaurant week\" decided on the featured menu which included the Buttermilk Biloxi fried chicken (the side salad is great) and also a strawberry shortcake for dessert. I haven't seen the shortcake on the menu before so I wasn't sure if it was just for restaurant week. It was amazing! We go here about every other month for lunch and it's always good.
