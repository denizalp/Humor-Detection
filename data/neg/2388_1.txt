This place has super fresh food and I LOVED the poke bowl. The salmon was delicious. I did not think the sushi burger was very good-just alright and kinda small. We had the Korean meat one. The cashier did not get our order right and it was confusing, and they also didn't charge as properly at the end (it was in our favor but I still corrected them and paid the extra 2 dollars). So a little confusing but really good food!
