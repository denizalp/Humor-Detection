This is the cleanest gym I have ever been in. The staff are all friendly, things get put away, and there are plenty of machines and weights so you can get an excellent workout. The stretching area is a bit small and they don't have a complete set of smaller barbells or easy bars, but you can work around that. No frills-- just a nice, bright, clean gym. We've belonged to four different gyms now (they keep getting sold and\/or closing), and we are really happy at YouFit. The price is right too!
