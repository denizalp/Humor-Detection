Went here on 'darkness themed mystery date', so that was obviously perfect. And it was impressive how dark they got the dining room. However, the food and service were average at best, and eating in the dark is 100% less enjoyable than eating not in the dark.\n\nBottom line: interesting idea and sort of fun to do once, but it's not a good restaurant.
