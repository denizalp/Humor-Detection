I love Chamsine so much. Everyone who works there always seems really happy, the food is delicious and fresh, the portions are generous, the prices are a steal, lots of options, easy to customize your meal, and they are very knowledgeable of various dietary restrictions. The falafel plate (which actually fills TWO plates) with an order of the hearty lentil soup is maybe the best value vegan meal you can get in Toronto for $10, and it will feed you all day. In terms of the restaurant itself, they keep it really simple and clean. Most people get take-out.
