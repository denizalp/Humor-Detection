I walked into a BJ's today because I happened to be walking past one to the next store. I am not going to brow beat them but lets just say  NO.. Nope....  Look Costco is up-scale warehouse shopping at its finest. High end product, clothing, food. Exceptional customer service. For example clothing you can return, WHENEVER. Year later no problem. Food.. Oh the food. The stuff they don't directly control (Such as their exceptional meats) they only sell the highest end stuff and I have never been disappointed.  The pumpkin pie is to die for.
