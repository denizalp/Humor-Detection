A Scottsdale, Phoenix institution for almost 40 years. Don & Vicki have been serving up the absolute best thin crust pizza that would beat any in the country, or abroad. The home made sausage is unlike any you will have had. The atmosphere is a true neighborhood trattoria and the staff, most who have been there for a very long time just complement the place. For a special treat, ask if Don will make a pizza for you giving it that little extra time.
