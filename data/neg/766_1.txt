Amazing breakfast and lunch spot in downtown Pittsburgh, right off of Market Square.  Their menu has seasonal items that change each month, but the main sandwiches\/salads stay the same.  They always have a variety of cold salads and cookies\/pastries on the counter.  Limited counter seating, so it's not the best spot for a large group.  The order line does get backed up, but the staff does a great job of keeping it moving.  My favorites are the turkey sandwich and the cuban.
