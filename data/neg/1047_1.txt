My husband and I had lunch here yesterday.  I had the American Pho and he had the Hippie (vegie) Pho. The broth of my pho was good.  My husband liked the House Sriracha and the miso honey sauce.  The garnishes are at a side bar.  We found that both the fresh basil and the cilantro were not necessarily fresh.  The long haired woman who cashiered also cut the limes for the side bar.  We found the prices high compared to other pho restaurants - Saigon Nites and especially Pho Thanh.  We will not eat here again.
