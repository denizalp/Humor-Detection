I go here at least twice a month, if not weekly on tuesdays, with a large group of  regulars. It's always packed and for good reason. The \"meet the meat\" is AMAZING! If you have not had this, and give this place a poor review... You fail. It is seriously one of my favorite spots for a Good casual diner and a tall Blue moon.
