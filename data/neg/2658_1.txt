I've been running with no hot water since Thursday of last week. I requested a quote and James was so helpful. I told him what was wrong and he helped me by calling the company that manufactures the water heater. The company gave James instructions and he forward it to me. I was able to fix the problem and James didn't even need to come by my house to fix it. Thank you so much James!! Amazing customer service!!
