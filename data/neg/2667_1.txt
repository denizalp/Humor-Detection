I have been the customer at this place 6 years. There was a reason I came back to this salon over that time and that was great service and the person who did my nails. She always did an amazing job . When new owner showed up, everything changed, all the technicians that had worked there are gone and you don't see happy faces in the salon anymore. On  top of everything the new owner is unprofessional and unapologetic person. The way he treats people who work for him and me, a long-time customer, is terrible.
