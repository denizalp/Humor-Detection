My husband and I had a great experience with Bill as our wedding DJ. There was one song I had requested before the wedding day and when I asked he said he didn't have it. A few minutes later it came on! Obviously he did what he had to do to make sure we were happy. I spoke with a Rich throughout our booking process and he was always quick to reply and very nice. I definitely recommend BBE!
