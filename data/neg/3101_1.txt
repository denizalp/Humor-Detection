Great people and great experience. My mother and I stopped in for facials, and walked out feeling amazing. My mom received other age-beating treatments, and has never felt better. She'll be flying back to Phoenix from Indiana going forward to visit me, and Pearl Med Spa will continue to be a part of our itinerary!
