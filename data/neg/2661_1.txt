Much like every theater show in Las Vegas, there is a gift shop right outside of it. Now with this shop, I highly recommend going here before the show begins. You will then not be stuck in the craziness when everyone exits and heads into the shop. It is a lot quieter before the show and allows you time to enjoy the \"calm before the storm\".
