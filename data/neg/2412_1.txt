I used to think this place deserved at least 4 stars but with the new happy hour specials (1\/2 off appetizers and margharitas, 1.50 some kinda shredded meat taco that you can get at Juliobertos for a buck Mon-Wed) its gone down to a meh..  Their soda fountain is never calibrated right and now you have to request the complimentary chips and salsa.  Definitely not my favorite anymore!
