I've been to the Twisted Fork several times. Each time, the food has always been delicious. The selection is very good; there's several vegetarian options. I absolutely love their grilled vegetable wrap. I really enjoy the presentation of the food...the rectangular plates add a sense of class. Their daily specials are good, especially when they have 1\/2 price kids meals. My kids love the Shirley Temples. If you haven't tried the Twisted Fork yet, I would definitely recommend it.
