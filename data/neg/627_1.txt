I go to this Bahama bucks frequently but today there was just a different ambience. There was an employee that was getting off work and decided she would hang out and by doing so distracted the others from doing their jobs efficiently. I first was in the drive-through for about 10 minutes before I decided to go inside which I waited another 20 minutes for two shaved ice. The only reason why I waited this long was because I knew it would be worth it but the customer service this time around was just lacking.
