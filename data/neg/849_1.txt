Headed out to a Wednesday evening meeting at 1st Church of Christ, Scientist, Madison, I decided to try Everly en route, and enjoyed the Butternut Squash + Forbidden Rice Curry; but be cautioned the Fresno Chiles pack a little punch. After a couple bites, I knew I would need some toast to clean my bowl, and the sourdough not only aided the task, but too was delicious, brushed lightly with olive oil.\n\nThe service was so quick, on a busy night, I didn't need to check how many more minutes I had to complete my route by 7:30.\n\nYum!
