Terrible experience..3 cancelled appointments in a row, didn't even follow up to see if patient had refill on depression meds. Office staff let's you drive all the way there when they knew 2 hrs prior that your appointment was cancelled. We didn't even get an apology. Second appointment was during week of Thanksgiving and we were told dr. didn't want appointments over holiday week and wouldn't be available. Most uncaring dr. And staff I've had the displeasure to deal with. Left my family stressed out and without answers. We no longer see this dr.
