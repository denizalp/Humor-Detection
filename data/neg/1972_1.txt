This is my first time to go to a hookah bar in las vegas. Very chill place... they don't have a live DJ which im used to but great food and amazing margarita. I love there unique hookah tables... its comfortable. They do close early for las vegas but the girl who is waitong on us is very friendly and staff is attentive. I would come back.
