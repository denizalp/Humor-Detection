When I was getting my gel maicure the guy was in such a rush to finish. My nails didn't look good when I finished. When the guy was \"massaging\" my hands he literally massaged my hand dry was in such a hurry to finish didnt take his time at all. The way my sisters nails were painted was also in such a rush and not looking good after we finished. My moyher was very satisfied with the manicure because the lady took her time and everything came out amazing for her.
