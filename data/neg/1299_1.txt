Lana is a top-notch tailor and a delightful personality. She recently altered some of my dresses and did a superb job while meeting my aggressive deadline. She has a keen eye for fashion. I noticed a gorgeous purple gown on a mannequin when I first visited the shop and fell in love!! Turns out that Lana designed and created it herself. I bought it that day and can't wait to paint the town purple in my couture quality gown!! Thanks for your great services. I will be back for more fun.
