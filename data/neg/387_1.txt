Needed a new outlet and install for a mounted tv.  Requested a quote on Friday, they called within hours to schedule the assessment for Saturday afternoon. Rep was pleasant, on time and forwarded the fairly priced quote early Monday AM. After a few emails, the job was scheduled for later in the week. Technicians arrived early, were efficient and were done within 40 minutes!!  \n\nHighly recommend! Will contact again for future needs.
