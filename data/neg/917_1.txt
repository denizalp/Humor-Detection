Had a very nice dinner here with the family all of the food was great. We all got different cuts of beef and everyone was very pleased. While I was happy to see they had bourbon they butchered the old fashioned. Maybe I'm just a snob but an old fashioned should never have muddled fruit in it. It's an old simple drink of bitters sugar whiskey and an orange peel. But that was my fault for not reading the menu so the stars stay! Very friendly service as well!
