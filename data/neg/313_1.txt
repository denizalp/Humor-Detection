I would highly recommend this company.  They worked with our wonky schedule and fit us in.  We had a whole office suite worth of furniture to assemble, both relocated furniture and new furniture.  The tech called 30 minutes ahead to confirm the appointment, showed up on time, dressed appropriately.  Treated our office, and furniture with respect and did a fantastic job.  Pricing was affordable and I would bring them back to complete more projects.
