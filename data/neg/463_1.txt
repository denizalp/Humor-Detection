Loved Loved Loved this show. If you are a Beatles fan it is a must see. Their isn't much of a story but rather it is a great visualization to go along with some of the best Beatles songs, and the performers were amazing. It's a small theater setting which gives it an intimate feel. My only complaint is I wish I had time to see it again.
