Ordered their signature dish steak fajitas. Presentation was nice unfortunately meat was dry and tasteless and served with steaming hot rubbery microwaved tortillas. If you are more interested in drinking and socializing and less interested in food quality might work for you. Anyone who wants a better food experience look elsewhere.
