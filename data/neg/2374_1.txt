Jilbert gives good service some of the time.  When he is good, he is still usually late, but helpful.  The problem is,  every once in a while, he just disappears and can't be reached for weeks at a time, leaving the customer in a very disadvantaged situation. I have known him a long time, and in the beginning I was satisfied, but the last two times were bad.
