Meh... it was ok. They have a lot of things to read on their displays, but not enough hands on displays. Really disappointed in the \"music\" area... the Forces of Nature area was pretty neat. Probably a good place for little kids, but not teenagers. They were pretty bored... you can stack only so many pieces of wood....
