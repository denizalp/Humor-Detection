This place had really good Thai food.  Their pad thai was great along with the bubble tea.  Their thai currys are excellent.\n\n It was over a bit overpriced though.  Portions were also small and they charge for extra white rice..  I would go down the street to Tree- Country.  Bigger portions for a cheaper price.
