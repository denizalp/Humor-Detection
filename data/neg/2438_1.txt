We were out celebrating a birthday on Saturday nite. Our party of 8 turned into 20. I have to give a shout out to our server, Lindsey. She was very nice, efficient and never complained or showed stress any time someone new arrived. She worked her butt off and kept a smile all the while. If you stop by, I hope you get to meet her, she was awesome!\n\nAside from that, food was delicious. Drinks were unbelievable. We had The Conquistador. Best drink on the menu hands down. And the DJ was on point! \n\nLove this place!
