If I could give six stars I would. Let me start with Kenna and Kristin. Awesome awesome service from both. The food was amazing as we're the prices. Happy Hour was amazing,  the pork street were to die for. The atmosphere is lively,  beautiful breeze flowing though the open doors. I can't say enough about the food. If I lived in the area this would be my joint!!
