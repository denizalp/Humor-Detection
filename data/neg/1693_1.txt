It's right across the las Vegas premium outlets. The only good thing about checking in here. Went through Expedia and didn't realize I had book only one bed. I tried to upgrade but the front desk are unhelpful. Not even a single try. It's a no regardless. THE WORST HOTEL SERVICE THAT I'VE COME ACROSS IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE!! Never will I check in here again.f
