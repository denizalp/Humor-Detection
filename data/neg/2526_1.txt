Ordered food and delivered to my home via Grub Hub. My second time. I ordered yellow curry with chicken and massaman curry with beef. Also, I ordered spring rolls with shrimp. The latter was excellent but the curry dishes may as well have been vegetarian. Lots of liquid and veggies. The chicken was sparse and the beef, what there was of it, had gristle.  That's not good. Chicken and beef dishes should actually contain those ingredients especially since I paid for that. \n\nI'm afraid I won't order again. Shame because I really liked having a Thai option for delivery.
