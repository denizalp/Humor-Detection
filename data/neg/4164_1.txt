Wow !  Can't believe it took me this long to eat here. Has a rustic feel too it, comfy bar area. Had to wait 30 minutes for our reservation and management offered everyone in our entire party a free drink for the hassle, got to enjoy a free 13 dollar crown on the rocks. Got the beef wellington which was epic. Shrimp add on was worth every penny. Great service and the food was amazing. Can't wait to come back!!
