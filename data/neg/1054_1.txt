Went to the healthcare clinic at this location on 6\/25\/18, Carrie was on duty at the time. She was very kind, caring and professional and also gave me a follow up call a few days after to see how I was doing. I will definitely use this clinic again. Thank you Walgreens for having such a caring professional. \n\nRose
