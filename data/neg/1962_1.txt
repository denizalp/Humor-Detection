Cute minimalistic shop that opened up where Success Tutorial School USED to be (Ah the good ol' times haha)\nOrdered almost everything on the left side of the macaron stack. Cutest disney macarons ever! The flavours were pleasant; distinct but not overly sweet. I did a blind taste test and some of them were hard to guess ex. Pistachio (but still tasted good!) \nMy favourite was Pooh and Mike!\n\nMickey - Passionfruit\nMinnie - Pistachio\nDonald - Tiramisu\nPooh - Mango\nPiglet - Strawberry\nSulley - Blueberry\nMike - Citron\nTotoro - Black Sesame
