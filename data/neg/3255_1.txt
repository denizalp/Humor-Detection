Update: Second visit.  I went back to Anastastia, this time with a photo of the hairstyle I wanted. She listened very carefully to what I wanted, and my haircut turned out perfectly. She gave me tips on how to style my hair and what to use including how much and how to apply it. I am 100% satisfied with this haircut. \n\nI was a bit dismayed to learn that Sarah, who did my pedicure was no longer with the salon.  \n\nI will definitely be returning to Gavin Scott.
