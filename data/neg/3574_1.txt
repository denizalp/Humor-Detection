The sushi is cheap.... The fact that it is on a conveyor belt ensures that you will eat quickly, which is a benefit compared to other sushi places. I've been probably about 5 times the last few months because I wanted a quick and cheap meal. \n\nThe rolls are decent, but def not hight quality by any means. However my friend had a super sensitive stomach and has fared well here each time :)\n\nService is okay... Sometimes they are really pushing you out so they can increase turnover.
