We looked at the store front and thought, either the best or worst food we'll eat. It's the best!! Starts with fried tortillas and salsa, which we loved and inhaled! They had to bring us more. So good. \nWe ordered the tampaqino because of the reviews. Very moist and tender. Steak fajitas were also tender and come piled high with a lot of left overs. Delicious!! Everyone should try it out.
