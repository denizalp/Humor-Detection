Like many Pittsburgh expats, I eat at Primanti's everytime I come back to visit.  The Harmarville location is notably worse than the Strip District location.  My corned beef was bland, and the coleslaw dry and flavorless.  I hope the whole chain isn't going downhill.  Next time I'm going to the Strip for my Primanti's fix.
