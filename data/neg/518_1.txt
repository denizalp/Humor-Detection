This place is fantastic! The staff are super friendly, and the food is DELICIOUS!! And omg, the horchatte is just ridiculous. Probably the best horchata latte I've ever had. I love the casual atmosphere, and how welcoming it feels. I look forward to coming back for happy hour and checking out the cocktails!
