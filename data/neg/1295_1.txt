Proud to build, proud to own? I think not! I am shocked at how quickly things went down hill towards the end of the construction process. I have purchased several new homes from other builders and have never had such poor customer service. Bottom line... every other negative review before mine is true and accurate. I experienced almost everything these other reviews have stated. If you have an option to go with another builder, I would highly recommend it!
