Meh. Used to prefer this place. But after trying theaters further north with reserved, reclining seats, this seems like a b-grade experience. For better or worse, it's like seeing a film in the 90s. Except you can see cell phones when they're pulled out (unlike newer recliner layouts). \n\nAlso, what's up with not having Fandango scanning? We bought tix in advance, but still had to stand in the ticket line to get them converted to paper. Kinda lame.
