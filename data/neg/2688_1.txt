We found this place on Google Maps, saw the great reviews, and checked it out. Thank God we did. The ice cream was delicious, the staff was attentive, and the owner was super nice. He came around to every table checking if we needed anything, and even took our garbage and threw it out. We will definitely be back, even though we live on the east side.
