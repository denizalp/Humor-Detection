Just enjoyed a fantastic dinner here. I was really impressed with the friendliness and knowledge of the waitstaff. I learned some new things about Ethiopian food. I got the vegetarian combo and it was awesome. I really liked the spinach. The decor is kind of old fashioned but it's definitely a worth while mom and pop type of place.
