Any time I am in Arizona, I go to Garcia's. I think that they have the best authentic Mexican food in town. I recommend getting one of the sampler plates or at least one of he chimichangas. I'm only giving four stars because it took an incredibly long time at this location to get menus and our order taken. Aside from having to get up and ask for menus and drinks--everything else about the experience was great! Eat at Garcia's!
