Honey Salt is perfect for a date night or night out with friends. A little pricey but the food is delicious. The presentation of the food is beautifully done and the portion sizes are just right so you don't feel the need to over eat\/you have room for dessert! The decor is also fabulous and you can tell the owner is detail oriented. Highly recommend checking it out. \n\nNote: the front of the building is under construction so it was difficult to spot but it can be found in the middle of the plaza.
