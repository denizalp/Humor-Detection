I ate here a while ago, I had a decent experience.  The food was ok, was pretty informal for the price we paid tho.  I remember sitting on some stools or high chairs towards the front of the restaurant. Overall, I feel like I could of ate better food and had better atmosphere at a cheaper Mexican restaurant.  I would come here again tho, and give it another try.
