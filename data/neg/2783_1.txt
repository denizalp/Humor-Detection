I have died and gone to gluten free heaven. The chicken and waffles are better than I have even had in the south when I used to eat gluten. It's a good thing I don't live in phoenix because I'd never leave this place.... I think there's actually space on the patio for a tent. Maybe I'll stay and have another cinnamon roll.
