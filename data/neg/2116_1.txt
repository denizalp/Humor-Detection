I only like Pho broth a a few places. We decided to try this place and got Pho Tom (shrimp) with the beef broth. It was incredibly good and is in my top 3 Pho places now. We will definitely become regulars here. My only suggestion is that they need new menus. The current ones don't have numbers and there are things that are handwritten.
