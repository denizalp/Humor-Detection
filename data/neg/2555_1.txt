I've worked here, but I no longer do anymore.  The one thing I would have to say is that, I've never seen another restaurant up to par on how fresh their ingredients are.  From the veggies to the protein, the seafood, its all fresh fresh fresh.  The sushi bar serves the best rolls.  All you have to do is ask the sushi chefs whats good for the day and they will recommend you the best they can offer.  Ask for Josh, he's on his game at the sushi bar.
