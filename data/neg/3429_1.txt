The adult pool is nice, to get away from all the screaming kids, but even tho they call it \"adult\", it's not topless like some others.\n\nI tried one jacuzzi and the jets didn't work, then I tried another and the water was cold!  I tried a third one and the jets didn't work in that one either!  They need to maintain the place better or it'll get run down pretty soon.\n\nThe bright spot was our server Charelle- she was really awesome.  Worked really hard and treated us well.
