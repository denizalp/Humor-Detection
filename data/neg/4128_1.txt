Been wanting to check this place out for sometime, so my roomate and I stopped in for their Sunday brunch. Now I see why the reviews are so good! I had the arugula salad, my friend had an omelette, and we shared the burrata. Sooo good and I cant wait to come back for dinner. The only complaint I had was that our server was a bit pretentious,  but otherwise we really enjoyed the House Brasserie!
