Been living here in Las Vegas for almost two years now and have not found a great Thai cuisine place with decent prices off of the strip until I ran into this place. The food is very flavorful and great! Pricing is not sky high it's just right. 5 stars for friendly staff and great food. Decor and atmosphere is nice a cozy inside. Come get one of the best pad thai in town. And your option of spicy level 1-10 is absolutely awesome! Finally found my go to for Thai cuisine from now on!
