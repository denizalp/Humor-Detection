Very friendly owners and staff, wonderful customers who engage in stimulating conversation with you if desired, great location (especially in warm, sunny weather), nice variety of flavourful coffees and specialty drinks, good assortment of baked treats (though they tend to run out if you get there past 11:30), Wi-Fi that works well 98% of the time, lots of free parking on the street, and very reasonably priced. One of my favourites to visit when it's not filled to capacity.
