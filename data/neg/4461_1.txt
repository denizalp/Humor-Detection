After needing a new mechanic because my old mechanic messed up my front end repair, Troy and his expert mechanics took on the challenging repair process. This was no easy feat! After a couple weeks of fighting with it and it fighting back, the work was done and done well. I'm happy with the work and recommend Leroy's to everyone!
