If you haven't done this little jaunt, you definitely need to!...we had a blast! It took on a road through Red Rock Canyon and the views are spectacular. Our guides Frank and Cody were very cool! The little gas powered golf cart sized vehicles on steroids were easy to navigate. Yeppers, I definitely recommend this time of fun
