I've ever been here before but I've heard good things about it and I had a coupon so might as well. Drive thru took longer than expected to get our food even though we were the only ones there, and the drive thru guy was a little snippy with me, and told me I should have told him about the coupon earlier even though I said I had one before we even started ordering. Fish was okay, wish it came with tartar sauce instead of the red sauce they gave us :\/ I wasn't very impressed with it
