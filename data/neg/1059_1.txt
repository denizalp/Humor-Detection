Horrible service every time I go here.  My last visit the blonde cashier told me long lines are normal here because they are the only gas station in the area. Sad. Huge lines, with only one cashier on register most times and the rest hiding in the back. Pizza by the slice is usually hours old and rock solid. Plus the shelves are fu of empty holes.  They should visit my new gas station on dysart just south of I10 because they truly know customer service.
