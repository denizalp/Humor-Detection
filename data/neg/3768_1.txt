I went there one time and paid with my one hundred dollar bill and they tried it on the machine but it was giving a red light even though we got it from the bank. They called the manager and he threw it in our face after trying it himself and said that it's fake. One of the cashiers looks at it on the light and knew it was real and told him then he believed us. But their treatment was trash.
