I love Davidson. I grew up within 20 miles of Davidson and I live here now. It's a great community but too much traffic because of I-77. the pedestrian areas are dangerous these days. We need more police on bikes and in town to control the traffic and pedestrians that do not use the crosswalks downtown. It's crazy!
