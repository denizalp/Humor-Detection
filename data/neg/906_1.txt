I love this place so much! As soon as I walk in the ambiance is light and bright. Every time I go I am torn between crepes so I make sure I share a sweet and a savory one too. I love their lattes, rspecially vanilla! The milk is creamy and foamy just enough and the espresso shots are not bitter. I wish there was another location in the central Phoenix area.
