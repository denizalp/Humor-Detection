I work down the street from this Pita Jungle location and a lot of times people just settle for what's next door from their work just to get by, but that's not the case here. \n\nI love their menu and it has so many options to pick from. Friendly for everyone including for those who don't eat meat. This location is very cleaned and customer service rocks! If you choose to dine here you'll leave with a full tummy and a smile on your face :o)\n\nA+
