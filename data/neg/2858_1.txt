OK, I hate shopping, but this was bearable for a couple of reasons. 1. It was Monday, and after 7 PM, so it was virtually empty. 2. It is very well laid out and easy to navigate. I found stores I had no idea were there outside of your usual outlet offerings. Hello, Torrid! I wasn't even there for myself and managed to stock up on a few things. I would go back...on a Monday...after 7pm Haha!
