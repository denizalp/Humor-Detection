I have ordered from here before. The food has been ok. My last order I ordered over $100 of takeout but was missing the salt and pepper squid. I phoned to to tell them. The lady who answered says her friend put it on top. I did not get the squid yet she is telling me her friend put it on top. Please check the order before you leave! I will never order from them again. I do not like liars and dishonest people. Very sad when that happens.
