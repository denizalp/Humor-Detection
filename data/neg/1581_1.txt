The BEST coffee place I've ever been to. The staff is always friendly and often hilarious. The drinks are delicious and everything is reasonably priced. I love that they sell local art and the atmosphere is perfect. They even have chess if you need something to do besides the internet. My fianc√© and I had our first date here and if we hadn't moved to Gold Canyon, we would still be visiting constantly.
