Carolyn is a top notch dental hygienist!  She remembers me and my needs between cleanings and is a perfectionist with cleaning my teeth.  Richard and the front desk are also amazingly friendly and helpful.  And, of course, Dr. Poremba is very professional, responsive and caring.  Highly recommend this whole staff all the way around!
