Horrible customer service, usually out of stock on prescriptions if you need more than 1 or 2. Zero help from pharmacy staff. Texted me at 7:59 PM that my Rx was ready, went to the pharmacy counter, greeted with metal shutters. Pharmacy closes at 8:00 PM. Getting ready to move prescriptions someplace more reassuring and helpful. Dirty exterior and grounds too.
