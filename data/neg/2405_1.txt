Cool revolving sushi bar. Excellent speedy waitress service. Not the highest quality sushi but you definitely can not beat it for the price. My wife and I ate here for less than 20$ and that's hard to do with sushi. It's a very good place to go if you're new to sushi and want to try some new rolls but don't want to spend 11$ for 8 pieces. Go here and get 3 pieces for 2$ and if you don't like it well it was only 2$!\n\n\n  Nice atmosphere and an okay place to take kids.
