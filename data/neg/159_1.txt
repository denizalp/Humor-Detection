While not quite true authentic Japanese style Ramen like you get at Monta's in Vegas, it's the best tasting Ramen I've found In the Valley of the Sun.\n\nI find the owner very personable and honest about his attempt at making Ramen. He treats it as a work in progress and a constant learning process to find the right balance and above all ... consistency. \n\nPractice makes perfect ... stop by and take a taste of the young masters craft!
