We came in to add a new line on our existing account as well as purchase 2 new phones , from the moment we walked in Braulio was attentive and helpful. He was very patient and was able to answer all our questions thoroughly. Best customer service I've had in a T-Mobile store. I went the to the one on stapley and mckellips and this one by far is better. It's worth the drive .
