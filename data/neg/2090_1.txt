This is the second time I've been to RM seafood. Rick Moonen has a great menu and all the fish are sustainable catch which is far more ethical than most fish places selling fish from the cheapest source and steroid riddled male only Tilapia. Try the skate wings or the awesome sushi. Great service and great food. I will be back.
