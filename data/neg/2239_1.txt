We stayed at the Flamingo Hotel and finding this bar was a gem. We woke up early just to explore the hotel before the morning rush. It was about 8am. A bartender named Kevin called out to us saying it's still happy hour. We laughed and he said it's 5 o'clock somewhere  this became our late night and early morning spot everyday of our vacation. Carlos was also a great bartender. Drinks, atmosphere, and bartenders make this place perfect. I think happy hour is from 11pm to 10am not sure though.
