All I have to say is the best things come in small packages. I didn't realize that it would be \"hole-in-the-wall\" small atmosphere but it was so cozy we sat at the bar and the staff did great job of giving is the low down of how how to choose plates and wine. I give props to the cook because the Beef Vindaloo was my favorite and tasted just like my mom's. Holy cow amazing. Great experience.
