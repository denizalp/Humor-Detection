Had our parents 50th Anniversary at Sweet Basil.  We had such a terrific time and it was so much fun.  Our chef Stephanie was a delightful and she was extremely knowledgeable and gave us great cooking tips.  The owner Martie made everything so easy for me and was a pleasure to work with.  We would for sure do it again.  Thank you Martie and your entire staff!!\nPS...the food was delicious!!!
