My grandmother and I went to breakfast this morning and we had the BEST SERVICE! \nNaomi was a fabulous hostess with a smile and professionalism that seems to be rare these days. Samm, our server, never missed a beat and took excellent care of us from the very beginning to the very end. Samm, also had a great smile and professionalism that was always present. \nI was extremely impressed by both today and had to share.
