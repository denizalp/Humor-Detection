I'm so happy this place opened! We had a great night, and Matt our bartender was attentive and kept the drinks flowing! We have been back twice, and haven't had a bad experience! Not sure why so many bad reviews, but we had an excellent time! French Dip Burger was to die for, will definitely be coming back!
