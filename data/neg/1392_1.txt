Went again today and it was not as good.  The sushi chef Tommy was a real jerk.  His rolls were no where near as good as the last guy when I was here before.   So if you go and find that Tommy is the sushi chef, I would not recommend sitting at the sushi bar, and might even recommend you just leave.
