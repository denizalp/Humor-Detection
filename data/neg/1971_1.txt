This is about fab customer service! Thank you Chase for making my Starbucks experience very positive. Why? Your friendly, your attitude and wanting to please. I came in for a nitro and it appears due to storms that hit your area your store was without power which impacted the ability to have Nitro.  You made alternate suggestions and were so sincere. I had a cold sweet creme brew and it was fab! Thanks again and I'll stop by again.
