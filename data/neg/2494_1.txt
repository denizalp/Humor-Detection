Nice, appropriately-priced food. They have an all day breakfast available for about $5 -$6 each. They have a wide assortment of fresh juices too!\n\nI ordered a daily special of grilled omlete sandwich. Took a few minutes to get, and the serving size was okay, maybe a tad bit on the small side. The omlete was filled with onions, cheese and tomatoes though, definitely a good deal for around $6 with tax. Only caveat is that it is a bit off main campus.
