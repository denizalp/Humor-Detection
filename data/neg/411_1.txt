Tu Do is a rare gem, with the most delicious Vietnamese food that i have ever tasted. The owner and her daughter Tina are lovely people who go out of their way to make a delicios meal with a friendly atmosphere. We went with a group of 32 people and it was just sensational.\n\nThe tofu rolls,spring rolls, the chicken curry soup and the barbeque pork are not to be missed. It is always consistent with reasonable prices and superb dishes.
