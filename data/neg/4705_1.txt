My new favourite AYCE restaurant. It has so many options!\n\nThe decor is very nice, the washrooms are super clean, the service was fantastic (handled our group of 15ish with ease), the food was super good quality and best part about the food was you can eat as much as you want!\n\nI cant wait to go back!
