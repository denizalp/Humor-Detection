Frank & Finas...where have you been all of my 7 years in Las Vegas?! I'm so grateful to my friend E.B. for recommending this fantastic restaurant to me. The food was delicious and the only down side is that I just found out about it. Shucks! Anyways, great food, nice ambiance and great service. Can't wait to go back...the vegetarian enchiladas were amazing by the way....oh and the margaritas too, of course :)
