This company was hired through our home warranty to fix a clogged sink drain and a garbage disposal. He came right on time and was here for no longer than 45 minutes and repaired both issues. He didn't try to charge us anything above what we pay our home warranty, which some plumbers have tried in the past. We are very thankful for this type of service. We hope to use him again in the future when the need arises!
