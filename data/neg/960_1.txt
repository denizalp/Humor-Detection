really like the concept of aroma which has a lot of food options along with drinks, real meals where we can get full from, the food feels really healthy (not really sure it it is) the service at this markville mall location is nice and quick, good amount of spaces to sit inside or out on the patio. it's a bit hidden if your coming from inside the mall.
