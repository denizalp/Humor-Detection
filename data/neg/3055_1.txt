I normally like retro spots like these. This one didn't really wow me. The food is extremely greasy, kind of flavorless and they cover all the ice cream in chocolate syrup. The service was pretty speedy and I've never seen it jam packed so you can get in and out quickly. Decent place for a quick bite or if you live in the neighborhood and want to walk up it would be a nice little walk.
