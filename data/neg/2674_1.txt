My favorite Eclectic American Restaurant in the Valley of the Sun. Always a full menu of options from Fish to Hamburgers to Enchiladas and everything in between like a zesty taste of Louisiana in some options. The ultimate friendly staff with Reservations as an option for your party or a private room for that select occasion. As well, a fantastic OTB for Thoroughbred enthusiasts.
