John was fantastic!  I'm by no means a connoisseur of massage, but he was professional, courteous, and gave me a great deal (one ever better than the one I had found online).  I went in a couple of months after having a pretty intense surgery, and he totally helped re-awaken all of my muscles while also being sensitive to my incision and aches.  I would definitely recommend him!
