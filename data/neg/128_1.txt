Went for lunch today with seven co-workers.  Five of us ordered the Rush Burger.  We all agreed it was tastless and maybe slightly undercooked.  The other two had Seafood and enjoyed their meal.  \nThe service was lousy, not sure if they were under-staffed today.  \nWe all agreed that Rush was not something we would do again.
