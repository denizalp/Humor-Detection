I've seen countless botched or infected piercings and was slightly nervous since I had never gotten a piercing and didn't really have standards to compare this place to. That being said I came here because people rave about Halo. I got my nose and belly button done a few weeks ago and they are healing beautifully. The nose didn't hurt, belly did, it's different for everyone but the pain only lasts a second. I love the placement and look of my piercings, thanks to the great staff here for cleanliness, friendliness and professionalism.
