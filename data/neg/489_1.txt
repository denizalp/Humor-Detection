Came here with my work on a Friday afternoon for Happy Hour. They were very accommodating of our reservation especially because there were 20+ of us. They were also very good with service and splitting checks.\n\nFood is good!  I got the sashimi ceviche which was pretty tasty. Coworkers said they enjoyed their selections. \n\nGreat to know that there's a good, upscale Japanese inspired restaurant close by. Only thing is that it was a little dark inside. The bar area seemed like a great place too.. especially now that it's warming up.\n\nI'd come here again.
