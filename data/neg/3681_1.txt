So good! Romados has perfected their chicken, and even though you don't see the chicken in this picture, it's hiding under all those fries! You get a good portion of fries and salad and rice too, and couldn't even finish all the fries. We got two half combos, and three of us couldn't even finish it! So much food. \n\nAlso definitely try their egg tarts! I was hoping the egg tarts would be warm, but they're cold. A sweet dessert, and while they look like Portuguese egg tarts I've had before, didn't quite taste the same. Still yum though.
