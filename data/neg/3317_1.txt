We stopped in at this Popeyes on the strip to grab a quick bite to eat. Once we got back to our hotel which wasn't far the food was not very fresh. My husband and I got a personal order together and needless to say we still didn't finish it after sharing. The fries were so cold and disgusting. The chicken was just ok and the red beans and rice didn't have a good ratio of cold rice and beans. It was super thick. Not going back
