the food here is just off the chart!! so fresh and mouth watering.  we went here with a group of 6 and did the 3 course tasting for about $60 each...they ask you if you're allergic or dislike anything and then they create 3 AMAZINGLY deelish courses!! go here when in Vegas and craving sushi! and being a fusion of Japanese and Peruvian foods makes it a truly unique experience! the service was great too!!
