This was a pleasant surprise. I ordered a taco and a quesadilla. The pastor seasoning was beyond perfection. As for the quesadilla, I am at a loss for words. If you are looking for some tortilla grilles with some shredded cheese, this is not what you are gonna get here. They make their own corn dough and fill it with yummyness of your choice of protein with lots of Oaxaca cheese. The way it is supposed to be! Very authentic Mexican food. I'll definitely come back!
