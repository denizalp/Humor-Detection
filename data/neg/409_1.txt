Loved it. Had the Skinny which was the perfect light breakfast before heading out to hike Camelback. Andrea and the rest of the staff were great and backed each other up like a well oiled machine. The coffee was robust and never emptied or cooled too far. Orange juice was fresh and complimented the egg whites and spinach of the Skinny just right. Good playlist in the background as well. Couldn't have asked for a better breakfast that Memorial Day morning.
