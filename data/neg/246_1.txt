My husband would rate the Mihami Vice TEN stars if he could. I never hear him rave about a sandwich, but he's obsessed! The French toast is good, a little in the dry side, but not bad. The new morrissey burrito is tasty! I wish the roasted veggies weren't 90% onion and even more so, I wish that the mixed veggies weren't pre-mixed so that I could request no onions (as onions can cause migraines for me.) The vibe of the place is chill and relaxing. We love that the sandwiches help support local causes.
