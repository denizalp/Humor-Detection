First time at this jewel of a restaurant. Everyone was so nice and appeared to be genuinely happy that we were there. Our seriously handsome waiter Steve was well informed and very attentive. I used a Groupon and so glad they offer that service since I don't think I would have discovered this place since I'm on the other side of town. 3 words to know : Chilean Sea Bass. It was a special, we signed up for emails just to know when we can have it again!  Looking forward to my next visit!
