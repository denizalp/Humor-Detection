Excellent quality and variety of products in a nice showroom. One stop shop if you are building a house, however it is costly. My only complaint is the service. There is a female there very often, who I actually think is one of the owners, and she is gruff, unfriendly and really doesn't convey that she appreciates business. Everything seems like a chore for her and she actually makes me not want to walk into the showroom.
