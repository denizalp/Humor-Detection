Hands down the best sushi I've had up till now. The sea bass is damn.... so good. I had to order the same thing twice. 2 orders of sea bass, 2 of the fish ceviche, 2 of the tuna sashimi, and 2 bottles of sake to wash it down for 2 people. I'm going to be a returning customer for sure. If you eat here you won't regret it. Don't be cheap when it comes to food. This place will not disappoint.
