If you want a taste of Argentina, this restaurant is a must visit. As soon as we entered the restaurant, we could smell the aroma of fresh grilled meat.  I heard the heavy Porte√±o accent in the background from a guy with long hair, observed the pictures of Maradona on the wall, and saw soccer playing on TV, and knew I was in the right place. As far as the food, we had a sample of each empanada (they were all good), as well as a sampling of choripan and milanesas, which were delicious. Overall a great experience.
