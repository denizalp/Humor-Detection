As far as airport food goes, Whiskey River is better than most. I always get the Carolina Cobb salad and have not had any issues with the quality.\n\nThey always seem to be short staffed, or the hostess fails to tell the server they have sat guests in their section.  This trips service was better than normal.  They seem to be trying to rectifying this situation with the at table call buttons.  I didn't need to use the call button on this visit. Let's hope I won't need to use it in the future either.
