So disappointing. Lived in Korea for six years and usually the smaller restaurants have the better food (most of the time). I know being stateside it's difficult to compare the authenticity of Korean food, but the food here was not even close. They added way more vegetables and spices into the ramen and bulgogi that it took away the taste of the main dish. \n\n I rather pay more at a Korean BBQ restaurant than come here.
