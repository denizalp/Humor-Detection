This place is awesome. I've been getting my liquid here for about 6 months now. You can't beat their prices! I've been vaping for almost 4 years and I always bought juices that were $12 for 15mls or $22 for 30mls. I would never even try the juices made in shops. This place has changed that! They make some good flavored liquid. 60mls for $14. You can't beat that. The staff there is also super cool.
