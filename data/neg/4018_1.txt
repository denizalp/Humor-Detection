Arrived at 9ish on a Friday night and the place was quite busy.  Excellent wait staff.  Extremely knowledgeable about the products - both beer and food.  Had some different beers than usual.  The food was very yummy - especially the frites.  Nice to site cosy together in a banquette and enjoy the evening.  Love the interior - the light fixtures in the bar area especially.
