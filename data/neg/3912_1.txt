Honestly I think Whataburger's food is on par with most fast food- nothing significantly better or worse. \nI just love the vibe and how it's almost like a time capsule back to how places were when I was growing up. It just seems to have that old school burger vibe to me (not to be confused with 50's diner vibe).
