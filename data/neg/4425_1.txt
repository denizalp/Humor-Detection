This place is very clean and nice. Service is ok not the best I didn't know you seat yourself until the man at the register spoke up. Pho was delicious broth is very good has great flavor and they aren't stingy with the brisket\/flank. If you know what I mean lol -- gave 3 stars only because I ordered their Viet ice coffee and It literally was a cup full of ice. Small cup maybe 12oz but felt like 4oz was actually coffee not worth $4-5 . Got maybe 3 sips--as for pho it's delicious but Try for yourself.
