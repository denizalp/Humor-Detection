We came here for the first time based on other high reviews but we were disappointed in the slow service. I had the nachos and my husband the green chili stew, the food was good but after waiting an hour to receive it we felt deflated. We were seated at 8:15 pm, took an hour to receive our food and now near 20 mins to pay.  We are finally leaving at 9:55 pm.
