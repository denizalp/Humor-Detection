I work in food service and what happened today at perfect pair was completely unacceptable. I sat for almost 20 minutes after originally being seated without my table being approached by a server. The servers touched multiple other tables around us and even directly next us. I have no feedback on the food as i left after this incident but would definitely not recommend perfect pair based on the service alone
