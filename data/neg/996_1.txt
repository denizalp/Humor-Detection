This place is located in a strip mall and has plenty of parking. It wasn't crowded at all when we got there so we got to sit in a nice comfy booth. I had the BBQ sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was really delicious!! It came with a side of sauce & a dipping sauce for the fries. It's a fun place that would be perfect to come with friends to grab some food and get some drinks.
