The food was great, and very reasonably priced. I absolutely love the interior design\/decor. Gives the place a very \"fancy\" vibe. Service was a little slow (probably just due to being understaffed), but the server was cheerful and kind nonetheless. Some of their menu items' portions were smaller than what was expected, but the quality was great which makes up for it. Will definitely be visiting again!
