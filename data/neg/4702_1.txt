This escape room was fun! The staff was awesome. John & B were great. At the beginning of the tour we asked for no help & received an ample amount of help. Myself & my friends do a lot of escape rooms, so we'd had preferred to figure out everything on our own.  The rooms were extremely authentic & put most haunted houses to shame. Overall a great place. Go private if you can, so you don't get stuck with another big group. www.Escapearoundtheworld.com
