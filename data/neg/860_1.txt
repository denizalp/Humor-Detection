This is a lovely little garden, well maintained by day, with a water fountain that serves as communal bird bath, with benches encircling it. It's a peaceful place to come by to read. It has shade and open areas, so bring in sunscreen!   There is also a gazebo and in the summertime, it is used for free outdoors summer concerts. But I have not gone so I can not speak.
