shopping at  furniture creations in tempe was an excellent experience, the prices are cheaper than online and at other furniture stores. Juli, the manager, provided us with a very enjoyable  experience, she was quick in helping us find what we were looking for and she has a lot of experience, we showed her a picture of something that we were looking for and she found it for us at a better price than what we had seen it before. Overall we would really recommend considering this place before any other stores, the services were excellent.
