This was an amazing experience! The food was amazing, the owners were extremely nice, and I truly enjoyed my time. The owner, Mr. Anoop, gave us the story behind the name \"Tiffin\" and many other stories. It was as if I was at his kitchen table at home and the hospitality was amazing!!!! I can't wait to go back, learn, eat well, and have an awesome time! It was a great BFF outing.
