We hired Angelic Grove for the decor and flowers for our out of town wedding. They did an unbelievable job!  I had a few guests come up to me to tell me it was the most beautiful wedding they had ever been to.\nWhat more can I say than that!  \n\nYou have Angela's charm and style coupled with Marks amazing creativity and together they are a magical combination. \n\n\nI highly recommend working with them, especially if you are willing to let go a bit and trust their vision.  They are true creatives!
