Super good lunch. Reuben sandwich, cole slaw and Caesar salad for 2 under 20. The bathrooms can use some work,but the waitstaff was very competent.   The Table has a lunch menu 2 for 15 which makes a great lunch. We would definitely go back again. Seating at the bar, at high top tables around the bar and at tables and booths in a separate fining room. Better food than many laces we have been lately
