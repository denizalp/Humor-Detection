Lots of washers and dryers.  The side loaders are double sized or quadruple size ($4.50). The large dryers are 7 minutes for ($0.25). The small dryers are 14 minutes for ($0.25). Bathrooms and tables for sorting are available. Lots of washing supplies available for purchase in coin-op machines. Snack and soda machines too. Some machines were out of service, but still was able to accommodate everyone. Not perfectly clean, but it is still very good. I'll be coming back.
