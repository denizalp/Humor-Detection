This place is very quaint with a lot of personality.  The staff is super friendly.  There are plenty of choices, so much so that it could have you second guessing your first choice.  The ingredients are fresh, but ordinary and nothing special.  The food is good, but a bit pricey for what you get.  Expect to be charmed by the ambience, but not wowed by the food.
