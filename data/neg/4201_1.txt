If you're in Vegas, you have to stop by and see the show.  It runs every half hour I believe and its just so beautiful.  It gets crowded early, but the fountains are so tall, you'll be able to see no matter what.  It's a quick show, but again, one of the staples of Las Vegas so make sure to stop by and see it at least once while you're there!
