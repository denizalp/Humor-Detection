We had \"Famous Tad\" and he was a great server! He got our drinks quickly and we were never dry. Before our meals came out Tad went over the different BBQ sauces which was nice. Our lunch came out quickly and was delicious as always. The lunch special is the way to go! Our family of 5 ate and had sodas\/tea for under $50.
