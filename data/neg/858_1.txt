Wolfgang puck is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. My family was in town and we always stop here at least once when they are visiting. We had so much food on the table I wish I took a photo of it, but I focused on my dinner because I was starving lol :P, I ordered the pasta with meatballs I would give it a 10 and the I believe it's an iceberg lettuce salad with blue cheese, I'm sure it has a different name at the restaurant but just ask your waiter both were excellent.
