My husband and I decided to come here for my pre birthday lunch.  There was no wait and the hostess seated us right away.  Our waiter was prompt and always checked on us.  We ordered the chili glazed chicken wings as a starter and it was delicious.  I had the grilled burger and my husband had the breakfast sandwich. Both were very satisfying and tasty.  We ended our meal with the vanilla bean cream brûlée topped with fresh fruit.  I would definitely come back again.
