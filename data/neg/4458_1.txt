I have a love-hate relationship with this Apple store. Sometimes my shopping experience is a breeze. And sometimes I can't get someone to help me at all. So we'll even it out to 3 stars. I do, however, appreciate the selection at this location - they tend to have most everything I am looking for - from travel converters to Kate Spade cases. And when I do get someone to help me, they are always very nice, knowledgeable, and efficient.
