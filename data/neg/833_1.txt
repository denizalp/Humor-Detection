I have hired them twice now and both times it blew me away how clean the carpets turned out and actually how dirty they were. LOL\nNote that in between the two times, I used Stanley Steemer and the carpets turned out terrible.  There was actually dirt where there had not been before, so maybe it pulled something through, but Fresh Start came out and fixed Stanley Steemer's mess. I will always use them in the future.
