Great menu, quality and selection, but I just never see how anyone can charge $15 for a pound of any type of meat.  It doesn't cost $15 for the whole damm corn beef.  Their keiser rolls were just over $1 for EACH. Yes they were big but still that is pricey.  \n\nI think this is a great place but just pricey is all.
