This place is visually super adorable. I got a chocolate peanut butter popsicle and it wasn't amazing. It didn't taste any different than the popsicles i make at home. It was also like $4 which seems a bit pricey for a tiny pop(size of the miniature haagen dazs). I was hoping for something spectacular since its a store that specializes in banana icecream. The pop was also super icy :\/ super disappointed. \n\nI'll probably come here again to try something else.
