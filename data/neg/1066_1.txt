AMAZING customer service! The manager kept checking on us and our server (Jojo?) was extrmeley friendly and bubbly! The food was awesome. They had the best country gravy I've ever had. I ordered a special (biscuits and gravy, bacon, fried chicken, and an egg). I loved everything. I also tasted my sister's Mac n cheese, and it was delicious! I was on my bachelorette attire and the manager COMPED MY MEAL as a congratulations. Loved it, will definitely return. (PS the waiters are all super cute guys with black rimmed glasses...like a bunch of Clark Kents! Hahaha)
