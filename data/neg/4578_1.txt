I really like this nail Salon. I came in on a whim when getting a sandwich next door after work. Everyone is so nice and they try really hard to fit you in, even when close to closing time. They did a great job and their prices are fantastic. They aren't close to my home, but if I'm in the area, this is where I will go!
