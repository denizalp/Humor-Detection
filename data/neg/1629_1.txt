This review is for Hannah who helped me out at the Bakery as I was passing thorough town! \n\nGreeted me. Kindly explained to me about their ways of getting things done from scratch and how variety is added every day. Super sweet. Gave me a delicious sample too!! \n\nThe bakery is CLEAN, and inviting. The music was nice too. \nAnd their retail is so tempting!!! Too bad I had no more room in my car!
