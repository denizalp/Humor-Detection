Fun concept, especially for kids.  Kids tried the monkey business flavor, which they enjoyed.  The adults created their own combination (up to 3 flavors).  Just imagine spilling milk on an icy cold steel tray, and then just watching someone spackle it to death as they sprinkle in chocolate fairy dust - that's exactly what it tasted like - not bad, but wouldn't pay $7 for it again.
