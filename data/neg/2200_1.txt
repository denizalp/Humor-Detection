Great food, fantastic price for what you get.   The servers are a tad stand offish and almost seemed annoyed with us being there. They also don't ask to have the bill split and seemed unwilling to do so when asked (claiming for work and I obviously didn't eat two breakfasts). Aside from this the gem that is over easy is fantastic.
