These people could care less if you get your medication. Super rude.  Lady on the phone wouldn't listen at all. Would not call my existing pharmacy for rx transfer. It wasn't my idea to change pharmacies it's their rules so they should do their job and get on the phone to fill my rx.  Stupid, incompetent, uncaring, unprofessional. Who knows if I'll ever get my meds. I need daily injections for a severe bone disorder. Don't go here if you don't have to.
