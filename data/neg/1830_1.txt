This is a really great vintage store. Le Love! \n\nVIBE \nNice layout. Funky employees. \n\nTHE GOODS \nThey have fabulous 50s - 60s inspired lingerie here. And shorts! Shorts that are long enough with a funky print! I'm loving Libertine Libertine. A lot of the bags and men's stuff are very utilitarian. If you are a gay hipster, you will find many many things. This means I wish I was a gay hipster. \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nFrances Watson's future looks mighty fine to me. One of my faves in Parkdale.
