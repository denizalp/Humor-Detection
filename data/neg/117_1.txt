The selection of stores is okay. I came here mainly for the Nike factory outlet. I came out with a Vegas Knights license plate frame from a small hockey shop.\n\nInside the food court, there was an Easter Bunny that your kids could take pictures with. Unfortunately it did not have any specific hours or days that he was there but I was there on a Thursday.
