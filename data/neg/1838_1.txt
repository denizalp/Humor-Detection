This place is by far the best breakfast spot in the Yonge and Eglinton area. Not only is the food always amazing, but the staff is even better! The owner is always there smiling and very hospitable and friendly. The waitresses\/ waiters are awesome every time. Love love this place... a must try. \nP.S. try the pumpkin spice pancake... words can't describe how tasty it is
