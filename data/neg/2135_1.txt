Really good food. We tried Sweet & Sour Shrimp, Kung Pao Chicken, BBQ Pork Fried Rice, and Singapore Noodles. Got the soup, eggroll and crab puff combo.\n\nEverything was really good but I would not get the Singapore Noodles again simply because I'm not a curry fan. If you like curry then you'll love the Singapore Noodles.\n\nNice atmosphere and friendly staff. We'll be back for sure.
