Mrs. B is amazing!!! She was formerly at Snips N Clips for kids, but I'm so happy she has her own place now! She's the first person who cut my sons hair and he loves going to her. She's so friendly and always makes kids smile. My son gets compliments on his haircuts all the time thanks to Mrs. B!!!
