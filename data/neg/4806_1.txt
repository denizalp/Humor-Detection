Stopped here during the Southwest Airlines system outage debacle. Had a few glasses of wine, lots of club soda, and the Artichoke Pie. The service here was surprisingly top notch, which I typically would not expect for an airport restaurant. Eric was my server, he was very friendly, fast, and efficient. One of the best servers I've had in a long, long time.\n\nThe Artichoke pie was really tasty. Artichokes, green olives, carmelized onions, and ricotta cheese -- very interesting combination of flavors.
