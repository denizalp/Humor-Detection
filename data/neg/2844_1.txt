Went with a big group of people on 10\/20 for a friend's birthday and had a terrible experience. The server gave the table shots, strongly implying that it was because of my friend's birthday and they would be complimentary, received the bill later and we were all charged $10 per shot. Ridiculous, since this is supposedly a nice restaurant. Food was so-so and overpriced.
