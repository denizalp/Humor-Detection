I've had my haircut here since the 1970's and it's an institution in Chagrin Falls.  Lots of conversation if you like that.  Dutch and the guys are interesting and they get interested in you!  Best of all, I know what to expect when Dutch is finished, just the way I like it.  That also counts when I get home and the boss reviews the haircut.  While I lived in Chagrin for decades, six years ago I moved to Shaker Heights and still go back.  Great shop!
