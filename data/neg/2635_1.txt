I've visited this location multiple times because it's close to my university\nmenu seems pricey for a katsu but the portions are big and I've never been disappointed when I've tried all the different variety of katsu they have\ntheir crab cream croquette was okay \nnot much crab meat or cream cheese inside. it was pretty bland
