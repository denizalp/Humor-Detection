We used Alaskan to purchase 2 a\/c units for 2 separate homes. They were reasonably priced and very responsive. The quotes were detailed and they stuck to their word. The installs went well starting with on-time arrivals. I would recommend them with confidence and expect they they would provide equal service and value to others.
