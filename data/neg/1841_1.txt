Huge fan and will definitely use them for any and all work my car may need in the future.\n\nMy friend and I attempted to install an after-market stereo ourselves but ran into a bunch of problems and accidently shorted a few fuses.  The Sun Valley guys were able to fix the damage we caused and install everything perfectly in under an hour and the cost was still no more than a normal install.
