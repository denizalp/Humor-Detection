I come here strictly for alignments.  Quick and easy service.   The regular price is about the same everyone else,  but they will price match local chains and you can find coupons about anywhere.\n\nMy favorite thing about Firestone is they have amazing store hours and are open all weekend.\n\nCustomer service is average but again.  I only come for alignments.   They've had a revolving door off front counter guys and techs over the last 2-3 years.  Tough to have any kind of relationship with the employees.
