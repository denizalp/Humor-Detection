Worst place ever to rent. From the outside it's nice but once you move in it's like hell. We had to call about roaches and bugs every other month and we had to get sprayed for scorpions 3 times. Once one crawled on me.... talk about nightmares...The staff isn't helpful they charge you for everything. You only get one gate key that you have to share and both my husband and I work late... it was such a hassle. Finally we left and we got a final notice with all these absurd charges. DO NOT LIVE THERE!!
