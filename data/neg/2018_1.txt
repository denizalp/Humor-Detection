Just moved in the area and was overwhelmed with all the vape shops. Picked this spot based on reviews and was not disappointed. I wanted to just run in and out with juice and coils. I explained what I wanted and the first choice she described sounded great and it was! I bought Locals Only Afterglow 60 for $15 and 5 coils for $20. Very great prices! I def will be back
