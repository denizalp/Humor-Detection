I had dinner at Olive & Ivy back in April and the food and service were excellent! I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. For appetizers we got the bruschetta-prosciutto and the mozzarella. We also got the margarita flatbread. These three appetizers were phenomenal. As for my dinner, I got the lasagna bolognese and it was very tasty!  As for the service, our waiter was very knowledgeable, professional and sociable.
