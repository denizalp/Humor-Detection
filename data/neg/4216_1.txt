Dined here for the first time with the family. Loved our entrees (Chimichaga and Enchilada), Queso was perfect and we had a fabulous server. Food came out extremely fast, but we didn't get water refills and had to wait awhile to get our check. The appetizer chicken nachos were ordered for a kid and weren't great so we left them. The four star is for the lack of attentiveness, especially at the end but we will definitely be back. The prices were extremely reasonable and it was perfect a perfect, family friendly place.
