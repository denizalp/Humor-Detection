Great experience. The manager took the time to understand our needs and priorities in a vacuum in order to make the proper recommendation. I  now look forward to vacuuming (crazy as it seems) because its not a chore if you have the proper vacuum. Thanks Mr. Vac & Sew, my vacuum seriously sucks, in a great way!
