The new location is awesome.  Sometimes we get pizza by the slice in the bar (maybe just me and my son for some quality time) Others nights the whole family. Great NY style pizza.  And the Casanova Bros will learn your name and choices like a great bartender.  Awesome local family owned restaurant with great food.
