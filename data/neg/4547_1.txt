Their chicken tacos melt in your mouth. The prices are a steal! The rice was a little dry to my liking but everything else was delicious. I wanted to try the empanadas but they were sold out. :(  I will definitely come back for the tacos and order the empanadas.  The food is fresh and their pops are imported from Mexico so the coke tastes a but different (not as carbonated and strong).  The place only has about 6 tables so it's small. I would order take-out if it seems busy.
