Perfect place for dinner on a cold December night.  Cozy room, very attentive service and excellent food.  The bread with white beans and olive oil is a nice treat on the table.  The salads were big and tasty and the pasta entrees didn't disappoint.  Bruschetta was also very good. \nWine is reasonably priced by the glass.\n\nOverall, excellent.  It is pricey for Italian food, but you come away satisfied and it feels worth the money.
