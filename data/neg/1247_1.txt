Indian food is definitely one of my favorites, so I'm very picky when it comes to it. While Origin isn't one of my favorite Indian restaurants, it's pretty good. They have great garlic naan bread and their veggie samosas are good as well. I'm not a huge fan of their entrees, however, their desserts are pretty tasty. I really enjoyed their Gulab Jamun, Mango Kulfe and this poached pear dessert they serve with ice cream. I can't remember the name, but it was on the menu when I was there last week. If you like pears, try it!
