Terrible, ordered this off of grub hub and ordered the protein packer and calis breakfast sandwich. Calis sandwich was not a sandwich they just threw all the ingredients into the box. The protein packed had barely any chicken and was very small for the price. Would not order from here again. I could have made this better.
