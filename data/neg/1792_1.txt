It was tasty when I was there with my co workers but I got sick after and did not enjoy that. \n\nFood: 1\/5, since I got sick, not much I can do about the rating here.  The butter chicken and pakoras were tasty though.\n\nService: 2.5\/5, attentive but seemed odd about the waiters being monotone.\n\nAmbience: 2.5\/5, nice seating and large spaces.\n\nPrice: 2.5\/5, $17 for lunch buffet.
