2.5 stars for the Pho might be a more accurate, given that the broth seems to lack the sort of depth that top shelf Pho normally boasts...but it's a solid choice on cold winter days, for sure. On the plus side, it comes out fast and the small portion is a good option for those not looking for a Super Bowl of Pho...
