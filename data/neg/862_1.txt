Absolutely love this place! Hawaiian Shave Ice with ice cream on the bottom and condensed milk is the closest thing to the island! And the pineapple dole whip just like the one at Disneyland. Definitely worth going to this place and definitely worth coming back, great environment and great service! \n\nAlso worth trying is their milkshakes!
