Ordered the pikilia platter for delivery (an assortment of appetizers, mostly meats here) for two, and it was a genuine feast, generous portions, and nearly every meat was expertly done.\n\nAs always with this sort of dish, I wish there was more rice and more potato to go with the meats, and more pita with the dips.\n\nAnd perhaps ask for the Greek salad on the side, seeing as it came under the meat ... but minor quibbles aside, this is tasty, affordable old-school Greek goodness.
