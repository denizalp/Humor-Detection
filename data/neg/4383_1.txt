Dr. Gex is amazing. His clinic is well organized and clean. They don't send you anywhere to get ultra sound or blood work when needed. FMLA papers are cheap and $25. They allow kids during your visit. They are flexible with scheduling. And the staff are very welcoming. I would recommend Dr. Gex to everyone I know.
