Ate here during the weekend brunch.  SO AMAZING.  And for only $33 with champagne, in Vegas?  Such a good deal.\n\nHad biggest selection ever, with the highest quality ever.  \n\nMy entire group of 10 people wanted to cry when we were full and couldn't eat anymore, because there was just so much more delicious food to try!!!
