Food was amazing and it's a good thing b\/c the hostesses kind of sucked.  Our 45 minute wait took almost 2 hours and the snotty high schoolers working the hostess stand almost caught a piece of my mind.  But thankfully the food and service made up for it.  I'd say go earlier or later to avoid some of the rush, especially as the bar area gets jam packed.
