haha,... straight up... if you want some decent\/not so bad typical Mexican food. This is an OK spot... if you want GOOD tacos... Get your ass up and go somewhere respectable. This is a hole in the wall that speaks for the hole in the wall.. not greatness... To be honest... I doubt they even care... the goal here seemed to be  middle level Mexican food... that fell somewhat short... ask me for pics...
