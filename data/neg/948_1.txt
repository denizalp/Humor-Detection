I have been able to visit each floor and overall I'm pleased! \n\nI truly am not a fan of meatballs, but the spicy pork ones were fantastic. I had an heirloom tomato salad at mezzo which was surprisingly filling and the rooftop bar is fun to visit. \n\nI would really like to go back and try the pizza!
