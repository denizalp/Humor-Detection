Found Dr. S to be very thorough and knowledgable.  I have a been to many doctors but not one so versed in modern tech and treatments for glaucoma.  He took time to answer my questions and increase my knowledge of eye care priorities and mechanisms.  He is so much more than a dispensing OD.  Great staff.
