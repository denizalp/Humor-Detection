First stop once we arrived in Phoenix was Deigo Pops. I'm pretty sure it was the Brussel Sprout nachos that caught my attention when I bookmarked this place. Outstanding. We also order 3 different kind of tacos, all were very very good. One bowl, which was huge and very substantial and the Ceviche which I absolutely loved with coconut and shrimp. We also enjoyed the outdoor dining. Something we take advantage of every time we come to Phoenix. \nGreat beer choices and cocktails as well. We are already talking about going back before we leave town.
