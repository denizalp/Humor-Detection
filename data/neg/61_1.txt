Stumbled into the centurion last night and was very happy with our overall experience.  The couple running the place (the chef and his fiancee) were charming hosts, very helpful and provided great service; but most importantly the food was delicious.  It was their Tapas night and our group had at least one of everything on the menu.  I can not think of one disappointing meal, they were all shades of brilliant.
