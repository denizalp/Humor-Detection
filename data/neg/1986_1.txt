I love Indian food but dont eat it nearly often enough.  A friend mentioned this place so I was excited to try it.  \n\nI tried the Special Chaat and a Chicken Tikka Wrap.  Both were good, fresh, lots of flavor, I prefered the Special Chaat.  I got it regular but it was still quite spicy.\n\nPortion sizes were a little small for the cost.  My wife asked me to bring her home an order of Rogan Josh but it was not a normal menu option.
