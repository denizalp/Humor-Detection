Service is much needed at this casino.  The workers feel they don't need to treat the clientle with any respect.  They definitely need some CSR training\nOther than that the it's a beautiful property with great lighting.  Too bad because Customer Service is one of the most important aspects of a Casino and this one surely failed.  I will not be going there anymore until they take this serious and make sure the staff is mandated to attend some CSR training. I get treated better with respect at the smaller casinos such as Monty Carlo or Golden Nugget.
