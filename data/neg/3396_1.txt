I cannot recommend Americana Inspection Services more highly. Jason Van Loo took personal time out of a holiday weekend to accommodate our tight turn around request.  He did the most thorough and comprehensive inspection I have experienced.  He took extra time to answer all my questions and walk though everything I should consider. He also provided a referral for an additional inspection for our roof.  I have had home inspections before and didn't really expect much and Jason proved me wrong. He provided a very thorough, high quality inspection--- worth every penny and more!
