This is a nice salon in a very cute area. The kids pedi chairs are adorable and they have little DVD players at each one. \n\nThe only reason I took off a star is because it was really warm and stuffy because they did not have the air on. It was nice out but the door wasn't even open...part of the pedi experience is to be comfortable and being hot and stuffy isn't so fun.\n\nIf they turned on the AC or opened the door at least, it would make for a five star review.
