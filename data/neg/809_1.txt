Quaint restaurant with a full bar and awesome decor. Came here on a date and would definitely go back. Dim lights set the mood and the wood floors add to the ambiance. Server seamed to be a college student but was fairly attentive and did not over visit the table. Ordered the eggplant napoleon for an app...wow delicious! Both our meals came out hot and in a timely fashion. We finished with a bottle of wine for desert that was just perfect. I'll be back for sure, date or no date.
