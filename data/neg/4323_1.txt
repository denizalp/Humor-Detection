Good place to go after getting a bite to eat at D's down below if you want to carrying on your evening in the same place. The Loft can get a little packed, so come early if you want a seat. And, FYI, seating is definitely limited. What's cool is that you can bring food up from D's, as well as bottled beer from the beer cave if something you want isn't offered upstairs.
