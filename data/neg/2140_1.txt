We stopped here after a long morning of site seeing. I had the steak sandwich with a side salad and my friend had chicken with a side salad. The food was delicious! My sandwich had a light but flavorful sauce and the meat was perfectly tender. The 'side salad' was huge and had the best dressing. The service needed some work but we found that was the case at every restaurant we went too in Montreal.
