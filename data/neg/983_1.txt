Southern Gourmet does it again !  You have to TRY the Tomato Pie - simply amazing!~  Combination of fresh chopped tomatoes, basil, olive oil, cheese\/spices baked into an open faced pie shell.  It's wonderful!  Call the office - get your scrip and go get you ONE!!!  (Call ahead - rumor has it they can't keep the pies on the shelf and they do close over July 4th ). Two locations - Monroe Road and inside Black Lion in Pineville!  Thanks Randy and Crystal !!
