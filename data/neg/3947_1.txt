I. Would have given Cabot 4 stars, but the 1st time we went for the 48oz margaritas for $10.00 they were closed\nLast night we went for dinner. They still serve 48oz margaritas for $10.00\nThe food was very good, the service was friendly, knowledgable and fast.\nOverall a fun dinner experience. The prices were very reasonable and recommend going
