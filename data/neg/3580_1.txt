The best place to grab a sandwich in Pittsburgh. A varied amount of sandwiches to try. Some unique, some normal, but all of them excellent. The bread is perfect, and compliments what is in the sandwich. Fry lovers will enjoy the crunchy fries in regular, or Cajun style. 10% off student discount as well. A must along with Primanti's if you are visiting the steel city as a sandwich lover
