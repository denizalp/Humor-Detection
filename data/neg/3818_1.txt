We had their charburger, fries, and vanilla shake. I thought that the charburger was a bit too grill flavored for me. The presentation of the burger was neat, unlike other burger places.  I thought that the fries were   good. The shake was pretty delicious because it tasted like the inside of an orange creamsicle without the bad orange flavor. They also let you have pepperocinnis from their condiment area. I thought that the pepperocinnis tasted a bit like pickles. The service was friendly.
