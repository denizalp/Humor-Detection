I'm not into crawfish but my wife and I love seafood, and we got a recommendation to this place over Hot & Juice. On Valentine's day, and my wife's B-day we decided to give it a try. Were we glad we did! We got there right before dinner rush, and got seated right the way. The place was clean, server was awesome, and the food was great! We tried the alligator appetizer, and loved it! From service to food everything was wonderful, we highly recommend it!!!
