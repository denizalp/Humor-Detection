Tucked in the back.  Great alignment shop.\n\nI called Thursday morning for a Friday morning appointment.  They had me in and out in under an hour.  $75 might be steep for a 2 wheel alignment but you get what you pay for.  Excellent customer service and knowledagble techs.  Clint dialed my Cobalt in and it drives like a whole new car.\n\nThanks guys!
