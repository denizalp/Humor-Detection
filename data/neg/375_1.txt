I have been taking my vehicles to Howard for several years now.  He is always honest and so happy he opened his own business.  He is personable and honest and I highly recommend his services.  He is honest about what he will charge and if something doesn't need fixing, he won't go ahead and fix something unnecessary and then charge you for it.  It's so nice to feel confident when something happens with my vehicles that Howard will be able to fix the problem.  Highly recommend!!!
