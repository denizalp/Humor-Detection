This place caught me completely off guard. A friend of mine who lived in Phoenix years ago recommend this place to us since we were out in Phoenix visiting relatives.\n\nWow.. good stuff! Interesting too. \n\nGET the jerk chicken fried rice. wow... Jade chicken.. yummy.. Black beans.. even better. Most of our party opted with Chinese and I'm sorry we didn't get more Mexican to try it. \n\nNote - It's not fancy, no one waits on your table. You order at the counter and they bring your food out. Great prices... great food..
