The staff here are friendly and quick to help you. It's also a little shop with some pretty cool gift ideas. The have all the special packing stuff you might need for those odd packages and the typical boxes, mailing envelopes, tissue paper you  might need. I go here about once a month to mail all my birthday\/anniversary cards out to everyone.
