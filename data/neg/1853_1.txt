Brought my two year old son here for the one free try out session. The receptionist was not friendly while checking in. In a small room, the teacher does songs and different game things which is okay but my son only liked the bubbles part of it, which only lasted a few minutes. Then after playing for a bit he got bored and was trying to get out. Plus, I think the price is pretty high for only being able to go once a week.
