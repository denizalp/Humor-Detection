We have been here 3 times in the past two weeks and we will keep coming back.  They have a small but well-executed menu that is quite tasty.  I have tried a different ramen each time but so far I think my favorite is the Curry, or maybe the Spicy Tonkatsu.  My wife and I also quite enjoy the pot stickers and karaage chicken.  This place fills up fast at dinner hours but they do take reservations.
