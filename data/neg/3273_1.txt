On September 13, 2015 I was at the restaurant around 5 pm. The service was slow, after I was seated approximately 10 minutes had past and I hadn't seen a waitress. I went to front entrance and spoke to the greeter, afterwards a waitress came to my table to take my order. Basically it took 15 minutes from the time that I entered the restaurant to have my order taken.
