If you are ordering a cake for a special occasion and you want a terrible hideous cake then this is the business for you! Talk to Tina who's skills match her cake making skills, dry, bland and ugly. You will be in unqualified hands with her! Steer clear of this place! The owner is horrible and unprofessional, their cakes are sh*t. Your special day should be just that, SPECIAL you shouldn't have a deceptive business who can't fulfill their signed obligations. Save yourself the extreme trouble and do not give this woman any business, she doesn't deserve it.
