Have been here a few times for dim sum. This place is always full with customers during dim sum\/lunch hour. Dim sum is at a discount price if your order is placed before 11am. The food is decent, comes at a good pace. Dim sum 3.5\/5, Service 4\/5, Atmosphere 3.5\/5, overall experience is good at this restaurant. Tip: if you want to come here for the discount dim sum,  be sure to be here before 10 to get a table!
