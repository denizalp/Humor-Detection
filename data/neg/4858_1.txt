When we checked into the hotel, they gave us free tickets to the show and just thought....eh, why not???\n\nWe were shocked at how much we enjoyed the show. He was classically funny and witty and gave a great performance.  I definitely preferred Mac King to Penn & Teller.\n\nIf you have the chance, go see it.
