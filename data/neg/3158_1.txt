The decor of this place is great, as was the service. The food wasn't horrible, but wasn't anything amazing either. Stop putting cabbage on tacos. It was also a little pricey in my opinion. If you do decide to go, check in on Yelp and get a free appetizer. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but I think I'll stick with phat burrito.
