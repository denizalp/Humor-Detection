This is a tourist trap store but don't fall for it! The staff is rude and does not deserve your money. I chose a shirt from a table right in front of an employee, who said nothing to me. As I'm waking to the register to pay, another employee snatches it from my hands and told me I couldn't purchase it until tomorrow with no other explanation. Find another store for your Canada merchandise, I will not be returning tomorrow.
