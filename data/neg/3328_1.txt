Always a great experience coming to this restaurant. Food is prepared quickly and served directly to your table. I love the mix of Chinese and Mexican food. Chino Bandido is original in that aspect as i have never seen another restaurant that serves a blend of the two. The restaurant is always kept clean and staff are friendly to help in any way. Can't wait to go back again.
