This place is bagel heaven and one of my favorite spots! They have so many bagels it's easy to miss one. Today, I discovered the chocolate chip bagel and I love it!! I topped it with strawberry cream cheese which had big chunks of strawberries in it. It was delish! Some other favorites of mine are the potato cakes, chocolate soda, and of course the lox plate. Soooo good! Bagel cafe keep doing what you do!
