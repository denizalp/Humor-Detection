Stayed in room 506. \n\nClean room, clean bathroom, lots of areas to \"plug in\". There isn't a dedicated fitness area in the hotel itself, but you are given limitless access to the LA Fitness that is adjacent to the property. \nNo room service per se, but lots of places that will deliver. \nI would definitely return to this property
