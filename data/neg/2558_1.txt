This place lost my business.  $4.99 for a basic wash is way too much.  And $19 for a top of the line wash where I still have to do my own vacuming and drying?  Really?  What benefit do I get?  None.  You can change all the fancy flashing lights and special effects in the wash line all you want but your product delivery doesn't justify the cost.
