Enjoyed our meal at this place so much we came back three times during our stay. Tried the calamari, pizza and hamburger.  Hamburgers are excellent, huge fresh and cooked well done as requested.  I would suggest splitting one among 2 people they were that big.  Appetizer, calamari was just ok, pizza was a bit undercooked for my liking I prefer well done.  Service varied but adequate most of the time.
