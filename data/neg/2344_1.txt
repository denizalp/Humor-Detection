I had the three cheese omelet (with ham for extra $$) with hash browns and a homemade biscuit. The omelet was okay but I wish they would have put the cheese into the omelet instead of putting sliced cheese on top of it. The hash browns were also okay as well. The biscuit was as dry as a bone. Over all it was an average meal for $12
