Terribly overpriced for the quality and setting.  We went for lunch and the staff was rude to the customers, seemed obviously unhappy with their jobs and the table was dirty, silverware smudged, poor food selection and most of the signs labeling the dish were incorrect.  The Wynn buffet is much better. Would not waste my money on this tired and unclean buffet.
