I went through many different cake businesses to find this one! They were very accommodating & helped every step of the way to get me my perfect cake. I ordered the boss baby cake, two tier- chocolate cake with strawberry Bavarian cream, it was pricey--- $297-- but that's how much you pay to get a good quality cake! It was worth every cent, it fed everyone at my party AND it was a big hit! Everyone loved it. It was super moist and just perfect. I'd definitely recommend to ANYONE!
