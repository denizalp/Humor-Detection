Pretty upset. I've been having problems with people having a hard time hearing me on my phone. The guy suggested a new Sim card but said I needed to pay for one. I asked, if that wasn't the problem was I going to be reimbursed? No, of course not, and the problem on my phone was not fixed. Was not until a couple hours later we talked to an employee at an actual Verizon store that said we had been got. Sim cards are free. Avoid this place.
