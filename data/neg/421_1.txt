Probably some of the best sushi downtown. Me and my friends are regulars! Don't let the purple rice freak you out- it's delicious. The staff is friendly and the food comes out very quickly once it's ordered. I recommend the dumplings and shrimp tempura rolls, they are fantastic. The only downside I have is that the place is a bit small, so it feels at times that you have to rush and eat. More like they want you to eat and leave immediately. Other then that, this place is awesome and definitely worth trying out!
