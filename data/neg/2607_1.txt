I have been taking private lessons with Rachel Busch Skrylnikov. Rachel is very fun, sweet and professional dance instructor. She is very knowledgeable about choreography of dance and I have really enjoyed learning various style of dance such as Samba, Tango and Rumba from her. I definitely recommend Rachel to anyone with any level of dance experience.
