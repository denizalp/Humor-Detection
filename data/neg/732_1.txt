I have been searching for a salon in the greater Phoenix area for a year.  I found Snapdragon on Yelp and read about Stephen.  He is everything they say and more.  He was pleasant from the get go and even though my hair color and cut was plain and boring (just a trim and all over dark brown) I walked out feeling like a million bucks.  The salon was clean and bright and the moment I walked in I felt invited and comfortable.  The receptionist was so kind!!  I will be a new repeat client!!
