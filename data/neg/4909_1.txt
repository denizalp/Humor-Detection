I love topokki!! Came here very excited for some authentic Korean food and was not let down. Our masseuse recommended the spot. The topokki was very authentic, we also grabbed the dumplings! The service was great, there wasn't a time we were waiting for anything. My only disappointment was that they didn't bring out the traditional Korean appetizers like cabbage and bean sprouts! I've never gone to a place for topokki and had no appetizers come out. Besides this i loved the place.
