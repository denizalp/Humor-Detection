Awesome variety of Eastern European food. I would have loved a better variety of Romanian food, but overall I am very happy to have discovered this place. Yummy treats :) \nThey sell cooked food too. Not very impressed with the cakes but the beef stuffed cabbage was good. Will definitely be back soon :)
