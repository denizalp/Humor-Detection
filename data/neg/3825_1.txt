If you've never been here, you should try it. Realize they are paid to act like dicks. But it is actually quick service, good food, yummy drinks, and funny hats that everyone gets to wear. Not for those that easily offended or can't take a joke. Beware they pick on all ages young and old, but it's all in good fun. I really enjoyed their drink specials and had a good burger. Unlike some other locations this is shared table seating.
