Hap's is nothing to write home about. It's only busy at lunch because it's in the parking lot of a corporate building which is convenient to the employees. I ate there a couple years ago and decided to try it again recently. The pulled pork was dry and hard to chew. The bbq sauce is okay. Potato salad isn't bad...but there are much better choices of bbq in the area if you want better food quality. I wouldn't go there again.
