Too bad Yelp won't allow you to give out 10 stars.  Located in a non descript strip mall like just about everything else in Phoenix.  This place has it together. Great food, great service, friendly people. If I had to complain about anything it is that one day I can imagine that one day the place will be too small and they'll be a wait but for now it is still somewhat a hidden gem.
