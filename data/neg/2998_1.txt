Who the hell hires these guys? They know absolutely nothing about anything other then the drop down bar on the computer screen they stare at. Multiple times i've had the wrong parts delivered to my shop after explaining exactly what I need. Worse then dealing with a Walmart employee trying to find something in the store.
