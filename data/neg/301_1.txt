Cool store - interesting addition to the neighbourhood. It's essentially a hot table you would find at a Pusaterri's or McEwens. A special shout out to the cookies, which are great. \n\nThe store looks like it should be selling great produce - and at the prices would theoretically reflect that - but the reality is it's not super high quality - just tasty.
