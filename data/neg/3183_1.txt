This place is awful. My wife paid inside... Went to pump her gas... And when the pump wouldn't work the man inside told her she never paid. She refused to leave until she got her money back. They finally admitted she really did pay when a customer called the manager out for lying. These guys are scum. Hope this place burns down. PEE YEW! YOU STINK!
