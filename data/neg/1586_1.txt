Not very pleased with the new seating arrangements. The couches are now placed back-to-back which allows no privacy, every word is heard by the people sitting directly behind , bumping arms , elbows , shoulders, and heads with the couple right behind. The couches are now facing the wall and allow optimal viewing of others eating. Not a good idea for business by any means.
