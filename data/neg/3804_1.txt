Shower faucet decided to quit working and water was leaking by the buckets so I went to YELP to find help. I came across this company and based on reviews, decided to give them a shot since this was pressing and of course on a Saturday. Mike arrived on time assessed the problem and provided multiple quotes for various ways to make the repair.  It wasn't a cheap fix but Mike knocked it out quickly, was very detail oriented, pleasant and trustworthy. I would call on them again and recommend them to others.
