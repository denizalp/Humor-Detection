Dr. Edwards is amazing. You can tell she really knows what she's doing and also has a solution.\nI was going to another vet that made me pay several hundred dollars for tests and medications that didn't work - Dr. Edwards took one look at my cat and knew it was just a food allergy. She saved me a lot of money and for that I thank her. \nI will be going to her as long as she is open.
