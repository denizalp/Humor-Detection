Extremely convenient Oakland outpost of the Strip District gem. They recently changed their queuing system to reduce the cluster mess that used to be their waiting-for-coffee clump...but just because their lines are now orderly, doesn't mean there is less of a line! Grab your coffee during time slots that aren't close to the half hour when students are in class. If you're in for a long day, get the double cappuccino for a lovely caffeine boost. They also have some incredible baked goods from Colangelo's- you absolutely must get the raspberry croissant.
