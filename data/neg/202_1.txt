One of my very favorite restaurants! Everything I've had there is absolutely delicious. Staff is friendly, and service is generally quick. Great for takeout, too! \n\nSome dishes I definitely recommend are the crazy noodles, panang curry, and mango curry. Additionally, they have great bubble tea! I recommend the thai iced tea, green tea, and mango flavors, but you can't go wrong with any.
