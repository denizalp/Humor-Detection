Love this store. One of the great things of living in Vegas is that they have Trader Joe's. Love the return policy, though I do hate when certain things I love get discontinued, but that's TJ's as a whole. Decent wine selection and it's cool when staff remember me & my daughter...\n\nDon't forget your bags!
