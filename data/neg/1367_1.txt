Outrageous billing, especially considering service I received was just horrible. They did not really do me anything (doctor just said it's matter of time as it is flu) and despite the fact that I made an appointment it was close to hour wait. I asked about billing prior to receiving a service and they said I would not owe anything, then couple months later I got a bill with $140 on it. I would not recommend going to them at all.
