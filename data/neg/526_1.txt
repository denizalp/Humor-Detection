Love this place so much. They just did a big remodel and it looks a.m. isn't. Very festive and day of the dead like with those colourful flags everywhere. \n\nI got the chicken taco and the shrimp one. I always get the shrimp it's the best for sure but sometimes they do run out of that one. You get to pick your spice level and what kind of sour cream. Love who you can customize it.
