Fantastic fresh authentic food pizza!\n\nI never had a problem with the crowds.  But note, don't show up when they first open, as the pizza oven didn't have time to heat up enough for a proper brick-oven pizza crust!\n\nA bit expensive and portions are not too big, but if you want authentic fresh food, you can't beat this place!\n\nLove it!
