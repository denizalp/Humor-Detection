When we first arrived everyone was friendly, great customer service. Our waiter Jerry was helpful with his suggestions. Jerry was funny, efficient and a great waiter. Good waiters are hard to find. The food was excellent. Fried chicken was a hit. Mashed cauliflower taste just like mashed potatoes.  \n  Since we're on vacation, we had dessert.  Peach cobbler and red velvet cheesecake. If you like marzipan you will like the cobbler.  I really liked the cheesecake.  Needless to say we were stuffed over the top.
