I've been dying to try Eggslut in LA, but have been super turned off by the lines. So, while in Vegas, decided to give it a try. It was everything I was hoping it would be- a messy, flavorful, taste of heaven. I had the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich (without the chipotle ketchup). It was filling and absolutely worth trying.
