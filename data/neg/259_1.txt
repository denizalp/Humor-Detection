Came in to try a new local place since my move  to the south west. \nVery quite on a Saturday night, but relaxing in the restaurant. \n\nWe ordered a house club sandwich and a French dip sandwich. \n\nThe food was fresh and delicious. \nSeasoned steaks frys had a good taste \n\nFound out that the restaurant is owned by Ellis island, so I had to ask for a taste of the root beer \nThe root beer is fabulous \n\nThe server Floridia was very personal and made sure our first experience was rememberable.
