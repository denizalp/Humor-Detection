I've been a loyal customer for quite awhile.  My hair is in great shape.  \nOne of my friends recently told me, \"You have the greatest haircut ever!\"  The only thing that makes it 4 instead of 5 stars is the price is a little high, but the stylists are well trained.  I've also tried a makeup application and I plan on getting a facial there someday.  Lots of services available.
