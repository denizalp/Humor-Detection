I had the country fried steak this morning. It's served in a skillet over a bed of overly salty breakfast potatoes covered in sausage gravy and 2 eggs. The country fried steak was a bit on the chewy side... it wasn't horrible... just the saltiness of the potatoes overpowered the dish. We also got a side muffin which was firm but moist and a pitcher of coffee. The coffee itself is nothing amazing  but having the pitcher on the table for my own warm ups was cool
