To summarize:\n\n- 90-minute wait (after being told 30-40 minutes)\n- Can't have burgers cooked medium-rare\n- Food is average at best\n- Food is over-priced\n- Floor is filthy\n- \"Craft beer\" list is lacking\n- Manager is extremely rude (but, wait staff and receptionists were trying their best!)\n\nHow does someone start a new restaurant and let it get this bad this quickly?\n\nThis location has ruined not only their own reputation, but the reputation of the entire chain.
