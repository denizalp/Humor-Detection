I've never had dim sum before so I really don't have anything to compare it to. It was about 1pm when we went there and this place was so crowded that there was a line to get in. Luckily it was only a party of 2 for us so we got in quick. I love the carts. I kept grabbing so many different things and realized that it might be too much. Next time I'll know to limit my selections.\n\nWhen I go back to vegas, I'll stop by this place again.
