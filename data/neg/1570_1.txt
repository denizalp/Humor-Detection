Wanted a relaxed atmosphere to have some drinks and catch up with friends. The low tables, comfortable seating, and low noise level were perfect. We had all eaten but took a good tour of the drinks menu, particularly the unique selection of cocktails. The tapas menu looked delicious, can't wait to go back hungry! My boyfriend insists that I mention we were charged 2$ for each pitcher of water, which they refilled without asking. I was pleased that they kept my water full, I was very pleased with the attentive and friendly staff.
