The employees were super friendly and explained everything on the menu, and even let my friend try a sample of the drink she was wondering about. I stuck with a matcha float (matcha on top of matcha, what could be better!?) and was in love with my choice. The large size is quite a bit and I ended up finishing it for breakfast the following day.
