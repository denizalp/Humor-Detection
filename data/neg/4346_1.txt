This nail salon is great!  Everyone was nice and the customers were all having a good time. Lee did an excellent job on my manicure and pedicure. She took her time and was very gentle. We had a nice conversation.   I liked that the same person did my manicure and pedicure.  The location is great with plenty of parking   I have definitely found my new nail salon.
