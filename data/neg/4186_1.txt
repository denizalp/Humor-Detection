Wait time wasn't bad for a Friday night, only 20 minutes.I am a big fan and was excited to eat here. Maybe expecting too much since it was Guy's restaurant...my lobster lollipops were really good and so was my son's burger. Turkey sandwich was just ok. Our entire table was in agreement that the fries need to be plated differently. They are shoved into this cylinder and were soggy and limp from being on top of each other. Plus that presentation doesn't let you see all 3 types of fries.
