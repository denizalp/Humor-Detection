Pros: \n\nGreat Music \n\nGood Looking People \n\nGreat Location \n\nExcellent Layout\n\nCons: \n\nBiased Door Policy \n\nAsshole Security \n\nInhumane Bathroom Conditions\n\nThe Rest\n\nServers are decent, but can get overwhelmed due to the volume of customers, moderate drinks prices although drinks are watered down. Overall it's geared to serve as a meat market for college kids that have yet to grasp the value of competent service.
