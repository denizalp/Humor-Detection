No prices are posted at this self serve bakery. You have to ask for prices from the busy counter staff. While the products may be delicious, I left empty handed rather than going through the hassle of finding out what things cost before I bought them. The lack of posted prices is an unwelcome change at what was once one of my favorite places.
