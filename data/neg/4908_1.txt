I've never actually been to Olde Village Bistro, but their uber eats is really good. The portions are huge (which makes the uber eats prices well worth it) and I can only assume it's even larger in person. \n\nI love their hollandaise sauce and their selection of breakfast is amazing. They make really good egg benedicts and they come with 3 eggs instead of the 2 I'm usually used to. I really should visit it in person sometime.
