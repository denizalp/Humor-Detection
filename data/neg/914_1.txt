Superior customer service\n\nA few months ago we bought new rims for my Rubicon here. Haven't had any problems whatsoever. We love them. \n\nToday I stopped in and asked them for help and they came out and looked under my tk and knew exactly what was wrong.  (It is a dealer warranty problem, not anything installed here). Thanks for helping me figure out how serious my problem was (or wasn't).
