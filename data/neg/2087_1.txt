Great BBQ!\nIt's a little out of the way, but worth the journey if you're looking for decent BBQ.\nI don't remember seeing any highchairs.  We ended up bringing in our stroller for our daughter to sit in.\nWhile you have to order your food at the counter, there is a wait staff that will bring your food to you and refill your drinks.\nNo alcoholic beverages... (that's why 4 stars).
