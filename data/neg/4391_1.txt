VERY disappointed. Visited to get a bagel to go (after buying their bagels ever since I moved to Montreal this was a no brainer ). Unfortunately, after waiting at least 5 minutes trying to get an employees attention(at least 15 people working) once I asked an employee to get a bagel to go they responded by yelling \"tabernack!\" To my face 3 times. Left immediately. Never going back.
