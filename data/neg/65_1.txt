Came at 5pm. Could have used some music s it was dead silent.  Very nice place.  Friendly service.  Had the quesadilla w flor de calabaza it was super tasty l, I would order it again. Boyfriend had the enchiladas Suizas that came with rice and beans.  The enchiladas were ok in taste, beans were good but the rice was cold and may have been boxed.  My beef chimichanga was good but I wouldn't order it again.
