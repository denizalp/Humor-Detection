Grabbed two lunch specials for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. Absolutely worth the $6.50 each. Ordered via Yelp and picked up at their side area inside the Bounty Hunter bar. They honored my special requests (dressing on side, add lettuce and extra peperoncini). Gyro and fries were tasty- garlicky taziki sauce tied it together. Antipasto salad was very large with plenty of meat and cheese but lots of veggies too. Soda came in 12oz cans. Will be back to try more lunch specials.
