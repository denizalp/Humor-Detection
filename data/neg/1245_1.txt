Great Menu.  We went there for Thanksgiving dinner.  Our server was a little bit backed up, but who cares, we weren't in a rush.  Bison was excellent, as well as he Froi Gras appetizer.  I had the Steak for my entree, it was cooked perfectly (medium\/WD0.  Wine was awesome, we had a malbec to start, and then moved onto Reisling with our food.  Really good Reisling. Weinbenhaume OpenHeim something something.  Cheese plate at the end of the meal was good.  Pricey, but worth it every now and then.
