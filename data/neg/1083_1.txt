I have never been so impressed by a nail salon. Cutest little boutique ever! My sister is getting engaged & this was one of the \"stops\" on her scavenger hunt! They even played a song for her per request of her soon to be fianc√©. Will definitely be coming back! The attention to detail they put into my nails and toes was extremely exceptional!
