The puppies and kittens are in horrible conditions. Those working at the store don't walk the animals enough. They are confined to a small glass shelf that isn't even big enough for an adult to lay completely stretch out. The prices are super high and the quality of the pet you are getting does not match. Many animals go sick to their new owners because of the lack of consideration the store has for an animals well being. Please stay away from this corporate animal mill.
