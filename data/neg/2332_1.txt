I've been here a few times just because I'm in Albertsons buying some groceries and it's convenient to have a Starbucks in the store. I ordered one of my favorite of the season, iced Pumpkin Spiced Latte. The employees that work in this Starbucks provide great customer service and are very friendly. Usually no lines at all which is great. I'll stop by whenever I'm wanting Starbucks!
