Somehow whenever my family can't make up their minds on where to eat we end up at Brio. At first it seems like a good idea. The menu is huge and everyone is sure to find something they like right? Well, I'd be happy if I don't come back. The portions are large but range from mediocre to just OK. The prices are fine but for the quality of food you're getting why settle? The service systematically starts out OK and then the server seems nowhere to be found when bread or water refills are needed.
