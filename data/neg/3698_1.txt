Could not give 0 stars so i have to give 1, service was garbage, i ordered chicken wings and waited for an hour.  Like literally an hour, manager told me they could not found my table but server told me there was a hold in the kitchen.. Bunch of liers, place is filthy, i would not bring any kid here, dont come here and dont try their food, seriously, service was really really really bad!
