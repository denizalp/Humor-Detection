Amazing! Love this dining room and our server was great! Very attentive. I wish I remembered his name. The eggs Benedict were so good. The English muffin was toasted perfectly but soft enough to perfectly cut though. I substituted potatoes for fruit and got a mixture of fresh blueberries, blackberries, strawberry, cantaloupe and honeydew!!  The make your own omelet was delicious too with spinach and mushroom. I love that lons uses ingredients from their garden on site. Will be back for dinner soon!!!
