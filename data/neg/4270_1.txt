After many returns to French Grocer, a three-star review is merited.  My experiences have unfortunately just been subpar lately, and the best thing going for them- the take-away sandwiches and salads- are no longer available.  My biggest gripe has been service lately.  I can handle very slow since I've come to expect it here, but not slow AND rude.  The young bearded gentleman (ok so everyone has a beard these days!!)  who seems to be a manager, is just plain impolite and unhelpful.
