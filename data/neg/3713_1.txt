I must admit I think I've got a man crush on Guy.. Lol the restaurant was a pleasure.  Ordered the dogfish IPA, it was cold and tasty but the tacos of seared tuna were amazing.  Perfectly put together, so nice I took a picture. Bartender was great in a miserable kind of way, warmed up quickly and made some good recommendations. Overall a great experience.
