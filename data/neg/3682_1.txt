I LOVE THIS SUSHI BAR. Aside from it being extremely convenient for me and my friends, I have always had a positive dining experience here.\n\nWe usually come fo their Friday night Happy Hour, which is from 5pm til closing (kitchen closes at 1:30 am I believe). Everything is 50% off! How can you go wrong??\n\nPersonal favorites: J roll and Ryan Patrick roll.\n\nI also need to add that the tempura ice cream dessert is HEAVENLY. \n\nThis place is seriously dangerous for me. When I crave sushi, I crave this place. And let me tell you, my sushi cravings happen often!
