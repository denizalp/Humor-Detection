Great customer service and very clean place. Conveniently located two blocks from eaton centre They are like chipotle style where you choose your base, protein, vegetables etc into a bowl. Approx $9 a box and $4 for drinks. You can order half and half base (noodle and rice). Would recommend if you need a quick spot for lunch or dinner.
