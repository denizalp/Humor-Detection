I was craving some good pastrami and I found it here!\n\nThis place is tucked in Treasure Island and its a good place to stop and share a sandwich w\/a friend while casino hopping.  The portions are generous and the slices of pastrami very thin (I prefer it cut a bit thicker).  Because the meat was piiled so high I gave up halfway and ate the meat with the fork.  This is the closest I'll get to a nyc pastrami sandwich so I will be sure to drop by this place for a snack everytime I'm in Vegas.
