So. I just called to see if Native was open.  The dumb girl who answered the phone says \"No. We are closing right now\".  & then hung up on me.  .  Why the hell did you answer the phone you idiot?  I love the honey hot wings. It's the only reason I go back. It's certainly not because of the staff. Rude.
