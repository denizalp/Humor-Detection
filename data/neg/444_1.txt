Mike did a great job with my husband and I's car wash.  He is busy but very accommodating with your availability.  He has the best prices for a mobile car wash (comparable to the drive thru prices) and does quality work!  I don't like going to the drive thru as they scratch your paint and bumpers so I'll be calling Mike every few weeks to wash our vehicles.
