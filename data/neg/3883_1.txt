Good food, great location! \n\nThe pop tarts were awesome, and they rotate flavors every day. Make sure to order a few for the table! There's a nice selection for brunch. Staff were super sweet as well! They were able to accommodate my dietary restrictions with ease. We left here very happy and full! \n\nThe location is perfect, because New York New York is one of my favorite hotels! There's also rarely a long wait at Tom's Urban. It's a good choice if you're looking for a quick sit-down restaurant before heading out to the strip.
