This place is always hopping. You need to get there at 11.oo am for lunch . The staff was friendly and attentive . Their prices are very reasonable and portions large . My spaghetti was  a little over cooked and the sausage was overcooked . I  like their marinara.  I should have sent my dish back but I was too hungry
