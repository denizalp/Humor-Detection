I'm only knocking a star off for the high cost. It kind of expensive for a slice. $4+  One can get a whole medium pizza from Pizza Pizza for $4.99\n\nHowever for the Best NY style pizza, King David has got everyone in the area beat!  Kosher pizza rules. The taste (love the tomato sauce), ingredients and care of preparation is apparent.\n\nThey also offer freshly baked bourekas, falafels, that look very appetizing. Can't wait to try them on future visits. Located across in the plaza North of Promenade Mall on Disera Dr.
