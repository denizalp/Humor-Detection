Really cool set up inside with lots of choices on the menu. My daughter and I settled for pasta with a cream sauce; two different dishes, same base sauce. We both felt sick that evening, and she had diarrhea for the next few days. Likely won't be going back, which is unfortunate because the food was so good going down!
