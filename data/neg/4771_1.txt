Really yummy, great selection of cocktails (some like it hot was so good!!), wonderful service from Oscar, and plenty of food options for everyone in your group. The steak and kale salad was delicious and filling, bit I recommend getting a side of the house pickles to go with the salad because it really took it up a notch flavor-wise. \n\nThe decor is so beautiful and not at all gaudy like most Vegas restaurants. Love this place!!
