South Indian food: outstanding - five stars, dishes I've never had before. (Because, it turns out, I've been eating at Northern Indian restaurants. For example, naan is more of a Northern menu item-- get the dosa, a Southern menu item. Again, the food is exceptionally good. This place is busy though, so service was on the slow side. I'll definitely return. I'm craving their food again already.
