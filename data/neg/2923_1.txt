I moved back to Scottsdale from out of state and my old stylist had moved on. I was back to square one, so started with a Groupon and met Jessica! Search over. I have been battling with left over ombr√© ends for awhile and with a little added color and a fresh cut, I feel like a whole new woman! She is attentive and explains why and how she is doing your hair. I'm very easy-going when it comes to haircuts, but for someone who isn't, you won't be nervous with Jessica taking care of you.
