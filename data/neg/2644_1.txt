Enjoyed my first visit. Cozy restaurant and tasted authentic. Service and food good.\n\nCrab Rangoons 4\/5 - very good though the color of filling was different than what I'm use to\n\nPot Stickers 3.5\/5 - crispy, pork dumpling. A bit doughy than I'm use to\n\nChinese Sausage Fried Rice 4\/5 - very tasty and generous portion\n\nSiu Jiu Beef 4\/5 - crispy pan fried noodles with beef, peppers, and onions in black bean sauce. Very good. \n\nWant to try the wings, congee, and seafood pan fried noodles next time
