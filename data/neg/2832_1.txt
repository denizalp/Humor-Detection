Customer service itself is horrible. They don't even greet you when you go in or thank you when you leave. I go to relax and they just put me in a bad mood. I went in to get acrylic nails and paid about $30. The man who did my nails rushed and didn't do a good job on then. Waste of $30, never going again and don't recommend going.
