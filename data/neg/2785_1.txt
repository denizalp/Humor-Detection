This is my new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  A cozy atmosphere and delicious food - perfect for date nights!  I got the avocado bahn mi tacos, and they are possibly the best tacos I have ever had- the tempura veggies inside are delicious.  My date loved the Cuban sandwich.  Additionally, the Kaya juice is a perfect blend of fruits - it makes you feel like you are at tropical resort! Thanks for the great time!
