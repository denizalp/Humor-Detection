This is for their deli.\n\nI work in the complex and have at times eaten at Subway until I learned they knew about Jarod being a pedophile the whole time (my opinion, they should be run out of business). So! I really wanted a sandwich and decided to pop in to Safeway and give their deli a try. I got their Italian sandwich and....omg.....YUM! Eating there again today. I've never had a sandwich so good! I will continue eating there and trying all the sandwiches!
