I don't buy into the trader joes hype to the level that many do.  I acknowledge they have a unique experience and interesting food options,  this particular location is difficult to shop because it is very small and difficult to get to by car.  Parking is a nightmare, especially on the weekends.  The only thing that gets me in the door is their $3 Charles shaw wines which do live up to their name.
