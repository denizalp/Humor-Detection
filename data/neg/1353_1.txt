My server was \"Stephanie\" and she was great. She severed me a delicious happy hour flat bread and a few cockatails. She was incredibly accommodating. I was slightly confused about the new happy hour. But the manager accommodated me (short guy with a beard.) Without a doubt I will be back. Definitely a neighborhood favorite.
