This place is super cute! I got the Roasted Chicken Salad & a chocolate chip cookie sammich and was pleased with both (though the cookie sammich was a BIT sweet for me, but I don't usually eat sweets). Service was fast and the atmosphere was calm for lunch hour, so it was a nice get away from the office.
