The ultimate place to go shop for Korean grocery. Every time we visit Vegas, we always stop by here and pick up snacks and ramen.  They also have a food court inside where you can pretty much choose all of the different menu Korean restaurants offer.  We actually come here especially for that. Wish we had this in Utah.
