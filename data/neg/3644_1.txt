Great Southwestern Caesar salad with chicken. Service was split second. 3min from order to receiving my salad at drive through. There was a car in front of me. They had the same 3 min in and out. \n\nThe only ding is there wasn't enough dressing for this very generous salad. My first visit. I'll be back.
