The soups and wraps here are amazing! I hate myself for only discovering Ravi's Soups only weeks ago. I've been neglecting myself. I've probably tried almost everything on their menu and from what I tasted was fantastic. The staff here who I believe is family owned and operated are super friendly. I've taken a couple friends here and now their also hooked on the goodness.
