What a nice find in Scarborough. Located at the SE plaza at Birchmount and Lawrence, this restaurant serves great Hakka food and the price is more than reasonable. Lunch special comes with pop or soup.\n\nThe place has very nice decor as well, with friendly service. The lady was really attentive and helpful. I ordered their sweet and sour chicken special and the food came pretty quick. I am not an expert in Hakka food but chicken was quite tender and the sauce was delicious.\n\nNext time I would like to try some items on their dinner menu.
