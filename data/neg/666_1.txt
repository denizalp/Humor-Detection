I was slightly dissapointed whilst having dinner there. From reading the reviews, I thought I wudve had an exquisite time but it was below my expectations. I believe Italian food is not supposed to be served too constructed, n that's what my meal felt like. Everything was sub-par however the quantities and prices didnt meet my expectations...
