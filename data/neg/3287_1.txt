I had the opportunity to re-visit Jardin Nelson on my recent trip to Montreal.  \n\nAs in the past, the crepes, the jazz ensemble, and the overall atmosphere were wonderful.  Yes, it is a bit touristy, but isn't most of Vieux Montreal?\n\nI enjoyed the Newburg and my dinning partner the Argenteuil....wonderful!
