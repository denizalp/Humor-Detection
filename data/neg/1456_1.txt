I've only been here once, but I quite liked it and would like to go back when\/if I'm in the area again. We were seated by the open kitchen, so it was entertaining to watch the pizzas being made. I had a pasta and it was good, though a little bit lukewarm. I would love to go back to try the pizza, though.
