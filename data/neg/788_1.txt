I love this place and due to a \"hook up\" have stayed in a Penthouse Suite the last two visits. \n\nAWESOME \n- Amazing steam shower \n- Great toiletries \n- Stellar Customer Service \n - The VIEW from the 61st floor\n\nUN-COOL \n- No coffee makers \n- No MP3 player hookups or place for an axillary cord in the Penthouses so I couldn't jam to my tunes.
