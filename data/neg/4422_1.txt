I expected so much better from a place like MGM, considering it seemed that there was a lot of thought into everything they've done.\nBut I wasn't really impressed with the buffet here. The food was admittedly fresh, but the flavours just wasn't there, and there was definitely a lack in food variety, considering the price you are paying for it.\nThe waitress service however, i cannot fault, even though at the beginning it seemed a little confusing, as we had to change table 3 times before we got to the one we were supposed to be sitting on.
