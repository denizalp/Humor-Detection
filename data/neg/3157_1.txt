Wow! A custard lovers paradise. In the cold case they even had butter brickle flavored custard! My all-time favorite flavor and rarer than hens teeth. I know this because I always search for this flavor whenever I'm near ice cream or custard. Culvers delivers too on the creamy, smooth, flavor in their chocolate yogurt and the price won't break the bank.  I will definitely be returning.
