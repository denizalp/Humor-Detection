True story. I placed an order for delivery, they screwed it up. Said they were sending a replacement that didn't come. They gave me a credit. A few weeks later they screwed up the order for the replacement to the replacement they screwed up. The order came and it was wrong again. I had to call and get a replacement for the replacement for the replacement. They finally got it right but the replacement for that pizza was cold because they didn't care. If I could sum it up in a word, clowns.
