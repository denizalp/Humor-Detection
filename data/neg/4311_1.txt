I have only had brunch here once: salmon bennie and a ceasar.  It was ok, not bad, not great, just ok.  The lines on the weekend are a bit ridiculous, but the service is fast and friendly.  \n\nI'd recommend it, but I feel like there are way better brunch places out there.  However, if you're in the area and want something more convenient on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, this is probably your best bet.
