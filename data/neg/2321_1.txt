\"Thank you Lisa for your services!\" \nI'm still new to this area and needed to scan  a check and Graphic Imaging was the closest place.  When I arrived there, Lisa was so helpful and kind to me.  They are awesome people and I learned a thing from Lisa.  In Hawaii they would say, \"Maikai Kanaka!\"(good people).  I'm forever grateful!
