Got two Poke bowls, one with brown rice, Loki salmon and shrimp with toppings, and an Arcadian bloom bowl\/ (salad bowl) with salmon and spicy tuna. Both were delightful! Bubbly atmosphere with friendly staff with clean workspaces. Lemonade is sweet and tasty, especially the mango lemonade mixed with green tea. The gelato puffle was awesome! The soft, but crispy bubbly waffle complemented the cookies and cream gelato nicely. Would definitely have it again. Ask for a double scoop though because the gelato to waffle ratio is just a bit off ;) We'll be back!
