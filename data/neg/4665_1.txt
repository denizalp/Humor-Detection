It only get's a 2 just because of the good ambiance and reasonable prices.  They served this swill wine that was absolutely disgusting.  I drink cheaper wine sometimes, but this red wine was  absolutely aweful.  The food was very generic and nothing really worth noting. Bland.  Fairly priced, but I definitely won't be back.  Can't believe some people think this is actually good italian food.
