I started out with the Good for You Bars which are my favorite. I would buy whole trays because I love sharing them with my friends and family. Now I have moved on to trying almost every flavor of cookie she has made and the list keeps growing. The cookies are huge and delicious. They definitely satisfy my sweet tooth. The owner is super sweet and it is really an adorable cookie shop. You must try!!
