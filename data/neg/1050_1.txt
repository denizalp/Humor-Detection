Over 15 bear on the tap, all micro microbrewery Yay! I'm a fan. After a nice game at the Rogers Cup I came here wit a friend, great ambient  so we could have a nice conversation. So many beers to choose from to bad I had to cycle home later. The Barman was extremely nice and the beer was super nice. Prices are about 7.5$ a pint and 5.50 $ a glass (some beers are 6.5$ and come in a wine glass, the strong triples mostly). I will defiantly re-visit this one again.
