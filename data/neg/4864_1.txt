Excellence...man I wish this place was next door to me. It's so delicious and so smart of a concept. Way to go for Aaron Pool the owner of this gem. Also...the people who helped us out were amazeballs. Just a wonderful experience all the way around. Please come to my state...i deserve to eat this on the regular.
