My husband thought Dustin was a trustworthy individual and hired him to repair our pool; however, little did we know that we were getting ripped off by him. He overcharged us considerably.  We found this out after my husband just happened to talk to another pool guy. I would highly recommend getting multiple quotes and not trust this smooth talker at face value! Unfortunately he is making short term money decisions!
