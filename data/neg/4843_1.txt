The Guild is a good restaurant to go to with friends after work, as it is conveniently located  they have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and good service. In terms of the food, I thought the portions were a bit small and that the food was good but not amazing. I wouldn't go back for the food, I would go back for the ambiance and for their outdoor seating in the summer.
