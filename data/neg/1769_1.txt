We had a great dinner at Mr.  G's.  We had the pizza special &  a garden salad. Pizza crust was really good and sauce was flavorful. I asked if I could have a side of their hand breaded eggplant and was accommodated.  The eggplant with marinara sauce was delicious. Service isn't super speedy,  but you are certainly treated well.
