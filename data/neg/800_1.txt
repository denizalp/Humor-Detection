We came here on a hot evening to relax on the patio. We ordered drinks and burgers. The slider burgers were ok. I felt like they were missing something. It was only burger, cheese and bun. Maybe a pickle or mayonnaise would have made them more appealing. The drinks were good. We ordered cocktails and they were a bit on the lighter side with alcohol.
