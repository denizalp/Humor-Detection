I wanted to surprise my husband with new cushions for his Mission Style Chair. So obviously I could take the old ones. I measured as best I could and brought those measurements. I picked out a beautiful leather vinyl that will hold up very well and the cushion is very sturdy. The cushions were perfect! They fit snugly and are very comfortable. The seams and zipper have excellent workmanship. If you need any cushions, in or outdoors come here. You will not be disappointed.
