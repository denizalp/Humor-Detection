This is such a great shop.  We love the food and the staff is always so kind and helpful.  We love all the unique flavored popcorn, cotton candy, delicious chocolate, and beautiful candy apples.  The kids love to come here to get special treats but it is also a wonderful place to purchase gifts, especially for those hard to buy for people.
