New ownership!!  The Bonjour Bakery & Deli, now with a Korean twist, is a wonderful addition to the Las Vegas Valley's selection of Bakeries.  The best Baguette outside of France and delicious Croissants, not to mention the pastries.  I have been there numerous times since it's soft opening and always new delicacies to try.  Service is so friendly and the place is absolutely spotless and very inviting.
