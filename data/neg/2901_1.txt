Used to go regularly because the wings are great. They still are and the suicide ones are delish! Tonight we ordered a pitcher of the goose island because we saw it on draught. We were just told that they don't have it with no further explanation (but we saw the tap?) So I ordered the Reuben sandwich and it was sooo sooo super unbelievably salty. It might have been the mustard. I couldn't finish it and when I told the server she basically didn't react. Cool beans. If you go, just don't get the Reuben.
