I have come here since they opened the door and it's absolutely,  hands down our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!!\nThe Food Is amazing. ...we bring friends from all over who come to visit and we always go here and they are always satisfied and raving about the restaurant. \n\nThe staff...from the bus Boys all the way to Juan, the owner.....are extraordinary!  \n\nAsk for Hernan....best waiter around!!\nOrder the Queso Fundido for your appetizer!!!!   Soooo yummmmyyy!!!\n\nOnce you go here, you WILL go back.  Best Mexican Food in town!!
