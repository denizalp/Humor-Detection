These guys were so helpful! My mom and I decided to bike from Pittsburgh to DC even though neither of us are any kind of \"bikers\". Golden Triangle was able to provide all the gear we needed, as well as support with the planning process. We were not sure what to expect on the trip, and talking with the people and getting their affirmation that we would be fine was very comforting. The trip ended up being an experience of a lifetime and it was with the support of GT.
