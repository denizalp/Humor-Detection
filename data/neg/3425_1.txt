Love love love Keisha! I've never had a PERFECT pedicure til she blessed me with her work. She was super friendly and did an amazing job at cleaning, shaping and painting my toes. As for the salon, it's so cute and clean. The staff and environment is very welcoming and friendly & if it's your very first time coming into the salon, they give you $10 off your service. Will definitely be coming back for some pampering when I need one!  Also, it's advisable to make an appointment because they get super busy!
