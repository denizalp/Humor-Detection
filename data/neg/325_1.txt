I came here last minute, so it wasn't really a planed thing but omg I loved it , there was a good vibe loved the music the dancer were working they butts of on the pole I tipped one and he was so cute and nice, what I loved more was this drag queen and she just blew me away she danced so nice a was just at \"ahh\"with the dancers the service and the people..\nfirst time there was awesome experience and will definitely recommend.
