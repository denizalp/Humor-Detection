Breakfast\/Brunch was quick, tasty and reasonably priced. I had the NYC Lox, Eggs & Onions. \n\nWaitress forgot that two of us asked for more hot water for our tea. We reminded her about 6mins later. \n\nWe didn't ask for the bill; weren't ask if we'd like anything else, we were just given it....cue to leave.
