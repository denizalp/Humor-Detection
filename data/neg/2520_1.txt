This is a piss poor place to live. They charge you 25 a month for someone to pick up trash frok your front door even if you don't use the service. What they say the rent is isn't actually what you'll pay. From all the fees and everything my rent is 100 more than advertised. Cops always on property. Do yourself a favor and move elsewhere this place is garbage. I can't wait to leave this place and have even contemplated breaking the lease to just move
