Honestly not bad for a buffet. Still felt like crap afterwards but I had a serious dim sum craving and left satisfied. Good selection of dim sums at the lunch buffet as well as Western food like potatoes and bacon. The Chinese dishes I tried were decent as well . I don't expect much from a buffett and was pleasently surprised by this one.
