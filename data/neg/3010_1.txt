Found this place on Yelp looking for a cheap taco joint near ASU. I was quite disappointed with the food I received. I ordered three carne aside tacos with rice and beans. The rice and beans were tasty but my tacos were nothing special at all. They weren't even served with cilantro or onion(a taco necessity), instead it was sprinkled with some old brown lettuce and diced tomatoes. Also each taco came to be three dollars which is pretty expensive for the type and quality of the little tacos. I won't be coming back.
