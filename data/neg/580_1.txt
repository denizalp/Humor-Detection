Awful, Unethical, and a rip off.  When you cancel a flight with Allegiant Air, they actually charge you 100.00.  As if they didn't already rip you off with all their fees.  Baggage fees with Allegiant are a rip off as well, charging for  a carry on?? Dumb.  I will never fly this airline again.  I will pay whatever a great airline charges or I just won 't go.  They have ripped me off for the last time.
