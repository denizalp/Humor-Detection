Yuck. First, the fish was stale and definitely not safe. Second, both sushi chefs were SO drunk they couldn't keep it together. They made everything wrong, served dishes to the wrong people, forgot orders multiple times,  and we're stumbling over themselves. The hostess was all over the place but had no idea what was going on around her.\n\nWouldn't waste 26$ there again.
