My assistant and I stop into Rascals once a week to look at clothes for our family and friends who have young children. They are right next to Starbucks, so it is always a treat after picking up a cup of our favorite brew. \n\nRascals has an excellent selection that borders on the creative. I have always been impressed by the above average quality of the material used in their kids clothes.  They do a nice job!
