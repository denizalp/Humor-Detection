This store was completely awesome!! It is absolutely huge and decently organized into different themes and sections.\n\nI could spend hours in here looking at all the cool stuff they have.  There were some items that I thought were a bit overpriced but mostly they had affordable, quality secondhand items.\n\nIn particular they had a lot of 'country' decor, vintage Christmas items, tools, home decor, and a ton of vintage finds. If you are into vintage stuff you HAVE to visit this store. \n\nI will definitely be back when I have more time to get lost for a while! :)
