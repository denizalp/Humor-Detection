It's Waffle House  10:30 on a week night. Service was ok. Food was ok. Order wasn't 100% correct, bacon\/waffles arrived long after eggs\/toast\/hash browns. Some Waffle Houses are better than others.  There are better Waffle Houses IMO. It's also a tough gig, so I don't have high expectations and you shouldn't either at this one.
