Let me start saying that this Banner urgent care is the best urgent care facility that I have ever visited, this place is brand new, well kept; clean bathroom, the lobby is neat, the patient room where I was taken was impeccable. Thefront and back  office were helpful and polite, the nurse practitioner Rebecca Gonzalez was amazing, she was efficient and personable at the same time, I would highly recommend this Banner health care provider in particular.
