The employees are robotic.  I was not greeted with a hi or even a smile.  The tables were dirty. I had to wipe my own table to sit. The food was just ok if you enjoy eating sour cream, rice and beans.  I was served extra all that with a pinch of meat and guac. They need to check their serving sizes because they are all off.
