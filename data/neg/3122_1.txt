If you go on the lobster or crab leg night it is worth it although you have to make multiple trips since they ration the portions. As for the rest of the food very cafeteria like and not very good. The dessert bar is pretty lame with some items a bit stale. I still go for the crab legs and lobster but not worth it on other nights.
