9am in the morning, we check in for one night. Check out time is noon. HouseKeeping wake us's up for no reason. Spoke to the Manager (Johnathan), asked him It's not Check-out time why is your housekeeper knock on the door. His respond was to Check if we need any thing. Very??!!! And his other comment or suggest is we should have use the do not disturb sign. That is what it's for. \n\nThe A\/C in the room never work right. Either it too hot or too cold. The thermostat never work correctly.
