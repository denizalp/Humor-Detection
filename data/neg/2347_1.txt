Amazing selection of gluten free treats from thoughtful, friendly family owners. Their son has food alleegies so they take them very seriously. The steamed chicken buns are killer! The food is high quality home cooking. \n\nWe stocked our freezer and have yet to try sweet and sour chicken balls, breaded shrimp, lemon chicken and hot dog buns, just to name some of what they offer. The bbq pork bunk doesn't have the sweet sticky pork you might except but it's fresh and delicious. \n\nCan't wait to go back and stock up!
