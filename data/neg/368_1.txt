Ok....so I have read a few of the reviews. Respectfully I have to disagree with a few prior post. Originally from Santa Monica and now a local here in Vegas. I got to say I miss the Canter's in Fairfax but I have had nothing but a good experience with our Canter's here on the westside. The service has been nothing short of on point. Of course the menu....in one word \"Fresh\"!
