Been coming to this restaurant for well over 10 years\n\nThe lady already knows I always ask for fish sauce and brings it without even asking, that's good customer service\n\nBeen greeted and remembered as well as amazing food always makes me go back when the urge for the 7 beef dish arises\n\nThis is the ONLY place to have 7 beef dish in Toronto, any other restaurant just sucks for it
