The service was incredibly slow and the food wasn't very good. I ordered the fish and chips expecting a typical fish and chips experience. When I learned that it was actually tilapia, I was curious at first when when I tasted the overcooked, too-thick batter over the crumbly fish I was immediately turned off.\n\nThey do make some good flavored lemonades, but really I was just horribly disappointed.
