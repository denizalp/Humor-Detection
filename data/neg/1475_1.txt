Pretty good food! Pretty good prices. You just have to put up with really loud (bad) music, obnoxiously drunk rednecks, teenagers hogging the pool table, hit-or-miss wait service, and packs of cops doing walk-throughs. Also, not a whole lot of seating, if you don't count the bar - which I don't - so get there early. Parking is pretty bad because of all the bars and restaurants in such a small area...BUT at least Friends has a back entrance so you don't have to walk around.
