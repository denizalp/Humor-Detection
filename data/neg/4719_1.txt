Ok so I believe I have now seen all the Cirque du soleil shows in Vegas! Mystere and Zumanity were always my favorites but now this show holds number one on my list! \nThe music, the dancing, everything is amazing. Makes you want to get out of your seat and dance your butt off! Not a bad seat in the house!!!! Also those tasty specialty cocktails are nice! Popcorn could use some help but it got ate! Lol\nGo see this show if you love the Beatles!!!
