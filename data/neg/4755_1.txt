The portion was small but it was the best buffalo chicken sandwich I've ever had. \nUPDATED \nwill never order fried chicken from here again. They clearly ran out and used chicken tenders instead on the sandwich. It sucked. Tell the customer if you're going to do that, so i can order something else. The burgers are pretty good.
