I LOVE this place!!!  I had the powder dip nails which I had never had before and they look fantastic!  It's been 2 weeks and my nails still look like I walked right out of the salon.  And I am so incredibly hard on my nails they usually have scuffed or chipped or broken off by now.  I feel like the cost to get the powder dip nails was very competitive with the no chip but so much nicer.  I will be back.
