Friendly, efficient service. Great attention to detail, and care of the presentation and cook of the food. By far, the best Vietnamese cuisine I have had in the GTA. \nI have a very discerning palate and notice everything around me. I just had a mind blowing meal here tonight. Definitely my GOTO now. It has been a loong time since I have had lemongrass chicken or a spring roll this good! 5 stars for sure!
