Pizza was good. I went for pickup. I was more impressed with the staff. Everyone was super nice and very welcoming. A lot of times workers act like you are bothering them or that they are just miserable. They also had a nice dining area and it was clean. Only piece of advice to management is to move the extra supplies that were stacked by the front door to a non visible area to clean up the main area a bit.
