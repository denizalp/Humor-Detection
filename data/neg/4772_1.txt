I love their wide selection of beers! Conveniently on King St. They have a lounge section and a restaurant section. My friend and I sat at the bar. I got the Zodiac 3x and shared some frites with a friend after work one night. Noise level isnt loud so you can have conversations at the table without yelling across. One of the better places to chill after a long day at work.
