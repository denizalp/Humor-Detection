I am giving a zero rating for this place the owner is a grade A B****. My steak was a bad cut of meat (my friends steak was good) and instead of comping my bill or a offering a discount the owner of the restaurant who was passing our table acted defensive, patronizing and snatched the plate while I was holding it and trying to explain my situation. Our waiter Frédéric was awesome but the owner's attitude and crazy\/awkward behavior was completely unacceptable and unnecessary. She should not be customer facing... Ever.
