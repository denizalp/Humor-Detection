The service was fast and friendly and the falafel was moist and tasty.  But the falafel sandwich was overloaded with bland lettuce, no hummus, and the wrap was a bit dried out.  Maybe going again I'd know to order differently, but given the other reviews, I was a bit disappointed.  Overall, good prices and the food might get better if you order exactly what you want.
