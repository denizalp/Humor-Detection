Dr. Becky was very welcoming and friendly. She knew how to connect with my daughter who suffers from anxiety and other things  because of her condition. During our first visit dr. Becky knew exactly what was going on with her and I did not have to explain why she was being uncomfortable and fussy during the visit like I did with other doctors that my daughter sees. After my daughter had her first adjustment i could tell that she was more relaxed and happy and I hope to see more improvement from her.
