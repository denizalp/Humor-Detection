My two young kids attended their first swim lesson with Ms. Victoria.  She was great with the kids, and helped them relax and enjoy the experience.  The water was the perfect temperature and clean.  I also spoke to other parents that were happy with the lessons.  I am looking forward to future lessons and would definitely recommend Water Wings Swim School to other parents.
