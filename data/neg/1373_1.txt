This restaurant is a gem!!! The food is authentic Italian!!  Everything is homemade!!! Momma checks you in and daddy comes by to make sure all is well!  Each dish was plate licking good!!! The bread basket alone was amazing all hot and fresh with a variety of flavors!!!  Loved our waiter, Alex was  attentive and knowledgeable !  He should train some of these Vegas waiters!!!  They were also very accommodating to a couple of our preferences!!! Even the deserts fresh and all made from scratch that day!!!  Delicioso!!  See you again real soon!!!
