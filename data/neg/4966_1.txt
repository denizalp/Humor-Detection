Sitting here currently. Just had the country breakfast. \nThe bacon is amazing! Potatoes I was expecting better. But the biscuits & gravy....AVOID! \nMost stale biscuit I've ever touched. It's was hard like a hockey puck! \nThe gentleman next to me even commented on how old the gravy looked due to the lack of steam coming off the plate. \nDon't come in the afternoon because you clearly get the left overs.
