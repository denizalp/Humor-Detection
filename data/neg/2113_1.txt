LP does a brisk take-out coffee business for passers-by en route to Laurier park. But their small indoor seating area is one of my favourite places to work. Good music, hipster watching, warm staff. Plaid-shirted, bearded, amiable owner. Coffee is very good, though the slightest of notches below Le Couteau, Pikolo, Myriade II. Occasional (though welcome) smell of strong cheese from the grilled cheese side of the operation.
