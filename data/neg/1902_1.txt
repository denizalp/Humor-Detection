Aisles were clean, well stocked, produce looked plentiful & in good condition. No issues with staff here. Though I have to complain that some of the shelves in the organics section were bare. They also don't have any essential oils in the organic section, which I thought was strange. Other than that, good service with the cashiers. There were plenty open.
