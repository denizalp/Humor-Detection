I like their Monday, all-day Happy Hour, their cocktails are really good, and with $4.00 off?? Keep them coming!\n\nTheir food is \"okay\", I had a salad, and my husband one of their sandwiches, food is pretty average. The ambiance is good, kinda hipster, very small yet cozy\/cute spot. I would definitely go back and give it another try, but that's just because I live a few blocks away. \n\nIt's definitively a casual place, not for a special ocassion
