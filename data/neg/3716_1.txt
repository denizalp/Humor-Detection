It felt like Christmas morning coming out to my \"new\" car this morning!!! I am beyond happy!!! Thank you to Troy Sabo and Billy Wittmann!! I never felt pressured, confused, or jerked around. Troy explained everything to me perfectly and was so patient with me while I asked all of my silly and numerous questions. I will forever recommend them for anyone looking to buy a new or used vehicle. They are stellar!!!!
