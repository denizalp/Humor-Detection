I had the sirloin tips and mashed potatoes, it was ok, not too tough but nothing to say much about.  It seems kind of expensive for what I got.  \nThey gave me a window seat overlooking the street.  It was interesting watching the evening crowd ebb and flow.\nI tried two beers.  The Marzen was tasty and I'd order another one.  The Rauchbier on the other hand just tasted kind of odd.  I would not get another of those.
