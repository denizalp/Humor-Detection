We had gotten a gift card for a massage, so we set up a couples massage. It was my first time to Massage Envy the place was clean the front desk staff was nice. We filled out the first timer paperwork and a few minutes later went to the couples room. My girl Andrea did a good job, very relaxing massage my wife was also pleased with her girl. Not the best massages we had but we both enjoyed it. I would go back for another try.
