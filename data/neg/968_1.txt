Our favorite \"go to\". Great neighborhood bar\/restaurant where everyone knows your name. Food is wonderful, happy hour is out of this world and now they have brunch on the weekends! Happy To have this place in the neighborhood. Shout out to Rand, Alexis and Kristin for always taking such great care of us.
