The pharmacist, Melissa advised me to take the pill right away before my surgery, which I had to map my work schedule out for, find childcare for, and a ride to and from. Turns out the consent forms are invalid when on medication. So I have to reschedule the procedure, find childcare again, and not get paid for work and then pay for transportation again. \n\nDon't trust their advice. They are not experts and say whatever they think sounds about right. Not what you want in a drug dealer.
