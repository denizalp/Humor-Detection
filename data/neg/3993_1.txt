If I could give 0 stars, I would. Drove the family downtown to see an imax feature that was posted on fandango only to discover that the Science Center doesn't update their times online. Turns out the feature wasn't playing. For a \"science\" center to be so far behind on tech updates is baffling and disappointing.
