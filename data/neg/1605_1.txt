Loved Dr. Schlotterer but I did not feel comfortable with the nurses at the office. No manners as soon as I walked in. The nurse who assisted Dr. Schlotterer was rude and seemed to have an attitude. Felt uncomfortable with most of the nurses and going for my first time, i think it's important to feel comfortable. Will not be returning back.
