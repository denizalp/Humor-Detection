Christina is legit the best server I have ever had. She welcomed us and did such an amazing job of making my friend's bachelorette brunch the best it could be. Seriously your experience here will be so much better if you sit in her section. The food here is also amazing and they have all kinds of wonderful infusions of flavors.
