3.5\nClean, nice staff, good location\nWent for. $5 day\nBig mistake.. Newborns should not be allowed into rated R films. And IDs should be checked for questionable kids. Plus have someone checking for phones. Never again for discount day all the \"heathens\" come out.\nBut the place is nice. Grab a stiff drink or 4 prior to the movie and life's good.
