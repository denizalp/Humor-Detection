This was my first time at Burrito Boyz. I'd gone around with my partner at around 5pm (so not peak time). The person who made our burrito was in so much hurry and she didn't care whether we followed the ingredients that she was putting. \nI've had burritos from other places and this one was the worst. The chicken was overcooked, she barely put any sauces & condiments and the end result was a bland tasting burrito.\nI won't come here again.
