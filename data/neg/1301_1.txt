I have been in this store a handful of times and while the giant selection of products was outstanding, that staff was not.  Everytime I had a question about a product, I either couldnt find a sales associate or they were all too busy gossiping with each other to mind the customers.  I once wandered around the perfume aisles for a good 15 minutes before anyone even took notice.  I dread going there unless I absolutely cant find a certain product elsewhere.  Not recommended unless you feel like being ignored.
