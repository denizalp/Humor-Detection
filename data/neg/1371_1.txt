Vida Moulin is a magical place. The expertly curated selection of home goods, clothing and gift items will keep me coming back again and again. I had a wonderful experience with the salesperson, she greeted me immediately and was friendly and helpful. They have a fabulous selection of succulents and they plant them for you in the container of your choice! Very unique and fun.
