Came here spontaneously and was not disappointed at all. Service was good and food was fantastic. Our waiter was Manuel and he took good care but could have visited a hair more, but I'm not complaining. I have to remind myself to relax-it's a Friday night and we are without a kid! Nice selection on the menu and plenty of Veg options too. And oh....the Guac is excellent.
