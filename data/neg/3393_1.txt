I hate going to the dentist....everyone does. This place is an exception. I arrived and was greeted nicely. Completed the paperwork and sat down. The dentist called me into his office to chat. I have never had an experience like this. He actually made time to meet me prior to any treatment. I received my cleaning and he detailed everything for long term goals. My experience was outstanding. I will definitely recommend and I will be going back.
