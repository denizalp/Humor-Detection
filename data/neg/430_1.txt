Encore Beach Club is a must. Both times that I've came here, it's been amazing and it has to be my favorite day club by far! The venue is very spacious, not small and cramped like Drai's. You are also very close to the DJ if you decide to go up on land; you can see them crystal clear; its kind of surreal Definitely coming back next time I'm in town.
