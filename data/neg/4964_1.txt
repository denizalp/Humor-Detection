Cute cookies! They have boxes that make good gifts. I can also see people ordering these for baby showers, bridals, etc. We tried the dutch chocolate, the regular chocolate chip, and espresso crunch--they were pretty good (I'm not too big of a shortbread fan though). They are a bit pricey but they're well made.\n\nAlso, you get a free cookie with every purchase.
