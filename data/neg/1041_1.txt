Coming from Manhattan, Tum Nak Thai definitely satisfied my Thai cravings. They're prompt and delicious, and prices are so reasonable! It's a shame more restaurants around here don't have better online menus or online methods of taking orders, but everything I ordered was great! Glass noodle soup had perfect veggie to meat to noodle ratios, noodles were on point, and the green curry was delicious!
