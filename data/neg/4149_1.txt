Terrible place!  It is dirty and completely unorganized.  The bathrooms are disgusting and look like they haven't been cleaned in ages.  When looking for basic items, I found empty shelves.  Finally, the check out takes FOREVER. They only keep a couple lanes open, even with really long lines.  I will never go back. Thank god there is a nice Target in the same shopping center.
