The service was excellent. The staff was quick, polite, and fun. However, food was very bad. The tortillas were bland, thick, flour tortillas. The fillings were equally bad. To put it simply, I'd rather skip their $2 taco Tuesday, and pay full price for Chili's (and for the record, I do not think Chili's is good).
