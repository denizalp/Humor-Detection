I went to my first dentist in Phoenix for over 20 years. When the dentist took in a \"partner\" I knew the end was near. I conveniently forgot about the dentist until a crown fell off. My wife had been referred to Dr. Patel and was impressed with the staff, office and Dr. Patel. They were able to schedule an appointment for the next day. I think I've found my dentist for the next 20+ years!!\n\nHighly recommended! !
