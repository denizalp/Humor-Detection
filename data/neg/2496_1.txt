Lots of showtimes for the latest movies.  (We saw Inside Out with our younger kids- LOVE! The older kids saw Jurassic World.) Fun games in the lobby to pass the time, since part of our group was still watching their movie.  Lots of staff at the concessions too, so you can get your popcorn fast and not miss the previews!
