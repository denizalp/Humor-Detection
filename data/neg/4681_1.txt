My experience with Aimee Bar Am Photography was a pleasure! My daughter was fussy and not in the mood for a photo shoot but Aimee managed to capture her adorable happy side.  The pictures I got were great and i get many compliments  from the people around me. will defently use Aimee agin for all my Photography needs.
