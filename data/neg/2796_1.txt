I had an appointment with Andrew for lower back pain and walked away feeling 100x better! Friendly staff greets you upon entering and shows you to their relaxation area prior to your session. Feel free to get some tea or water while you wait- trust me, they run on time most of the time! Members have the choice of monthly massages or facials with their \"credit\" and can add on more services at a discounted rate. Plenty of appointment times for clients and lots of masseuses to choose from!
