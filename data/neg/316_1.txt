Nice atmosphere and fun place but food was very mediocre. I ordered the sirloin medium and it came out a bit over poked and quite rubbery. Catfish could have certainly been cooked longer for better crisp and color. Sides were small and their green beans were not seasoned at all. Presentation of the dishes were very thrown together and as soon as you see the dish, you know you're going to be let down. For a good time and drinks, I would recommend. For a good meal, look elsewhere.
