This place is awesome. I came in today, to get my vehicle refinance. They offered me a great deal, I couldn't refuse. The personal there, are friendly & feels homebody to me... Especially, the Rep. Margaret... Got some laughs & explained the process very well to me... I definitely recommend, if your looking for a local bank, that makes you feel at home. Looking forward to my future endeavours with them.
