I went there last weekend and had a pretty good meal. The meat tasted kinda same, since the sauces in beef, pork, beef ribs were similar, but they were still good. The service was nice, the waiter asked if I want more food and drinks very often. And the price was accetpable, especially comparing to other places at downtown area. I will go back again in the future!
