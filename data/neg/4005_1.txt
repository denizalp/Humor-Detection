This place is a solid 4 stars in my opinion.  I would have to say the service isn't the best, not very friendly and not thorough in regard to checking on tables.  Getting that out of the way, the food and atmosphere make up the difference.  The food is solidly good Korean food, and the restaurant atmosphere is sleek, modern, and clean.  We always enjoy what we order.  They serve a Korean dessert soup after dinner which is a thoughtful addition.
