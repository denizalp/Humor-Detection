It's hard not to like Slices. It's the perfect place to end a night on Mill (or to stop by in between bars for a quick bite). Is it be the best pizza on earth? No,but they don't try to be that. Slices is an unassuming pizza joint that gives you exactly what you want: decently good pizza when you're too drunk to leave Mill Ave. This pizza place gets an extra star for dealing with the throngs of drunken fools that bum rush this place after 2am on the weekends.
