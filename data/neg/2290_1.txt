Let me start by saying what great customer service they have. All employees seem to enjoy serving you with a smile.Everything is so fresh and good. My favorites are there grilled chicken salad w\/blueberry vinegarette and their fresh zucchini fries w\/ sweet surrachi dipping sauce. Glad there's a healthy alternative for quick delicious food close by:-)
