This was the first place I ate in Vegas.\nYou can walk to it, it's close to NY, NY.\nFirst, it was hot outside so... they had the door open...\nThen you had to wait in line and choose a make your own pizza or speciality Pizza. I chose the Zucca with squash, rosemary, onion and bacon.\nEverything was made well and it had fresh ingredients but this pizza really didn't have much flavor it was salty, greasy and tasted like rosemary.\nI don't know what the other stuff tasted like but I would like to try pizza at other places.
