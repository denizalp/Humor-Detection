This is the place I tell people to come for authentic Wisconsin food that doesn't pride itself on deep fried food.\n\nHighly recommend it, very cool atmosphere in an old farm house. Good wait staff, great menu. I suggest you try something out of your comfort zone, there is no wrong choice. You'll be Happy you tried something new.\n\nDrink are great, of course you can't go wrong with a brandy old fashion.
