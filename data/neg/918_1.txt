Wonderful service! We have been using them for about 6 months now and absolutely love their work. They pick up and drop off at my office so it is very convenient. Wonderful packaging and they even stuff the sleeves of my dresses to keep them wrinkle free. We used a cheaper dry cleaner before, but the clothes would come back damaged, wrinkled and sometimes even smelling vaguely dirty? Using Elite is a 180 degree from that one! A little pricier, but you get what you pay for and BOY is it worth it!\n\nWay to go! :-)
