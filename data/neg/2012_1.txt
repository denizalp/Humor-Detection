I drive this location everyday heading to and from work. Today I stopped by.. my son and I walked to a super nice super clean McDonald's. This visit was my first using the kiosk. I will say they are very user friendly. I was able to navigate quickly through the menu. While I was ordering the cashier took the time and went out of her way to give my son a toy. Super appreciative of that!!! The staff as a whole are friendly!! I recommend the kiosk experience if you haven't tried it! \nThank guys!!
