The line to get in went around the corner and it took about 40 minutes before we were seated at a table.  I have to say, besides the snow crab and the other limited seafood, I was disappointed.  Since I don't eat red meat, the other choices just weren't as good as I had expected.  I ended up eating lots of veggies and a couple of asian dishes that were okay.  The dessert and fruit selections were impressive however.  The service was very good and attentive.  I've definitely been to better buffets that were also a lot cheaper.
