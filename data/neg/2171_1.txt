Found this shop via yelp while in the area running errands.  I walked in looking for some e juice, was welcomed to sit and sample from a wide variety of juices on hand.  I was pressed for time and asked for something sweet and the guy (I'm horrible with names) suggested \"Summer Wapple\". I believe it's one of their \"Da Val\" in house blends.  He even mixed a bottle for me right there, smelled delicious like some kind of watermelon candy...I can't put my vape pen down today it's so good!  \nFriendly service, tasty juice.  Will be back.
