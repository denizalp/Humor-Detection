A pretty solid hole in the wall pizza place. I've tried their pepperoni and meatball slices and can say with certainty that it is delicious. Their ranch is also pretty top  notch. A note, their pizza is a little on the greasy side, which gives it that deliciousness that makes me want to keep coming back.
