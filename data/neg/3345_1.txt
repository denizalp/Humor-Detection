The pizza at this place is amazing! Great service, desserts are sinfully delicious (fried dough OMG). Great Greek salad, little pricey but good. Chicken parm was overdone but pretty good. Will definitely eat here again.\n\n\nEdit! Service from the \"manager\" not so great. The pizza is to die for though. I wish they had a place in the Bay Area.
