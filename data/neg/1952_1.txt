I rarely come across a disappointing Bookman's experience, and this is one of the two in Phoenix I made a point of visiting when I visit from Tucson. Good selection, some antiques, and very busy. Great area with electronics\/games. Great place to spend some time and fun for kids and teens! too! The children's room is very fun for youngsters.
