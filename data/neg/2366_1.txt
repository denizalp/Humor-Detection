Ordered an order of fish and chips, soft shell crab sandwich and crab fries. Everything came in a paper take out box despite eating in, which was very awkward  to eat. The crab fries were okay but everything else was weirdly undercooked. We were really excited to try this but it was horribly overpriced and inedible. I hope they work out their issues.
