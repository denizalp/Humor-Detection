*NOTE: CASH ONLY*\n\nCame here this week for lunch and had to question why I don't come by more often! Juicy burgers and awesome fries. I had the Salisbury burger (mushrooms, sautéed onions + gravy) this visit - probably my favourite from the menu. \n\nCustomer service is great - I think I've seen the owner every time I've visited and he's very friendly. \n\n25% off a combo with your first Yelp check-in is a pretty sweet deal!\n\nWould love to see a couple more speciality toppings (e.g. goat cheese, jalapeños).
