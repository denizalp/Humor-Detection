Burnt almond torte deserves the title of best cake in America. Delicious. Very busy bakery. Came in to pick up an order while I was in town, long wait but to be expected as they do have the best cake in America. Pecan tassies are also delicious. Online ordering is very easy and convenient for easy pick up.
