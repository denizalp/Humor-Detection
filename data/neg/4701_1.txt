This is the best FREE show on the strip. I have been to Vegas many times and I never miss the chance to see the show at the Bellagio Fountains!\nIt is always different. Each time you see it you hear a new song and are entertained by a different show.\nI think the shows run about every half an hour, starting at 3 pm and going until midnight.\nYes, it is just dancing water, but it is always a dazzling performance that never disappoints!
