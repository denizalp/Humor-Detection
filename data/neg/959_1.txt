Scott was very informative and knowledgeable about air conditioning and heating system. He treated me as an educator, and was very thorough and complete. I appreciate the time he took to explain how my system worked, and took detailed photographs to explain further issues. Very trustworthy and honest. I would highly recommend Scott as a service technician. He demonstrates honesty and integrity, and I trust his judgments.
