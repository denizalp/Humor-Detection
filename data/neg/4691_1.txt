Really good broth, and I'm giving it 5 stars because it is the best I've found in Madison. I tried the classic pork belly ramen - would have liked it hotter in temperature - but it was still  delicious. Velvety pork, chirashi egg and ramen with just the right amount of push against the teeth. \n\nI plan on going back for the other ramens and will update this after, but still a firm recommend if looking for a place to eat downtown or if ramen committed.
