I came on November 3,2017 for a mammogram.  I came in to get a copy of the report on the 13th and they have not read the film. What the hell.  Every time I'm come here it's bullshit.  Ten days and they haven't read it. I will never come here again  I've breast biopsy's and with clusters of calcification and the film just sitting there.
