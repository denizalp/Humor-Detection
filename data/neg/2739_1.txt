Used to like the place. The food was decent. But.....we were just there and Becky was yelling and screaming at the top of her lungs at one of the employees in the kitchen. . It went on so long (about 15 minutes) that I had to tell the waitress to tell her we could hear her out front. Never again. We won't be back.
