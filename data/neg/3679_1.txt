This place is so good that we ate here thrice (on a weekend trip!). The chicken is just out of this world. And the drinks are great as well. Everything on the menu we tried was great, but the absolute recommended dish is Mama's Chicken Biscuits- a must try. Simple, but amazing. Also enjoyed the Yardbird Benedict off their Brunch menu, if you're there early.
