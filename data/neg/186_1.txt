Our friends recommended Arizona Frybread to us and it was really good. We got the FB#1 special with four different mini fry breads. Their green chili is really good. It was a little to spicy for my husband but I didn't think it was bad at all. The horchata and the melon peach fresca were delicious! Then we had to get dessert so we opted for the sampler. The fry bread covered in cinnamon and sugar was my favorite (kind of like a churro). The place was very clean and the service was very good.
