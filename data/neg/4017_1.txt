The outdoor patio was a great place to catch up with friends. A Watermelon Honey Margarita and an order a Yucatan-style pork tacos made it perfect! If you like a little spice, be sure to ask for the salsa verde! Next time I'll come with more people or a bigger appetite so we can try the taco flight- 15 assorted tacos!
