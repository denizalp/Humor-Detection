First time getting a mammogram. I came because of the reviews on Yelp. Glad I did! Initial scheduling over the phone was good, polite and quick. Receptionist was friendly and took my info, had me fill out my paperwork. I was called back within minutes. Tech was friendly but not overly (purposeful I'm sure because as soon as she saw I was relaxed she mirrored my behavior). Quick and I was outta there.
