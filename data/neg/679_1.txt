For being open for such a short amount of time I would have to say I am impressed with this place! Exactly what the neighborhood needed. The beer selection is extensive and there is something for everyone. The food is amazing, I recommend the tossed tots they were delicious! Also there are so many tvs and the staff is so helpful with putting whatever game you want to watch on whatever tv you would like. The servers are attentive and super friendly. Will definitely be back!
