I wish they would come East!  The secret isn't a secret, other fast food just ignores​ the obvious.  Fresh ingredients make a ​better product.  Bun, lettuce, tomato, and onion all fresh and delicious.  Fries fresh​ cut.  It just makes everything​​ good.  Great burger and fries period.  Cheapest meal on the strip we had.  $9.69 w\/ tax.  Two cheeseburgers​, one french fries​, and two glasses of water​.
