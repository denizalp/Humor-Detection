Called in and had them come out to service our walkin cooler. They came out right away, which was great. Asked how much it would cost before he started the technician said $375. After he fixed it he told us that the total is $550. We paid the invoice. Called their customer service and she basically said she couldn't do anything and that was it. Would not recommend anyone to use this company.
