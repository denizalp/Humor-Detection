Ordered Fuku Burger and Fuku Moco; unfortunately both patties were over cooked :( not juicy at all and there was no flavor :(\nThe gravy was delicious however and the burger itself tasted okay also; it would've been much better with a juicy meat for sure...\n\nFries..... Tasted like a frozen product... Lol\nDidn't taste of the garlic either :(\n\nNot worth the $13.50 for a combo at all but I will give them another chance later and see if tonight was just one of their bad nights...
