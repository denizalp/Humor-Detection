Worst ER ever, I have been here for 3 hours, and still haven't  seen a doctor. They had a girl od ing in the bathroom. It's insane.  They keep ignoring  me because  I  am not crying  and  screaming,  I feel so helpless.  I just want to speak with a doctor.\n\n\nThe only  great  person  here is Melissa the main chart nurse,  she is a rock star. \nI would  give her all 5 stars, she tries  to  get us seen.
