This place doesn't even deserve a single star. Long wait everytime. Bad service everytime. Kitchen closes at 10PM. This place is only useful for shaved ice and its only special because shaved ice isnt available everywhere. Still not worth the wait or bad service. Cha Me Cha is by far the worst dessert place I have been.\nService: 1\/5\nFood: 3\/5\nPrice: Average
