The food here is great and it's a place I frequently visit. The staff can occasionally have an attitude and act rude but I always take the food to go. It usually doesn't take too long to get your order. All in all its great food at a fair price and I would highly recommend giving it a try. \n\nUPDATE\n\nThe prices have gone up and they cut a few corners. Very unimpressed. I will return but I won't be running there any time soon.
