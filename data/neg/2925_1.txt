First time in to this location and it was amazing! The drive through went super quick, even though there were a few people ahead of me, and when I added to my order and asked for extra red sauce, the girl was super friendly. I will definitely be back! I was soooooo happy when I saw Federico's and am even happier it's a great location as far as service, cleanliness, and tastiness.
