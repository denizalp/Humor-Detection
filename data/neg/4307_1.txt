Pleasantly pleased with the layout and crowd at Kelly's during the weekends.  Have mostly been for drinks an people watching.  The huge wrap around bar makes for a great spread and the bartenders have a steady hand.\n\nHave only eaten there once, but wow the apps were great.  Make sure to give them a go...Fingerling Potatoes, Ahi Tuna Tartare, Roasted Brussel Sprouts,  and the BBQ Short Rib Sandwich.\n\nKelly's steps up the Scottsdale atmosphere all at a great price point.
