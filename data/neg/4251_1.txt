I looked all around Charlotte to find my new hair salon after I moved from out of state and love Carmel Day Spa. It's a house turned into salon so it feels cozy and comfortable. Erin Scrudato does my hair and she is AWESOME!!!! She is the only person that I've been too who actually listens to what I want and understands what I mean. She colors my hair so well that people thought it was my natural color!!
