Was good meat tasted old or something in certain spots.first time here so did not expect the pickled onions to be sour might be good with a little sugar in them.My daughter raves about the food truck says food taste much better than this one.but not totally horrible I took onions off and the crack sauce is great on the fries but I did not taste much garlic witch is ok for me...
