Fantastic restaurant...one of the best meals I've had. We went before catching the 9:30 Ka show. Great service, friendly waitstaff, quick, simple but elegant atmosphere, and good food. The cheddar bread is delicious. I ordered the mussels, which was a heaping (at least 1.5 lbs) in a creamy, spicy red broth, with bread and homecut French fries...perfectly crisped. Everything tasted so fresh. My sister got goat cheese and spring pea manicotti. Waitstaff was very attentive, bringing heated washclothes at the end of the meal. Highly recommended.
