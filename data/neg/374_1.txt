I come to this Resturant very time I am in Vegas I cannot explain exactly what it is about their food that appeals to me other than it is absolutely delicious. \n\nThis place is sort of a cafeteria style place off to the side of the sports betting area of the Venetian casino. \n\nThe beef lo mien and the egg flower soup are by far the best meal there I recommend all my family and friends to try this place every time they are in Vegas.
