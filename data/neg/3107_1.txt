Its a local bar for sure. Only shock top and bud light on draft. They do have bottles of other stuff but you can drink bottles at home. I've had the patty melt and cheeseburger and both were exceptional. they don't give you enough fries with your burger. The daily specials are pretty good. Nice service and friendly people. Definitely 90% locals in there.
