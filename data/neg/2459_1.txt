Great neighbourhood stop. The owner is really friendly and caters to what you need and always remembers you when you come in. It's fantastic, I live a little past this place and will go out of my way to pick up my deli meat and cheese. They also sell great pies and baked goods that are nice and fresh. Amazing selection of sauces and condiments. Love love love!
