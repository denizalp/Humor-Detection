Michael and his team provided all of the flowers for our wedding and did a spectacular job. First of all, planning was fun and easy. He makes you feel like an expert (even when you're not!). I was amazed by how cost efficient he was as well, which had been a concern of ours. More importantly, though, our flowers could not have been more stunning. The bouquets, the corsage, the boutonnieres, the cake topper and the church display were all absolutely beautiful and I'm so glad they'll live forever in our pictures. Work with Michael!
