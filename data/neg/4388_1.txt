I like the Lakewood joint, but have had three (how stupid of me) meals at Avon's Rush Inn. \nMy short review is \"Don't\"Rush In\nProblems with poorly prepared hamburgers (Hamburgers, for god's sake!) and over cooked\/burnt turkey burgers. Even the salads don't get up to the \"so-so\" level.\n It may be this place is not a lunch spot (which is when I'm in the area.)...Servers seemed unconcerned or disconnected, hard (HARD) Acid rock blaring and a total of 3 tables occupied in the joint during my entire stay.  I won't be back.
