Ate there on Friday night 8\/24.  The service was outstanding, ambiance amazing and the food was incredible.  We had the cod and chicken adobo.  Excellent choices.  The wait staff catered to every wish and I highly recommend this restaurant.  I would say this is better than Nobu where the chef came from.  Go here for dinner.  You won't be disappointed.
