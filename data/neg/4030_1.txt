My sandwich was fantastic, but I found the service was a little slow. \n\nAlso, if you're seated in the middle and it's cold outside (like we were), every time the door opens you will feel like an arctic blast washing over you. They wouldn't move us to an empty table away from the door, because it was apparently reserved. Although it appeared to us that the table in question was later occupied by walk-in customers.\n\nAgain, the food was very good. I think the prices are a little high, but that's what you get in this location.
