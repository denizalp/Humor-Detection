Descriptive phrase: comfortable coffee hangout and shop.\n\nCoffee shops can be \"too coffee shop\" sometimes, trying to be hip and working too hard. I think Barriques does pretty well at avoiding pretentiousness. This Monroe location features locals ranging from college kids studying to older couples reading books to young families playing board games. In the back they have a varied and respectable wine\/booze selection for sale, as well as a tasting bar for visiting vendors. Their small snacks and coffee is standard, but the atmosphere and friendliness of barristas makes the space a great stop for a chill night out.
