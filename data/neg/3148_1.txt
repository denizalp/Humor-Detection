Let me just say the pizza here is DELICIOUS. You have to pay for each additional topping so it might add up but it's not too bad pricing. The inside is nice and there's outdoor seating too. It was really loud with like a million kids when I went which was kind of annoying but the pizza's bomb. Definitely check it out!\n\nBTW it's free BYOB cause they don't sell beer anymore. There's a liquor store two doors down though if it's a must.
