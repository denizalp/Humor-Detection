The basil kai dao is my favorite. We've eaten in and done takeout a few times and the service is always fast. The servers are nice and the food is delicious. The chicken lettuce wraps are also delicious. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area. Wish they didn't use styrofoam takeout containers, but that's a personal preference.
