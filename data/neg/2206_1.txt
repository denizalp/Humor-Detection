Bought a fish from this excuse for a shop to get my fish a buddy to swim about with. What the owners\/manager did not bother telling me\/care about was that the fish was diseased. Added the fish to my tank, and within a day and a half both, it and my pet that I had been taking care of for more than a year died.\n\nNever going to this place again. Ever.
