The food was good. Mimosas were tasty. The price is tad high, but that's what you get when you eat at the MGM Grand Hotel. We went for breakfast and there wasn't much of a selection. The one thing that was nice was The chef making eggs to order. He was excellent. If you're going to grab a dessert, try the mango passion yogurt mousse. The only thing worth tasting. The other desserts sucked.
