I went here craving pho, and wanted something closer to home than my normal spot. This was a great choice as the pho broth was delicious and flavorful. They have everything you need on the table and they still check on you often. While the pho was amazing, the Thai tea impressed me. Perfect creaminess along with the flavor of Thai tea. Check out was easy because you don't even need to calculate a tip, they have it there for you when you slide your card.
