I had a wonderful experience at this dealership. Although I didn't end up buying their car, I felt that the salespeople were courteous, kind, and most importantly honest. Aft explaining a frustrating experience at another Mazda dealership in town, they were very up front and candid with me. Honestly, I would have bought their car; the only reason I didn't was that I preferred another more.
