i also hasve been a client for several years and attend the clinic in Peoria.  They have certainly gone down hill.  Everyone tells you something different, they fill your meds wrong, there is no product.  What else can I say.  And I can see from reading other revues that this appears to be the norm.  I hope the docs read these revues and try to change things or I will also go elsewhere.\n\nSS
