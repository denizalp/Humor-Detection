I am not impressed at all with this place. My friend an I made an appointment and they made her wait an additional 20 min. They rushed when painting my nails and then messed up my flower but didn't bother to fix it. They also made my friend bleed when doing her finger nails. I am so mad that I had to pay what I had to pay.
