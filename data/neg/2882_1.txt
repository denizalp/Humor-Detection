I thought it would be cool to go here since this is the location of the very first Cold Stone Creamery. A plaque on the wall confirmed that this was store #1 but other than that it was unremarkable. The Cold Stone closer to my house is bigger and cleaner with a nicer outdoor seating area so I'll stick with that location. Store #1 still has the same great ice cream, though, and very friendly employees!
