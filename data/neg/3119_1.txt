Trying to arrange for a tow out of state was getting frustrating. After dealing with rude people on the phone & reading some scary reviews our mechanic referred us to Shaun's. Both Shaun & Cory were very courteous & respectable on the phone and worked to get our sons car off the side of the highway quickly, charging a  dry reasonable rate. I will definitely refer anyone needing a tow in the Las Vegas area to them!
