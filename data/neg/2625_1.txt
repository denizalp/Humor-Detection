They are all the same.  But I am impressed that this store is fast and efficient with serving.  There is not much seating in the place since it shares a seating area with Chipotle and a pizza joint, so I would recommend preparing to get your food to go.\n\n3 stars because I asked for more orange chicken than fried rice and he told me \"No\". Really????
