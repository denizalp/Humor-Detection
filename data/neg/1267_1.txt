I came here with family as I'm visiting from San Diego. It was so much fun! They have a great beer and wine selection. The food was delicious!! There was a man playing guitar on the patio. The building was awesome, very pretty. It was cool to have an inside\/outside bar. Our waitress was very fun, and made sure we had everything we needed.
