Bought a certified used 2017 Chevrolet Camaro a month ago and literally 2 weeks after scraped the curb coming out of a driveway. I was freaking out cuz I thought I would have to pay for a whole new rim, over $800 for one ! My dealership referred me to hub cap Annie and saved me hundreds of dollars just by buffing and painting!! They are amazing !
