Decided to check this place out, since it's close by RAW Fitness and Portion Control, which I go to regularly.   After standing directly in front of Reception and waiting patiently for no less than 10 minutes, I walked out.    Two other guests in front of me received full on attention.    I was not even acknowledged with a greeting.   I did not have an appt, but the door stated they take walk ins.    Disappointing.
