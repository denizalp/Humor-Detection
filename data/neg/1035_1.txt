Good selection of candy and slushies, probably every drink ever invented is also here. Of course its not perfect, some of their stuff is a bit more than select foods and such, but some stuff is priced better. Anyway I enjoy coming here and buying a few stuff, candies, phone cards, etc. However sometimes their slushy flavours are terrible, so just remember that mango passionfruit etc will taste more like \"fruit and sugar\" flavour. The kool-aid slushies are fine though.
