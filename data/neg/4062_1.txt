Top notch service.\n\nI found this company because they were cleaning the carpets of the home we had just purchased.   While he was there I scheduled an appointment for him to do the home we were moving out of.\n\nHe was 2 for 2.  He called to confirm appointment, was friendly and courteous, price is competitive, showed up on time, and the carpets looked amazing.  He did this circular pattern with the cleaner that made the carpets look better than they ever had before.   \n\nSimply the best carpet cleaner I ever used.
