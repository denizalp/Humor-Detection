Service was pretty bad at this restaurant even with the iPad ordering. We only had a table of 2 so I don't know what the heck was wrong with them. Half of our first order came after 30 minutes, the other half was lost. Our first order miso soup didn't come until an HOUR after. The food was mediocre at best and just wasn't worth it for the price. The desserts were unique and good though.
