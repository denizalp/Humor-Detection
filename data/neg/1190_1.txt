Purchased a bag of 50 pork & leek dumplings for $13.75 (A bag of 30 costs $8.75). The wrappers on these dumplings are thick but it's necessary to hold in all the filling. They definitely did not skimp on the pork and leek. Probably the most jam-packed dumplings I've ever had. Will definitely come back to get more dumplings.
