A bit pricey, but I liked the food.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have is there is no price on the menus for the ice cream.  Spoiler alert: it's $5.50 a scoop!  Granted, it was a large scoop, but still, that's a lot of green for some cream.\n\nI also had the veggie goat cheese pizza, it was pretty good.  The crust was thin and a little soft in the middle (a bit like me), but the toppings had a good flavor.
