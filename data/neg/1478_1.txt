Had a fabulous lunch at The Thumb today.  The food was great (as always), atmosphere was awesome...the new fish tank was a hit for my 2 and 4 year olds.  Highly recommend this place for any meal and bring the family.  It's the only place that we regularly take our kids b\/c they love seeing all the cool things for sale.  And most importantly...the staff are great: friendly and super helpful.  Kudos to the GM Mike for making this place a big success.
