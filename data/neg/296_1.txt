I've been here a few times over the last week or so, and the daily choices for drip coffee have been fantastic. I love the variety, and each kind has been full of flavor. I've had a few of the pastries as well, which weren't really anything special, but that's okay; I personally come just to seek my morning coffee, and am more than pleased.
