I love Archi's \n\nI highly recommend the seafood pancake! I don't think they list this on their menu... I'm not sure why but I heard about it from my mom and it is amazing! \n\nDon't leave without having the sticky rice and coconut ice cream either ^.^ \n\nOnly down side... the service was slow. It was busy so I know it can get crazy trying to take care of all the tables but we didn't get a single refill and tried to flag the waitress down like three times before we were able to get her attention.
