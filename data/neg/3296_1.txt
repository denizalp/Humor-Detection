I love love LOVE taps! This place is full of amazing staff, and the owners are awesome!! I've started coming here regularly after work for the past 4months and every time the experience is always the same; warm, friendly, and loads of fun. They have new affordable specials\/drinks and entertainment for everyday of the week with a great crowd every time! I definitely recommend this place for any day of the week :)
