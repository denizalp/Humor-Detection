I saw chocolate so I found myself here on my way to another place. Got the dark chocolate with a praline centre and hazelnut on top because it was the lady's favourite. Pretty mediocre. I wasn't impressed but based on the amount of Christmas orders she had to fill--stock pouring out all over the floor--I'm sure others would disagree with me. She seems pretty popular. The chocolate I tried didn't do it for me but perhaps another one might. Definitely worth a try.
