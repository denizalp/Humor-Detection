The wait staff is lovely.  I wish the same could be said for breakfast.  We only went to this, and then because it was free.  I would not encourage anyone to pay for it.  We always joke... Who can screw up eggs?  TI, that's who.  Runny wet scrambled eggs two mornings in a row.  On a good note, the zucchini bread was yummy.  Fruit was good.  Hot things... Not so much.
