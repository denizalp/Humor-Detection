This is a wonderful place to strive for goals !!  I give Independence Gym 5 stars due to the high energy POSITIVE atmosphere .!!  Perfection is an impossible standard, but the persistent effort to improve allows for the closest imaginable comprehension to what perfection would be like in this physical life.  I am glad to be a member of the Independence Gym Family.
