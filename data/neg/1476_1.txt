Service around 7 on a slow Saturday night.   Got wings boneless with mild and buffalo chips. Wings were great I got cheese on chips and that was not as good.\n\nService was not great. Server was very pleasant but had to ask for serve ware and never got beverage refills. \n\nChoose carry out if you can.
