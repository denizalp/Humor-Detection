Went here on the weekend for lunch and food\/service was fantastic! Had never been to an AYCE sushi place before, was pleasantly surprised! Everything was super fresh and the service was very prompt. Definitely a great deal for $17.99\/person. The amount I ate would have cost $30+ at the normal rates. Will be recommending to all my friends and family!
