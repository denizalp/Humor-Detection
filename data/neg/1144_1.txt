Horrible! Had to sit in the bar area and my husband is hearing impaired (too much noise). Salads came quickly and were good, but the eggplant arrived and it was barely warm. Waitress disappeared, never filled the water glasses. Just to get over the new Oakmont bridge it took 30 minutes. My advise, stay out of Oakmont until the bridge is completely open. This place could possible be good if you get a seat in the dining area, otherwise avoid it entirely. Don't think owners care because it looks like a \"gold mine\", so anything else is \"so what\".
