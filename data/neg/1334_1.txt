Jenny Brown was so awesome! I don't love to pay massive amounts of money to get my hair cut and colored, so coming here was perfect! My stylist, Jenny, knew exactly what she was doing and I am so happy with the results! Plus, she is so nice and easy to talk to, so it's not all awkward and quiet for the whole time you are getting your hair done! I will definitely be going back.. :)
