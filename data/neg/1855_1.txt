I pay 100$+ for Internet every month.  And this company just fails in every single way possible.  Bad connection, bad service, bad maintenance, lazy technicians, terrible phone assistance, horrible AUTO PAY.   YES. THEY ARE EVEN BAD AT TAKING YOUR MONEY CORRECTLY OR EASILY. \n\nI hate Cox with everything inside of me. And they have a basic monopoly on Internet in Phoenix.  \n\nCox. Please go out of business and die.
