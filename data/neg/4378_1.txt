We were frequent Sammys customers when they were in Centennial hills and loved it.  We went to Sammys on Flamingo we ordered the Humus w\/flat bread, coconut shrimp and the chopped chicken salad.  It took forever to get our small salad we kept asking where is the salad coming from the waiter kept telling us it coming.  Well  it's coming took almost 20 minutes to 1\/2 hr,  in the mean time we had our shrimp and humus.  We wanted everything together but it never happened.  Don't think we will be back.
