This year is the first time my wife and I have made it to the State Fair...shame on us for taking 7 yrs to get to this.  WE HAD A BLAST!  It was somewhat smaller than I was expecting, really didn't know what to expect I guess.  Overpriced food and drinks, tons of freaks to look at and a lot of fun things to do...IT WAS GREAT.  There was a llama in the petting zoo that thought my wife was his best friend!
