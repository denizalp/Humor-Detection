I read the reviews on Yelp about Biaggio's and decided to try it. The owner waited on me. While I was waiting for my Stromboli to come up, he generously gave me a slice of cheese pizza and a coke.  I found this highly unexpected, and very kind. He had me with his generosity, but after trying the meatball Stromboli, he really had me. The Stomboli was incredible!!! I can hardly wait to try some of the other items that people are recommending here.
