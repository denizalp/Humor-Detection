Shoubu Sushi has now been sold to new owners who have unfortunately cheapened the experience.  Most of the dishes that made Shoubu a standout restaurant are now gone.  The individual sushi pieces have been made significantly smaller while the prices have remained the same.  There is also a new chef whose skills leave a lot to be desired (some sushi pieces are mis-formed, others are missing key ingredients (like salmon in the spicy salmon roll).  I would not recommend returning to this restaurant.
