The worst customer service I have ever encountered. My husband and I went to this store in Feb 14 to buy a jacket for my daughters ceremony(eloping to Vegas) and the man who helped them was completely rude! Totally talked down to me and said awful things. I started crying when we left because  it was so bad. We cancelled all our suits for ten groomsmen. Never again. We'll take our business elsewhere.
