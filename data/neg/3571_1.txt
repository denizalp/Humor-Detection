This is the first review I've ever written about anything. This is the motherf'ing place. Nobody messes around. I suggest eating the candy by hostess's before being seated and on your way out the door. Everyone was on top of their shiz. EVERYTHING tasted delicious, the fajitas were incomparable, the French fries were even the best French fries I've ever had. Everything was quality and delicious. 11\/10. Went there yesterday with my dad;) for the first time, going there tonight for the second time.
