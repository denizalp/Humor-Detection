I love this women's only Goodlife location. The equipment is generally well cared for and organized. They also have a few massage chairs and a couple Gravity machines. It's a small space, but patrons and trainers tend to be more polite than the larger GoodLife locations. There are a lot of stairs in and around the gym, but it's a solid bet for me!
