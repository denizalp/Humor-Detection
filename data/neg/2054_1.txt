They have a big store. Apparently this is a Canadian department store although I couldn't really tell that from the street. Once I got in there it was pretty apparent. They have tons of shoes there. I was looking for boots. Although I didn't find any, the lady who helped me was pretty helpful, though not too friendly. But I always love shopping and their prices seem pretty on par with other places.
