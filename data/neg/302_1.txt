The cookie beurreo is fantastic... But let's talk important stuff: les boules Ã  beurre! These italian specialties, which are called nonna maria at this place, are amazing! My mother in law makes me these all the time when she visits from Italy and these are just as good as hers... Now that's a compliment!!\nI am so happy that this place exists in Montreal and that they were able to turn a delicious italian rustic dessert like pesce (their italian name) into something trendy! Bravo!!!
