Stay away from this place..They will ripped you off...I was in Vegas the weekend of August 10-13...I actually rented a car the 11-13..Took the keys home by accident, I immediately went to Fedex and shipped the keys back to the Vegas office, I also screenshot a receipt to Pedro Reyes and said he received and thanks...Yesterday, I checked my account and $330 was taken out of my account without any notice or any phone messages..I'm fighting them to get my money back...Pay the extra money and go to Hertz or Enterprise..This company is full of crooks!!!!
