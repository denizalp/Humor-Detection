What a great place. A working farm offering home grown food breakfast was so fresh they offer lunch and dinner too. Because I am an event florist and stylist in Sam Diego I have to give them a high five for the venue you can say I do here it would be a beautiful backdrop to your wedding and reception in the cooler months .
