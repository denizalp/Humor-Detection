Great place! We were able to get in before the crowd on a Sunday morning and had our choice of tables. The staff was very friendly and the food came in just a few minutes. \n\nWe ordered two crepes and both were fantastic!\nBristol - Smoked turkey, goat cheese, avocado and bechamel sauce. YUM!\nHam and Swiss Cheese - Ham, Swiss cheese and honey aioli. Also YUM!\n\nI had a hot tea and my friend tried the coffee - both good options! I definitely recommend heading there for brunch when in Shadyside!
