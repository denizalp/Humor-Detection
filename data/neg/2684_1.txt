Love this place! I go out of my way to eat lunch here. I'm not big on sandwich shops but everything here is so good. The menu items are relatively basic stuff but somehow they make it taste great. The breakfast burritos are really good also. I love the soup, sandwiches, cookies...it's all good! The owners and staff are delightful.
