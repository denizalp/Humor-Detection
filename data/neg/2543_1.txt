Bought a Lifeproof case for my I Phone at the Yorkdale apple store\n\nBecause the case is so big I am unable to use accessories and I need an adapter\n\nI was told to go on the internet to get an adapter but I told them I got the case at your store\n\nThey don't care\n\nI had to order one from the states  $ 15 plus $ 15 for shipping
