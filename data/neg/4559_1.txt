Bunch of buttheads here.  Was thrilled to find a Broncos bar but devastated with the attitudes.  House liquor is turpentine and never got offered a menu so I can't review the food.  I think the bartender was fired from the bar next door.  I remember him.  Strange vibe in the place....sort of a dive bar feel and the other customers were not friendly or fun.  3rd try here, we're done.
