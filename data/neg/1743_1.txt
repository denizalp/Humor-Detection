Wish I would've checked yelp first. We were shopping at Tanger outlets and wanted a sit down lunch so came here. They were completely empty, yet our server was nowhere to be found through our meal. We ordered things that never arrived, never got refills, food was mediocre, and had to wait to pay our check because our server was missing again. Don't go.
