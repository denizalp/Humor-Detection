We had an excellent experience shooting at he range today with our safety officer, Chase. He was knowledgable, friendly, and very educated. The whole experience was very fun for the entire group and we are looking forward to returning! We definitely did not share the same experience as some of these others with negative reviews and I would suggest trying this place out yourself and forming your own opinion.
