This is where all of the Beautiful People shop. Literally. Wow. Forget singles bars and dating services, who needs them. I go here for the food just like I only read the articles in Playboy. Yea right.\nTo me, buying Whole Foods in house brand, 365, is the way to go. It offers a good quality produce at a reasonable price. The Seafoods are way overpriced, while the same stuff can be purchased in China Town for half. But this location has great parking and is across the street from Green Valley Ranch. Bonus, huh...
