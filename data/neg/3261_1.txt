Awesome promo!! \n\nThe bread so sooo good I can't wait to be back to have other flavours. This time I had the chocolate and the matcha red bean! \n\nI like their fruit tea selection. I had their house special fruit tea and it was different from other. I did wish their had more passion fruit flavour though. Maybe I will find my fav from their selection.
