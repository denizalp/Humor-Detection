We contracted with them for roofing and gutter replacement back in the beginning of March. There were a number of hiccups and difficulties along the way including some poor communication, but, the work was completed today and they made sure that things were right by us. \n\nI won't go into details about the issues, but, they have promised us to get better about their communication and have made corrective actions for their future business and have worked incredibly hard to make sure that they left with a satisfied customer.
