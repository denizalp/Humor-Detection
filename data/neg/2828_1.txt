I've eaten at Hot Taco three times. Overall, I think they should have put as much time creating a good menu as they did decorating the place. Great decor, mediocre food. Considering they own so many restaurants and have a place across the street from Taco Boy (Folly Beach) I'm surprised they missed the boat on this one. Then again, since they are next to All-American and Oak Room, they can get away with mediocre food and they know that.
