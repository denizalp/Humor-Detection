I'm going to miss living here. I loved the location, the pools and the fitness center especially. I had a non-renovated apartment which I thought would be a let down. It was the opposite. The apartment I had was exactly what I needed and I loved every second. Minus a few AC issues during 120 degree temps which are extreme conditions, I had zero complaints living there. I loved the staff, they were a pleasure to deal with. I wish I wasn't moving out of state.
