I went to CycleSouth for the first time this morning with two friends. This class was one of the best classes I've taken. Not only did we work up a serious sweat, we thoroughly enjoyed our time cycling to the beat of the music.  The instructor, Anthony, made the class so much fun by bringing his enthusiasm and energy. I have tried many fitness classes, and Anthony was by far the best instructor. My friends and I can't wait to go back!
