Saturday night, so there was a wait.  Service at the bar was great.  Bar tenders we're friendly and fast.\nOnce we were seated, our drink food order was quickly taken and the salad came soon afterwards.\nUnfortunately, the entre didn't drive for another 40 minutes. That is the only reason they didn't get 5 stars.\nThe food was excellent.  Well prepared and presented.\nWe will return.
