We recently enjoyed numerous shows of the Bellagio Fountains. I found myself fixated and starring at one detail then my eyes and mind came back on-line and began wandering the enormous Foundation Lake and the ever changing spouts of water. \n\nThe computerized show, corrioqgraghed to music is completely fascinating for people of all ages. We never saw or heard the same show twice.  Besides how many things can you see in Vegas, over and over, FOR FREE?!
