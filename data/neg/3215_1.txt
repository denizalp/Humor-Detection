We heard of this place on yelp and decided to try it. The place is very pretty, the service is excellecent and the food is just phenomenal. One dish came out a bit burnt and they reqdily remade it for us at no extra charge. The biryani is really good.\n\nThe owner and the chef make a point of coning out to talk to you.....overall a great ambiance.\n\nThe menu is very diverse and lots to choose from for both veggies and non-veggies.\n\nKids get crayons and drawing paper....which is always such a bonus since it keeps them occupied! Overall....terrific experience.
