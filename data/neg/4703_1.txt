A mediocre pizza, also don't rely on delivery.  It arrived almost an hour and a half after I ordered it.  I think if I would have ordered it there this pizza would have been a lot better and with a $5 delivery charge that made the pizza $21 for their all meat and that didn't count taxes or tipping the driver.  For that price I would much rather just do carryout from Biaggios.  Way better pizza and even if I wanted delivery from them I know I could count on faster and better service.
