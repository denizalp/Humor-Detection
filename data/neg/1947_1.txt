I love this place! The carne asada tacos and pastor tacos are delicious! My friend had the shrimp tacos and she looooved them. Honestly I come here often and it is my go to place for tacos because they taste pretty authentic, they're kinda far from me but  I'm here often, that's how good they are! Also you have got to try the jalape√±o avocado sauce they have, it is delicious!!
