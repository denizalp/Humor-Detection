Server was fantastic!!! We decided to share a meal because it was late and the portions are quite large. We had the Morton's salad, Chicken Bianco & Horseradish Mashed Potatoes - yum yum and yum!!! We have been here before for Christmas Parties so have never been able to order what we like so we were excited to try some new stuff and glad to say we were not disappointed. Definitely coming back!
