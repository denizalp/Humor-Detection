So bad! The service was ok, but the food was abominable. We got two appetizers, the sashimi wan-tacos and the lettuce wraps, and the tacos were so bad we sent them back (which I never do). It was like there was chalk in them! The lettuce wraps were ok, but the peanut sauce tasted like they blended skippies with canola oil. Not impressed! If I'm paying $15 for an appetizer it should at least be edible. Guy Fieri should be embarrassed!
