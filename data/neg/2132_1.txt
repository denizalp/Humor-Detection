We've been coming here for years.  From the first visit they've treated us with great service, very friendly.  They have awesome Korean dishes with generous sides.  They recently renovated and expanded the restaurant to hold more patrons.  If you love Korean food, this place is a must.  It's also a family owned business, and they take pride in what they do.  You can tell by the quality of their food.
