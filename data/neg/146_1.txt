Recently the Dr sent me to a specialist. The specialist ask me about the medical history this Dr office sent over. It stated I had a tubal ligation... Well I am an unwed mother who is currently pregnant I've never had my tubes tied. Then trying to get an appointment in the late afternoon is impossible. I am beyond frustrated that I cannot get after work appointment. I'll find another OB even if I am 30 weeks and counting.
