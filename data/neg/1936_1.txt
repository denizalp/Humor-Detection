Had Titan come out for an estimate , it took about 3 weeks for them to come out, we have 3 leaks but, we were interested in having a total roof replacement. After they came out and looked at the roof,  a week later they called to say they didn't want to do the work,  we asked why, they couldn't even give us a reason. Now I understand why their reviews are so bad, lazy company trying to call themselves roofers.
