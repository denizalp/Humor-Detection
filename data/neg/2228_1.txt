I received my Padi Open Water Scuba Dive certification here a couple of weeks ago and the staff there is Awesome! They are all very friendly, helpful, patient and just down right Fun! I got a Great deal on my certification (through Amazon Local) and it included everything with the exception of my own mask, snorkel, fins and boots. They never pressured me to buy from their shop, only offered it as an option. Great Experience and Highly Recommended!
