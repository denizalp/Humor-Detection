Sorry Charlotte, I'm not seeing what the big fuss is about.  Ordered two Tacos and a Burrito.  Taco's were dry, don't get the double corn tortilla, just helped with the dryness.  Burrito was good, nice combo of seasoned meat, rice...................I guess if you're going by and hungry it's worthwhile, but I wouldn't go out of my way..................
