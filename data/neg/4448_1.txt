While my dogs looked and smelled awesome and they did the cuts exactly how I wanted, my yorkie came home with 3 small cuts on her (one on top of each wrist and one on her stomach).  I know she can squirm, but I was not made aware of these injuries and the one on her stomach is obvious! I'm really disappointed because this groomer was close to my house and the staff was wonderful.   Needless to say by omitting that this happened,  I will not return.
