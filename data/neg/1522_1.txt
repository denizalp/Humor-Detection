The size of the place is incredible.\n\n\n The checkouts have 35 aisles!\n\n\n Imagine the biggest UK branches of Currys, PC World, Virgin, Game, Richer Sounds and Maplin Electronics all squashed together over one floor. when you enter they greet you with a map of the store.\n\n\n This is a huge Electrical Superstore that sells absolutely everything in the White goods, Audio visual and Computer range. Awesome!
