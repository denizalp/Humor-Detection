Really good authentic and fresh Chinese food . I like to come for lunch because the food is fresh , good and inexpensive . The portions are big and it comes with tea, egg roll and really good egg drop soup . I took a friend to dragon palace that normally doesn't like Chinese food . He really enjoyed his Kung pao chicken and will be coming back . Great service as well .
