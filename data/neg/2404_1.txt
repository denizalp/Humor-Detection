This vet doesn't care about saving animals,  just to put them to sleep. if you care about your special animal's life DON'T take them to Summeridge animal clinic. I lost my special boy because he was mistakenly brought to this clinic. The vet acted as god deciding Vegas needs to be put to sleep discarding any respect to his life, his story and his history.
