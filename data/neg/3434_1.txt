Great out door patio area with a large tv screen. Trivia on Wednesday nights is fun. Unfortunately I ordered the nachos per my servers recommendation. They looked tasty , but after one bite I could tell the cheese they used was the cheese you get with ballpark nachos. I was extremely disappointed. Would recommend going here to drink, but I do not recommend the food.
