This is a gem. Traditional Japanese food prepared with great care and attention to detail. The vegetable tempura was perfect, and at $5.75 a steal. In fact the prices here, given the quality, are very good. \n\nYes service is sometimes a bit slow but I think this is because they prepare everything when you order it.\n\nOne of the best and most authentic Japanese restaurants in Montreal.\n\n(NB: they no longer serve sushi.)
