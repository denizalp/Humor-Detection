Not what it appears, unfortunately.  I have had business associates state the same about this restaurant.  The hostess and other workers (one in particular, name escapes me) were both unprofessional and as a result I will do my best to steer friends and clients from eating at Cafe Monarch going forward.  It's amazing what word of mouth can do to hurt a reputation.  Maybe management should discuss with staff the importance of a first impression.
