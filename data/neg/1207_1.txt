This is a popular regional chain.  OK food.  OK beer.  It's OK.  There are many more pubs in Cleveland where you can find better food, better beer (more selection) and a more authentic experience.  For example: Academy Tavern on Larchmere.  For example: The Little Bar & Grill downtown.  Etc.  If you want some wingz with the dudez, go here.
