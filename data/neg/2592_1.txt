As impatient as I am, the long wait is always worth it. They honestly serve the best BBQ that I've ever had and do so with fun, excited attitudes. All of the 5 star reviews are spot on. Get there as early as you can to ensure that your wait time isn't ridiculous and that you get the best cuts of meat. Great place to go on a date :-)
