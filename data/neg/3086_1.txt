Great food!! Huge portions!! Great service!! Extremely Pet friendly!! Before we were even waited on the waitress was already bringing out water bowls for our 3 dogs. Which is a huge plus for animals lovers like us. We travel everywhere with our pets so always looking for places they can go too. This will now be one of our regular places in Vegas. Highly recommended the fried chicken dinner.
