This place is the best! I won't go anywhere else. I have brought everything here from dress pants to formal wear. Comes out perfect every time. \n\nJust a few weeks ago, I needed a bridesmaid dress completely altered in a weeks time frame (there was difficulty with the order). The whole dress was taken in and ready in time for the wedding. Excellent customer service!
