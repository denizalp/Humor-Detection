Some of the best wings I've ever had, and the fries or wedges are fantastic: crisp but super fluffy inside. I came in right before they were closing by accident and the owner happily served me, and I got to chat with the chefs and the owner while having a beer. This place is well worth the walk or drive from the nearby hotels. I came back the second night to try the mussel and beer special. Gourmet food at pub prices.
