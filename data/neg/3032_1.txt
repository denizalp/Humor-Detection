Pesto mashed potatoes. Yuuuuummmmmmm.\n\nI like that at the Bellagio, even though it costs maybe another $5 than other buffets on the Strip, you get unlimited Mimosas, a great selection of all-you-can-eat (especially fresh fruits) and some interesting food combinations for a brunch buffet, like those pesto mashed potatoes. This is one of the best buffets in Vegas and my personal favorite.
