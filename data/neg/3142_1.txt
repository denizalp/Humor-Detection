My husband and I just had an awesome meal at Hef's and had a great time. Great food (although, the oysters had a little more grit than I like). The cocktail shrimp were so great and the wings were perfect. They have awesome happy hour food specials every day, and good looking drink specials. The bartender who was there at the time, Bobby, was very attentive and on point with refills. It is a small place so get here early. But otherwise, Hef's is going to be a regular spot for us!
