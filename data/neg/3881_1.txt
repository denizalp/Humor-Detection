At $22 for breakfast The Buffet @ Bellagio only costs $2 more than the other lesser buffets on the strip.  Still a Very good Buffet.  Fresh foods.  Breakfast included all the standards and a good variety of fruit. There were 2 omelette\/egg stations and the buffet also included lunch items like pizza or roast beef. We thought they were lacking on desserts options mainly just pastries for breakfast with only one gluten free chocolate cake and one raspberry chocolate mousse.  We waited was just 15 minutes at 9 am on a Thursday.  \n\nFor a buffet I recommend this one.
