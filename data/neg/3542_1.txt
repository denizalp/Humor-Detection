This is a very hip and fun gaming arcade! Very fun located inside the mill mall. They are pricey for the games though and my kid will go through his card very quickly. They are kind of on the low end with earning tickets on the games. \n\nTheir Taco Tuesday is amazing though! Deliciously authentic street tacos!
