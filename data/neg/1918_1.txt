While my family and I enjoyed our lunch, the downside is that this small restaurant doesn't have a designated smoking area. We ordered beef, spinach and cheese burek, french fries and cevape. Everything was delicious and the server was attentive but we ate inhaling unwelcome secondhand smoke from other tables. Probably we won't come back.
