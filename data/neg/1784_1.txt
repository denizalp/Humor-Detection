First, due credit: Sidebar was there before ANY of the new places transforming downtown into a cool social hub were there. Its a killer place: contemporary but without being douchy, hip music, good drinks, the prices are right, and going up the stairs adds a unique characteristic to the place. Great spot to build your buzz around what is usually a pretty mixed crowd. The stools trade off comfort and stability for their contempo design, so if you have a medium to large ass, and move around a lot, watch out.
