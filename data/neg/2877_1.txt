Super yummy & Fresh! Service was super friendly and persistent.\n\nThe coconut shrimp tempura was def new for me, SO GOOD!\nThe oysters we fresh, and the miso soup was very flavorful!\nThe sex bomb was the best roll we had. Next time I am def trying more variety in rolls. \nThe sushi chef was friendly and even spoke to us! \nThe desert was fab, i got the chocolate fried banana with green tea and I couldn't help but to finish it! I am most definitely going to come back!
