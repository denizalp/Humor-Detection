Really well known for a \"no frills\" experience for Italian in Yorkville. Due to it's price point, it's a popular spot for lunch meetings. \n\nThe food is good and the service is fine. Ambiance is also just fine. It's a solid 3.5 star restaurant that doesn't strive to be anything more than it is. If you appreciate it for that, it's a great place.
