Go to this restaurant often and usually sit outside with my dogs.  Went a few days ago with good friends and their Service dog, Paddington, seated  inside at a comfortable table to accommodate us.  \n\nLunch was so much more enjoyable because of Adam Fox, who not only provided excellent service but great conversation.  Will ask for Adam when I return as he made it more of an experience than just lunch.  \n\nA special thank you to Scooby, Isabel and Maria, service a smile!
