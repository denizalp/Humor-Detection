The Cleveland Clinic Heart Center is a top notch clinic specializing in heart surgery. The hand- off to a mediocre rehabilitation center, Kindred on Fairhill for a heart patient was less than acceptable. I find this quite unusual when the Cleveland Clinic surgery team spent days prepping the patient and hours in surgery. Why then transfer a patient to another facility for potentially a mediocre if not fatal outcome? Also, the Cleveland Clinic Doctor who highly recommended the transfer to Kindred Rehabilitation on Fairhill will not return any calls. Hence, the reason for this post.
