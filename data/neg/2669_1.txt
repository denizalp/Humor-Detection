We were new to the whole tapas experience but our English speaking waiter was very polite and patient with us.  \nWe had the bison burgers (so good), calamares, chorizo & shrimps (very tasty & spicy), smoked salmon, crispy lamb (also very good) and venison tartar.  For wine we did the Trio Bulles and the Trio Breton. Both sets were delicious. We then finished it off with the Langhe  2011 Merlot.\nMy 20-something kids enjoyed the ambiance. Overall a very good experience.
