Good.  \nReliable. \nCheap. \nSome healthy options.\nQuick.\n\nI think this is a decent quick pizza joint.  Nothing outstanding but does the job and much better than say a Pizza Pizza.  Every slice I've tried has been pretty decent but I do like the Spinotta and standard Pepperoni.  \n\nHint: I've noticed it's a lot cheaper to buy by the slice as opposed to a whole pie.
