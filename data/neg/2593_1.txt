Review for Song San. We come here often to enjoy JaJangmyun and JJampong. Other main dishes are also very good. Be aware that they will give you so much that it would be hard to eat all of them. The taste and the quality of this restaurant has been up and down quite a bit. However if you really miss korean-style chinese food, this place serves its roll. Hopefully more chinese restaurant opens up in town and we would have more choices to choose from. :)
