Good overall. Only went for color safe shampoo and conditioner, but they have a good variety of hair care products for every type of hair- including treatments for damaged hair and for ppl who spend a lot of time in the pool.\nNot a huge store but it appeared to have a good selection in general.\nStaff very polite- asked if I needed help but didn't hover when I said no.
