If your looking for a retail shop that sells high end knives at a normal price(comparable to the internet and not MSRP) then this is your KNIFE GUY. He is friendly and seemed knowledgeable about his merchandise. There is no other place that I know of in town that is comparable. He however, does not carry many cheap knives if you go see him be prepared to spend at least $100 for a pretty nice knife.
