I attended a corporate function at this venue and highly recommend it. The space was well setup, they had wifi and great technology capabilities. The furniture was all comfortable. The food they served was AMAZING. I was really impressed by the food. The staff was incredibly friendly. \n\nOnly minor downside...The outside of the building is very no frills. But for corporate functions this really isn't much of an issue. \n\nKeep up the good work!
