Best Chinese food in Charlotte, hands down! They always have fresh and delicious meals and the flavors surpass any Chinese restaurant in the area. We have to drive about 20 mins to get here, and pass a dozen other places but we will make the trip every time. Service is excellent for pick up or dine-in. Chicken and broccoli is my favorite, and my husband always gets the sesame chicken. Definitely deserves more than 5 stars!
