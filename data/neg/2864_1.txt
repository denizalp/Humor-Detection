At first glance, the restaurant looks really fancy. There are different ordering \"stations\" for the type of tacos and taco meat that you order. Confusing and there are no signs that explain anything. The food was alright, could have had more flavor but they at least have a good variety of different kinds of meat. The eating areas don't seem to be cleaned often
