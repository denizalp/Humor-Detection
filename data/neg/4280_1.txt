So, I ordered double dough with red sauce...guy put white sauce on thin crust (I figured it was thin after I got it cz I couldn't tell when it was just a dough) but, I wasn't gonna hold up the line and make a big deal about it so I didn't say anything and they were pretty friendly people too but, I hope they get it right next time!
