I called and Matt was at my house working on it 2 hours later. Dryer vent cleaning is a bit of a  weird expertise but no doubt Matt really knows what he is doing and is really into what he is doing. From what I saw, he will do the job until he is proud of it regardless of how long or how many trips up the ladder it takes. He even cleans up the mess. I consider him a good craigslist find and highly recommend him.
