I love this place. I come there all the time. I always deal with the owner there and he is the best. He's always so nice and helps me find exactly what I need. If I ever don't find what I want he orders it and it's there within days. I absolutely love this place. Never came when it was owed by the previous people when I went there it was always empty the shelves would be so plain with maybe one of a particular thing never was stalked. Now I go there anytime I need something quick. Thanks!!!!
