Grooming service are always wonderful, my dog has been coming here for more than 3 years. Sharon and Andrea are very loving toward my dog and my dog loves them too. My dog always smells great after her grooming. \n\nI'll continue to come here and I also recommend Sharon and Andrea for dog grooming services.
