Amazing food! Horrible service. Server never checked on us. Got our food at the same time as our drinks (sodas). Food was messed up but we ate it anyway and it was absolutely delicious. Never got refills on our drinks. I've eaten here twice now, because you should always try something at least twice, and I doubt I'll be coming back.
