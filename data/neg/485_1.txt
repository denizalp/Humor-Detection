B&B did a fantastic job representing me. I was very satisfied with my service and settlement. Their entire firm was very attentive and thorough. From my first meeting with them to my final meeting and the meetings\/phone conversations in between they made me feel like a priority and never made me feel pressured to take a deal I wasn't completely happy with. They we great at keeping me informed throughout the process. I'd definitely recommend them to my friends and family seeking legal advice or service.
