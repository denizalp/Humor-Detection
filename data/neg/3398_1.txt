I really enjoyed the lunch I had here. The patio is really quite nice and differentiates itself from the more corporate, hurried venues on Stephen Ave that are totally basic (Earl's, Cactus Club, etc...). They have interesting drink specials and a beautiful venue. Our servers were great. The food was quite yummy, although portions were on the smaller side. I guess that is the downside to eating fancier food...you get less of it. I really liked this place though and will definitely be back.
