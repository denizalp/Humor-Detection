Super expensive... I came in to get my eye brows waxed .... the girl tried to squeeze me in real quick ... all she did was tweeze them cost me $45 just for her to pluck my eye brows ...... I could've done that myself. She didn't even trim them all she did was take out 10 pieces of hair and charged me $45 ..... go to a benefit brow bar!!!!!!!
