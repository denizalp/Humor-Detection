One of the best Italian Grocers on this side of town. I love all the Specialty Foods they carry especially their selection of sauces. I have chosen random items at DeFalco's and have never had an item I have it enjoyed. Can't go wrong with anything here there are just a few things that are priced a little bit High but are completely worth it
