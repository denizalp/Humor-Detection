I came here with a fairly large group for the dinner buffet. I had such high hopes for this place because I LOVE seafood, but honestly, the quality of the seafood wasn't all that up to par. While there was decent selection and variety, there was also sand in the shellfish. The crab legs were also super salty, so I was a bit disappointed. I have yet to find a really good buffet in Vegas!\n\n-L.
