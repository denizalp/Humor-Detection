I had an alright pizza and a medoicre hoagie.\n\nI had a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was good, though a little greasier than I'd like. The crust was very good though, almost deep dish but not. Maybe that explains the additional grease?\n\nWe also ordered an Italian Hoagie which was not good. It reminded me more of a Subway hoagie. It could have been cooked longer and the dressing was just a packet on the side. The hoagie did come with homemade chips though which were very good.\n\nMaybe it was an off order and I need to return?
