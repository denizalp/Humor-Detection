I went back to give Einstein's one last try and I am glad I did! They have a whole new staff and the manager was there. I took sometime to chat with him and I was pleased to see he is making great changes.  I ordered the same the same items I did in my other review and it was still my favorite thintastic sandwich. The employees were full of smiles and happy to help.
