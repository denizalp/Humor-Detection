I went here for trivia night with a group of friends. The waiter was friendly, but inept. He didn't want to write down our order, but also couldn't memorize it... which resulted in having him taking our orders (6 or 7 if us) and running to the computer between each of us to type in the order. The food when it arrived was \"meh\"- not good not bad, just food that is definitely overpriced. I don't think I'll be back.
