OMG. \n\nAll of the sandwiches I've had w\/ chicken or turkey were delicious\nThere's a hawaiian chicken one on brioche that was so good.\nBurger is pretty tasty too.\nZucchini Fries~~!\nPeanut Butter Oreo Shake~~~~!\nThe sauces!\n\nOnly thing is that it's kinda pricy for a fast food place.. but the quality is good so it is worth it.
