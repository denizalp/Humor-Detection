Delicious chicken pad Thai. Fresh ingredients, perfect mixture of noodles, meat, and veggies (for me, but my son would have liked more meat). I asked for spicier the 2nd time I ate it and they brought out some type of spicy sauce to add. I was disappointed because I like my spice cooked in. Perhaps they didn't trust me that I would eat it spicier? I made a ginger garlic chicken stir fry this week and I sliced 5 large jalape√±os in it and it was fine. I'm okay with a little more spice.
