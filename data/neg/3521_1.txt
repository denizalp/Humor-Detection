This place is great! My past experiences at the dentist were filled with anxiety and pain, which caused me to stop going to the dentist. I moved into the area I stopped into the office and spoke with the staff everyone was nice, professional and the office was clean. I explained my fears and past experiences and from my very first visit the dentist and hygienist did everything to remove my fears. They're work makes me feel comfortable and assured that my teeth are being treated with great care and professionalism.
