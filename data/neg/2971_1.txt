This place is the beez kneez! I am from Dallas so I used to go to the original all the time. Obviously like any business they learn as they grow. The one I went too didn't have lounge seating, didn't have free clubs at the bays and wasn't three stories. They get better every time! Kids love it, girls love it, everyone loves it. You have to check it out rather you golf or not.
