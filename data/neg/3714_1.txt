everything about this place spits hot fire, and spitting hot fire is gooooooood!  Chase and the crew rock it without even breaking a sweat.  Pizza. Wings. all great, but if you think you are ready for it, try the italian sub on crispy sourdough, hot with everything and habanero mayo,  call it \"The Matt\" BOOM! Instant classic.  Don't even try another sub in the state, it's a waste of time.  Stumpy's is it.
