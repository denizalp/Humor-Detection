Fantastic experience at this store. I've purchased several couches, nightstands, and tables from this location and I've always been happy with the service. My wife and I worked with Lee C. as our sales person and she was fantastic! She is very knowledgeable about the products and patient with customers! We will surely return to work with her again soon.
