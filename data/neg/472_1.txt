It was 100 degrees after a long workday and I came home to a non working AC, ughhh!! I called Desert Diamond Mechanical and they sent their tech Cody right out to my house. Cody and Josh were highly experienced and explained everything to me in way I could understand. The price was super affordable and less then I've paid in the past with other companies. Above all the customer service was amazing!! Thank you Desert Diamond Mechanical for making my home way cool again!! You have made a customer for life, Leah A.
