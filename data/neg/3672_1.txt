I needed a drop in cabinetry stove removed and new slide in stove replacement which required cutting granite and  cabinetry and new electrical outlet installation. Mike (the owner) got the job done beautifully! He was honest and reliable, communicating and scheduling, following thru sooner than planned. Very conscience. Great work.
