I'd completely forgot they were coming today! Needless to say, the technician arrived early, offered to help me move furniture out of the way, and did a great job!! We have a new puppy and teenagers that wrecked the carpet upstairs and down. In an hour and a half my carpet looks like new. He was professional, friendly and affordable...5 star service all the way!!!!!
