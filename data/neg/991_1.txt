Stopped in for a quick plate of tacos. Had the Living Social deal so seemed worth a stop.\n\nMenu is small, but contains a pretty good mix of tacos. Each plate has two tacos plus rice and beans. Chicken, pork, fish, and veggie were all availble in one form or another.\n\nI opted for the chicken street tacos. Tasty, tender, thigh meat topped with veggies and cheese. Winner, winner chicken dinner in my book.\n\nWould return and likely booze it up a bit as well. The changing colors on the bar were a bit funky, but place has a good vibe.
