Their monk whiskey drink was very bitter and I couldn't finish it but I prefer sweet drinks. I had their Belgium fries which came with a white sauce and these were amazing!!! Highly recommend as it was a generous size for the price and so delicious. I sat inside and it was a quiet relaxing atmosphere with a very pretty and unique chandelier that I kept staring at on the first floor lol Overall would recommend if you don't mind beer and stronger drinks
