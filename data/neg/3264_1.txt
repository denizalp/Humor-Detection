Three strikes...you're out!! BLD is close to our home and the food is decent, so we gave it 3 different attempts, only to decide we will not be returning. The girls at the front just stand there and have no idea what a customer experience is supposed to look like. You're lucky if you get a smile from a single member of wait staff, with the exception of the girl from the kitchen when she brought out our plates. Not for us.
