Had the Kale Kai Salad last night with the spicy fish on top, it was delicious! A bit pricey for a salad ($11+) but its pretty big, I finished the second half for breakfast this morning and it was still good! That cilantro lime dressing brings life to me! I loooved it. The fish could have been a bit more crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside if they pan fried it skin on and then baked it..but the flavor was nice. Might try it with chicken or pork next time instead.
