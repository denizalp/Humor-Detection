Pretty much on par with the other UW clinics. You make an appointment and they make you wait 20 minutes past the appointment time. Then when you are in the office it is rush here and rush there. \n\nTruthfully, healthcare always seems to run slow. The people are friendly and the location is great. What else can you ask for?
