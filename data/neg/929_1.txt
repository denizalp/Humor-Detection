This restaurant definitely should be on everyone's bucket list! Everything was absolutely amazing! They pay close attention to every detail from the moment you walk in to the last breath you take in the restaurant. \n\nLuckily for us, the omakase menu recently changed to include sashimi and other special surprises in addition to the traditional nigiri. There was an amazing assortment of ridiculously fresh fish that delivered exceptional flavours. Though this experience costs $105 per person, it was worth every penny.
