Visited Indie Ale House on Friday, March 5th around 6:00 PM for dinner and was promptly told that it would be over an hour wait and looking around it was easy to understand considering it was rammed.\n\n30 minutes later we were texted and told the table for the six of our group was ready.\n\nFried chicken, bison burgers and spring rolls were ordered along with every single beer on their tap list. Everything came quickly and well prepared.\n\nOur group spend at least 2 hours here eating, drinking and having a fantastic time. Make a point to visit this establishment.
