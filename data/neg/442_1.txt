Excellent‼‼\nWe love this restaurant for breakfast and lunch. Daily specials and there's a menu for lighter eaters. Candy makes the best homemade green chili sauce. The prices are very reasonable. Everything is homemade including peach cobbler, muffins. Etc. We've been here at least six times and have not once been disappointed. The staff is so friendly anand it's such comfortable place to eat. I have no problem coming to Candys by myself to enjoy a delicious meal. Give it a try you won't be disappointed.
