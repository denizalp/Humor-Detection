Review of Casino only...The floor staff is unprofessional and asleep at the wheel.  A craps dealer literally stole $7 from me an no one cared other than the security guard.  Even the surveillance team made up a fantastic story to defend the inept dealer and pit boss.  Spray yourself with Lysol before entering and exiting.
