Jewels is a jewel in itself! The chicken and waffles are Devine!!! I highly recommend Grandma's latte... the hazelnut in it is heavenly. We came to this area for baseball spring training and it is difficult to find quality food that is GF and doesn't taste gluten free. Jewels is the exception to that rule. \n\nThe doughnuts are moist and delicious!! Don't miss out on those!! And the honey is incredible!!
