I've heard of this place for years and finally came to check it out and have some fun. I'm not a pinball fan at all, but I found a couple to play. But, they have a lot of old school early 80's arcade games as well. Even the kids will have a great time.\n\nWhat is amazing to me is this place is run by a nonprofit organization. They keep the games running for the love of the games, not to make money.\n\nBring your quarters, have fun, and keep the place going!
