Very tasty dutch babies.  Delicious baked omlette.  Waitress was on top of it and super friendly. \nYummy coffee.\n\nDefinitely an \"older\" crowd.  The ambience hasn't been updated since the early 80s probably and is covered with a multitude of  \"NO _____\",  \"DO NOT _____\" \"Outside Drink Not Allowed\" etc posters all over the walls giving it the look and feel of of a middle school gym..... are all those warnings and policy posters necessary?
