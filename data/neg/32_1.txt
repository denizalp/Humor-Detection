We stayed here while my husband was working in Vegas.  I chose Mandalay because it looked the most family friendly.  We have two small children, there was no changing table in the pool area.  The pack and plays and fridges are $35 a night... I think those are amenities that should be included at a 4 star hotel.  I would probably look for another hotel next time - it was just okay.
