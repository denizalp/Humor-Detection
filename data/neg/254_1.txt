Breakfast and lunch are great and the price isn't bad. It's difficult to trust most places aren't contaminating the food accidentally or carelessly with gluten so I really love that I don't have to worry here. The patio is charming. The baked goods are great quality and the coffee and teas are good too. The line always goes quickly and the wait for food is quick as well. Customer service is spot on. Definitely my favorite brunch spot!
