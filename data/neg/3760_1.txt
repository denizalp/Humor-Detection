Lovely place.  My husband and I  decided to try it out for happy hour tonight.  Enjoyed it so much we stayed for dinner and dessert!  Cozy little restaurant.  Our server Jennifer was fantastic!  She went above and beyond with her recommendations and letting us taste several wines to make sure we liked them.  Impressed that The owner George is hands on and mingles with the patrons.  Eggplant torte, the specials, and tiramisu were all delicious.  Happy to have a non chain restaurant so close to home.  We will be back!
