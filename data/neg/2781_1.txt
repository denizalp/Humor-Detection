I have been a patient of Dr. Dameron's for over 15 years.  My teeth look great and my chubby belly attests that they also work well! Those years include consistently excellent performance by Dr. Dameron and his staff.  \n\nLast week, once again, my numbing shots DID NOT HURT. Not when they were given, not the afternoon of, nor the day after! \n\nEnjoy their Top Level Dentistry performed with State of the Art equipment and techniques.
