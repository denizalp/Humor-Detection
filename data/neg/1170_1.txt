This was my go to sushi joint when I used to live in the area and even now I'll try and grab some takeout whenever I get chance. I've always been a fan of their medium trio platter, it has always been a great value in both quality and quantity. Honestly if you live in the area there isn't a better option for sushi anywhere else.
