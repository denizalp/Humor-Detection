I took someone out here based off good reviews and was a nightmare. The food was horrible. Either not cooked right and\/or too many spices and salt used that way overpowered anything else. Also while not super pricey, it is a lot more pricey than other places with similar cuisine in the area with much better food. Don't go here unless you want horrible food at a steep price.
