Yummy food, good service.  Another place in the Rio that I love.  It is a great place to go after a night of drinking and you just want to munch on something.  Beware though the cocktails at this seemingly innocent spot are expensive!  Then they get you with the \"Wanna make it a double?\" question.  The french onion soup was fantastic!  I miss it already!!
