Snuck in before 3 p.m. breaktime, they reopen at 5. Simple high quality tables and chairs. Super clean. Simple menu for those of us not well versed in Thai food. Easy decision making. Ice cold water served right away with their Hot Sour soup..then we ordered . Outstanding..stay with the medium heat and most everyone will be happy. Pleasant , peaceful in the afternoon
