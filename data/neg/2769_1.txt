Great experience. The workers were friendly and the course was a lot of fun. \nI loved it and would go back. \n\nAdvice -\nFollow directions! I tried to be innovative on some of the lines and ended up getting cut up and bruised on my legs. Wear long pants, even if it's hot. It's shaded so you will be okay. And like others said, bring bug spray and gloves. \n\nAlso, my boyfriend is afraid of heights and he hated it (We hoped it would help if he faced his fears but it backfired).
