We had high expectations of the buffet of a reputed casino like Bellagio. Unfortunately the food was average. There was nothing exceptional really. I wouldn't waste my time going back to this buffet, even if it was considerable cheaper. We had to decide between Bellagio and Caesar's palace and I regret going with Bellagio since we are in town only for a couple of days.
