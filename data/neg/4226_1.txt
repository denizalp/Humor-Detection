Let me jump on the bandwagon and add my praise for Pita Jungle.  I love their new location and not just because it is in my 'hood.  It's open, clean and so far, there have been no service issues.  The food is relatively cheap and the portions are big.  I like the macro platter and the chicken wrap.
