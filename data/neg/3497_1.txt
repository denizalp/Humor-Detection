Good burgers and fries. Never had the custard because we are usually pretty full with the food itself. Booths are fairly large and could probably fir between 6 and 8 people, depending on size. Dislike how parents always let their kids stand in front of the soda machine tasting every soda (I know that's not the establishment's fault and it does not affect their rating).
