This place is in my top 10 restaurants around town. Food is simple and clean. I like it here better than andiron. More casual and the staff is always great. The stupid breakfast nachos are my go to for breakfast and the chicken breast and salmon dinner entrees are better than most places that have a similar offering. My ONLY gripe is that a small side of fries here is $7? Other than that no other negatives to speak if.
