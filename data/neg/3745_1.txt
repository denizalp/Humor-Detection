4 stars for snow ice and food\n\n2.5 stars for tea- way too sweet,  lack of taste of tea.\n\n3 stars for service. Some servers are friendly and some give you an attitude. \n\nAnd wonder why playing cards (UNO) is not allowed. I guess Green Grotto is more for hanging out than here.\n\nanother thing is dinner special ends too early -8pm. After 8pm, you can only order regular menu. very limited time.
