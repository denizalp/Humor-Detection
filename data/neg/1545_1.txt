Great local steak spot. Ordered the lamb chops and rib eye. Delicious! Prepared to perfection. Definitely worth it to go out of your way and venture off the strip if you are visiting town. I will be back to take my folks and other guests who appreciate a good steak. PS: Don't over shoot the parking lot on the left where the steak house is. . . at night we accidentally found ourselves walking into a large church-like congregation just behind the Ranch House!
