We ordered the Meatball Parm Sub & Spaghetti and Meatballs delivered. It arrived on time and still hot, and this was the best meatball sub I've had! My friend who is also from NY had the Spaghetti dinner and she raved about it. We are going to go and eat in next time so we can meet Vinny and try some of his other menu items! Real NY style!
