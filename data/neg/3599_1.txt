Tried Saigon kitchen for the first time tonight.  Had the shaken beef which they have gotten great reviews for. The flavored were good and I liked it but it was a bit too salty. Drank a ton of water to make up for the salt. ThE garlic soup and dessert was yummy. We also had the combination rice plate which was very good.
