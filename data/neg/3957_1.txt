I have been to three different Chiropractors after moving to Vegas a few years ago, I have finally found the best in his field. Dr. Mcintosh is not only exceptional at his job, but he also truly cares about every person that walks thru the door. You won't find a more comfortable atmosphere than the Joint on Sunset. Rosa is a joy to see when I walk in every Wednesday, the duo make a great team!! if your looking for a kind, compassionate, knowledgable Chiropractor, walk into The Joint on Sunset and ask for Dr. Mcintosh.
