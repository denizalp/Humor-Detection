Hidden Treasure in Las Vegas.  Located in the Cosmo, they have a pre Fixe menu for $20.13 (for the year 2013).  It is awesome.  The scallops are sweet and perfection.  The fish (watch out for some bones) is cooked to perfection.  Tangy and hint of nuttiness from the olive oil.  The yogurt was tart and sweet with a kiss of the strawberry jam.  Beautiful restaurant and great service at an amazing lunch price.  What more can you ask for?  Try it.
