If you are in a hurry, the Sky Harbor Economy garage is the way to go. Once you park and grab your bags, you are 7 minutes from the tram ride that takes you to the terminals. I have never waited more than 5 min for the next tram. If time is of the essence with a budget held in mind, you would be hard-pressed to find a better solution
