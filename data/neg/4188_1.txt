Very heart welcoming and kind owners, however I did not really enjoy the roti at all. \nDon't get me wrong, the roti is made fresh on the spot, and they even make a point of it by letting you know before it deflates on the  stove top, but the filling wasn't anything special. No flavour and chewy meat. I understand its a tiny space they have to work with, but seeing them microwaving the food was a turn off for me.
