Corks is such a beautiful place to have dinner.  What Paul has done to remodel has been outstanding.  My favorite item on the menu is the Mac n cheese.  \n\nMy only complaint is that the food always seems a bit salty for my taste.  Having high BP, that is a big no no for me.  So we can't eat here as often as I would like.\n\nThat being said, it's great place for a glass of wine or trying new craft beers and simply enjoying the atmosphere.
