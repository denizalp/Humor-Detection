Went here for a 30 minute ion detox \/ 30 minute reflexology with a $22 Groupon. The place was relaxing and services were good. I give it 3 stars because the worker asked me for a tip upon completion.. I don't mind tipping but I don't think it's appropriate to ask for a tip and when I did, the two workers came to the front and all huddled around to see what I was tipping.
