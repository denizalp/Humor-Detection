Tried this gem of a restaurant in the Venetian hotel. The dining area is hidden behind the bar\/lounge area. We had the signature fried chicken, buttermilk biscuits with whipped butter and apple cinnamon jam, the short rib and kale salad. Portions were huge and the food was incredible. Next time we will save room for the peach cobbler, bread pudding and shrimp & grits.
