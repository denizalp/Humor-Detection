The ice cream at Sweet Moses is seriously the BEST ice cream in Cleveland. I have yet to find a place that can even compare. The service is incredible and their new holiday special, the Sterling-Lindner, is to die for, and the atmosphere is always enjoyable! It is a bit more pricey than other ice cream places in the surrounding Cleveland area but completely worth it!
