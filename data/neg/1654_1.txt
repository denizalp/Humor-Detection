Nice little cafe in Old Port! I love their pastries and coffee, but my boyfriend loves their signature Butter Ball. I personally think that they're way too sugary, but everyone else seems to enjoy them. I once had their avocado toast in the morning. They were super accommodating and the toast was great. Going to try their tea service after I gather up my lady friends!
