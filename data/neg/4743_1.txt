I don't know about you, but I hate going to the dentist.   After a tooth flared up on me and I couldn't take the pain anymore, I went to Brookstone on a friend recommendation.  Dr Matt and his staff were friendly, nice, and completely put me at ease.  The tooth is now great, and now I have a \"safe\" place to go for dental work.   Highly recommend.
