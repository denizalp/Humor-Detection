I ordered take out. I ordered the butter chicken and garlic naan. The garlic naan was delicious, however, the butter chicken had bones in the chicken. If the bones didn't come into the butter chicken, I would have given this restaurant a 5. The taste of the butter chicken was delicious and had the right amount of spice.
