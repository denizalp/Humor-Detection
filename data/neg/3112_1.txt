This place is awful. \nThe doctor has no time for her patients, spoke to me so fast I could hardly understand her and when I went to clarify what she said she seemed annoyed. \nI wouldn't recommend this place at all. \nI went on to find a much better dermatologist office, and I would not recommend this place, not if you want someone to spend time with you, and thoroughly explain your concerns.
