Like everyone else I have been waiting 4 months. I left a good deposit. They promised to send me an email day one. I followed up in week 2. I followed up in week 3. I spoke to John.... I followed up again. Continue with this broken record until 4 months later. No email no response nada. \n\n\nMy wife give me grief about it as we were expecting our furniture. \n\nNot sure I would recommend this hassle to anyone.....
