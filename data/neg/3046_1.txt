I have been here many times and never disappointed. Muffulettas are very comparable to those found in N'awlins. Large portions & great pricing, there have been times were we've had to wait sometimes with a lot of people waiting as well, but most of the time there is 1-2 people there and you have to take that into consideration. The food is definitely worth the wait in my opinion!
