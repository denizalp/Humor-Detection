Saw this place was open for a while but finally gave it a shot because of the good reviews. \n\nI've always liked the location at Finch and hoped this place would be similar but that's not the case! We ordered the soft tofu soups and they tasted really watered down. Side dishes were mediocre and the crispy pot rice at the end of the meal wasn't the same as the Finch location. \n\nI probably wouldn't come here again. The food is cheap but there are better options in the area.
