There is a reason why I drive 40 minutes from Mountain's Edge to come here to get my eye exam.  They are professional and everyone is so courteous.  From the call reminders to make an annual appointment to the reminder to keep the appointment to the check-in process to the exam by the optometrist to the optician, everyone works together seamlessly.  The equipment is high-tech and new, I never felt rushed during the exam, and the optician was so informative.  The optometrist even came out to help me choose sunglasses as a second opinion to the optician's recommendation!
