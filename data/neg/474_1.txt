Food was good. Pressed sushi wasn't the best I've had, but they have tuna sashimi which was fresh and tasty. Price was a little high.\nMy husband doesn't like sushi much, and they had a great variety of beef and other tempanyaki offerings which were really fresh and well seasoned which he loved.\niPad ordering system in a bonus.
