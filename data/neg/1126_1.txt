Just very blah. Took a while to get drinks. Uncozy atmosphere. Everyone running and not listening to the order. \nBurger came lukewarm like it's been sitting somewhere for a bit. Had to keep reminding the waitress to bring \"bottomless\" fries. Too loud with babies crying. Most likely never again category
