Good food, slightly high prices.\n\nI had the crawfish etouffee, my standard cajun dish.  It was quite good.  My brother had red beans and rice with sausage, which he loved.  Our friend had red beans and rice.  All were good.  No leftovers, but we were full.  The fresh lemonade was good; the maple bacon pralin was meh.
