We enjoyed a Sunday afternoon Happy Hour here at Diego Pops. The server was friendly. The happy hour menu including house margaritas was our favorite. Yes, I tried the Brussel Sprouts Nachos, and it was good, minus the Brussel sprouts, LOL LOL. The guacamole, and queso was good as well. Check this place out, you will like it!
