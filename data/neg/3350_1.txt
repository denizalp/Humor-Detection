A remarkable open air Amphitheatre with a wide natural sloping grassy hill makes viewing and spreading out very enjoyable. We had a nice picnic from our lawn chairs and hear Cleveland's reggae artist, Carlos Jones, put on a splendid show of 21\/2 hours.  Everyone had a great time; children of all ages danced and clapped to the wonderful Jamaican rhythm.
