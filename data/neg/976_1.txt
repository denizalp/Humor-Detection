Both Jerry and Tim were very patient with me, considering that I was dumb about my nose piercing. :) \n\nThis is definitely a good place to get piercings done. If you have pre piercing jitters, Jerry will calm you down. He's the man for that job! Both of them are very nice. \n\nThis place is my go to for piercings. I've gone for my cartilage piercing, I've gone for my helix piercing, and I plan to keep going there for the rest of my piercings. \n\nGreat place! :) thanks guys!
