The only thing that would make this place perfect is calories on the menu.  There is SO many fresh sandwiches, soups and salads.  The dessert bar is always fully stocked to compliment your healthy meal.  Lots of drink choices too.  Many different seating options so great for small or large lunch dates.  There really are few options in this area, so this place is great with free parking too.  Good prices, and very fast and friendly service.
