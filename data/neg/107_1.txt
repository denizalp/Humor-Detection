That is some amazing bodywork!!!! I loved the combination of aquatic stretch and watsu, a perfect mix.  Deep movement and muscle tension release and then followed by the beautiful relaxation that watsu provides. Rotem is exceptional at what he does.  He is highly skilled, kind and caring and makes sure you are comfortable. A real gift to yourself and a wonderful healing modality.
