3.5 stars....Clean. A lot of staff working the ticket window. Frequent showtimes.\n\nFive of us came to see Monsters University. Luckily we were early enough to get seats together. When my husband and his mom went to get some snacks, the theater started filling up. They were gone for about 15 minutes and when my husband got back he said that it was really busy at the snack bar. His mom ordered the kids some soft pretzels and had to go wait in a separate hot food line which resulted in an even longer wait. \n\nMy advice, get there early.
