I've been with this State Farm for a while now, and I've been helped by Jodi and Christina so far, and they've been wonderful and go out of their way to make sure your happy with the service you get, all their staff is friendly and awesome. And their rates are always better than everyone else I've gotten a quote from. If you need insurance this office is the place to get it!
