Although I am just getting around to writing this review, we went here about 3 weeks ago. The food is delicious and fresh and there is a lot of it. Both the fried mozzarella and the chicken parm use panko breadcrumbs so the breading is very light. The staff are all warm and inviting. It seems like they have a lot of repeat customers because they were familiar with everyone else that came in. I can see why, it feels like visiting your great aunt...if your great aunt is a super good cook.
