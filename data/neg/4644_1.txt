In 2014 I went on a 3 week tour of Vietnam from North to South, tasting the various cuisines country-wide. Pho Vietnam's fare is reminiscent of North Vietnam.  The food is fresh and tasty and not too spicy. Service was courtesies and fast. The establishment looked clean also, which is a bonus. I would come back.
