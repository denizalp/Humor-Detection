I am so grateful my friend referred me to Dr. Partovi and his wife, Mahnosh\n(dental hygienist).  I am so impressed with the quality of work and patient service. They made me feel comfortable by explaining the work I was receiving.  My young daughter loves them as well - she told me Mahnosh is the best!\nThank you, Dr. Partovi, Mahnosh, and staff for the excellent service you provide your patients!
