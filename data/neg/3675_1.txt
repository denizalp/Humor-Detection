Homewood Suites is the way to go for an extended visit. And the staff have been great!! Helpful, kind, and very informative. The room is clean and comfortable. \nThe food has been decent and well prepared. \nTreadmills work great, and gym was clean with fresh cool water. I've enjoyed my stay. Thanks Homewood!!
