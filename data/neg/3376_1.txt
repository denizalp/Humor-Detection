Our first time in Montreal on Christmas Day as tourist and stumbled upon this place. Not many places open on his day. This place was great all around. Service very well and friendly. Drinks were great and the ambience was alive and welcoming. Felt like a local instantly. The Christmas Devore and vibe truly set the night and saved our Christmas night outing. Highly recommended if you want good drinks and a good ambience for good prices.
