I visited this store from NYC and the trek from my hotel was so worth it! The previous Yelpers who mentioned the lovely local yarn were right on the money. We were hungry after a long bus ride so I didn't get to spend too much time in there but the salespeople were super helpful in guiding me. I picked up three skeins of yarns and two types of tea. I don't know when I'll make it back up there but I will surely visit again!
