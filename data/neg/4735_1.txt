The service was nice, the server was very friendly, attentive, and knowedgeable of the menu items. The atmosphere was warm, intimate, and relatively quiet. The food was quite good, but unimpressive for the price, (a dinner for two will probably cost around $100.00). Roy's is a good choice and I would recommend for something such as a date night with your spouse or for a quiet special occasion.
