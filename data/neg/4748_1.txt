Great Disney Store in Fashion Show mall! We found a wonderful assortment of Tsum Tsums which my youngest daughter collects. They have the Marvel variety in small, medium and large, plus the Christmas collection, the winkies, and more. They even have Tsum bags, mugs and magnets. My daughter was overjoyed. \n\nFriendly employees too, and such a clean store. We LOVE Disney!
