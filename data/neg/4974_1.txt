This is the second time we are using Public Storage and we chose to come back to this branch without hesitation. Glenda was great in helping us pick the right storage solution and helping us set up the autopay, seeing that we are going to be away for a few months. This location is also very convenient and clean. We will use this branch anytime we are in AZ and needed storage. Thanks Glenda!
