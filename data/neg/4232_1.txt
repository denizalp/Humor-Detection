My wife and I came here for one of our first few dates and we were real impressed. After a year or so, it kinda has been hit or miss when we come. The major sushi rolls we enjoy are usually never on the belt and we have to ask for it a few times before we get it. The staff doesn't seem to enjoy their work. They never ever come back to ask if we want more water or if we're doing OK. We still come cause we love sushi and it's a good price, but they're slacking.
