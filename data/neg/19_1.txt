We came here on a very hot July 4th. Services were great. The waiter got us ice water immediately. So we ordered two bowls of pho, one bowl of bun bo hue, and an order of spring rolls. The spring rolls were very loosely wrapped, not like the rolls that typically from other Vietnamese restaurant. The pho was good not great. The bun bo hue was very very bland, it was pho broth with a little spice color, not good!!!!
