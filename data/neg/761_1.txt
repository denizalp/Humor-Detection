As soon as I walk in I notice the lack and laziness there. The women that was going to cut my hair is rude and acted if she didn't want to be there. As she started to brush my hair I stand up and told her. I'm going somewhere else. I just didn't just leave my beautiful hair to grow for someone  unprofessional would mess it up. I don't know understand how's this business is till open.
