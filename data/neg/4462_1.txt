I have NEVER been more upset by a haircut. It was 16$, and I thought I'd tip 10 bucks... really regretting it. Straightened my hair for the first time since the cut and I'm in frustration. She asked if I wanted layers, I said yes like a DUNCE and ended up with hair that's just 3 different lengths in the FRONT and the back is all the same length. I HAVE A MULLET!!!!! I didn't cut my hair for 3 years because I was afraid of this. Sad.
