I will say one of the few places I actually can enjoy being on mill when its busy . they still have decent drink prices for drinks that will get you feeling good quick. I actually enjoy playing pool and having the seperate area from where people are dancing and where the tables are is this places best feature . tables are actually fairly good quality as well. Def cheaper places to play and if you show up late your waiting a while but considering its location cant hold that against it.
