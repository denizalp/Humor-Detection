Ragstock is one of those stores you could spend hours in just looking around. It has a cool vibe, and they carry a huge variety of new, vintage, and thrifty clothing and accessories. \nAlthough not everything is of a high quality, it is very affordable. Especially on the sale racks, you can always find something for a steal. \nI've shopped at the Madison location many times and am excited to hear one is coming to the Fox River Mall in Appleton.
