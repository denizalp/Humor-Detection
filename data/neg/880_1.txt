I like the dimly lit bistro atmosphere of the place, the prices are fair, and the Agave BBQ pizza was pretty good. I see they even do a pretty generous $5 two slices of cheese pizza and a drink special, that intend to do sometime in the not so distant future. My only complaint, and it's worth mentioning, is the wait time. 35 minutes seemed a little long. \nI'll go back for sure. Hopefully that wait isn't an everytime deal.
