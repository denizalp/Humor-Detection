We're so happy that Pasoli's has taken over the space that was Mandy's! They're serving the same great pizza with allergen-friendly and gluten-free options and some menu additions... but now you can have those pizzas, wings, etc. served up by a friendly and helpful staff and management team. All of the negative comments I had about Mandy's have been remedied. We're pleased to call Pastoli's our go-to pizza place in Squirrel Hill!
