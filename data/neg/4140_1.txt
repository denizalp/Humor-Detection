Went for a quick Sunday coffee and brunch with 2 friends. Saving Gigi is a cute and comfy, communal cafe. Americanos are okay - Northwood's are better. Service is a little slow and nothing is served with a smile. Food took awhile - my bf and I both ordered two egg brunches - eggs were really tasty, potatoes were a little bland, and the turkey sausage was tasty but dry.
