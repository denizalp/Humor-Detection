Service was terrible. Had to wait over 45 minutes even with a reservation and when we finally sat, it took over an hour just to bring appetizers which arrived one at a time. The entree came 2 hours after our original reservation time and it was cold. Worst of all, the attitude of the Manager was cavalier and condescending. I would not recommend this place even though the quality of the food was good.
