The Haymaker on Tatum and Bell has always been a favorite family friendly hangout. After the new concept, open setting, and refreshed menu, I was impressed with the staff, management and this spot finding its groove! The build your own mac n cheese impressed the biggest critic, my 9 year old daughter! The starters, burgers, and cold beer will satisfy for sure!
