I was not impressed at all the crab legs were frozen and the rest of the food was very bland.  Everyone raves about the deserts the cakes were dry, creme brulee was ok.  I think the best item was the raspberry and peach sorbet.  I would not recommend this buffet.  Planet Hollywood buffets is way better tasting and bigger selection.
