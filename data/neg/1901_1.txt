Restaurants aren't in the food business. They're in the people business. This restaurant doesn't understand that. \n\nTheir service is just horrible. Their bar staff know very little about what's behind the bar, and their attitude towards their customers is disrespectful. \n\nI'd recommend you go to El Rey instead. You'll get better food, better drinks, and much much better treatment as a paying customer.
