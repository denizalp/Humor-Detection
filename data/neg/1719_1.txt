Bad service - refused to use any coupons even though they were still valid. Ditzy waitress couldn't do two coupons at once -fine - but then refused to use even one. When I asked to speak to the manager he refused to come out.  The restaurant was dead and it was a Saturday night. Not good customer service at all. Food lacks care - looks like it was thrown on a plate. Even if the food was good we won't be returning - service is everything in this day and age.
