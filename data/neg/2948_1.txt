nice little place. I like it because it's not the typical las vegas bar\/lounge. I went on Saturday night when they had the live blues band. staff was friendly and helpful.  little bit of an older crowd when I went. Drinks were little more than I expected ($8 for crown and coke). I'd like to check this place out on another night... like when they have the acoustic night. if you're looking for something different than what typical vegas bar scene offers then try this place. ***NOTE: they will be closing on March 30th***
