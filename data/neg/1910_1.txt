I went in for my occasional haircut and decided to give this place a try instead of my normal place. And my hair stylist, Carrie, did an amazing job. Better than my regular stylist. She was very professional and courteous. She paid attention to detail and made me feel very comfortable. I would definitely recommend Dino Palmieri to my friends and family and I am never going to a different salon for my future haircut needs.
