Went at 6pm in a Friday, oddly empty inside. Wait staff was veeeeery slow to take drink orders, and then very slow to come take food orders. It seemed like there was only one waitress in and a new one in training. Food was good, can't deny that. Good beer list. Reasonable prices.  But the wait was ridiculous for how empty it was in there.
