Our first time, my boyfriend  had an awesome veggie wrap and I the California burger, it  was grilled to perfect temperature,  with sliced avocado and melted pepper jack cheese....ummmmm\nHowever, where we sat, we could hear two types of music, something from the kitchen and whatever the front of house was playing,  a little disturbing but I think once the place fills up, you wouldn't hear it anyways. We did ask the waitress to maybe have the kitchen turn it down and I believe she tried however, it seemed the kitchens music priority out weighed ours.
