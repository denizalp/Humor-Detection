Harumi will be by new go to sushi place. The owner himself served me and my boyfriend (we came during non peak times). He patiently answered all our questions and was extremely nice. I love that they use healthier black rice and that their fish tasted really clean. My boyfriend and I ate all the food and were super happy to get to enjoy some freebies like Mochi ice cream and even a 4 piece nigiri.
