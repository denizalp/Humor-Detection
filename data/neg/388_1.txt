There's nothing like an Oreo Overload from Cold Stone.  So when The Better Half and I passed one during a recent trip to Vegas, we had to stop and get some.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/cold-stone-creamery-las-vegas-2?select=UYwICGoMSIqDQqwELaCb1Q#UYwICGoMSIqDQqwELaCb1Q\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/cold-stone-creamery-las-vegas-2?select=FFhELO6xAnVo_Eq2E2nazg#FFhELO6xAnVo_Eq2E2nazg\n\nThe employees at this store hooked us up and made ours with a ton of Oreos\/Chocolate Chips\/Caramel....much more than we normally get at the stores we visit in Scottsdale.  When you get the craving for Ice Cream, you have to satisfy it!\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
