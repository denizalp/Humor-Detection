Had the Morris ramen with extra soft boil egg, the ramen is the most authentic I have tasted in Madison. Am very pleased with that. Tried the pork bun, it was absolutely delicious. The dessert orange ice cream sandwich has very great texture and taste. Overall wonderful experience. Great service. Modern looking. Well done !
