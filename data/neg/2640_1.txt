We got a cake from Las Vegas Custom Cakes for our wedding last month. They were super easy to work with. We were in and out in 40 minutes when we were doing our cake tasting! Their chocolate special cake is my favorite, but the guests told me all flavored were so good! We had chocolate special, marble with vanilla buttercream, strawberry shortcake, and red velvet with cream cheese. I will be going to them for any future cake orders!
