My dogs got a hold of my phone and I called all these different shops and no one was willing to fix my phone. I found them and they fixed my phone within 48 hours. I was grateful for them fixing it in that short amount of time because I was going into the hospital and would not be able to get it fixed. They are great and honest and will tell you the truth and not price gouge you. Thank you so very much.
