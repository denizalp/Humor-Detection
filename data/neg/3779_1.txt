Atmosphere was a 5, the food was a 3.8.  Kind of pricey for what you get, but not unreasonable. Service was a 5. The waiter was extremely attentive to our business group, the bartender was a true industry veteran.\n\nI got there a bit early to have a cocktail or two to loosen up before a big business dinner. True artistic approach to the service at the bar.  It almost felt like a time warp and Ioved it.\n\nIt's worth the trip just for the beauty of the restaurant.\n\nLots of history!
