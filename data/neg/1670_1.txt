Came here for lunch. Was seated immediately. I ordered two tacos and a side of the coco rice. The steak taco was a little tough but not that tough. Nice flavor and served on white corn soft tortilla. I was really impressed by the green chili taco  lots of layered flavors.  I would order this one without hesitation. Although, I walked here, it appears that parking may be an issue when the next door neighboring restaurant re-opens.   All in all, a great new casual dining spot in Old Town.
