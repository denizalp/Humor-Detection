Ok.  I read all the good reviews and decided to try the place.  Obviously, I didn't get the manicurists that everyone recommended.  I got the person who didn't speak at all and literally scraped my skin raw!  I have been home an hour and my legs and feet are still burning.  The manicurist didn't listen when I said 'ouch' or pulled back!  I keep looking at my cuticles to see if they are bleeding because they hurt so bad!  My advice:  beware.
