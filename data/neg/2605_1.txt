Stopped there for lunch a summer weekend as the only customers. The food was just passable even though we were hungry, had craving for thai food, and ready to find anything delicious.\n\nThe curry was too thick (to the point of almost pasty). Vegetables in the curry were in big chunks and not as varied as better Thai restos. Portion was adequate though I was disappointed with the ratio of protein vs veggies. It doesn't break the bank but certainly was a forgettable meal. We left full yet slightly unsatisfied.
