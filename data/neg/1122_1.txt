This place came highly recommended by a friend. When we walked in we told the hostess it was our first time, immediately people waiting for tables were telling us how much we would enjoy it. We waited no more than 20 minutes on a Friday night. I can't say how fantastic the food was and the customer service was exceptional. It's nice to see servers hustle when there is a crowd and they are eager to please, refill drinks, and get food out quickly. We will return for sure!
