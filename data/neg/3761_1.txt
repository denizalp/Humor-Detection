Ron and Sue were absolutely delightful....she is an amazing cook. I felt completely at home..Ron was so gracious to pour my son and I wine and serve snacks late in the evening...generous, kind good hearted couple.She is so stinkin cute...great laugh...fun dresser.\n  Lovely grounds, flowers...Ron has done a tremendous amount of work to make it such a sanctuary ......just the best...would return in a heartbeat
