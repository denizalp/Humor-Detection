I had to write a 5-star review to offset some of the poor reviews.  This is probably the best restaraunt in Madison for vegetarians.  Food is delicious.  I woudn't even know which menu item to review; everything I've had is excellent. \n\nI'd like to see where some of these other reviewers recommend people eat.
