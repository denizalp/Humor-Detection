Cora is the best! She's been doing my hair for over 6 years. She's amazing at coloring, styling just the way you like, and has an eye for fun new styles to try if you aren't sure what you want. The salon is adorable, easy to find and priced well. Cora is easy to talk to and very energetic! I recommend her and 3 Little Birds Salon to everyone!!
