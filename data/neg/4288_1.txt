After re-scheduling twice due to work hours, I'm happy Dr. RJ was able to fit me in for my dental check-up! My teeth look awesome after my cleaning! I definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for a dentist that is thorough, explains your treatment in a super simple way & is very easy going :)
