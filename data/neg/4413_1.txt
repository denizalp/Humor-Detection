My very picky Midwestern husband and three children enjoyed AZ Kabobs very much. We all split the family platter and appetizer sampler. Each plate was licked clean. We did substitute the gyro meat for the lamb. My one-year-old ate his weight in falafel. We will be going back soon - maybe tomorrow! Look for the Groupon too!
