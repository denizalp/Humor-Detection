FRIGGEN PHENOMENAL. Food was absolutely on point and the tall guy behind the counter was awesome. I'm writing this as I eat because I was too excited about how great the food was to let another minute go by without telling the world. I highly suggest the Jun special, it's an awesome sampler plate of all the goods.
