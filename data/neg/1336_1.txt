I'd say overall this pharmacy is just like all the rest. You have an order filled, pick it up and go. I do like the target pharmacy a little better just because they can fulfill our orders, Walmart can't. So you would just need to figure out if they can take your insurance or not.\n\nIf they can fulfill any insurance then it would be great and convenient.
