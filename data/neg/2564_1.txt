Love everything about this place. The staff is friendly and super efficient and the food is just so amazing and fresh. I honestly could eat here or any soho location every day. I wish there was one closer to Summerlin but hopefully soon they will have one. This place is my go to before I run my night time 5k or 10k. The protein and rice are perfect energy for me. Im a customer for life!
