Eastern European restaurant with good soups that your Slavic grandmother used to make. Every time I ate soup there it was good, salads are good, main entrees are great if you're into European food. As for me I don't enjoy them personally but my cl family did, like I said I only come here for soup. \n\nPrices are fair, waitresses are quick and friendly, always provide water with lemon, mint. Always see families, or bigger functions here always drinking and laughing loudly. Dim lights, good layout, feels like your family dining table. Drop by if you're missing European food.
