I used their online ordering because I was on my lunch break, very easy to use. The building was clean, friendly fast service, and the place was pretty busy for the lunch hour. I got the spicy tuna bowl with brown rice and it was delicious! Fresh tuna and veggies, and the portions are very generous for the low price. I got my sushi fix!
