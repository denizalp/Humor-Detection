7Skewers is one of the best restaurants in Bradford. They serve a piping hot loaf of herb bread at every table. The side salad with meals is fresh and the vinaigrette is sweet and savory. My go-to dish is the shawarma plate. Each piece is juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside. The portions are generous and the staff provide great service. Every dish is presented beautifully.\n\nI am thoroughly satisfied and impressed by 7Skewers. It is my new favorite place to eat nearby.
