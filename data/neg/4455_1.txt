Terrible experience, I'm surprised this place has any positive reviews. As many others have complained about in the other reviews, the owner is very crazy and rude. He yelled at my family when ordering and the food was terrible. The only reason they get any business is because of convenience since it's located next to the Strip. Soooo many other options around, please avoid this place.
