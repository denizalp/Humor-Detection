Visiting the area and wanted some good comfort food for breakfast. Found this place on yelp so decided to give it a try. Awesome! Staff is super friendly and attentive. We had John A as our server. He was great. Also he promoted the town and things to go and do in our travels! Food was really good, had the bissel breakfast a lot of food! Will come back for sure while we are in the area! Thanks!
