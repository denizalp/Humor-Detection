The Bellagio fountain is one of the best free shows in Vegas. My favorite place to watch the show is atop the the Eiffel Tower observatory during the day. At night you can see the gorgeous show from the patio of Chateau Nightclub :)\n\nAll the songs are classics or favorites and you will never be disappointed with this Must See Attraction!
