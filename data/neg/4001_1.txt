I stopped in alone for a couple of drinks and it happened to be gong Karaoke night. Though I believe this was a rather new and somewhat different offering than normal Karaoke there appeared to be many regulars in the audience who were supportive of one another. I like to keep moving so never required service though every time I went to the bar for a drink the busy bartender knew exactly what I was drinking and took care of me quickly. I was particularly enamored with the entertainment hostess Chondell. She is a gem.
