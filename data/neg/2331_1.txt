Jewel's is where gluten free tastes incredible!  Nothing has the grainy texture \"normal\" gluten free options do. Including that and a gorgeous menu of food and bakes goods is the best!  \n\nFeeling safe and knowing nothing I'm eating is cross contaminated is a HUGE positive plus!  Enjoy and explore their menu with delight!
