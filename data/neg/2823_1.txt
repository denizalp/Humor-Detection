Stayed here for 1 night during our visit to Arizona with a group of friends. Rooms were clean and quiet. Shower water pressure was low from the 5th floor. Gym was strangely detached from the rest of the hotel so you have to exit to get to the gym. All the equipment could be updated -- they seem pretty worn out. And I got lost trying to find it because there were signs everywhere inside the hotel hallways saying the Health Center was on the 2nd floor... Otherwise it was good for a Sheraton! The people were the nicest!
