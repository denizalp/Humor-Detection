Anyone that says this place is 5 star really doesn't know about great breakfast..I will give them the fact that everything was fast and service was good but it seems they just want to push orders out because it's so busy. I can't stand restaurants that do this..like if you have hashbrowns they come out all soggy and undercooked..you guys would be great if you focused on the food a little more because you already have the clientele and breakfast isn't that hard to make
