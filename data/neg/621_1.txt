Took the family here for the first time! The kids were so excited to customize their own donut.  The menu had so many great options. The donuts came of fresh and warm.  My son got salted Carmel with m&m's.  My daughter got strawberry shortcake.  My husband got chocolate covered cherry and I got salted Carmel.  We all enjoyed it very much. We will be back again for sure.
