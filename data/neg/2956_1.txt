Yummy drink, even though it was hot instead of iced, which I reminded the cashier\/barista about twice. She was more concerned about helping the flight crew behind me, and paying for \"Monica's\" cappuccino than getting my order correct.... that's why she had to ask me three times which muffin I ordered.. \n\nMaybe I'm just cranky due to my delayed flight, but I think having a full blown conversation with a different customer while in the midst of the current customer transaction (mine), is not cool. \n\nI should have just gone to look for a Tim Hortons instead...
