Sunnyside is a quaint little store with kind-hearted staff. Literally, 4 isles of food and a bit of produce. Not enough to fill all of my natural food needs but awesome for anyone living in the Kensington area or looking to build a picnic on the way to Riley Park. Much of the produce is locally grown and organic. The joint is also wind powered. If you think of it more as a convenience store rather than a market, there is absolutely nothing more that you could ask.
