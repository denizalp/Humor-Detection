Really good, my favourite is the salmon burrito (modified to accommodate an egg allergy). They accommodate allergies and have allergy menus attached to their regular menus. \n\nNote: if you have food allergies, make sure to remind them to change\/wash the knife! They use the same knife for all the sushi burritos, so there will be serious cross contamination if they don't change the knife.
