Finally found my waxing place!\n\nFriendly, clean, aesthetically soothing, and just because that's not enough, the prices are amazingly reasonable and might I say... inexpensive!\n\nJuliana gave me a wonderful treatment: she is so bubbly, professional and knowledgeable in her craft.  I didn't hesitate to ask her questions and she certainly knew what she was taking about.\n\nAlso, they offer package deals- so buy in advance and save yourself some cash!
