If I could give them a zero, I would... Today I spent over 4 hours to try and make an appointment, and no one answered the 3 times I tried.. This is outrageous.... I went into the office also before needing to reschedule because they lost my paperwork..while on crutches, and they said.... Well maybe we might have time within 3 hours that they can squeeze me in... Like I'm going to sit for three hours in hours in hopes that I get \"squeezed in\" just terrible ... Never would recommend them
