this is a cute, authentic mexican restaurant on the east side.. i came early in the day (1pm) service was quick.. food came out quick and my waitress was nice.. i had the red enchiladas cheese only.. the sauce wasn't authentic at all to me.. very tomato paste-y.. the fideo soup was great as was the salsa.. i just had higher expectations for the enchilada sauce :(
