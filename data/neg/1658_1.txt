Ordered their summer special (Pineapple poke bowl). Their staff said it was big enough for my bf and i to share. That wasnt the case, i would have finished it myself.\nRegardless the taste is very refreshing, fish are pretty fresh. It came down to the rice, the rice is soaked with pineapple juice since its served in a half pineappld shell. Its different but i dont like wet rice, just the texture of it seems weird to me. But overall the flavour is pretty decent. We chose to have wasabi mayo, actually goes well with the sweetness of pineapple.
