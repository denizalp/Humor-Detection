We hired 'A Way Home Moving' through Yelp for the Relocube moving help. Justin and his teammate were absolutely wonderful. They were fast, efficient, and highly organized. Seeing how they stack all items were almost mesmerizing. They ended up saving 2 cubic feet of trailer space than how I planned. Which was a big discount on my moving cost. I strongly recommend Justin and his crew! (Wish I could hire him again...)
