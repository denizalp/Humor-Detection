I'll echo what another reviewer said: 1 star is 1 too many. After two hours the movers never showed. First I was told they had picked up another \"quick job\" at MY SCHEDULED TIME and would be an hour late. One hour later they're still a no-show, so I call and am told to give them another 30 minutes. Thirty minutes later no one shows and I call and cancel. Despite all the haggling no one ever apologized. Moving is stressful enough. Save yourself the worry and AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.
