Seriously the best dinner I've had in Las Vegas. The cheese and meat sampler dish was worth it alone. The menu is huge and the portions are pretty large too. Wild mushroom risotto and pumpkin gnocchi were our entrees and they rocked. I can't wait to go back. Forget the expensive places on the strip. This spot is worth the drive.
