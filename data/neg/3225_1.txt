I contacted this law firm as colleague inquiring about a mutual case. Two people got on the speaker phone and one went off on some crazed foul mouth rant accusing me of acting, I guess, too congenial. It was one of the strangest and most unprofessional interactions I have had in my twenty-year business career in this town. There is no excuse for this behaviour and I would without question suggest you stay far away from this firm for your legal needs. There is no way somebody so irrational, uncouth, and uncomposed can handle important legal matters effectively.
