Came for lunch while here on business.  Very quiet at the time, and the interior was very nice.  Waitress was attentive and kept our drinks filled.  I was unimpressed by the sampling I had of my neighbor's special of the day (scallops with truffle aioli), but my french dip sandwich was stuffed with quality roast beef, and the herb butter and bread they give at the beginning was dangerously addicting.  Prices are a trifle high for lunch, but it was very nice experience.
