Definitely coming back here. The staff was friendly and checked up on my to make sure everything was alright. I only wish there were more outlets so I could do homework, but I understand why. I ordered the cauliflower tacos after seeing all the great reviews for them and loved them. My food came very quickly. I also had a small hot chai latte with almond milk that was delicious.
