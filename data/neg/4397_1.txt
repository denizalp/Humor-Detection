Well our unit broke again. The guy came just a few months ago to do our last free tune up. He said everything looked good and now this morning we wake up to a freezing house with a two weeks old baby freaking out. So now that's three repairs in 2 years. We will not be having Alaskan fix the problem this time. They charged way too much last time for something that is their fault. Horrible company.
