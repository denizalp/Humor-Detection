My husband and I have been going here for a few years.  It's truly one of the best.  I've tried many dishes.  Sushi rolls, Wok entrees, etc.  never had a bad meal (or lunch).  Mia is awesome.  My grandson is 18 months and she and her staff are always so kind.  We go there all the time and plan to keep in going.
