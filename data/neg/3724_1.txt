Okay I'm not very big on Chili's style restraunts.  But having said that, I had a pretty good time there on Saturday. Bryan (the bartendar), and Brad (the manager) do a good job over there.  They treat everyone like regulars and make sure you have every thing you need to enjoy your visit. Thanks guys!
