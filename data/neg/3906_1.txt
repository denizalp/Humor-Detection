Went for the dinner buffet. Was able to get it comped from playing the my Vegas slots game on Facebook. Their crab legs were on point! Thy had cold and warm ones. The variety of different foods were great and desserts was a great variety. I might be biased because I was comped but it was not bad. Id say your average buffet, one step above Luxor and Excalibur
