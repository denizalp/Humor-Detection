Good clean room. The room had a fridge, microwave, and a flat screen television. \n\nIncluded in the stay is a complimentary breakfast and free wifi internet access. \n\nI would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a hotel.  The only two \"cons\" would be that it does not have a pool, something you might consider if you have children and the TV signal is not high definition. They are however very minor points.
