What an amazing place.  My wife and I shared some crispy egg rolls as our appetizer, for our main course she got the chicken fried rice and I got the shaken beef.  I can't believe how tender the beef was and the onions to black pepper ratio was amazing.  I noticed people expressed concern for the small amount of the chili sauce they give you; they now give you the whole bottle.  My wife liked it so much she said she wants to meet her father here later in the week.
