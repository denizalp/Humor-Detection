It's sort of an undesirable location, but the restaurant itself is a neat concept.  Made to order, hole-in-the-wall vibe, no need for a server, and all the toppings you need atop a wagon in the middle of the place. The prices are decent and the hamburger...works (like that play on words?) I enjoyed it and would recommend eating here over chains such as Red Robin and Chili's (on most nights).
