Finally got to try Roots Farm Food last night at the Passport to NoDa food truck rally. It was worth the wait! I tried their sliders. I got the 14 hour smoked beef brisket. Yum! I also tried the pork belly slider. Again yum! They were super friendly too! I look forward to catching up with them again in the near future for some more delicious food! A nice added touch, they through in an extra slider for my wife's birthday!!! You just can't beat great customer service.
