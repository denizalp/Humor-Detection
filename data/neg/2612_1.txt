Our group of five wanted a classic American breakfast. This place delivered. \n\nWe decided to eat outside on the patio , this was not a hassle for anyone. Service was great and everyone had coffee that was full at all times. \n\nI had the 2x2x2 which was there 2 pancakes 2 eggs  and 2 bacon . Fluffy pancakes what more can a man ask for with warm syrup. Win.
