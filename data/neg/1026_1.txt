Happy Mothers Day at Hob Nobs! Bloody Mary's, Mimosa, coffee, and nomlicious food! Yes I made that word up. The margarita pizza - add avocado and balsamic reduction was so good we were full and still ate the whole thing. Perfect weather and beautiful to sit on the patio. Our moms even got roses as a nice surprise!
