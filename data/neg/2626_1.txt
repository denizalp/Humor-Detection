I have lived in Camden Stoncrest since September and I have to say this place is very nice. Beautiful pool, great staff, nice landscaping, it is a very welcoming feeling. The few issues I have had were taken care of in a very timely manner. The location is great, a little bit annoying that you cant take a left out of the apartments but you get used to it. I would recommend these apartments to anyone.
