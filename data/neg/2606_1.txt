Ordered tom yum and glass noodle soup for appetizers this cold evening -both were excellent.\nPineapple fried rice and Penang curry we ordered were very good; not the best but certainly good. The curry had a kick despite having ordered mild. This is not a damper on the taste however.\nOne MUST try the fried banana with ice cream. That was the best part of the meal.\nAmbiance was great as well as the service, considering I had a rambunctious toddler in tow. \nA great place for Thai in the area, reliably good!
