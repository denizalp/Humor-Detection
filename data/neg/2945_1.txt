World's smallest bar! I kept seeing Hef's and was excited to finally go there. Total let down. The staff was friendly but the drinks just weren't good. The couple next to us kept raving about how much they loved Hef's so I really wanted to love it too, but it just fell short. I did not use to bathroom, but my guy friend did. It's bad when I dude come back from the bathroom and says \"Call the CDC. We should geet out of here\".
