Cheap eats worth a ride from the Strip, nice selection of the basics plus an unique Asian section with lumpia and oxtails, never seen that at The Buffet at the Wynn. Sign up for their card and save another buck! Nothing fancy but solid food. We also lucked out to get lamb chops, that were most excellent.
