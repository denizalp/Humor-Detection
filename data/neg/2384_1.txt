Finally tried Stumpy's Pizza after hearing good things about the food. We like to support neighborhood businesses, so we gave the pizza delivery service a shot. We ordered \"the works\" pizza, Spicy BBQ wings, and the Veggie Calzone. All of the food was hot, delicious, and promptly delivered by a friendly face. Will definitely give Stumpy's another go in the future.
