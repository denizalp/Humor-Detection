The place was nice and it was a fun escape room. My only dislike is the amount of people they cram into a small room. I went with a group of four and we were paired with a group of six. The room was very small which made it hard to move around. Plus the other group wasn't very good at sharing the clues so it made it a less enjoyable experience.
