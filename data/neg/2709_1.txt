Saw another roach in this place.  Do they not clean up good enough that now the last two times, a roach has been in tbe main walkway. I hope they aren't in the food, too.  Lost my appetite.  Maybe the exterminator\/ pest service needs to be called more often.  And maybe the health inspector isn't catching what they ought to be.  \n\nBoth times I told the gal at the register and the response is, \"oh, that's not good.\"  They said they'd tell the manager, but it doesn't seem to be doing much. \n\nDon't think I want to return.
