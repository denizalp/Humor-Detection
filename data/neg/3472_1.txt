I love this place. Feels just like home. I love their Laos style papaya salad and their desserts (nam wan) when they do have it. FYI, Laotians love spicy food... So if you love the food and still want that perfect combination of spicy and being able to enjoy your papaya... Order it with spice level \"less than medium\" lol
