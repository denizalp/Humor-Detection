So I came into this thinking that I would literally die of awesome because it had come so highly recommended and it had always been on my \"to try\" list.\n\nI guess for some huge carnivores this place would be a huge godsend because omg meat meat meat but I honestly thought that the food was just okay. The combo plate meat was meaty and delicious but the mac & cheese that came on the side was insanely salty -- not exactly even meal quality.\n\nOverall...overrated and not worth going out of my way for.
