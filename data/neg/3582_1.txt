My girlfriend took me here for my birthday. 4-stars for the food, but I'm giving it 3 for the cost. It is really pricey, and it's unfortunate that one needs to spend this much money to have a quality meal in Scottsdale. The dishes were excellent and well plated. The wines were nice but not spectacular (not worth the $60 add-on to the pre-fixe menu). I would go back, but I'd go back a lot more if it were cheaper.
