I am updating my review to include catering. \nI ordered Kufta\/Macaroni\/Grape leaves\/stuffed Zucchini\/Bamia\/ emjadara\/ lentil soap\/ Konafa with walnut \/kalayat bandora \/maamol and Harisa. \nMy guests were all impressed and they all agreed this is the best Arab restaurant in the USA. \nThis is authentic home cooking that's no different than back home. \nThe price is affordable but the quality is superior-best middle eastern -Arab food in Vegas. \nI have been to all the others and none are close in quality. \nThis is the #1 Arab restaurant in Vegas.
