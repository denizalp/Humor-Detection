It doesn't get better than this!!!  Our family has been coming here for years.  My son has completed round one of his braces, I currently have a set on my teeth and my daughter is getting hers removed as I type this review.  Dr Couser is wonderful and his staff at both locations are friendly.  Insurance or NO insurance Couser Orthodontics Has affordable options for everyone.  I strongly recommend getting your braces done here!
