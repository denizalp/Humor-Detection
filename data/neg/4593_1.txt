Came here after many bad experiences at other salons. Saw that there was great reviews and I liked a lot of the pictures on the Yelp account so I decided to give it a go. I absolutely love my hair and received so many compliments! Stacy really listened and paid attention to what I wanted. My hair came out perfect, exactly how I wanted and I couldn't be happier. I will definitely be coming here regularly!
