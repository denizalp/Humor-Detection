This place is terrific. Everything is fresh, the service is friendly and fast.\n\nThe carnitas tacos are some of the best I've had (and I've had a lot, being a San Diego native). They also have a great special deal on 3 taquitos + quesadilla. The cheese is fresh and flavorful.\n\nI'm not a shrimp eater, but my wife loves the various shrimp dishes and she is very picky about them, so they must be good.\n\nI would recommend this to my pickiest Mexican Food friends.
