All the staff are so fast, efficient, respectful and care about everything. From the moment I walked in I was taken to the back and taken care of. They're amazing and I definitely had worse expectations. I can tell they actually take time to hire the best staff. Unlike UMC where we had to wait almost 7 hours for an ultrasound.
