1st time here. Waited over an hour for food. Not the start, between the salad and meal. And when when my order arrived, it was wrong. I ordered salmon and shrimp. I received salmon and chicken. Not a good look at all. And my veggies were skimpy. My friend that was visiting from out of town's meal was incorrect (asked for no zucchini) but plentiful. Took so long, had to take food to go. Our server was too busy flirting to care about refilling our drinks. I barely got an apology. Wont be back.
