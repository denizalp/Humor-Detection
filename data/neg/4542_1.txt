Yums! Planned to eat here upon arrival in Henderson, NV the night before the 25th Las Vegas Bowl. Let's go Aztecs! As expected, the food is fantastic. Ordered the Ceviche de Pescado (pictured) I have to stop writing this review and eat the ceviche before my husband gobbles it all up. Also devoured the Yuquitas Fritas before moving on to entrees, Tallarines Verdes con carne (pictured) and  Arroz con mariscos. Residents in this area should become regulars, if not already. Passing through, definately worth stopping by for the best Latin Cuisine.
