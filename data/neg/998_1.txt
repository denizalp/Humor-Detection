Not happy at all with my stay this time. I have stayed here multiple times for work but this time I was placed in a small wing of rooms off the conference rooms. Rooms 200's.  When you open the door to the wing there was a strong smell of sewer gases that went all the way into the rooms.  A hotel like this should never have this issue.  For two days in a row the room was not\nCleaned appropriately.  The beds were half made and towels were not replaced.   Never seen anything like this.  Very bad performance Sheraton.
