Tried this place out during a normal weekday lunch. Typical Chinese buffet-- pretty cheap price, good amount of variety for the hot foods, semi fresh foods with bad presentation. Very limited sushi and had nothing raw; but at least the sushi rice tasted better than most other buffet places! Place was pretty clean and their service was good. One of their buffet tables had a weird fishy seafood smell-- almost made me lose my appetite. Also, buffet quality ice cream is included during lunch service! May come for their dinner service to try it out.
