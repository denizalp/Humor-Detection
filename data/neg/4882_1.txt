On our Direct flight from Las Vegas to Austin\nFirst we were delayed 1 hour now they just announced another 45 min many longer seriously  does anyone know anything about this crappy airline.\nNo wonder south west is wired the best airline year after year. Don't fall for their cheap prices after you add everything from Carry on back to\nSeat to drinks to checked  bags you can fly private for goodness sake. First and last time
