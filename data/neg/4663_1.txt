Taste-wise, they deserve five stars. But the issue I have is that it's just not enough food for the price. Like, I'm not asking for more meat... but give me more than a spoonful of Spanish rice PLEASE! \n...speaking of which, the rice and beans are amazing considering their simplicity.\n\nBut BEWARE... that cold, green sauce they give you when you sit down is super spicy! I underestimated it.
