This place could easily be 4 stars for me if the dishes weren't so salty. We ordered the basil pad Thai, bass fillet with cashew nut sauce (breaded btw) and pineapple fried rice. It was amazing the first couple of bites then the salt really started to settle...\nService was good and atmosphere is nice!
