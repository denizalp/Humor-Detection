Went here because the Vietnamese place across the street is closed on Mondays.  Pho was very delicious.  Lots of depth of flavour.  Smokey and you could smell the spices.  Better than average.  Rice noodle bowl was meh.  Noodles with thicker than I'm used to and the grilled pork was hard and chewy.  Would definitely return for the pho though.  They take debit which is a plus too.
