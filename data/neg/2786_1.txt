Hidden gem located in Brampton's industrial area (Rutherford and Glidden). Food is authentic Dhaba style. (Dhaba = highway\/roadside eatery). Takes a while for them to prepare food, but it's worth the wait. Chana Masala, Kofta, Baingan Bharta are veg favourites along with Garlic Naan. Tadka Daal is also very delicious. The ambience is downmarket, but family friendly. Prices are very reasonable. Must try for those who crave typical Dhaba food that's open late on weekends.
