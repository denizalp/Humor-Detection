We wanted a close cheap restaurant to Encore and this was the best option. The menu is pretty limited. The decor and the ambiance of the restaurant was however beautiful! We were seated for 10 minutes before anyone even greeted us. The servers were all over the place like lost lil sheep. The food was alright but not worth what we paid.
