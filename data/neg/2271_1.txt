OMG! This was our first time here and thanks to yelp we found Jimmy & Joes! We were craving pizza and boy did this hit the spot.  My fiance got the Serious slice, which was seriously big and so tasty.  I got the calzone and holy cow is it huge! Best to share with someone unless you got a mean appetite.  All in all really really good stuff!
