Just had lunch here the other day and so enjoyed it. I personally love Indian food and was so excited to see a new Indian place opening up near us. We both had the tikka masala and were happily impressed with how tender and juicy the chicken was and how perfectly creamy and spicy the sauce was. We also really liked the decor. For sure worth a try!
