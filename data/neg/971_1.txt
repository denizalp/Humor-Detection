We've been waiting in line for over an hour. A party of about 50 people with \"line passes\" have cut the entire line. No employees have given us any information as to how much longer the wait will be or when we will be seated. There's zero communication between the employees and the patrons standing in line waiting. We got here at 6:45pm because we have tickets to a 9:30pm show. It's 8pm now and we still haven't been seated. This is pretty ridiculous and disappointing. We've been looking forward to eating here.
