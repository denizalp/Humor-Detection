Went to have lunch with my wife on our day off and was really looking forward to trying the food. We showed up at 11:05 and the door was still locked. The girl standing beside the restaurant worked there but couldn't get in as the owner hadn't shown up yet. We waited five more minutes and when he still wasn't there, we left. Extremely disappointed that we planned to eat at Oya on our day off only to have them not show up for work. Don't make plans to eat here. They may not open for you.
