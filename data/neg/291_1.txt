Called around and found this to be the best price I could find. The owner took the time to explain my options when I got there and wasn't pushy at all. When I finally chose decided which I wanted to go with he said it would be about 1.5 hours. To my surprise he came back in a little over and hour and said it was done. The tint looked great without having to spend too much money.
