This is one of the best finds out there!  Ab is an amazing host that makes you feel at home and recommends the perfect dish every time. The kibbeh balls are awesome, the hand made lemonade with spearmint is to die for. Honestly, whatever you choose you will not be disappointed. Try them out once, and all you will do is crave their food till the next time you go in!  I highly recommend this place and will be back often.
