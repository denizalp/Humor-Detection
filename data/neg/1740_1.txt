A diamond in the rough, Papaya Thai is good eating. Whether using a groupon or a new experience, the food is good, the staff humble, and the fish tanks enjoyable almost as much as the tv's. We've been here several times, and have never had a bad experience. We hope you enjoy it here as much as we do....
