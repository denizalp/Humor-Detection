My wife finally talked me into going here. Fish tacos...how cliche I said. And I was right. Good but nothing to make me say, I need to come back here. I had the fish (duh) although they do have chicken,beef, etc., and it was good but again, nothing super awesome. They have some decent beans too, I always lean towards the black beans.\nHonestly, I'd come back, it's not expensive and you know what you'll get anyway and sometimes that's all you need.
