I can't give enough stars to just how awesome this hotel is. My family and I enjoyed the wonderful hot breakfast buffet and the evening get togethers in the lobby. Coffee for us and milk and cookies for our daughter were always available. The rooms were decent size and very clean. Well maintained. It was one of the best stays we have ever had in a hotel. Definitely will stay again.
