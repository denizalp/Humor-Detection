Typical Hampton, clean, friendly staff, great decor, comfortable rooms.  Good got breakfast.  There are plenty of places to eat in the area.  Our visit was to go to Thompson Peak Medical Center and this was the closest hotel.  The only negative was we checked in early to choose our room on our second visit and to limit our walking and it was not ready so we were given another with a longer walk.
