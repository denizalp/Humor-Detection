The baker for this location quit a few months ago (August 15), the owner decided to bake the Donuts in his Tempe shop and drop some of the selection.  Well one of the Donuts dropped was the lightly fried,  Raspberry Jelly filled with a powdered sugar coating - my favorite kind.   That sucks!  They still have good service but the Donuts are not fresh and since they don't carry my Fav - I stopped going !!!\nNow their just another Donut shop - Just OK!
