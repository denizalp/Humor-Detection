Had Victor's Stree Tacos (chicken tacos). Very tasty, the roasted-red salsa is so very good.\n\nThe fun fact is the menus are on thick wooden clipboards - great for their novelty, these won't blow away in the wind! The misters are nice for the outdoors, kind of like patio heaters except for the desert.
