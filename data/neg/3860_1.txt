This was our first time visiting this restaurant and I have to say we absolutely loved it\nThe appetizers are wonderful and by the time we got our main meal we were stuffed. Lots of food and the drinks were delicious. Also Happy Hour was a great price. Staff was very kind and friendly. We are from California and have already decided that next time we are in Vegas we will be stopping by Juan's Flaming Fajitas.
