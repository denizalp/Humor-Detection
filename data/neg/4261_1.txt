If you have a chance to see a show at Don Bluth Front Row Theatre, do it.  I have seen 3 or 4 shows here and I have enjoyed each one.\n\nOn 1\/15\/16 I saw \"The Producers\" and I have not laughed so much in a long time.  It was well put together and the actors were wonderful.\n\nIt is a small, intimate theatre tucked in the very back of a Strip mall.  Kind of hard to find but well worth it.
