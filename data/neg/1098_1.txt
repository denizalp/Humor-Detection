Morning crew was 50% nice and 50% just rude. The girl had asked me if I was high and it's 1030 am this is early for some of us but she cut me off when I was trying to make small y'all since it was so dry and no eye contact to greeting Idk I just know my service today at this location was beyond low then what Starbucks has it set to. When she gave me my cash back then she was smiling and trying to compliment my daughter as if I would even think about tipping her.
