Walking into Freedom Cycle is a great experience. I've know Mark(owner) for a long time, but his employees didn't know me. I felt very welcomed like they had known me forever. Junior(other Mark) was very helpful and had me in and out quickly to drop off my bike. \nI would HIGHLY recommend this shop for any of your bike needs, they have no problems working on my Harley.....i'll never go back to a Harley dealership again!
