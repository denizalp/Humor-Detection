We had the Gaucho steak and egg sandwich and the bacon, egg, and cheese. Delicious. There was a large amount of thick-sliced, very tender steak, plus nice cilantro flavor in the chimichurri sauce. The BEC had a huge amount of bacon. Buns were buttery. Eggs perfectly runny. Only waited 10-15 mins at 8:30 on a Thursday. Great brekkie but wouldn't want to wait much more than that. Found two seats.
