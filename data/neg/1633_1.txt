We went here for breakfast our first day in our most recent trip to Vegas.  It didn't seem the same quality as when we came here for our honeymoon (almost 13 years ago) but the price was right.  For $20 we got a decent buffet with a good selection but the best thing was what has to be considered a secret (considering there was no line at 10 am): unlimited bloody Mary's\/wine\/mimosas were included!  If you're looking for a great way to start your day, this is it!
