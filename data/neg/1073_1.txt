I was disappointed in Olive and Ivy. I ordered the chicken salad and about halfway through I noticed that there was not any chicken in it. I was eating at the bar and mentioned it to the bar tender and she just seemed to shrug it off. She did not offer to bring me a new one or at least some chicken.
