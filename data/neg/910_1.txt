This is a great pub! We often stop here for early dinner with the kids when we are visiting my mom and the service is always friendly. A few times we have made this the meeting place for a night out to meet up with friends and family... everyone always seems to enjoy their food and the staff always accommodate our large group. It is what it is ... a pub ! A really great pub!
