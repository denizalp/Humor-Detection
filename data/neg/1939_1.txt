This office makes zero effort to communicate with patients when they LAST MINUTE decide to close their shot clinics for a \"meeting\" aka Golden Knights game!  Instead of honesty or e-mail or text alert of any changes, they lie about a \"meeting\" for Dr. Tottori & PA Chu. We live far & have been with clinic over 3 years! After closing 4 days for Memorial Day, we needed the shot clinic hours advertised. Good healthcare is finding a replacement who doesn't care about hockey, pay them to fill in for patient care.  Moving on...
