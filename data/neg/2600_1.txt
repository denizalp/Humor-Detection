I gave this place 1 star because of the materials they stock. They have pretty much anything one needs for steel stock. That said, the customer service is appalling. Started dealing with one of the counter help, he walks off mid conversation to bullshit with another employee. So, I start dealing with a different guy, this prick comes back and gives me attitude? This was the second, and last time I will spend money here. I'll pay a little more to deal with decent folks who actually want my business...
