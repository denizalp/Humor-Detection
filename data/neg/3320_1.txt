Jeff cleaned our windows inside and out, and cleaned the screens and tracks as well. My windows are sparkling, and the tracks and bug screens are super clean. He was friendly, thorough, and efficient. He also helped me determine what I need in terms of sun screen replacements. I'll definitely be using him again in the future.
