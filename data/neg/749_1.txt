I went in with no appointment for a wheel alignment.  They seemed busy, but I was still out in under an hour.\n\nThe salesperson informed me of my responsibilities to keep the warranty on my service in tact.\n\nHopefully the alignment was done properly. I will update if anything goes wrong, but very happy right now.
