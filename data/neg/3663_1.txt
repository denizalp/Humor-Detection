The PBJ burger was so good!!! I only wished I lived closer and it wasn't $17 for a sandwich. But it did taste really good. The chili potato tornado was good too. I prefer fries though. And the truffle Mac and cheese was just okay. I'll be back though whenever I'm in the area and definitely recommend the burger!
