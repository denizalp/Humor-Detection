Visited on A Wed morning around 8:30am and our group of 4 didn't have to wait too long for our super yumminess to come out looking beautiful and tasting delicious.  I went with Fresh Berry and it was delightful.   My one tiny complaint and why it's not 5 stars, is some of the blueberries still had stems stuck in them, which is not a nice surprise.  That minor lack of attention to detail was a little bothersome when I had to inspect every bite to make sure I didn't end up with stems stuck in my throat or teeth.
