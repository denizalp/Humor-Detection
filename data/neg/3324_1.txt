You will find cafe TO in Montreal, not Toronto. The cafe is on the ground level of Alexis Nihon and offers a decent selection of sandwiches, cakes and breakfast items. As I work in the Alexis Nihon complex I often find myself wandering downstairs in the morning and picking up a bagel or something at Cafe TO. \n\nAs part of the recent renovations at Alexis Nihon the cafe has received a brand new location and now has a dedicated seating area directly in front of the counter.
