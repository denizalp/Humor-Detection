Delicious!!! Very friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere. I could, well I do eat here every week! From pizza to salads and gelato everything is always great and I am never disappointed.\nAs I was reading some other reviews, they do actually do carry out, although yes it is the best straight from the oven.\nAsk about the chef's special..it is a treat for sure!\nI would recommend this anyone who is a fan of pizza. Great location, amazing food and a great staff
