Beautiful ambience, fantastic food and great service. Fabulous Happy Hour options 5-6-7pm or the 7-8-9pm. Different food offers & drink specials. I highly recommend the ahi tuna tacos and the lobster lettuce wraps topped with crispy pancetta. The creme brûlée is to die for, topped with fresh seasonal berries and house made whip cream. Italian coffee too...Lavazza. I will be back for a steak dinner. I have no doubt it will be delicious!!
