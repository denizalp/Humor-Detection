The owners are very nice and friendly. I can see that they are really trying to make the business work.\nI'm personally not a fan of lining up for a popular restaurant. I like places that I can make a reservation and sit in a quiet environment. My husband really wanted to try the place, so we lined up for about 0.5 hrs, which I think it's not worth the time. \nThe food still has a lot of room for improvement.
