SushiSamba offers high quality food and ingredients but it was all underwelming. My group of friends did the $50 per person and while some of the dishes were good, nothing was amazing. For the total we paid (+$500), there could have been some amazingness incorporated and we could have been a bit more full leaving the restaurant. The sushi platter was petite in quantity as well as size of the pieces. The decor was probably the best part about the experience, artsy and contemporary. I guess when it comes to sushi, I'll have to \"fish\" for the traditional.
