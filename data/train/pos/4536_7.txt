I've got to give a bit of a downgrade, because I love this place, but there is one ass who works there who, when I was pregnant,  consistently, and pointedly asked me if I \"want a decaf\" when I ordered my banana in the tailpipe smoothie, which has a shot of espresso.    Even if moderate amounts of caffeine weren't totally okay for pregnant ladies (at least if you believe sources such as Mother risk, run by the Hospital for Sick Children), please keep your barista-ing out of my uterus.  THANKS.
