Just heard about this place a couple days ago, my friends had it at their house and it smelled soooo divine man. I decided to try it out today and I'm so glad I did. First, the service was great (shout out to Billy and Kevin), the food was amazing and the price affordable. The food is so flavorful without the overbearing garlic taste and smell like at some other places! When you go, go ahead and make it a combo, you won't regret it. I can see myself visiting often!
