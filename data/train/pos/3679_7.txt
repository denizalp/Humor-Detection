Tasty, clean, friendly service and accommodating. I ordered the chicken salad salad. They didn't have caesar dressing so I settled for buttermilk ranch. It was tasty. My colleagues were satisfied with their sandwiches and salads. Some were in shock at how big their sandwich was. The pastrami sandwich looks amazing. I plan on getting that next time. FYI that Zappos chips are sold here.
