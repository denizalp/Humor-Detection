Since I had some time to kill before a meeting I decided to stop here since my car needed a wash. The line was pretty short and seemed to be moving Farley quickly so that was great as well. The lot was clean and I liked that the heat fans actually dried my suv pretty well. Usually I leave with my windows still dripping with water.  The vacuums did a decent job, but I'll stick to my local car wash.
