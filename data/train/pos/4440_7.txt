I had a great time here, but I wouldn't necessarily go back in a hurry as this is on the list of \"Bars My Ex-Boyfriend Used To Drag Me To.\" It's a tight space but the music is good and you'd do well to come here for a birthday celebration or work drinks. When I left my favourite cashmere cardigan behind in a drunken, debaucherous blackout, the staff was kind enough to set it aside and open early so I could come and pick it up the following weekend.
