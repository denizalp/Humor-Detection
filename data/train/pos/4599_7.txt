Ok, it's a J in the B.  Stupid to write a review.  But I rarely eat fast food and almost NEVER J in the B.  \n\nDuring a recent adventure in S Phoenix, I was in need of some lunch and this was the only place around.  Well, this and a Whattaburger, so my choices were pretty limited.\n\nWow.  This place is CLEAN.  And the woman who took my order was both FRIENDLY and COMPETENT.  My order came out QUICKLY and was CORRECT.\n\nAll things I usually never experience at fast food joints, or at least all at once.  5 stars.
