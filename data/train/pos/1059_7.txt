Sandwiches aren't anything special and the owner can be a bit rude to people - then afterwards he'll come up and be nice once you're sitting down eating.  Kind of like getting beat up by your boyfriend and the next day he sends you flowers.  Additionally, the 4% surcharge for credit card use is inexcusable - go to Subway or Ray's around the corner, this place sucks.
