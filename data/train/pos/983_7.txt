Great atmosphere as cool as you get. Really friendly service. All in all something to remember.\nDO IT ONCE... food is really not edible. We went with six people and went out for food after as so much was really really bad. We wanted to love it and bring friends back but.. the food was so far below acceptable you wonder what the owner is thinking. We didn't expect gourmet but we did expect passable which it was not .\n\nTruly mixed , go enjoy and make another reservation to eat after you leave
