This is what a great neighborhood bodega should be: cheap, easy, and full of things you need when you haven't prepared for such a need. \n\nIts just down the street from the house, the owners\/employees are cool as hell, and did I mention its cheap? Make sure you remember that, because its cheaper than Circle K or 7\/11, which are just up the road. \n\nAlways good to see local businesses making it happen, and I am stoked this is in my neighborhood.\n\nDamn, I just used \"stoked\" in a review. Someone revoke my \"not a douche\" card.
