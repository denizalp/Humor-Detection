To say that we've been waiting for a grocery store down these parts is an understatement. About a decade after it was supposed to open as a Vons, we finally have something down in Mountain's Edge.\n\nNo point going into too many details. No one decides where to buy groceries by looking on Yelp. It's a supermarket. It's minutes from my house. It's brand new, wide open, and clean.\n\nI didn't win on Monopoly. Four stars.
