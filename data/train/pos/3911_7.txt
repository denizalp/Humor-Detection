Gratuitous review to get an FTR... FTW! Yes, I need an intervention.\n\nI stopped by this gas station on the way to the Lake Las Vegas CMYE last month. My car was badly in need of gas (which is why one usually stops at a gas station), and horrendously in need of a car wash (due to my insane solo trip through 50+ miles of dirt gravel road out at Death Valley).\n\nTerrible Herbst #277 (if that's your real name) remedied both of those situations. Good job, Terrible Herbst #277!
