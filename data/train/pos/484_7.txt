Yet another restaurant that makes me wish there was a two and a half star category.... there really needs to be an \"adequate\" rating that lies between two star \"I've had better\" and three star \"A-OK.\"  \n\nWe had pho and banh xeo.  The pho was adequate but not outstanding.  The banh xeo was mediocre at best and quite expensive for what you're actually getting.\n\nNot a lot to say about it really.  Fine if you're in the neighborhood and craving a bowl of pho and don't feel like driving to Chandler for better food.
