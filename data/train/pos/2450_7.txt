While I'm not a fan of most corporation pet stores, I do like this place because of the adoption centers they have. You can always catch me in the back by the kitty room, playing with all the cats that I probably end up adopting sooner or later.\n\nI wish they served more organic type, healthy pet foods. Most of it is popular brand name garbage that isn't even good for your pets.
