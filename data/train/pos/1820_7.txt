Seriously this place is trying to scam people. Do not think they will honor your online reservation. A credit cards only operation, full of fees and policies designed to wear out the customer. Wave after wave of travelers make for long lines of grumpy customers by design. Expensive, frantic decisions at the service counter can be the end result of the endless BS storm this company shovels. Don't feel like an idiot walking out when they try and shit on you. There are other options.\n\nIf you're reading this post, you deserve to rent elsewhere.
