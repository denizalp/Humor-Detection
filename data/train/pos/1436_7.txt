Hated this place. i schedule my appointment first thing in the morning because i needed to have the rest of my day free. Apparently the only person that had keys was about 30 minutes late. it seem like the whole staff was huddle on the side of the building but it took at leas 15 min for anybody to come and tell me what was going on. The appointment didn't go that great either. the Technitian  treated me like an idiot because i had questions... never again.
