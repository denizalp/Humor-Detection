I go here today for the first time with my mouth set on a order of the throw it in the bag and not only was the \"hostess\" less than enthused to be there let alone pleased to see me walk thru the door she informed me that was on the old menu and didn't bother to throw out a alternative...needles to say I ended up going to teriyaki madness
