I'm on a mission to try every Marie Callender's pie during their $6.99 pie month.\n\nThis trip I purchased a Banana Cream pie to go -That makes  2 this weekend-Chocolate Cream & Banana Cream .\n\nThe banana was better-I love the real banana pieces.\n\nNext trip I may have to try the German Chocolate or Coconut Cream.
