I wasn't a very big fan of Ruby Tuesday's, but I am still sad to see it closed, just another Mill Ave memory. The salad bar was sub par at best, but they did have decent turkey burgers. They had really cheap drinks for happy hour, but the atmosphere in the place was so crappy it wasn't worth chugging them down there. I'm surprised Ruby held on as long as she did on Mill.
