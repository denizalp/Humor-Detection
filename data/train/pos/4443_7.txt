I've been here twice now, the first time my girl did a very good job, however this more recent time China(hopefully I'm not misspelling her name) gave me one of the best if not the best haircut I've ever had. Not to mention it was accompanied by conversation that I actually enjoyed, as typically I dislike small talk, and since I know absolutely nothing about hair care, she recommended me some shampoo and such that I've really liked.\n\nI'll definitely be back!
