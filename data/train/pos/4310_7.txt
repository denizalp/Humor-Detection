Stopped in yesterday and asked if they could take US Dollar, she said yes.\nBut would not recognize the exchange rate.\nAs a franchise, I assume that each location would make it's own decision in recognizing foreign currency exchange rates. But all across Canada?\nSo for every current US $1 I lose .20 cents.
