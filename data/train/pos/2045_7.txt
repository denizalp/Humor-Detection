A great gym. The facilities are fresh and comfortably arranged. The two pools are quite vast, with an indoor and outdoor option. The change rooms host a sauna, stream room and lounge with all the necessary amenities. There is even a bathing suite drying machine!\n\nYoga class on weds evening is great, but stay away so I have more room to move! \n\nOn second thought, this gym is horrible, never go here... I mean it's so far north anyway. Not worth the drive.
