This is a very clean facility. The management is friendly and helpful, and the rates are reasonable. We got a better rate by signing up online -- and when we needed to make a change, the management was very helpful and did that for us. We only needed the storage for a short time, and the process of discontinuing with them was easy and fast. I highly recommend this public storage facility.
