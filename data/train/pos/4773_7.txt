The husband and I went to Taj Mahal for a YUE. I had never tried Indian food before, but he was a little familiar. I loved everything I tried! Garlic Naan is now a craving for me. The service was great and so was the company  - I had the pleasure of sitting with Audrey W and Jim W, Gabi K and her lovely fiance, Jared, and Kim and Adam. \nLovely conversation, awesome food, can't wait to go back!\nWe tried: Veggie Pakora, Tandoori Chicken, Garlic Naan and Chicken Korma. Yum!
