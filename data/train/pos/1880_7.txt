Update: texted her from 10 minutes away and she replied promptly, saying I could come in. Love how convenient this location is, right off the 51 and Thomas. Got my eyebrows and upper lip done today (first time free with Yelp checkin) and it was less painful than when I do it myself. Excellent work and great prices! Still highly recommend visiting Farida.
