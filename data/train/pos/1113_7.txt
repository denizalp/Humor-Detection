I went to a movie and spent one dollar. That's really all that needs to be said. A lot of the same females who complain if there is a dark spot under a rug in their $20 AirBnb room complain about this theater. If you want a $13.50 experience, Harkins is just around the corner. If you're really going to be a cry baby about popcorn prices and how the place is not immaculate, you need to grow up and shut up.
