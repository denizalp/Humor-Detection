The best threading salon in Las Vegas! I was very fortunate to find this location since moving from Chicago where there is a street dedicated to most of these type of businesses. The salon is clean and is a pleasant environment. Susan maintains my unruly eyebrows and keeps them in perfect shape just the way I like them!
