Found an amazing package on Groupon for the gun garage. I purchased the deal for $274 (I think package runs almost $600). Two shooters...  shot a tommy gun, uzi, krinkov aka baby, p90, dessert eagle and a few rifles. Full Auto!! \nWill was our instructor and he was so awesome and fun to work with. He made the experience really enjoyable. Hands down one of the best experiences I've had at a shooting range. Thanks Will, you da best!
