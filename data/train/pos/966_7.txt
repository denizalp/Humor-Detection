Bishop Gorman is the opposite of a Catholic, college prep school. They have a great party scene and sports, but that's all they have. They sweep problems like sexual harassment and bullying under the rug, which I have personally experienced. If they prioritized their struggling students over their football team, they would become an excellent school.
