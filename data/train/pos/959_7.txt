How bad could this place be?\n\nWe waited 15 minutes in a booth a waitress never came to get a drink order say hi or anything else!\n\nI walked up to two managers that were rolling silverware to tell them how it was and they said \"its a hard night tonight and give us a break\" they never said sorry or anything else avoid this place at all cost! I called to talk to management and they don't want to talk to you nor will they call you back, avoid all nugget's at all costs!
