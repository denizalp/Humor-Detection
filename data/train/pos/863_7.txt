What happened to Bellagio buffet? \n\nBellagio used to be my favorite Las Vegas buffet. My last visit was a disappointment. The selections were limited, the flavors weren't there and the quality was bad. \n\nI would rather pay more $ and get better quality food.\n\nGood bye Bellagio Buffet.\n\n2 stars!!\n\nThe Buffet Bellagio is not yummylicious!!
