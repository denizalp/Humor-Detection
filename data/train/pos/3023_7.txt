I went to Vegas vacuum and sewing to pick up some vacuum bags for my Bosch canister. After a long search @ big chain stores with limited stock of vacuum cleaner bags this independent store had them. I was impressed by their outstanding customer service, and vacuum cleaner knowledge. I will definitely go back if I need service or parts.
