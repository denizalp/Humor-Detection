We went after midnight on a Friday and it was nice. \nLandmark Diner offers pretty standard diner fare. The server was friendly and the garden omelette was on the bland side but not terrible. \n\nPros:\n- Serve breakfast all day.\n- Lookout for the daily specials.\n- Open almost 24 hours. Check opening hours.\n\nThree and Half Yelps
