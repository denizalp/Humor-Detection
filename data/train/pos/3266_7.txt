A quite refuge in the Cosmo. Clean, well maintained, and void of the crap you find in \"party pools,\" like spilled booze and moorish the Hangover crowd. Most folks are relaxing and just getting their tan on. Helpful and attentive servers, stiff libations, and plenty of chase lounges with sun and shade. Perfect for mornings to sleep in the sunshine.
