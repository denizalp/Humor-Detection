An utter disaster. \nValet only parking no valet parkers\nNo choice of seating in a near empty restaurant\nDarkened room midday \nHad to request wine list \nOne order of a walleye plate morphed into the delivery of a fish sandwich which wasn't even on the menu \nThe salt shaker top was loose so it all poured on my meal \nFrench fries cold and soggy \nNever offered desert \nTook 4 people to validate parking \nThe place is a mess
