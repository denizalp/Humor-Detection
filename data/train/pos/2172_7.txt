Shady and a rip off.  I bought an EVOD Vaporizer for $30 (had battery, tank, charger, and case) only to find out that it was a knock off.  No wonder they don't accept returns under any circumstance. (Yeah, they made me read the huge sign that said they don't accept returns.)  It started coming a part on me after a month.  \n\nCrooks and stupid.  Maybe not as stupid as me - because I didn't research enough, but stupid nonetheless.
