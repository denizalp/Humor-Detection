WOW!! We just found this place and were so excited. Today would be our 4th visit and it's was just terrible. We brought our 4 year old and it was a crazy UNSUPERVISED MADHOUSE!!! My daughter came home with a swollen, bruised cheek. A boy threw a fireman's hat at her before my husband could get to her. No parents watching their brat son and no staff around. My husband told the lady on their quick departure. \nTHIS PLACE SHOULD HAVE MORE STAFF AND HAVE AT LEAST SOMEONE WALKING AROUND KEEPING SOME SORT OF ORDER.
