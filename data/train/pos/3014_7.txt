Really nice place. I went here with 6 friends and our total was under 140(and that's with the 20% gratuity and three drinks). The food was great, I got the carne asada macho nachos and it was really great for the cost.\n\nThe staff was also real friendly and our waiter was awesome( even though he gave us a different name every time)
