I heard about this place & bookmarked it but it took me a few months to get over to you Gypsy Bar. The atmosphere is casual cool & fun. The clientele not foo foo in the least. We ran in, had a cocktail & bounced out on a Saturday night. We'll be back to make a date night out of the place but were headed somewhere else this particular evening. So I can only report on the atmosphere & one cocktail. Can't wait to come back & of course update my review.
