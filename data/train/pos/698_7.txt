The name says it all!!  It`s a good deal for a buffet. The Chinese dishes are of average buffet quality, but I shudder at the other dishes like the prime rib and sushi.   The selection of main dishes is pretty large, but there isn't much choice for desserts, salad, or fruit.  But did I mention it's cheap?\n\nIf you're going for non-ghettoness though, you might want to try Mandarin or Dragon Pearl.
