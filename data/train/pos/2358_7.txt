We gave this place one more shot, but now we will never come back.  Reasons why as follows:\n\n1. 15 minutes before the waitress (Lisa) took our drink order.\n2. 20 minutes before she brought them back and took our food order.\n3. After an additional 20 minutes we flagged down a passing hostess to ask her to get our waitress.\n4. 10 minutes later....no Lisa, so we left.\n5. The manager did chase us down when we were almost to Macy's but it was too little too late.
