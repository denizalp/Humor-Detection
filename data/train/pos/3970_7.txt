Met a client here for B fast. I like this location and the access is easy to get in & out of. Another positive is the have a large selection of specials and everything is cooked fresh to order.\n\nI went for the breakfast combo and chose to add pancakes a minimal charge. The sausage are served as patties and were lean, eggs cooked medium and the pancakes yummy. \n\nService here by the entire staff was friendly and they are were constantly refilling our the coffee cups.\n\nI was so satisfied I brought additional clients the following day.
