Super Zamani is located right next to Super Khorak.. what a difference in the vibes. \n\nThe inside is quite small...the selections seems minimum. Even the hot food section looks so runned down and unattractive. The funny thing is the price point is a little higher than Super Khorak...so not surprise there was hardly any people shopping here.\n\nSo if you need to pick up any Persian groceries save yourself time and money.. go next door! That's what we did!
