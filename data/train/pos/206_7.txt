This park is where we use to go when we were kids.  Centrally located it has so much sentimental memories for me. I would always look forward to feeding the ducks, renting a paddle boat, having a picnic and especially riding the roller coaster. So when I brought my kids here to do the same it was very nostalgic.  Gorgeous historic homes surround the park (Encanto District) so that's another added bonus. Pack a picnic basket and a frisbee!
