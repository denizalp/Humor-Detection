Good food and ok service.  Tables are close together to fit more people like Sardines. \nWe had the Oxtail soup, not that good . The steemed rice was perfect lol. .the Mongolian Beef was also good,  the Cashew Chicken was bland \nThe price was too high  for  the service and the food quality and quantity.
