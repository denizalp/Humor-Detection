Greasy ass breakfast burritos sucked and gave me some serious acid shits. You know the kind that feel like you are shooting fire out of your ass? I want to go back this place to try something different because I live close but every time I even drive near it to go to Safeway or the gym my butthole puckers up and my stomach starts to hurt. Sorry Federico's..you have won this round but eventually I will get drunk and come over at 2am and you can try to redeem yourselves.
