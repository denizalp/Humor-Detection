Being from the Bay Area, I'm used to having a variety of incredible ramen spots from which to choose.  When I heard about Futo Buta, I pretty much dropped everything and went to get my ramen fix, but, after three attempts, it has turned out to be a far cry from authentic, flavorful ramen.  Ramen is all about a rich, delicious broth and this came no where near the authentic ramen I've experienced many other places.  Two thumbs down.
