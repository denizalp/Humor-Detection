This guy below me has probably never lived in Parma.. Yes, Parma bars blow, because Parma people blow.  Therefore Wagon Wheel is at the mercy of its customers, and it does a hell of a job (besides the DJ in the basement).  First off, the pizza is literally the best pizza I've ever had.  I promise.  2nd, it's only $7 for a large! There is always plenty of room, the patio is awesome, the bartenders are nice and the atmosphere tries to stay as 'unparma' as you can possibly be north of snow rd.  I love Wagon Wheel.
