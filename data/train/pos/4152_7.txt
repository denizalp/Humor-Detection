I just posted two picture of the last room I stayed in. I'm not going to name off the room number or building because I'm sure ALL their rooms need to be looked at, re-evaluated and DEEP cleaned. It's getting worst ansd worst each year. I'm guessing the next time I stay here, I'll post an new picture with the vents fully clogged and rating this one star. The question now is, how low can you go? I guess the good thing is that dust in the vent will catch other dust from coming out like velcro?
