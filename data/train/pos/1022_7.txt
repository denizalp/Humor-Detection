Very healthy. I had the filet entree and it was great. The flavors were not too strong in anything. At the end, I had salad, grains, meat, etc. It was a full meal. It didn't take long for the food to come out and we were able to finish by the end of our lunch hour. I like the place too. Well lit and clean. Will come back again to try other items. I hope their gyro or schwarma is just as delicious.
