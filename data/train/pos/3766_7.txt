Came back a third time to ask about ffl procedures. Once again the blonde girl ruins another visit. As I was waiting I could over hear her conversation with another customer she was assisting with. She was telling the customer that the .380 handgun she was picking up was no good and it would for sure jam even after the break in period. Not a good way to talk to customers. Blonde insisted the customer go with an xds because the .380 would ALWAYS jam, lol. I couldn't take it anymore, I bought a raffle ticket and left.
