Spring rolls were great. \nPho broth was thin but overall was okay. Pho condiments were provided when asked for instead of available on the tables. \nPapaya salad dressing was flavorless and their garnish choice was odd. \nLemongrass chicken was disappointing because I tasted no Lemongrass. None. It was all sweet peanut (tasty) sauce. The fish sauce dressing for the raw veggies was rancid smelling and tasted like dirty gym socks.\nFor our next pho trip we will go to Charlotte and deal with the traffic on I77 instead of returning.
