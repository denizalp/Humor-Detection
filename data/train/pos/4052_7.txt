Never have been a big fan of this place...the drinks are always top notch, but the food is always a giant disappointment save the puffy fish tacos.  Those are amazing.\n\nAnyway, we ordered nacho's.  Normally nachos come stacked up on a plate right?  I am not kidding you.  There were exactly TWELVE chips. 12!  We got the combo for $10, and got 12 chips.\n\nNever again.
