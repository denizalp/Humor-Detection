McDonald's that was easy in and easy out. The drive through was wrapped around the building, so I found a spot and went inside. My order was quick and accurate. Hot coffee, hash browns cooked the right way and an Egg White Delight that was close enough to the right assembly that I'll let it go.\n\nThey share the building with a gas station \/ convenience store.
