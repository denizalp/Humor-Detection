Pretty dope complex.  Too rich for my blood but I do have a Dr. friend who lives here and he showed me around.  Definitely a well up kept facility.  The condos are very nice and I only saw a one bedroom condo but it was quite spacious.  The location of Optima is sweet.  Just a stones throw away to the nightlife of old towne!!
