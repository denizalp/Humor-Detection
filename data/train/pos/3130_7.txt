Ladies, leave your backpack purses at home. They force you to lock it up outside of the store. The greeter and security were rude and this rule is offending. We will NEVER come back here. Ever. Eat a dick, Walmart. And you read that right, they told my wife to lock her purse up in one of their lockers outside of the store. We spend lots of money at Wal-Mart and have even cleared shelves on a few occasions. I'll never go this location ever again.
