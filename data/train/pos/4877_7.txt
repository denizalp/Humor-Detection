Excellent Service!\n\nI brought my Land Rover here for transmission issues. Terry was at the desk and was super friendly. I am always apprehensive about new shops as we all usually worry about having people charge and charge us for everything and all the auto repair stereotypes. \n\nI found Huff to have given me honest advice and they quickly ascertained what the issues were and called me to give me options. \n\nA rare shop that gave good service!
