As we were super hungry and didn't want to walk around much, this is the closest restaurant to the Suites Tower.  We decided to eat here.  The wait time was just few minutes.  The hostess was pleasant and helpful.\n\nWe ordered: Plum Wine - Delicious!\n                   Oxtail Soup - Perfection!!!  Wish I had some here right now  :-)                    Curried Singapore Rice Vermicelli - Delicious!\n                    Stir-Fried Mixed Vegetables - Perfectly done and Delicious!!!\n                    Salt and Pepper Calamari - Delicious!!\n\nEverything was perfect and we look forward to coming back!
