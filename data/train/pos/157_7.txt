Is it the best pizza in the U.S.?  After reading so many top pizza places articles, I had to try the famous Pizzeria Bianco.  It's a pretty solid pizza and I enjoyed it.  It's not neapolitan pizza but a thin pizza baked in a wood burning oven.  The crust was really thin and crispy.  I really liked the simple Margherita pizza and the Rosa pizza.   They only have two beers on draft but both matched well with the pizzas.  Service was friendly and fast.  I wouldn't say it's the best pizza in the U.S., but it's pretty good.
