This is a reasonably priced, clean, friendly nail salon.  I had a gel manicure and it looks wonderful. Had tons of compliments on it already.  I went back and had a pedicure and was very happy with that also.  They have been very busy both times I was there, but they work efficiently and keep things moving along.  The price seems reasonable to me - $35 for the gels that last 2-3 weeks and $30 for a very nice pedicure.  She spent lots of time on my feet.  I will definitely go back.
