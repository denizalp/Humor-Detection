Me myself and Irene Dever cheese. Sounds like a real party.\n\nAwesome cheese shop with all kinds of unusual and delicious cheeses inside the West Side Market. You can't get much better than buying cheese right from the source.\n\nWhile you're in the WSM, get a Lemon Sugar crepe from Crepes Du Luxe, a Brat from Frank's, and some spicy jerky from J & J Czuchraj. I dever you. I double dever you.\n\nThe woman there (who I am now sure is Irene) is a sweetheart and even if the products were not as perfect, she'd earn 5 just by herself.
