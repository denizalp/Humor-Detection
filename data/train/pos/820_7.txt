If I could give a 0 star I would! Not only did i get a third degree burn, I called the manager and he said it wasnt their fault ! You are suppose to make sure your hot contents are seales correctly, this could have been a major problem if it fell on my daughter ! I am so upset of how my hand got burned and for the manager to not even feel compassion for their error!
