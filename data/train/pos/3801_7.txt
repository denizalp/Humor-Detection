worst. place. ever. guest list line is longer than regular line, and they made you wait outside in the cold until 12am, when guest list is over so you have to pay anyway. Bouncers have a penis complex, are aggressive and literally don't give a shit. plus i've heard that the music in there sucks too. After 2 hours of waiting in the cold, we left and went to b-side.
