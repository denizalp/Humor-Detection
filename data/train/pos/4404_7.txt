Nothing says Merry Christmas like fire breathing dragons and a decent into hell with overly redundant instrumentals, but hey it finished with carol of the bells! \"What I see with my eyes closed\"? How I wish I spent my evening otherwise!  But thank God I left early and \"found my way home\" (song lyrics you probably never heard being quoted). Really the first half was good, after that I'm still not sure the nightmare I saw!  Save your money!!
