Hot young professionals? Was I drunk when I wrote my original review? \n\nThis is why the Kennilworth remains in my rolodex: \ncheap drinks\njukebox\nmini bowling\ndarts\nlobster tank\nyes, lobster tank\neating challenge\nit has that \"Greg Brady could have hung out in this den\" feel\n\nIs there anything else you want in a neighborhood bar? (I can concede that skee-ball would be bomb) \n\nDidn't think so.
