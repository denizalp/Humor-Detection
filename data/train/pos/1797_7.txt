Old school diner next to the Scottsdale Mall.. the interior space was very \"Golden Girls\".. check the chalkboard at the door for daily specials .. on my visit they had pumpkin pancakes listed \n\nGreat service .. menu leans heavily towards their pancakes .. lots of delicious fruit options.. I went with bacon, eggs and regular pancakes .. these pancakes are delicious .. fluffy and flavorful \n\nA little pricey for a diner .. but the location probably calls for the higher prices
