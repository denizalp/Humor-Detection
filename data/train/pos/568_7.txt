Pier 1 Imports is a store that has just about everything to help decorate and entertain.  I can always find something from candles to rugs, to pillows to cookie jars.  I was so excited walking in. The smell of the candles and the wicker...transports me somwhere tropical and in the fall the pumpkin spice candles and aromatherapy selection is the best!\n\nAnyway, this is a smaller store and the area...at night can be sketchy.
