For a Dundas W bar, this place is refreshingly unpretentious and relaxed. It's small, dark and welcoming. It's a strong silent bar, and I'm going to stay on theme and keep this review short and sweet. If you like good people, big beer lists and a nice barkeep, you'll like Lucky Shrike. \n\n...What's a Shrike?
