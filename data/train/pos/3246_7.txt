I truly love the attention to detail this place offers me and my pets. They are truly professional and provide my pets with great care. We originally came here back in 2008 as they were the only Veterinary Hospital with prices fitting my budget. There are several Veterinarians to choose from, but they're all wonderful. We no longer live near by, however, I still make the trek from North Las Vegas to seek care and advice.
