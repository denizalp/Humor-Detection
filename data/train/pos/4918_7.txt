This is the Good Safeway. The Evil Safeway is at 7th st and McDowell.\n\nGood Safeway:\nClean\nEasy to find things\nWide selection\nFresh produce\n\nEvil Safeway:\nGhetto ass shit\nWilted produce\nLimited selection\nHeroin addict park across the street\nIt's been robbed during 2 shopping trips... wtf?\n\nOnly 4 stars though because a lot of the bakery goods have partially hydrogenated oil. WTF Safeway? Don't make me sic Lindsay on ur ass, yo.
