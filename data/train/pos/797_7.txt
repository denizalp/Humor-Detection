YUMMY!!! \n\nSo happy that Chef John opened up a spot for lunch and on our side of town. The poke bowls are delish and they are very generous with the toppings. The fish is very fresh as always. If you haven't checked out his other spots, you'll have to check them out. Anything from Chef John is fresh and delicious!
