!! WARNING !!\nTheir wait staff will tell you (on multiple occasions) that their sauces are NOT made with wheat flour.  Unfortunately, this is only true SOME of the time.  After breaking out in hives hours after eating here, I called and spoke to the owner's daughter.  It turns out that sometimes she uses corn starch and sometimes she uses flour.  WTF?  The moral of the story is, either ask the owner every time you come in, or avoid the sauces.
