Worst experience. The so called senior stylist had no idea how to cut or colour short hair for woman.  3 hours into appointment my hair looked yellow like straw and stylist was too afraid to cut.   \n\nPaid 200 dollars for a colour and cut I would expect from a junior stylist.  Called back the next day and owner didn't even offer apology.  Actually wouldn't accept that there was a problem.  Arrogance to say the least.  Will never go back here nor recommend anyone waste their money.
