After this morning BK breakfast fiasco, I still wanted breakfast.  This place is like Campbell's soup good mmmm mmm mmmm. I had country breakfast plate eggs  and bacon cooked perfect. Don't judge but also had blueberry pancakes. My gf had the blue plate omelet( the yummy one with avacados). I can't say enough how great the food and service was. Love great diner's like this.
