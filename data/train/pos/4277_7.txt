I got the snicker cupcake and the coconut macaroon. The cupcake was gross and dry but the truffled chocolate topping was good. I wish there was a little more snicker taste to the cupcake. The coconut macaroon was pretty good it was caramelized and grilled or fried. My friends deliberated for 30 minutes on buying a hello kitty lollipop for 25 bucks .. way overpriced ...
