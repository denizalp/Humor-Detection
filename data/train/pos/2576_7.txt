Everything that's wrong with the suburbs.  Accessible only by car (or by the optimistically named Mississauga Transit), it sprawls so much you practically have to drive from store to store.  \n\nElectroncs and housewares shops and pet food stores and everything is in large quantities, and just a little bit less than you'd spend at a more convenient place.  \n\nHonestly, shopping at Costco makes me want to eat a bullet out of shame.  \n\nOn the plus side, everything there will be wheelchair accessible, as long as you drive there.
