Had a Groupon for a weekend stay.  When I tried to use it, the snotty little receptionist with an attitude said all the weekends were booked.  \"Upgrade or go call Groupon.\"  Great customer service.  This is a hospitality business.  If I purchase something from a business and they can't accomodate, most businesses at least try to do something for you.  \"Upgrade or get lost.\"  Nice. \nI got my money back and I would NEVER set foot on this property.  There are other hotels in this location, look them up first.
