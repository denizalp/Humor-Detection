NOT Perfect. Boy these restaurants really set themselves up for disappointment with their names.\n\nSlow ass service during dinner. Seriously some of the worst I've ever experienced at a restaurant anywhere. You've been warned.\n\nAlways busy, probably because of their relatively cheap prices. Their dim sum is pretty standard but comes out much quicker than their dinner plates. Seriously, do yourself a favour and avoid the dinner.\n\nIt is open 24 hrs, so if you have a craving for not perfect Chinese food in the middle of the night this place might be worth a shot.
