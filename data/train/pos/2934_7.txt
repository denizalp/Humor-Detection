Mediocre Chinese food. I ordered some take-out: the Cashew Chicken dish... it was more like a celery dish with hints of chicken and a couple cashews.  I also got the stir-fry veggies. Not bad. The place is cheap and they give you a lot of food, but it just isn't that great. If you order $15 or more they give you 2 free egg rolls. They were probably the smallest egg rolls I've ever seen.
