Being told 3 times by 3 different employees that you \"don't get commission,\" and still shadowed throughout the store. \n\nHearing the first one radio in my clothing description over his ear piece.\n\nThe place has a huge selection of nice, but expensive, things. But everyone working there felt like a robot. I've felt less hassled at a car dealership; no joke.\n\nWe did actually purchase something though. A dinning room table set in clearance. Everything about it was totally fine. Very good price for a table and 4 chairs.\n\nBiggest issue is the customer service. Place gave me the creeps.
