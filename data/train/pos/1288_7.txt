Would not go here at all, went there waited on the whole 5.\/ machines they have and then was told there was a line for.machines when there wasn't. Why the he'll even go there if you can't sit in an open seat. Drinks are mediocre and service is horrible I hope this place gets shut down. Also ordered a sandwhich the meat was rainbow colored which is usually bacteria. Don't go here it sucks !
