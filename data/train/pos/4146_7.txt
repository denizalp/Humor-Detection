Bed, Bath and Beyond is cool.  It's one of those places you can walk in and say \"I want that\" about a hundred times, and then as you're walking through the store you realize just how useless the stuff you're carrying really is.\n\nBy the time you make it to the register, you may have absolutely nothing that you need.  That's why they keep sending out those discount coupons in the mail.  But it sure is a lot of neat stuff to look at as you walk through the store.
