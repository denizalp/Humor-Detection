The fish tacos were fine but, frankly, nothing I couldn't make at home. $16 later I was still feeling peckish. The slaw is unusually spicy.\n\nOur server was a neophyte and interpreted our \"could we get the bill\" motion for \"where's our food?\" They might be a victim of their own success. We got the food okay but there was little in the way of a table check up to see if we wanted more drinks, dessert, etc.
