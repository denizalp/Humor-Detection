Yuck, just yuck! My boyfriend and I came down to Vegas for a weekend getaway. There were 3 of us girls and 3 guys. The boys wanted to hit a few stripclubs without us so we went to A thunder show. Way, way tom much raunch, it was kind of gross. I have no desire to touch or be touched by strippers and there was way too much contact, I know some women are desperate for that kind of attention from men but not all of us. Didn't want to go anyways but will not be back.
