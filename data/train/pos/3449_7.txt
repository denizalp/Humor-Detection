Alterio's Catering is a family owned business out of Canonsburg. \n\nThey specialize in corporate events, weddings, cocktail parties, breakfast buffets, B.B.Q's. and other events. \n\nThey catered a employee appreciation day luncheon at my job today. We had a few different meats, vegetables, rice, rolls, salad, fruit salad and cupcakes. The food was hot, fresh and tasty. \n\nI highly recommend them for your special event!
