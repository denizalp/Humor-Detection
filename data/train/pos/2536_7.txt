RIP Pool Party Season 2013. Encore Beach Club is a GORGEOUS venue. Gorgeous people, beautiful fake palm trees, bright orange day beds, and awesome DJ's! \n\nThe biggest downfall is the staff. They are rude, condescending, and do NOT understand the definition of \"hospitality\" \n\nSadly, they know people will come regardless due to the popularity of the venue and find reasons to be jerks. \n\nNOTE to Encore Beach Club management: if the pool is slow on a Friday, please take the sticks out of your asses and allow reentry.
