Although I enjoyed most of my stay at Ashton Pointe Apartments, I was not happy with the attitude or helpfulness of the staff when it was time to end my stay.\n\nI cleaned my apartment before I left. There was dust on the kitchen counter top and the stove top they charged me almost $100 in cleaning fees when the place was left in broom swept condition. I dont think it is fair to charge the resident for cleaning the apt for the next resident. I definitely wont reside there again and I will not give any referrals.
