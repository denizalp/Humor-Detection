So happy I was craving something sweet while at downtown summerlin because this place is AMAZING. Their presentation is beautiful, their staff is incredibly friendly and their gelato is top notch. I asked to try probably 20 flavors and instead of feeling like I was asking for too much, I was still encouraged to try more! They make all of their flavors in store and trust me, you can tell. Everything is so fresh and the flavors change slightly every week which is more of a reason to come often!! I absolutely love it here.
