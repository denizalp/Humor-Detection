Wasted our money! Wanted to go see The Chainsmokers but they never showed up over 7hours late!! I bought 1 rum & coke at $65 this place was so lame nothing to do but sit and wait for the guys to show up. We left after being informed they may or may not show up like wtf? You can't start a concert at 10am and no dk no bands til 5pm that bs and just bad overall experience
