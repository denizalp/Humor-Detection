OMG!!! I've seen the pictures of the donuts.  I've heard the hype. Today I finally got to try for myself.  OMG. I had the English Gentleman donut. What's is that you ask? A vanilla cake donut with chocolate frosting, maple drizzle and wait for it, heath bar crumbles on top. Everything I could have asked for in a donut and more. It was so good, that I will travel  to Tempe for a donut even if it's out of the way.
