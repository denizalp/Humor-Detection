I was there today and I most likely will not be returning anytime soon. The server Elmer was very slow and messed up our orders. Everyone else who works there seemed very unhappy to be there an really just brought down the vibe. It then took our server so long after he cleared our plates to bring the check that we stood up to ask for it and the lady ringing us out was extremely rude. I have not been here in a long time and will never go back.
