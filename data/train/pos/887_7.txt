Seriously amazing! This place is my biggest guilty pleasure. The cookies are so so soft and if you are gluten free\/vegan they have cookies for you too that are surprisingly so moist and gooey. The customer service is excellent as well! The only downfall is that they are closed during the day and Monday-Wednesday. I don't like sweets usually but I am kind of addicted to these guys!!
