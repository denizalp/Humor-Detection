I'm always in search of good bowl of pho, especially when I'm fighting a cold. It was a Sunday night and luckily this place was only one open without having to go far so we figured to give it a shot. So glad we did! Service was great, food was amazing.  And they have macaroons! What?!!! With ice cream if you want too! Double what?!?!? And please, whatever you do, order the fried chicken wings as an app.  That dish alone I would drive far and wide for.  Mmmmm:
