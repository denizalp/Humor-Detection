The Vermont Sandwich Co. offers a varied and unique menu. I got the \"dead ahead\" wrap, which had chicken salad, cranberry sauce, and thin slices of Granny Smith apples. It was a fresh blend of sweet and savory flavors and the veg was nice and crisp and not soggy at all (a problem that usually occurs with wraps). I also got the potato salad which was perfect! It actually tasted like potatoes rather than mayonnaise soup. The place is small, so I would recommend take out rather than staying for lunch. Definitely recommend!
