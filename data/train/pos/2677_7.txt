Came for Ping Pong at 6:30PM to 9:00PM. Borrowed a racquet from the centre. The racquet was cheap and some rubber was tear off. Better to bring your own racquet. Played with a pretty girl who wasn't part of our group. We were both beginners, so we did whatever and most of times the ball flew everywhere.
