I'm always running late so I just run in and grab and go. They didn't have the snowman doughnuts I was really hoping for ... but nonetheless the ones I did pick out were fresh...but I'm wondering where they're made? 'Cause if its close... I'm there! The store seemed kinda trashy...maybe it was just the people in line in front of me... really folks... how hard is it to pick out a KK??
