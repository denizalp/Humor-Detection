Do not come here for a piercing..... PLEASE (I can't say for a tattoo) but these people act like they've never used a piercing needle before. Also, have no idea how to \"fix\" a piercing they messed up. You do not bend a piece of jewelry to make it \"fit\"... Here they do. (see pic)\nThey also don't use high quality jewelry, I don't think it's even surgical steal. (I'm allergic to everything but surgical steal) and the first piece of jewelry they gave me has left my bellybutton bright red, inflamed, and irritated. (it is healed) don't come here!
