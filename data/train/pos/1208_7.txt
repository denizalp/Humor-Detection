We got here right when it opened (Sunday) for lunch and had no problem finding seating, but within 15 minutes it filled up completely. Ordered tonkotsu and miso ramen and got served pretty quickly. Overall, impressive ingredient selection all around (different veggies, mushrooms\/fungi) and their pork is really, really good. However their broth in both the ramen bowls we got were noticeably salty (slight turn-off). Would come back to try the other options, was definitely an above-average ramen place
