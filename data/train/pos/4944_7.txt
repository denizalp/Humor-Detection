Moving forward, you will probably be able to find me here every Sunday with my laptop day drinking to my hearts content. They have a fabulous patio with comfortable furniture and a relaxed vibe and one kick-ass mojito. I also REALLY enjoyed the chopped salad (veganized, of course).\n\nMy only complaint is that it is way too expensive. Hoping that they run some awesome weekend specials so I don't break the bank hanging out!\n\nOooooo just a quick update: BICYCLE DISCOUNT: Be Green! - Ride your bicycle to Local Breeze for Brunch and receive a 10% discount on your entire check.
