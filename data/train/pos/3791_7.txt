I've gotta admit, the Quebecois make better middle eastern food than Chicagoans.\n\nBasha is a local chain with multiple locations. This particular one is located near the downtown area.\n\nWe had lunch one day while staying at the Omni nearby and returned the next day. Yeah, it was that good. The lamb shawerma is tender, juicy, and flavorful. The shish kabobs are excellent. The roasted potatoes with garlic yogurt sauce make for a great side item.\n\nIt is sorta dive-y, not a fancy place. But, the food is excellent and inexpensive. A definite visit for quick, great, and inexpensive food.
