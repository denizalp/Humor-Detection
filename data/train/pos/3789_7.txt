There is always a long line at Eggslut in LA, so it was so nice to run into this place a few minutes before it closed--no line!\n\nI got the sausage, egg, and cheese and it was egg-cellent! I firmly believe that all burgers and sandwiches are infinitely better with a broiche bun and the one I got was egg-ceptional. I always wondered how an egg sandwich got be so hyped, but I have to say it's pretty egg-traordinary.\n\nLooking for a tasty, quick bite? Eggslut is egg-actly what you need.
