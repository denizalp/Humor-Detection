I will literally fight you for the Spider-man pinball machine don't even test me.\n\nNo but really, this place. No entry fee, just bring a pocket full of quarters and game away. It's never too crowded here, at least when I go, so there's always plenty of different machines to pick from and have a go at. Usually kept really clean and great for date night or a night out with the kids. I love going here and usually end up crying over the Star Trek machine.
