Don't mean to be a hater but I guess I'm just picky on my Mexican food.  If I'm gonna eat a burrito or taco, I'm thinking L.A. taco truck style.  This is more what I'd call TexMex.  Lettuce, tomato, guac, and sour cream on the burrito.  The carne asada doesn't taste like it's been marinated.  Don't get me wrong, it didn't stop me from eating plenty!  (see photo I submitted of Steve R.'s arm next to the big burrito)\n\nI'm rating it 2.5 stars but rounding down to 2.  \n\nI will be trying it again.
