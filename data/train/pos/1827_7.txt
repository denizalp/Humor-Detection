My husband and I had Dough Mama on Friday, September 11 at a weekly Food Truck rally.  I was super excited to try their pesto pizza.  Pesto and wood fired? Oh yeah!  I was severely disappointed.  The pizza crust was burnt in several spots on the bottom and it gave the whole pizza a burnt dough taste.  They have great branding with the old lady and the tile covered oven you can easily see.  But the pizza was not good.  I've had so much better from other wood fired food trucks.  Sorry Dough Mama.  I say no mama.
