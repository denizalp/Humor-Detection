I'd rate 0 star if I could... This place is awful!! Beds were not clean! TV was broke and would not even turn on... The AC plugins in the wall are hanging out of the wall and have no covers!! There was still trash in the trash cans.... Used Q-tips on the floor and window seals...wtf? Paint pealing off the walls, room was not clean at all ...oh and they had no toilet paper in the bathroom...wish I had time to take pics of it all....I highly recommend you DO NOT stay here!
