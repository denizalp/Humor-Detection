Armadillo has some pretty good grub for a bar. I highly recommend the fried green pickles and the smothered chicken.\n\nHappy hour is spot on and they have off track betting. It's a great place to stop in for a few cold ones on a hot summer day.\n\nIt's a bit dark and dingy but that only adds to the charm. The servers and bartenders are super friendly. (My boyfriend talked me in to 4 stars for this review, he's a regular).
