Horrible! Absolutely horrrrrrible! How come a major telecom company can't manage to port a simple phone number? I spent hours with techs in my home and on the phone, and still had to change my phone number.\n\nOn the plus side, their customer service reps are very good at apologizing. I'm guessing they get a lot of practice.
