Here on vacation with my family and we stumbled upon this little restaurant on our hunt for food. \n\nThe food is GREAT! Huge portions! You really get more bang for your buck. Also, the staff\/owners are really friendly. \n\nBONUS POINTS: I read on their menu that one of the owners are also from Kaneohe, HI where I was born and raised!
