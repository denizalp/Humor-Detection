They have a dumb dress code for men . \nWe went myself and some friends and they didn't let my friend in because he was wearing Jordan's , \nBut apparently you can wear chucks and busted ass vans and running shoes. But you can't wear some fresh Jordan's , stupidest shit I ever heard of in my life. Oh and they're lost and found opens at 10pm !? Likeeee whaaaaaat!? People need to find their missing shit ASAP not wait allll day , get it together drais
