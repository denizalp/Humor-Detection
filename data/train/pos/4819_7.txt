Not the best Mexican in the city -- that's my friend, Jesus -- but I liked the food more than other yelpers. Week-long booze offerings include cheap beer on Wednesdays and Margaritas on Thursday. Their trellised patio in the back is one of my favourites in the city.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: The tortillas fall a little FLAT.\n\nMenu Readability: Pretty readable. I wouldn't shoot the dog over it though.\n\nNeed to mention: Their website makes Myspace look understated and tasteful. Do check it out.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: My foreign policy: I'd rather drink Mexican beer than American beer.
