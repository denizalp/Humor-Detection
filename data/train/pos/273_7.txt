This place can either be super chill or really hectic depending on the night you go. Saturday they had a live Hawaiian band playing in the outside area and it was really nice I actually enjoyed it a lot. But of course it was pack with stupid drunks everywhere. Literally got stepped on by three people by that time I was ready to go. This place is not what it used to be anymore. Thanks people for ruining it...k bye
