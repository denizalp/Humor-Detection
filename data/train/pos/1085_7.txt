This place is a little smaller than their other store in town but the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  The only complaint that I have is when you do the test to see if you are a neutral or a stability, they try to push the insoles on you that is the same price as one of their shoes.  Other than that everything else is good.  If you join the VIP club you save even more and have a bigger return window.
