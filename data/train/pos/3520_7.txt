I will NEVER eat here again. I work across the street at the hospital. Ordered a calzone. Tipped the delivery guy. Took about 2 bites of the calzone before I found what could only be either PUBIC or ARMPIT hair. I called to explain this and was called FUCKING ridiculous and was told I could not speak with the manager. He also said mozzarella cheese looks alot like pubic hair...ummm, what?!! What a piece of shit that guy was. Gross...
