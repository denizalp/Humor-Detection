Really Good BBQ, but I do NOT get all the hype. Standing in line for hours, place running out of food, etc. I feel like I'm trying to get in a Hollywood club versus trying to eat lunch. I'm from Texas so my bbq standards are high, and I will say it was good- but there are other places in town (a couple) that certainly meet the mark without all the hoopla.
