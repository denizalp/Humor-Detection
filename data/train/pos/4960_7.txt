This place was convenient, so I planned to meet a friend here while we both in the area.  The friend didn't show up.\n\nI'm bumpint Anthony's to 3 stars for the fresh mushrooms and real cheddar in the Mushroom Cheddar omelet.  Also for the actual grains in the whole wheat toast.  I didn't notice that last time.\n\nMy friend gets one star.
