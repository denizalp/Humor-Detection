Good food, but very rude service.  Not accommodating with my 3lb chihuahua which is a service animal whom I bring everywhere with me.  They said she needed to be on a leash when she was in a baby carrier.  Stupid and not the law.  Won't go back ever again.  They don't like people with disabilities I guess.
