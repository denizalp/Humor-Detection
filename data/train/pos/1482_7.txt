Several reviewers mentioned that the spinach & mushroom filling is vegetarian. If Aaron Pool makes it the same way that it's listed in the recipe he share with the Arizona Republic today, it is NOT VEGETARIAN (chicken stock).\n\nI am shocked that several reviewers (who are vegetarians) seem to have had staff members steer them toward this option, despite the fact that it is NOT vegetarian.\n\nReally? Why not just use vegetable stock? And if something seems veg, but is not, please tell your staff.\n\nHere is the recipe that Mr. Pool shared:\nhttp:\/\/www.azcentral.com\/story\/life\/food\/recipes\/2014\/04\/22\/spinach-mushroom-enchilada-filling\/8013227\/
