Sitting on this patio makes me feel like I'm on vacay! \nGreat views, relaxing vibe, beautiful marble tabletops, good service and food. \nI always get the buffalo cauliflower here because it is so good, served with a side of bleu cheese and buffalo sauce. Side note: they do not have ranch here at all. Which is a good thing, I think. \nOn this visit just had a few apps, all reasonably priced and drinks. \nGreat spot to come to in downtown Summerlin where you can walk around and shop and have a bite for a delightful experience.
