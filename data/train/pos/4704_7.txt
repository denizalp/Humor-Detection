This is the worst Chinese restaurant that I have ever eaten at.  I went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed.  I don't write many reviews, but I didn't want someone to get suckered in like I did.  \n\nThe one good thing that I will say about this restaurant was that the food was very cheap.  However, I could not stomach but a few bites so I still did not get my money's worth.
