It's easy to eat nothing but chain food restaurant fare on the Strip; hence, my family enjoyed venturing a little bit away from the high-priced resorts and McDonald's to visit Palermo's Pizza.\n\nWe visited this wonderful restaurant twice and were very impressed with the high quality of the food and service as well as the low prices. This friendly family-owned restaurant offers homemade Italian food--the recipes are original and excellent. \n\nWe ordered a cheese pizza and fettuccine Alfredo--they both were tasty and the portion sizes were good.
