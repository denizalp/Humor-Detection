The flavors are fun and the gelato is suuuuuuper creamy!\n\nThey have a ton of flavors that remain the same and about five special flavors that are continuously rotating. Most of the flavors are parallel to their Australian counterparts, unless they can't find an ingredient.\n\nGelato\n1 Scoop: $3.50\n2 Scoops: $5\n3 Scoops: $6.50\nBambino: $2.50\n\nPint (Small): $10\nPint (Medium): $18\nPint (Large): $25\n\nFavorite classic flavors: Salted Mango & Coconut, Yoghurt Berry, Tiramisu, and Coconut Pandan. Their waffles cones are delicious, too. \n\nI haven't any of their gelato cakes yet, but they're gorgeous and I'd love to get one for a special occasion!
