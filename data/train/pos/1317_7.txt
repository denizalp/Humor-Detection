Great service. Fantastic selection of glasses frames. The main dude is a nice guy and very helpful. The optometrist is friendly as well. \n\nBut, that place is legit messy. Fire hazard messy. How can anyone run a business like that? If you use their washroom, you'll notice crackers above the toilet bowl. Weird.
