Convenient routes, kind but tough transit officers, grossly understaffed. Our student rides the light rail daily and has witnessed several unsavory incidents (use of marijuana on trains, fights on platforms, arguments on trains). He reported that he occasionally sees the transit officer about once every 2 days. We are thankful that we have this mode of transportation. However, as the transit officer explained to us that he cannot be everywhere. He kindly instructed us on how to report incidences as they are occurring. We hope that METRO Light Rail will increase their staff to monitor for safety.
