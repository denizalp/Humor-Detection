This was a nightmare.  They moved me on October 16.  Sent 2 men.  Not enough help.They broke a mirrored chest.  Had a company repair glass. Chest was destressed glass. Used regular glass and when I complained they sent me a check for $80.00.  Chipped 2 pieces of furniture and  chipped a piece of glass for my dining room table.  Also put a huge hole in the wall when they were building my bed.  I found all of this out after they left.  Company did nothing about it.  They are the worst moving company.  Do not use them.  Trust me.
