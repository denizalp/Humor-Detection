The other half of the two parks here, Place Du Canada. Dorchester (officially, \"Dominion Square\") has more trees and benches compared to the other. And more monuments even though it's about 2\/3 the size. Including one to the Boer War and one for Scottish poet Robert Burns.\n\nThe park is open 24 hours and is a bit of a focal point for pedestrian traffic in the city. It's also well served by the Underground City.
