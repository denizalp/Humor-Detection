greeting- Yes\nVibe- Sucks\nBR- Casino\nPrice- Expensive\nParking- MGM casino\nService- OK\nFood\nSpaghetti and meatballs $25 is not the amazing Postrio S & M! Dried not fresh spaghetti is used. I sent the first order back. There was so much hot pepper in it my mouth was on fire. It was corrected. \nThe pizza was too dry. Not the amazing Postrio pizza. \nWIGB? No\n\nPostrio in the Venetian hotel closed. So we were hopping this was going to be a replacement restaurant. It is not. Quality is not the same. It's location in a secluded out dated casino just sucks the chi out of you.
