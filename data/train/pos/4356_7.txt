Visited a couple other times since my first encounter and the service was a lot better. Maybe it has to do with we actually sat in the restaurant vs the bar. Server Eric today was great. Super friendly and personable. He greeted us right away, got our drink order and was back to take our food order. \n\nTried the Tuna tartare but found it a bit bland. Ceviche was served on two pieces of hard tortillas. Generous amounts of shrimp and served with a hot sauce, which does make the ceviche taste better. Truffle fries delicious!
