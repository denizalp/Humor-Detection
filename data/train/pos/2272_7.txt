the food is not good.  considering you have to wait almost 45-50min+ for Take-Out.  Are they harvesting the crops there or waiting for the chicken to hatch its eggs on as needed basis?  Why do they take so damn long?!!!!!!!!!!!   I will never go there unless I have 3 hours to spare for a take-out lunch!
