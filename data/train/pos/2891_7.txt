\"Kind of a weird bar\" is about right. They charge Barchef prices for their alcohol yet have the decor and ambiance of a brothel.\n\n$10 for a glass of Pinot Grigio. $6 for a bottle of beer. $7 for draft.\n\nThink highway side tavern or motel bar - don't expect anything fancy or you'll be disappointed.\n\nI have no idea how the fish in those tanks stay alive.\n\nUPDATE: I keep reading in other people's reviews that there are books, couches and popcorn at Imperial Pub. Was I even at the same bar?? Only way to find out is to go back.
