Good service, good food in an eclectic atmosphere. We had a flat iron steak (very good), the reuben ribs (aptly named) and the pork paprikash which was , to my taste, a bit bland but perfectly cooked to fork tender. Their wings are some of the best if not the best I have enjoyed--they will bring me back. Our desserts were lemon coconut panecotta and the crispiest brownie puddle which I couldn't stop eating.
