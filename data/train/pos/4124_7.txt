Angry Tuna sushi and salmon tartar are to die for!  The place has a very zen like feel to it that makes me love eating there even more!\n\nWait staff is young and friendly.  Has moments of being somewhat loud so I would say that it's perfect to take the children here!!!\nGreen tea hot the spot too!
