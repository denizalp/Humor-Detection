Again, I'm back at the store...\nThe checker DIANE is still there. The store is clean they have tons of stuff and \nI'm standing at the check stand in this pick... Waiting... As the debit machine says..\nWait for cashier. I had to wait until she was done with her text. \nShe is so rude!  If you do t work there, your NOT going to have a conversation with her. She doesn't say hello and her \n\"Have a good one\" sounds like,\ngood riddance!
