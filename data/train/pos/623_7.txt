Who knew I'd like a private pharmacy so much ? I'm always on the go, and honestly didn't think they'd get my meds filled so fast. Usually it takes 2 hours even if they promise one hour, but the pharmacist said 15 minutes and he said stick around I shouldn't be that long. No joke, or too 5 minutes. A little out of the way but I'm always driving by after work anyway.
