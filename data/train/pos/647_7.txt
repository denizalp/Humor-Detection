We didn't stay at a hotel in Vegas, we stayed at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. Ok, I wonder how many other people said that? Excellent hotel which heightened the experience of Vegas. The rooms were modern and very comfortable.\n\nOne of the highlights of the place was the awesome pool they had there. So many hot babes there, it was unbelievable. \n\nZipzap Zubidy Bop!
