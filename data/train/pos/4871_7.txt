This bar has an ambiance of zero and is constantly swarmed with college kids, frat boys, Cleveland Heights-area alkies, really young-looking people as well as other random characters.\n\nBUT, who cares about ANY of this when:\n\n you order a Stoli and tonic,  Absolut and cranberry, 3 jagerbombs and a Modelo and pay $22. $22??!! \n\nAlso, note that the bartender was clearly drunk, high or both and was straight free pourin'.\n\nSo, my God! The place is hard NOT to love!
