Brand New Food Basic!\n\nDefinitely clean and nice, without any funny smell!\n\nAmple parking... since hardly anyone goes there as it is in a new sub division.\n\nOpen Daily from 8 am to 10 pm, with longer hours than Leo's No Frills down the street that closes at 9 pm on weekdays and even earlier on weekends!\n\nAccepts all credit cards!!\n\nStaffs here are nice and friendly, that's always the case when the business is new!
