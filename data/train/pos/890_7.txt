If you are hungry and you want to get what you pay for...don't stop here. This is one of the only Chipotles where I get the stink-eye if I ask for a little more rice\/beans\/meat (not that I'm asking for mounds of food, but at least enough to fill my burrito) The burritos here are way to small to be paying almost $8 bucks for a burrito (I don't usually get extras like a drink or chips).
