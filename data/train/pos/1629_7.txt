If you've ever wondered why Canadians dress so badly, the answer is simple: Roots. Roots clothing is much like the way Americans perceive Canadians: boring and inoffensive. Thankfully, here in Quebec, people are more stylish and dress far better than their Anglo Canadian counterparts and you don't see many people in Montreal (besides McGill students) wearing Roots clothing. \n\nIn fact, Roots may be reason enough to argue for Quebec separation if only to keep out the ugly sweatpants and stultifyingly generic preppy wear.
