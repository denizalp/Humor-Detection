Very nice looking place. Came before dinner rush, so it wasn't too busy. Nice staff very attentive and informed us if something would take long. \n\nApps:shrimp and eggplant- really good,great zing of spice and they used white eggplant which i prefer over purple. Much more tender.\n\nChicken Milanese- pretty good...liked the herbed pasta but overall not the best I've had and chicken lacked flavor a bit\n\nSo overall not fantastic but i enjoyed my meal and such and would return to try other dishes.
