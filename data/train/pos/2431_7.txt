If I could give 0 stars I would. There are NO requirements for the hair 'stylists' to meet in order to work here. Its a cheapie chop shop and you get a lot worse than you paid for. \n\nI don't know why I returned after a couple very bad cuts. Maybe I am a glutton for punishment or too forgiving or just too lazy to find a new place but surmise it to say: this Great Clips has TERRIBLE cutters with no training and I recommend avoiding it at all costs.
