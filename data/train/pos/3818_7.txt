This place is an amazing hidden gem, tucked away behind Crossroads Market. I used to pass by this place every day on my commute home from downtown, and regret not stopping in and checking out a show sooner. $15 was all I had to plunk down for an incredible experience called a Chrismoose Carol. Best adaptation of a Christmas Carol I've ever seen! Well, next to my personal childhood favorite, Mickey's Christmas Carol :). And honestly, far better English accents than some Hollywood actors! Bungee Jacob Marley! Is there any other kind now?
