Dark, unassuming and full of booze - the bar, not me.\n\nPlease don't visit this place. It's nice, and unspoiled by a-holes and what would you want with a dimly-lit, well-stocked bar a few blocks from The Mod Club anyway? \n\nSurely, you hate a year-round patio, great service and daily drink specials.\n\nYeah, move on. I'll hold down the fort.
