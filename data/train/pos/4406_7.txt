If you like fried chicken, this place should be on your list. Its pretty perfect for my liking. Not too much breading, incredibly juicy and the perfect amount of seasoning. They are very accommodating and willing to sub if you prefer all dark or all light meat. Oh and be sure to try their fried green tomato with pork belly appetizer. It really hits the spot.\n\nOur server (Tracy) took excellent care of us. I would absolutely come back here next time I'm in town.\n\nBe sure to make a reservation, the place always has a crowd.
