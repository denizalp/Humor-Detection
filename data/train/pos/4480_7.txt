2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 82\/100\n\nThis is at the top of my list for best happy hours in town! I always tell everyone this is the Happy Hour to try. Located in Town Square, after years of going to Brio's HH, this is a much better alternative. \n\nHappy Hour: \nThey do not skimp on quality, taste & serving size. I recommend the burrata, carpaccio, & calamari. The blueberry lemon drop is a must try! All $6 each from 5-7pm. \n\nService was fantastic. Seating was nice outdoors, except for the massive winds and airplanes. \n\nWill definitely be back!
