Maybe I'm not a fan of diner food. \n\nService was very friendly on a busy Sunday morning.\nRestaurant was huge, but the decor was a bit tacky.\nWe had the Cali Eggs Benedict, protein pancakes, waffles, and a veggie skillet. After a night of debauchery, we needed some serious comfort food. \nThe portions are huge but everything was mediocre and forgettable. \n\nPerfect example of why there is a portion control issue in our country.\n\nI did like 1 thing, the double carafe coffee on the table so we can help ourselves with coffee refills.
