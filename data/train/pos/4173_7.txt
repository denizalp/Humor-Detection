Located in The Mirage and unlimited alcohol! \n\n1. Came here for a group dinner and only had 1 plate of food and 1 dessert. I really wish I had more time to sample everything.\n2. There are stations lined up against the wall and are split up by region (?).\n3. Avoid the sushi. Each piece is 90% a lump of soggy rice.\n4. Try the tamales! This was one of my favorites.\n5. The mac & cheese was really good too. You can never go wrong with staples.
