These guys work on commission and they will rip you off.\n\nCharged me a $850 to install an $85 condenser fan motor.\n\nA guy came to my house last summer when I was without AC and it was hot.  He quoted me a price of 850 dollars so I bit the bullet and did it. \n\nIt took him less than an hour and all he did was remove 4 screws and plugin 4 wires.  He left the new motor box there on my property I googled it and found out the motor only cost $85.
