Dr. Vazquez was so, SO rude. I should have walked out when I heard the way he was talking to other patients, I left the office almost in tears. \nTo top it off he told me he couldn't help me, he didn't specialize in what I needed, yada yada. I told the front desk explicitly what I needed to be seen for when I was making an appointment, so why would they still schedule me? \nWish I could do more than just write a bad review. Avoid this place.
