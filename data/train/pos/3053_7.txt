OMG!!!  What an amazing value with an amazing selection of build your own toppings at $7.99!!  Even with a line, our pies were fired up and ready to eat in less than 5 minutes! \n\nGreat service, friendly staff that answers any questions during pie assembly :).  This location provides a yelp checkin discount currently on your first visit.  \n\nMy first experience was the location by the civic center (same experience there too).  Definitely recommend if you haven't been. \n\nCompetitor's have smaller pies, smaller selection, higher prices and slower service... so Win Win here!  Enjoy.
