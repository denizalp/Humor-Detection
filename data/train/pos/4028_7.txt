Overall, just an okay buffet.  Upon initial view, you would think that you are about to get exposed to a lot of food, but truly, there are just a limited variety of foods that you are getting.  You basically have a Mexican station, Asian section, Italian section, and things off the grill.  Add some cold shrimp and crab legs and that is the vast majority of the food items.  Through in a huge assortment of desserts from ice cream to lemon tarts, and you pretty much have the entire food line up.
