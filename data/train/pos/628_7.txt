Great buys and discounts. I wanted to find a blanket, comfy and pretty pillows for my classroom readiness room for students who might have sensory or behavior challenges. Look at my awesome find. All were in pristine condition. I bought 18 cushions and a full comforter for under $50 with my teacher discount (25 o\/o on Sundays). Thank goodness for Goodwill. I hope my students will benefit from these gifts. Tip: To be safe, I am running all of them through high heat in the dryer to get rid of any possible hitchhikers.
