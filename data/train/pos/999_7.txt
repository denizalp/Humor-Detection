I went there again had the Margarita pizza. \n\nIt was soggy, and tasted like a wet foot. The sauce wasn't good and the grated Parmesan tasted like cheap kraft in the green can. \n\nThey say the house make the mozzarella, that confuses me because it is super oily?\n\nIf you use quality mozzarella its not like that. You use whole milk.\n\nSo this is one of the worst pizzas ever. I'm sticking to Grimaldis, better pizza, better salad.
