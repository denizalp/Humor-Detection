We are all super bummed that Emerson Fry Bread did not show up for our scheduled Food Truck Lunch today. We have over 50 hungry employees who were eager to eat at a food truck for lunch, as our campus Cafe is closed this week. It was a nice alternative that our Happiness Committee attempted to offer us and to no fault of their own, the event is ruined and now we need to come up with another plan to feed our hungry employees ASAP. I guess we'll be eating disappointment for lunch.
