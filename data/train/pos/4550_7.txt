huge edlerly area, went over to grandma's house and asked where she wanted to go eat and she said Coco's :-( So i took her. Never seen so many old people eating at one place in my life. not a bad thing, it was just weird being the only people there with kids. Ordered the prime rib and it had good flavor but there was just way to much fat that i could only eat about a 1\/4 of it. The seasoned vegatables i always liked but couldnt eat em.
