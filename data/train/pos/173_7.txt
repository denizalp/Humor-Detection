Yay!  They have opened, and they are close to my work.  I had an arugula salad with chicken, and it was excellent.  They had a nice patio to sit on that was less noisy than inside.  Good customer service.  I was not feeling well that day, and the staff was nice to me.  I was getting a migraine and probably looked like I was going to die.  I look forward to coming back.  I also hope they get their online ordering up and running because I will definately use that.
