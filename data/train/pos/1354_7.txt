This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour. I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 15-20 min for me to pick it up. I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed. I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order. The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced.
