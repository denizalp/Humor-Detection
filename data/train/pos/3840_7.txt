Awful sauce, wings were okay, hoagies left alot to be desired. The pizza was cooked well but just thin crust, heavy tomato pastey sauce and no flavor. It's what a non-Italian place would think New York style pizza would be like, except there was like no cheese and the sauce was awful and too much of it. Hoagies just tasted like not fresh ingredients and meat. I wish there were zero stars for places like this.
