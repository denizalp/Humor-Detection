Yay, finally made it back to Cibo for their happy hour! Ordered 2 $5 pizzas and dang the dough was just as good as I remembered! :) hehe.\nThat dough is sooooo yummy... crispy and chewy..... hmmmm!\n\nThe bacon salami pizza was yummy. Go Try the Pizza!\n\nI also tried their Gnocchi another time and just to warn people, it's not your normal gnocchi... it literally is a potato dough dumpling, shaped almost like a gyoza! hehe.
