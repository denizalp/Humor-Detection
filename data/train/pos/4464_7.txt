Welp, it looks like Parkdale's gentrification has reached new heights. The moody, secretive cocktail bar has arrived. \n\nThe old Salvador Darling space has been revamped into what appears to be a little shop, with a big beautiful bar at the back. The cocktails are divine, the music is great and the crowd is, well, exactly what you'd expect. For better or worse, I love this place.
