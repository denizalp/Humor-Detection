Excited to have a decent sushi place in my hood. Go to the website and print out a 20% coupon! Monday and Tuesday's are 50% sushi and Wednesday thru Saturday indulge in happy hour 3-5:30pm for cheap alcohol and sushi. Big selection to choose from. Ginger dressing on the salad very fresh. Miso soup was a bit watery. I had sashimi lunch, got 9 good size pieces. No sushi rice on the side just plain rice. Lots of parking. Cute clean and trendy inside. Would have given it a 5 stars but our waitress ruined the experience
