\"Walk in welcome\" on the window. BS! Never!! Welcome to let them tell you NO every time! I understand you guys are busy, just don't try to let people think your place is the best one in town that's why you can talk to people with that kind of attitude! there are so many good places out there!! \nP.s.  Took a long time to find the parking! And had to walk a loooooooong way to get to the door!
