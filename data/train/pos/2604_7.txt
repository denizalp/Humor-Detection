Good outdoor mall when the weather is nice.\nI go here for RA happy hour sometimes.\n\nHowever, I found a HUGE roach chilling near the fountain area on the stone step\/ bench area.\nWell, duh its an outdoor mall...\nbut still, I refuse to get along with roaches.\n\nThat one experience was disgusting and kind of freaked me out thus I'm hesitant to go back.
