- boards are way too bouncy. miss the net and a breakaway the other way every time.\n- locker rooms have anti-alcohol signs but they are always trashed with beer cans and bottles. no effort to even put them in the trash.\n- toilets don't have seats...feels like a 3rd world country\n- shower missing a prison guard\n- bar closes before the last game ends...no wonder no one is ever there and beer cans are all over the parking lot
