My friends and I came here for a friend's birthday. It's a little off-putting when you first come in. We had to cut through a very un-Mediterranean bar to get to the actual resturant. The food and martinis was good, the owner was very attentive, and the entertainment was fun to watch (just make sure you're not in her way when she spins!). Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to try a hookah.
