I work down the street from this place and I love it. Everything on the menu is inexpensive and very good. Not sure what everyone else is complaining about to be honest. \nBreakfast omelettes and burritos are my all time favorite.\nFor lunch I have tried the Salmon salad, Chicken on a bun, Crispy Chicken Taquitos.\nYou can pick up for quicker service or you can have one of the lovely employees deliver it to you by foot (they do not drive).
