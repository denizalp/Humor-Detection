One of the best day clubs in vegas! I came here in the scorching hot summer and for guest list people the wait was 2.5 hours long ! Although we were upset, the vibe was great! Not too crowded but fun enough to party. I wouldn't get in that pool water considering the bathroom lines were empty lol!\n\nDrinks are pretty expensive so you should be friendly and make friends to get bottle service!
