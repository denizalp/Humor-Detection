VooDoo Beach is an impressive and beautiful pool located in Las Vegas. This spot has a few different pools to pick from and scenic views all around from the hotel view, to the palm trees and waterfalls around and even sand to give the beach feel. VooDoo has a great ambiance to get some sun, make a splash in the water, and just overall relax and take it all in. There was DJ spinning up on his deck when I came and the bartender here was awesome! 4 Stars for fun times at VooDoo Beach.~
