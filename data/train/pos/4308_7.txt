One of our favorite casinos to visit and also great that its connected to Palazzo. We haven't stayed here, but the dining options are great. we've dined at Bouchon, First, and Taqueria Canonita.\n\nThe Phantom was also cool(catch a show before its gone!) and we've also ridden the gondolas(our out-of town guests made us do it!)  throw in some cool shops and fun people watching, you got youself a very enjoyable time in faux-Italy...ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(327\/365) \"Italy On The Strip\"
