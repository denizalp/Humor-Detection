This is probably more appropriate for a \"TIP\" but I couldn't figure out how to write one on my desktop.  Anyway, I saw a sign that they are no longer going to serve lunch bento boxes and that it will just be the full service menu at lunch.  Also, they now offer daily specials!  When I went, they had a blue fin tuna special.
