I have no ideas why this place has such high rated reviews. First of all, it is not even ramen. Secondly, the soup base was very disappointing. I am not saying the food is awful. It is just very average noodle. \n\nIf you live nearby and are just looking for noodle, yes this place is convenient. But, if you are looking for Japanese Ramen, you will be very disappointed. I should've known by looking at the menu that people posted. \n\nThe one star is for the very friendly and attentive waitress.
