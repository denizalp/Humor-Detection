The Foot Spa gave us bad service so the owner Chen wrote to us inviting us to THIS PLACE. No Engrish spoken here. Upscale from \"foot massage\" for $20 to body for $30. Same thing as \"foot massage\".\nWe wanted private rooms and two girls \nSure sure\nWait wait\nOk ok ok\nBut after 10 minutes waiting,,,, no no no the lady waved us away....\nCurtains separate the \"rooms\".\nI like to pay extra and get privacy without hearing all the people grunting moaning and chattering...\nVery disappointed
