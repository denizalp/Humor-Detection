My wacky girlfriend and I were there for lunch today. She had the gyro and loved it. I had the souvlaki sandwich and loved it.  She had their cheesecake and loved it. I had the tiramisu and loved it. We both had the ranch fries (circular fries sorta halfway between a fry and a chip) and loved them. She got the check...and I love her. \n\nSeriously, it's a neat little place. Yinz should go.\n\nOh, I forgot. They have octopus on their menu! Octopus! In Brookline!!!! I must try!
