Joined a few friends who enjoy this place. \nIt was recently remodeled so had a fresh look. We sat towards the back where we could look out to the pool of the RIO. Service was quick and friendly. We ordered a variety of items. I enjoyed the Tandoori items along with the Naan. My friends had some Vegetable and Chicken curries that they raved about. \nWould love to try this place again on my next visit.
