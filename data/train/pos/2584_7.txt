I've attempted to sell CDs here twice and have been rejected because my CDs smelled bad. I admit that I don't have a good sense of smell, but these guys seem to have hypersensitive olfaction. I don't ever recall a CD having a smell of any kind and mine have never been exposed to cats. So, if you'd like to sell your CDs, give them a good washing and deodorant treatment before bringing them into Half Price Books in Rocky River.
