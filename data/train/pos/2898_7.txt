Blech! I was really looking forward to this but ended up grossed out and remorseful. Probably would have been fine had they gotten our takeout order right. All 3 of our cheeseburgers were mistakenly made doubles. After taking the extra beef patty out the burgers were just sloppy, soggy messes. Just gross. Definitely wont be back...YUCK!
