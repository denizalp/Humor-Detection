So, the club has been open for a week and I've been there 5 times total....call me Surrendered OUT!\n\nAnother great thing about the club is that the gogo dancers, ACTUALLY, DANCE! And know how to!!!! lol \nThey aren't these fake boobed out girls just there to giggle and show some T and A....these girls are fit and you can tell....\nI swear, these girls did some yoga poses that made me go \"Whoa, did she just bend that way???!\" \n\nAMAZEBALLS.
