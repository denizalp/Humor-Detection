I came here a few times for a Sunday breakfast back when they did that, but they stopped doing so. I like the surroundings, and the small patio; however the reason I do not stop in any more is that a place with a choice of 35 burgers holds no interest for me. I love pub food; this is not it - strictly a personal preference. I regret that they changed so completely to stricly a burger place.
