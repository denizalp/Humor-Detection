I had LyLy do my nails and she was awesome.  Call a cab to go over there.  $20 cab ride, $45 for a manicure and deluxe pedicure, $20 cab ride back (or if LyLy's husband is there, you can give him the $ and he'll take you back.  Total $85.  Regular manicure and pedicure at the hotels on the strip, $110-$145.  Do the math.  And they did an excellent job. \n\nAs I said, do the math.
