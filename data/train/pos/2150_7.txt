When I discovered Jone's Market, I made a point to visit and look at the food selection. They have a good variety of sausages (imported from California), dry goods, canned goods. They also have Russian Black Bread, imported from Glendale. CA. Also have Baltika beer, Soviet champagne, and Georgian wines.
