We heard about the Philly Cheese Steaks being the best around they come with your standard back east toppings onions, peppers & Mushrooms.  The juices dripping off as you eat,  it's messy like it's supposed to be.   They use the best tasting Mozzarella.   Keep this place a secret or all your friends will be here..\n\nSaved my free pizza slice for the next check in.
