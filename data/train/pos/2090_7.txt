Once you get through the winding Swedish maze of home goods and fight off the roaming Minotaur, it's not too shabby of a domestic adventure. They've got all the affordable home decor your little hermit heart can hope for. It's not as strong as top of the line brands but those brands have a substantially larger price tag. The furniture is modern and looks good, there's a good variety too. From couches, to bed covers, to pictures frames, plants and wooden spoons, IKEA has it.
