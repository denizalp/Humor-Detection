TERRIBLE and disrespectful service. This place only spends time with people who choose to waste a pay check in order to have a table to show off and make up for their insecurities and boost their egos. Don't waste your time here, unless you want to waste time on meaningless people with meaningless conversations that are equivalent to that you would have with a child entering puberty then go right ahead. Clientele is not ideal at best. Take your business else where to a place you can enjoy an intellectual conversation, because this is NOT the place for that!
