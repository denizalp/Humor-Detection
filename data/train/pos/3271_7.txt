Where do I begin?? This place has no class and no rules. Came here for a show at Encore and the disrespect was unbelievable. The security and everyone there was entirely rude and I will NEVER step foot in any of their properties. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere legitimate and classy and stay far far away from wynn.
