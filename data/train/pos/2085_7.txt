No doubt this guy has turned me on to some good quality music, but not without making me feel like an idiot.  If you needed help at my work and didn't know anything I'd happily help you without asking for your money.  Then again I don't worry about my image, I just figure I should be myself and do good work and that'll keep them coming back.  I'll boycott your store until you change your personality which is unlikely!
