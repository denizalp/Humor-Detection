this whole tea thing is actually pretty good, I got the pomegranate vanilla tea latte (Aren't I white?). The buddy got the chai latte. Both very delicious, reasonable for about $5 if you want to change the flavor a little (say make a green tea latte sweeter) they can do that. very nice service. I'll be coming here a lot more, and not just for early football games in korea.
