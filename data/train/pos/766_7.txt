What is it about Vegas Clubs and huge let downs?  They always show pictures of beautiful women and when you get there it's nothing special.  The bouncers are always strict so you end up having to go in with a huge group of girls.  And once you are in even if you see a hot girl they end up in the VIP section.  I think the next time I go back to Vegas I'll stick to the gambling and food.
