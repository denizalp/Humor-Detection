Some great pierogies are expertly handmade with \"tender loving care,\" here in this once-was-a-gas-station. Quality, I tell you. They're definitely worthy of a pierogi pilgrimage. \n\nOrder them hot if you want them right then and there because these nice ladies also sell them cold to take home too. \n\nHot and buttery, buttery, buttery, and covered in sauteed onions is how you'll get them. So good. We shared the potato and cheese, potato and sauerkraut, and hot sausage varieties. Delicious, them all.
