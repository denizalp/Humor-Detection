Positives:\n- Nice lobby\n- Expansive Arizona parking\n\nNegatives: (in the order I found them)\n- Rest of hotel is ancient and beat\n- Rooms not updated - the fake brass around the mirrored closet doors is awesome\n- Ice machine was broken\n- Phone was broken\n- Bizarre process to sign in to free internet\n- And the big winner: the HVAC is incredibly loud. Even with earplugs it kept waking me up.\n- Not that the hotel can do much about this, but Mesa is pretty crappy...
