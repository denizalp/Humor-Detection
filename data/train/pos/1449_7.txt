This has got to be the LEAST appetizing name for an Italian restaurant. It's called \"The Firm.\" Can't they make it  La Firma for instance?? The decor is a bit outdated as well. BUT the food was amazing! I was very surprised due to the lame decor...The waitstaff was friendly and the portions were big. Personally, I think it's more of a dinner place b\/c it's kind of dark .. and the meals are heavy. Yummy pasta!
