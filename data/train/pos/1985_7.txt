Pretty much no shopping experience makes me as happy as going to Costco. Their pizza is reason enough not to jump. Big portions of life make me happy. I like the fact that it's membership only. Keeps the riff raff at bay. F-ing riff raff. \n\nWhat is riff raff? \n\nI can't think of one negative thing to say about except that the female employees don't seem to like being stared at by my weasely eyes. GOSH!
