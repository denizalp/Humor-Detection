Renaissance festival in Vegas. \n\nIts a great festival for the family. Entertaining shows, tons of great food, family fun activities. Relive the renaisance times by dressing up and relishing in the days of chivalry. \n\nWe had a great time for our first visit..excited for what next years will be like..
