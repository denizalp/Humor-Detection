Where to get brunch in Markham that's not dim sum? Main's Mansion lays out a nice brunch. And a summer Saturday or Sunday on the patio can't be beat. \n\nMain's serves up a brunch right. Gilead Cafe needs to take a lesson. Eggs benny for the price of eggy benny at Gilead Cafe but you get home fries and an embarrassingly large side of fruit. \n\nService is great and parking along Main street (not to be confused with the Unionville Main street) is free.
