Overall, this place is awful. Finding your room requires GPS and breadcrumbs to find your way back to the elevator. \n\nThe really bad:\n* The room was absolutely awful. The TV looks like something out of 1985\n* There was a used razor in the bathroom\n* The sports book is closed during the weekdays. \n* There was duct tape holding carpet and other things together in the hallway. \n\nI honestly wouldn't stay here EVER again.
