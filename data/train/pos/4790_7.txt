This place is my favorite 24 hour casino cafe.  It has a lot more than just the standard diner dishes everyone else has.  Nice atmosphere and Wynn has the best casino mojitos I've tried.\n\n10\/10\/07:  I am really bummed they now only do a limited menu after midnight.  I am moving my rating down a star.
