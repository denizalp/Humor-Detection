Really underwhelming. This was our second visit. Ordered many of the same foods as the first time. Tonight the food was bland and tasteless.  Empty tasteless calories. The mixed drinks had too much sugar and too little alcohol. There are so many wonderful places to eat in Las Vegas that there is no reason to come clack.
