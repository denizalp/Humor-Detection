Solid place!! Their vegetable juices are freshly made and their best products!! Their smooth is a little bit too sweet for me but some may like it. The all green energizer is really green juice flavor...no sweetness...I think it's delish!! I heard others saying the hangover is really good and healthy and less green juice flavor and a touch sweet...may try that next time. Their acai bowls are excellent as well!! I got the Hawaiian acai bowl and they added a layer of coconut for me!! Will come back!!
