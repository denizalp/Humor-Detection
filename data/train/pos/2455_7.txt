Went for dinner tonight. Will be last time I\nCome here. Food took forever to be served.Steak was warm, potatoes cold. Just about done with dinner when my napkin fell on floor...went to reach for it and saw a roach crawling on it. Beyond disgusted. Have never encountered that in any restaurant before. Needless to say not coming back.
