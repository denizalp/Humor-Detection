I lived in Ohio for two years and didn't try Swenson's until three days before I was moving out of the state.\n\nThat was dumb.\n\nDrive up.  Turn your lights on.  Order a Galley Boy (or two) with a side of teezers and a peanut butter shake.  Turn your lights off.  Wait five minutes.  Roll down your window for the car hop.  Devour (the food, not the car hop!).
