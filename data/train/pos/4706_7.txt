+4 stars b\/c it's the best highway, -1 star b\/c it's so expensive!\nRoads are always clean\/clear and hardly ever have traffic. I drive to Mississauga everyday and this makes the drive super fast! My dad is such an addict he'll take it from Leslie exit to Bayview (if you live in Richmond Hill you'll understand how short that is!)\nWe have become such great customers that they send us gas cards lol\nGreat highway and with the ridiculous gas prices, it is def worth it!
