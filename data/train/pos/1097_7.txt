Won't ever buy anything from that sales person. Walked in. Happen to be wearing my moving and cleaning Grubbies. He looked down his nose at me and asked if I was looking for used. They only carry new. He obviously didn't see what vehicle I got out of in the parking lot or he probably would have treated me differently. What a creep! Off to find my appliance elsewhere.
