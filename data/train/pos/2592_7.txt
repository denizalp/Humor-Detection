Wow! I cant' believe it's been 2 years since I've been here.  I've been preoccupied with other aspects of life.  I just got a mani-pedi today, and it was fabulous. The ladies who work there are very nice, and their skill-level is high.  Elegant Nail's prices are reasonable ($45 for a mani-pedi with hot oil treatment on the hands and a paraffin dip on the feet). It might not be the chic-est nail spa in Charlotte, but it's still an awesome place to go.  Laid back, quiet, relaxing, and the hand and foot massages are premier.
