Beatles, I'm there.  Cirque du Soleil, I'm there.\n\nI've been to 6 different shows over the years, and I've seen my last Cirque du Soleil show.  Not that I didn't like the music (although not live where others I've see are), and not that I didn't appreciate the effort - great choreography, set design, and elaborate stunts and dancing.  In fact, there were a few moments where I said \"wow\".  But it wasn't enough.  Frankly, I was just underwhelmed.\n\nI don't get the clowning around mixed in with the serious.  Enough.
