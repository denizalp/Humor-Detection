This place reminds me of the meat shop I grew up going to.  True butcher shop. Filet is $21.99 a pound which is pretty much the going rate.  Phenomenal quality filet...as in restaurant quality.  Other stuff sold there?  Spices, seasonings, deli meat, cheese, pasta.  Messed up parking lot so I suggest you enter their parking lot with one hand on the wheel and one hand on the horn if you know what I mean...
