Not too impressed with the food at this place.  I find it terribly overpriced and very mediocre.\n\nThe owner is a salesman and would not trust anything he says or does.  \n\nAte here with a group of 10 people.  Steaks were overcooked, short ribs were of fast food quality, veal was as thick as prepackaged Hormel lunch meat.\n\nToo many other good restaurants to go back to this place.  Owner is a bit of a creep as well.
