Always the worst customer service.  I've been waiting 10 minutes for a notary while only 1 of 4 people working in the branch is busy helping customers.  They are too busy looking at their computer screens to pay attention to the people standing in here waiting!  I can't wait to change banks!!!  I HATE this branch!!!!!
