TJ Maxx, I love you.\n\nThe amount of visits I make here is disgusting. Honestly, I think I need to seek help to save my wallet from another beating.\n\nBut honestly what's not to love about this location! I always walk out with something I love!\n\nIt's mine and my best friends go to place to discuss how CUTE everything is and buy things we don't actually need.
