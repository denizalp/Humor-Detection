last time I came here, in the middle of my 5th plate i had to use the rest room. when i came back i ate 3 more plates.\n\nreally the only thing worth while to eat in a buffet is seafood. this isn't the best but its a lot of it. a lot of the ok quality versions of my favs. but the best are the lobsters and raw clams! \n\nbut stay away from the cocktail shrimp!
