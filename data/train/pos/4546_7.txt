This restaurant is located in the venetian hotel. Since my girls and I stayed at this palazzo we came here one night because they are open till 3AM which is a plus! I got the soft noodles with shrimp and it was very yummy. The portion was perfect and it was around $17 I believe with tax. Not the cheapest but still worth it if you are hungry late at night.\nThere was a lot to choose from on their menu. I probably wouldn't mind eat there again since it looks like they had plenty of seating.
