This was our 2nd stop on our Buffet of Buffets tour and the buffet here was average. The best item was probably the crab legs, but even then it could have been better.\n\nThey have a good dessert area where they have cotton candy and gelato. Also the cake selection is great with many different kinds. Too bad I was so full otherwise I would have like to sample more of their selections.\n\nThe service was not very good as our plates kept piling up after we ate and were not cleared in a timely manner.
