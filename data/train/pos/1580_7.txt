I should have worn a cowboy hat!\n\nThis is the only mall in Canada where you'll find a greeter at Wal-Mart who'll say \"Howdy!\" at the entrance. Hey, it's Calgary! \n\nIf you like Wal-Mart, Sears, Shoppers Drug Mart, and Dollarama, then, this is the mall for you.\n\nI wouldn't go here for the latest fashion. Unless, you like Randy River or Reitmans.\n\nThe ambience of the mall can be summed up with Avril Lavigne's music video called Complicated. Minus all the rowdiness, of course.
