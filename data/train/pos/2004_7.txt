This pizza is really good for its price. However this location is dirty. My boyfriend and I walked in and was looking at the menu hanging on the wall and there it was, this huge roach dead hanging there... ON THE MENU. At least clean it up so the customers don't see it. Disgusting. Now I know why the pizza was so good.
