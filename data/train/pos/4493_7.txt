WARNING! This has been the worst flying experience. Flight has been delayed 4 times, and it's not due to weather.\n\nI was unaware of this thing happening, but now after checking the reviews, it seems like it is a common occurrence. DO NOT FLY with Allegiance, unless you like unexpected delays for no reason. If you value your time, pay a a little bit more for a flight that will get you to where you need to be ON TIME. Saving those few bucks was not worth 5+ hours of my life wasted here.\n\nCheck my photo for proof of delays.
