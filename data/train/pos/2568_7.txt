This is a great place for coffee and wonderful pastries.  The Baristas are GORGEOUS young men and are so friendly, entertaining and helpful.  There is outdoor seating as well as a nice big indoor area.  The pastries are amazing and unlike Starbucks, you won't break the bank for a cup o'joe and a treat.  I dare ya to go and not enjoy the place...I double dog dare ya!
