Why? Why? WHY do y'all do this to me??? Thanks for the lousy birthday present. I'd have rather gotten a Long John Silver's gift card. \n\nCould you have had more turnovers? \n\nCould you have at least just held on to the ball? \n\nDid the fact that I watched the game at a Damon's bring hexes upon your franchise? Should I have stayed home? \n\nBlah. \n\nYeah, yeah, better luck next year. Grrr.
