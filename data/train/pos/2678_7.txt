I went here a couple of times and my experience was not the greatest. The staff are very young and don't seem to care about your skin type or tanning history, they were more concerned with chatting to their friends that were sitting in the waiting area. \nI used one of their beds and since they didn't ask me about my tanning past I was in there a little too long and wound up getting the worst sunburn of my life. I will never go back.
