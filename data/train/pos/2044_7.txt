Anyone who gave this place even one star, has to be the owner or a relative!!! Worst food ever!!!! We took one bite(cheese steak and hamburger- they gave use the wrong burger on top of that!!) HORRIBLE, and through it out!!! Nasty taste, cheap hamburgers, no meat on cheese steak and had a horrible taste-
