Cool spot to kickback and club yourself out for the night. This place is actually quite massive, complete with indoor\/outdoor festivities. The decor is fairly modern and the music will pretty much get the crowd going throughout the night. I have been to Surrender several times, but primarily only after XS or someplace else. Overall, not a bad spot to party the night away... \n\nPros-\nMassive \nIndoor\/outdoor \nLocated within Encore \nDecent music \nOutdoor table games \nEasy to get in\n\nCons-\nSmall dance floor \nNot as hip anymore compared with (Omnia, XS, etc)\nInteresting crowd mix
