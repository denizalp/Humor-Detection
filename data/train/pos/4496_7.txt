Best Pho I have been able to find in Charlotte. Very traditional, super tasty. The exterior is pretty ghetto but they've done a good job transforming the interior to be more inviting. \n\nPortions are exceptionally big, most times it'll be two meals for me. Wait staff is usually attentive and fast. Occasionally there will be a small language barrier if you want something explained on the menu. But hey, it's a traditional joint, what do you expect!? Highly recommend it.
