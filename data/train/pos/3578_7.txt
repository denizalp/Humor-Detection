Typical punk dive. Crappy beer, crappy sound system, and crappy neighborhood. Those are the good points. The bad points: it's not original and punk\/noise bands bore me to tears. But on the rare occasion they book a good show here, it's cheap and close to my house. Kudos for the veggie friendly vittles. Shine on you filthy, urine-soaked diamond.
