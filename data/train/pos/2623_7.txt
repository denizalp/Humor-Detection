I needed to fax a document and UPS was the most convenient at the time. I stopped by right at about closing time. The Clerk indicated they were closing in 4 minutes. I told her it will only take less than 2. I must admit I haven't used a place to fax any documents for awhile. I was totally shocked at the price to fax a page. The price to pay for convenient, I guess. Clerk was helpful and waited to make sure the confirmation went through while she closes for the day.
