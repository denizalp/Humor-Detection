What a disappointment. The variety of food was horrible. Nothing tasted fresh. 12 people came out to like 450 which is expected but can we get a little bit of quality in the food. Service  was the only thing that I would say is good here. The wait to get in was about 40 minutes. I would never come back here for the buffet. Had better food at other buffets here
