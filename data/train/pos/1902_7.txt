Overpriced junk.\n\nNothing says fashion trendsetters like $4 pencils and $10 decks of playing cards.  I actually bought one of the $6 Kris Jenner masks (just a cardboard pic glued to a stick) as a gag gift.  Kinda embarrassed about it, but it has made for great fun at the bars.\n\n$40 for a coffee mug.  For that I should also get a walk-on role to one of the TV shows. I can play dramatic. \n\nOnly in America!
