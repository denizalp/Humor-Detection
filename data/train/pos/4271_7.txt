We sat at the bar.  Told the staff it was our first time, ordered de-lish beet martinis and were about to order dinner...  When the bartenders made a round of shots for everyone at the bar, the two bartenders and the manager and drank them.  We were left out.  \nWe didn't stay for dinner.  \nWe will never go back.
