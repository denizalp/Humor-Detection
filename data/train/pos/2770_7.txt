Been here a few times and I always see the security guard on the cell phone... not really watching people. \n\nGas is cheap but must pay with cash to avoid paying the surcharge fee.\n\nDrinks and snacks are reasonably priced and the cashier is always friendly.  Maria is usually there when I come in.\n\nThanks Rebel for keeping my tank full without breaking the bank.
