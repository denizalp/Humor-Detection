How has no one else reviewed this place? Wow.\n\nWell I have only been once or twice so I am not the dazzo's expert, but I remember it being pretty awesome. \n\nKosher dogs and hamburgers. Fries. Chili. All the goodies on top you can imagine. Seriously amazingly tasty. Located in the ghetto, really tiny parking lot, but worth it. \n\nSomeone else who is more knowledgable should come review Dazzo's!
