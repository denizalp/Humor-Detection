My first date with my wife was a the Garcia's pizza in Normal, IL in 1979 near Waterson Towers.  I later found out that Garcia's closed in Normal when I was celebrating my 20th wedding anniversary.  We drove to Champaign and told them that we met 20 years earlier and they gave us our meal free for being so loyal.  I went to school at the U of I in Champaign and my wife went to school in Normal at ISU.  Garcia's have the best pizza outside of Chicago.
