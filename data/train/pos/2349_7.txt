I bought a facial package from this place when they were on Charleston. Called last month trying to get treatment done, and was told that they lost my file after the move. They can't verify the remaining treatment, therefore I lost my package. I don't think it's my problem where they lost my file. This place is irresponsible, and has no customer service. I do not recommend anyone to go there.
