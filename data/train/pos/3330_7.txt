Authentic Mexican't food. Factory made chicken tamales containing rehydrated red bell pepper and corn? Woah! Not to mention the rock hard taquitos, scarce of meat. The rice was really salty too. What happened to quality control? There are too many taco shops to count but I'll count this place out from here on out.
