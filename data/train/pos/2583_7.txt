Victor was great, our photos were excellent.  I would recommend, hands down, to use him.  He was also a fantastic deal, compared to what the chapel charged, and provided better images.  I'm so glad that I hired him, the photos from the chapel were blah but Victor's were amazing, so happy that I have those.  I would have taken him to the wedding if I could, but no outside photographers allowed...  Hire Victor!  You will be happy you did!
