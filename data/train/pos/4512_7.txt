well this place has always been amazing, when hunger strikes you in the middle of the night! Lol \nthis one over here in Surprise is fantastic, our server Tammy, was excellently amazing! She was serving 10 tables by herself! Their food is yummy as usual. They never fail my expectations, I got some cob salad with some prime rib, and it's mouth watering good! \nI'll definitely be coming back!
