Above and beyond service and friendliness the several times I've been. Nice selection little selection of wines and beers. Large open area for seating that is comfortable for families or the lone wolf that pops in for lunch. Was surprised by their big variety of hot sauces in the \"Rev It Up\" area.  They do offer a military discount.
