Debating between 4-5 stars. very good carne asada. We got the carne asada nachos and it came with a huge pile of asada and fixings on the side which was great for sharing amongst 4 people. We also got lengua  and al pastor tacos and burritos. all were great. But the place is a little dirty and we had to clean our own tables. I'll update the next time i go.
