I used to love them, then they sent me a pair of dull shears. Then they sent  me a new pair , but it only took 2months to send me a new pair to the wrong address mind you. So decided to buy from someplace else.  Just got the new shears and am sending them back but  I HAVE TONPAY THENSHIPPING ON THEIR CRAP......  I'm through with ryans  and there's obnoxious shit....
