This is a national chain hot doggery. They never disappoint & when you're looking for hangover cure I'd say this is a pretty good one. The hotdogs have the snap & all beef that they're known for. I also got the chili cheese fries to share & they were also yummy in the tummy. If in Vegas & need a quick bite or on a budget this place will do the trick.
