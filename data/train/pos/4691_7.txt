When visiting Lee Lee Supermarket for the first time, I was pleased to discover the availability of good Boba in the Phoenix area.\n\nThanks to Boba Tea House, I am able to enjoy the sweet, creamy, and intermittently-chewy experience that Boba has to offer.\n\nThe Boba Tea House also serves a limited variety of foods -- including calamari.\n\nDrinks are about $3 each.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- The Internet on the computer never seems to function correctly.\n\n- Punch out cards are available -- in which you earn a free drink after ~8+ visits (forgot the exact figure).
