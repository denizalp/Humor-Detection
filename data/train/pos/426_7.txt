I second the best pet shop in Pittsburgh. I adore this store. The staff is uh-mazing. They don't treat you or you pet like some average joe customer who comes in to stock up on pet supplies. They take the time to get to know you and your pet. Stop in and visit! \n\nBy the way they are conveniently located right across from East End Vet.
