Busy location every day of the week. I come here maybe bout twice a month. I like coming here to get kalbi short ribs, water and random things that interest me. I also love coming here for samples (which I know people like doing too.) I can spend hours in here and go isle by isle looking and all the things they carry. I like coming here for the polish hotdogs at the food court... Cheap and tasty...
