Next to the Town Center is Fry's Electronic store where you can purchase anything that is electronic related. This store is larger than most Fry's locations I have been to and this location even has a small cafeteria in the middle of the store where you can buy food and drinks.\n\nAs with every Fry's Electronic store, there is a store theme. As you probably would have guessed, the store's theme is slot machines as you see from the front of the store.
