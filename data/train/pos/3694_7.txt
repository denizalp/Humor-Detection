I have worst experience with this restaurant. We orders food through postmates day before yesterday.We ordered chicken curry and tandoori chicken. Tandoori chicken is frozen one which I got I think it's almost week ago food and I ask for spicy but it's not at all tasty, no salt and spicy. We spending money for the frozen food is very bad... and also full of red colour. They can use colour but not too much. Very bad and worst experience.
