I was happy with Hertz until I learned that if you need to extend your rental car through @hertz and you made it through @hotwire, be prepared to pay over 100% of what you reserved it for. I paid 80ish for 3 days and #HertzRental wants 118 and some change for 1 day. What a joke! #Hotwire #carrentals what also sucks is that I picked up the car later than the reservation time and the time return does not change  #hertzgoldmember #hertzgold #hertzgoldclub
