Even after I switched agents, I am still getting calls from her office.  I spoke to her personally to get setup and and it still was not done correctly.  Jen has a poorly run team and keeps terrible records.  I REPEAT save yourself a ton of headaches and DO NOT TRUST this agent with your insurance.
