Great breakfast place since I haven't tried their other menus, it is pricey but so is everything else in this hotel. The salmon and bagel were delicious and filling. Presentation and service were great as well, I loved the dill sauce that comes with the salmon and bagel. The eggs were cooked perfectly. My husband's eggs benedict was executed very well.\nOverall nice place for breakfast with a nice terrace weather permitting.
