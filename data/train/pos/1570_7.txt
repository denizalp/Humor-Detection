Located a few steps away from fun (wink wink), this place is worth a visit. This place is old and serves up cheap food.  Most people that come here appear to be locals. It's easy to get in and out of and their associates seem to know patrons by their names.\n\nI've been here a few times and enjoyed my visits. \n\nThe bowling alley always seems busy.  \n\nIf you don't need and aren't searching for the glitz and glamour of the strip or Downtown, this is the place to visit. \n\nSteak specials for $5.99!?  You can't go wrong.
