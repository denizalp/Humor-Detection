This restaurant has been relocated into a newly constructed building.  The restaurant's decor looks very nice and modern.  The buffet is conveniently placed in the dining room,  The employees were very nice and my order came out correct.\n\nI cannot give this place 5 stars.  This is a new building.  It should have a 100% sanitation grade.  The dining area wasn't filthy but did need some attention.  Many of the tables were dirty.  They weren't busy and a BUNCH of tables were dirty.  Somebody was falling back on their job.
