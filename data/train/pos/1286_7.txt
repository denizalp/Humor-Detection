Wow, this is some amazing fried chicken! I think the recipe is the same at all locations, so this would make sense. I ate three pieces of it, and I can't remember the last time I stuffed myself like that. The other items I had (seaweed salad, imperial rolls, kimbap) were all good, but that chicken is seriously the reason to go there. A little bit spicy, perfectly seasoned, barely any grease - which is a rarity when it comes to fried food. I already want more! This will be a dangerous place for me, I can already tell.
