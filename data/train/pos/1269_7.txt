One of my favorite places to eat at in LV.\n\nCame here for brunch, lunch and dinner.\nLove the interior & exterior of the place and love their outdoor patio that is dog friendly.\n\nThe toast with peaches are great to start with, yummy caesar salad and burger. I wasn't take huge on the fried chicken sandwich but I'm still giving this place a 5 star.\n\nI will def come back and try other things on the menu.\nGreat service, never a problem with parking or getting seated right away.
