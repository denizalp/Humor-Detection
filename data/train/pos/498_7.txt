You know how you get to a point, where you say no mas, toward a type of food?  Well, we hit that AFTER, this jaunt to American.  That said it was awesome burgers!  But we're burgered out for a while .  You can take that as a compliment American!!\nWe ordered the classic and route 66 with onion rings and fries respectively and it was shark eyes all around (5\/5). Hot and fresh tasting! \nThe service is consistent at this location and the staff is friendly and the interior is clean (5\/5).\nGive this place a try...It's worth it!
