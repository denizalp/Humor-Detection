I can never tire of these even after all these years.\n\nI've watched them from restuarants, hotel rooms, in the back of a cab on the Strip and standing on the sidewalk itself and always find myself drawn in.\n\nSome songs are better than others but even ones that I don't like can't take away from the experience.\n\nFive stars all the way!
