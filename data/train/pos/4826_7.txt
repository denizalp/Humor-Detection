Expensive and service with attitude.  Just didn't work for me. I wanted a good beer and some descent food choices. The menu is pretty pricey and very suitable to they Ritz Carlton crowd. Yet the severs wear blue jeans and hang with each other. Very confusing place. Don't think this place will be in business for very long.
