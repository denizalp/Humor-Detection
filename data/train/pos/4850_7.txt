Since my previous review, a lot has changed at Above All Grand Salon and Spa. Haircuts are less expensive (I got mine done by one of the owners, so perhaps that's why it was more expensive), and they've widened their types of massages. \n\nThe current owner wrote me and was very responsive to my previous reviews, and I have to say that attentiveness like this reflects the quality of the business.
