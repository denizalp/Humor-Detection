Went for a co-workers lunch and even though we were the only people in the restaurant the food too lover 30 minutes to come out. Then when it did come out the shrimp skewers were raw and the fried chicken was soggy. Not to mention they removed the sushi and soup for. The bento box. \n\nFish quality is average. And customer service is atrocious. Many better places to go to get real sushi without the crappy service and overpriced items.
