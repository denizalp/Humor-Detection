We made a reservation for lunch last Friday and really enjoyed our experience.  We were warmly greeted and quickly seated, the restaurant was lively, the servers were so friendly and attentive and the food was quite tasty too.  I started with a strawberry mojito (so tasty) and shared the pretzel bites with cheese fondue with my husband.  I enjoyed the \nblack bean burger with tots for my lunch - perfectly cooked and satisfying.\nDefinitely a great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner if in the GCU vicinity!
