I like how you can park at Palazzo and walk over to the Sands Convention. Picking up the badges was very quick and easy here since the traffic  isnt as bad. Place os well staffed and easy to get help when you need it to locate a vendor. Place is small compared  to the Las Vegas  Convention  but it serves  its purpose  for what it is.
