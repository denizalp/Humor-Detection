Us Asians are professionals when it comes to buffet. \n\nStretchy pants? check. \n\nEnema the night before? check. \n\nNot filling up on carbs like bread\/rice\/potatoes to maximize stomach space? check. \n\nCrab legs, cocktail shrimp, all things seafood? check. \n\nFilling up at the dessert station and eating until you're bursting? CHECK!\n\nI'm getting too old for this shit.
