And now for something a little different: a review on Lego store.  It is not just a wonderland for kids, but for many adults as well.  At prices as steep as around $400 a box, I guess you really gotta love legos.  \nThe store in Yorkdale isn't big, so beware of the crowds everywhere you look.  There are areas where people big and small can build stuff with legos.  \nAnd if you are a regular customer, you can become a VIP and get discounts.  It is really a Lego haven.
