Had a decent joining experience but they do exhibit some of the slick selling tactics that is typical of US culture. Anyway, I have been charged $250 (plus HST) per month for a family membership and have been assured that no one gets in lower than this. I find it hard to believe many people would pay this kind of money in a bad economy - so if you are getting a better deal please make it known on this forum.
