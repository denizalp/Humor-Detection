My wife's  choice for a Dr. to help with her lack of sex drive and moodiness.  The pellets they implanted made her have even less of sex drive and caused depression moodiness and anger. My wife of 14 years docent even like me any more.  I called and spoke to the doctor's staff.  Dr. calls then calls my wife.  Guess who has the problem, me ofcourse.  Well thank you very much for pretending to care and not helping. Obviously this Dr. didn't want to hear what I had to say. Oh well peace out.
