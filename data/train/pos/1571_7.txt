Nothing too special here, though it sure seems the opposite. Their bowls of smokey drinks have little alcohol in them, I can't even taste the alcohol whatsoever and because the drink is cold the gummies become hard and hard to chew. \n\nDefinitely should share with someone because the drink is large and the price is steep. I believe $36 for a bowl of concentrated sugary sweet smokey concoction. I would complain it's too expensive for what it is, but it's Vegas so there's no need to complain. You know what you're getting into.
