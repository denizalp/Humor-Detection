Ridiculously bad \"doctors.\"  The internet helped me with my foot problem, but the \"doctor\" didn't seem to want to really help me at all with my real problem (my foot), he really wanted me to say that I was depressed or anxious so that he could give me some meds!  \"So...are you depressed?\" \"No.\"  \"Are you sure???\"
