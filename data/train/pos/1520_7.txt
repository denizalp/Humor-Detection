The sign says \"and grill\"  not so.  Just a bar, no food.  So once you get past that your good to go.\nIts really a big place, pool tables, pin ball machine, the usual bar games.\nThe drinks are well made and fairly priced.  Don't expect anything with an umbrella, this isn't that type of bar, and I like that about them.\nIt's not flashy, maybe even a little grimy, it's just right for a neighborhood dive bar, exactly where you want to go when you really don't feel the need to get dressed up for a beer.
