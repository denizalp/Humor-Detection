I have to tell you, during the economy condition like today, I try to squeeze every way I can. Shopping at the International Supermarket in comparison to Harris Teeter or Food Lion, I saved almost 50% on my grocerey bill. For example, the Cafe De Monte cost $3.99 a can at International, Harris Teeter $8.99 and Dean and Deluca $9.99. Not to mention other produce and soy sauces. You must come and see the differences.
