I've been here twice. Once while underage and a very nice out-of-towner slipped the bouncer a 20 to let me and my sister and friend in during the NCAA football championship game a few years ago. And another time as a last minute stop for some food, finally of age. And didn't pay cover.\n\nI had fun both times. Yeah it's a little bit of a dive, but it's a fun change of pace.
