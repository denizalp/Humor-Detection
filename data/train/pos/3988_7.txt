If I had kidnapped your first born, the ransom would be  chicken kabobs and fried burritos from Chicken Latino. I would also like 4 bottles of Inca Cola.\nSeriously though, whatever they marinate their kabobs in came directly from the brow of Jesus. I have been known to eat 5 kabobs in a row and then beg my wife for more as I wince through the pain,  unable to move from ingesting far too much chicken.\nThe burritos are also tasty. I am a sucker for deep fried though.
