Well i have yet to try the ones here in LA so i tried it here as i was walking around the mall at Planet Hollywood i just got a pepperoni thin slice which was good. But I'm kinda basis cause i love pizza so i don't get too nit picky only if the taste is really bad i think i've only had a bad pizza once a long time ago from some place that no longer is around lol. Good pizza though.
