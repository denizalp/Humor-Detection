I only went in here because I needed a new cord for my iPhone and having gone through several already, I just needed a cheap one. \n\nThere are no words for how horrible this place is on a Saturday afternoon...I honesty think a funeral would be better.  Every person in here smells bad, looks bad, and behaves badly!  I did not see one person with even a pleasant look on their face.  :(\n\nPerhaps they have cheap prices on crap but I will GLADLY pay twice as much for ANYTHING to never step foot in this place again!   \n\nZero stars!
