Not a fan but it's ok if your pressed for time and need to return to business\/seminar. It will cost ya $19 without alcohol for lunch. The gelato and desserts were awesome. My colleagues enjoyed the carving station. Everything else was meh!\n\nI assume breakfast might be better as those lines to get in were longer long. The staff was awesome, friendly and extremely attentive. I wish I could review them separately def 4.5 stars worthy! \n\nI say give em try and see what your thoughts are. My taste buds might have not been ready for buffet lunch.
