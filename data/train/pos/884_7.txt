What a beautiful place! The rooms are beautiful, and the suites with the patios are so fun, it gives the room a little extra something. I stayed in the suite with a living room and an outside patio which was wonderful. Room service is timely, and the food was great! The casino was crowded, yet not overly crowed! Check in and out was easy. I would completely recommend the hotel, it's lovely and the staff is professional!
