This Mirage and Treasure Island Tram was originally built to transport guests instead of waling in the desert heat back when it was owned by Mirage Resorts and it has mistys to cool patrons off and that was a plus. When you exit the Tram into Treasure Island you are already inside the 2nd level and you take an escalator down to the casino and you have safely made it inside without dealing with homeless people, drunks and hookers. \n\nI gave this Tram 5 stars because it's very reliable and FREE!
