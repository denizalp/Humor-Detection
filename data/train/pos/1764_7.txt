this place is the epitome of vegan junk food! do not go here if you think you're coming here to be on a diet\/ eat healthy food.\n\nalthough there is no animal fat rendered protein a lot of the things are deeeeep fried and carb heavy. that said, the carbs are deeeelicious and they do it right!\n\nthe soy-soft serve is pure joy bliss.
