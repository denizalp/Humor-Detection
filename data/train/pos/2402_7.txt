I  LOVE this salon! REESE took her time to learn what i wanted and also offered suggestions to take my ideas to the next level and make them better! Reese did an AMAZING job on my hair color and she even educated me on how to keep my hair from getting so dry in this climate. I would recommend Reese to anyone who wants a stylist who listens  and delivers !
