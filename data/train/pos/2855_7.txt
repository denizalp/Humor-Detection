Dear Yelp,\nWe went to the shop at 2pm sharp. We scheduled 2 appointments. There was another lady that complained about her appointment while we were there. There were no open seats. We waited 15 minutes, no one came to say \"we're running behind \" or whatever. Not a word. My best friend called Seacret down the street~ and she got us in immediately. \nYelp needs \"zero\" star here. They also took a wax that walked in after us.  Just communication | even if they're running behind. A waterbottle would be nice.\n*Bye Felicia!!
