Garbage furniture! I bought a recliner that started to fall apart after 1 year.  Am I missing something???\nIs furniture now supposed to be replaced yearly like Sneakers?  This Recliner's wooden frame is made from compressed sawdust, not a solid piece of hardwood!  Don't buy any furniture from this place!  All this junk comes from China!
