I'm a regular because of all the problems I have w\/ all of my Apple products, except for my iPad mini (knock on wood).  I am exhausted by hours I've dealt over Apple Support w\/ these issues.  But to top it off, after my recent iPhone update, my phone is totally messed up so engineering has to rebuild my iCloud.  What a mess.  Wish I could speak, specifically to the updating department.
