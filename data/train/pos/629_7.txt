BY FAR THE BEST PHO PLACE IVE BEEN TOO !!! \n\nThis restaurant is extremely CLEAN !!! And very pretty ! \nThe staff is super friendly and understanding ! \n\nToo the chef behind all this madness \"Great Job!\" Hands down the best pho I've EVER HAD!! \nNot only is the food great, the attention to detail in their food (Knife skills) is a plus for me !! \n\nAnd if your not looking to get anything savory ?? They have BOBBA AND THESE YUMMY MACAROON ICE CREAM SANDWICHES!! Yummmm!!
