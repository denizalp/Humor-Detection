Be aware that this Dry Cleaners changes his mind all the time on what he is going to charge. Keep in mind when his prices say for most items that means if there is a large or extra large size you are going to pay more. It does not mean special fabrics. I think all of us expect to pay more for special fabrics. Make sure you know upfront what you will be paying because the claim check you get has no prices. You go to pick up and low and behold you owe way more than you thought.
