Dropped in for a late lunch yesterday and was pleasantly surprised, especially given the negative reviews. Lamb vindaloo was reasonably spicy (not crazy, though) and had great flavour, and the naan bread was perfectly crispy in parts and chewy throughout. Complimentary pappadum and spicy pickled carrots were a cut above the usual free stuff most Indian places put out. Mulligatawny was a little lacklustre but far from terrible.
