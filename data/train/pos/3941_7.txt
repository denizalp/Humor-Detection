Come here often to shop with my mom for my place in Santa Monica. \n\nPlanters cocoa almonds are my favorite. Milano cookies too. I pick up all my vegetables, fruits, dried mango, granola, frozen fish and chicken, almond milk, orange juice, yogurt and snacks from here. \n\nI live alone but still come here to do shopping for my home.
