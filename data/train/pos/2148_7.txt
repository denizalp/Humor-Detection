Decent cappuccino, though nothing to write home about. As a quick and simple breakfast, the baguette with havarti and apricot jam is a generous size and reasonably priced. Though the bread was a tad on the tough side for my taste. I do like the decor and the bar style seating. Bonus points for free wi-fi and friendly service. I'll be interested to try other items on the menus - both food and beverage. Always good to have another coffee option in the neighbourhood.
