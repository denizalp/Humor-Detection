These aren't just any normal ants. These are severe-ants.\n\nThis is a gorgeous building that reminds me of the London Planetarium or a much older version of Madison Square Garden. It's got a lovely dome-shaped roof and is pretty spectacular inside with good acoustics. It's a lovely building at Case Western out in the East Burbs University Heights area of Cleveland, which is probably the most collegey area of town - can you tell from the name?
