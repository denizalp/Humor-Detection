We wanted to try Heritage for lunch. We arrived to a virtually empty restaurant only to be turned away by a host who instructed us ( in an extremely rude tone) that we would need to make a reservation at least 48 hours before arrival or forget about it! Both the servers snd the chef are really losing out due to poor staff judgement. Customer service begins at the front door. Lesson learned! I think we'll just forget about Heritage! PS Rippingtons was fresh, friendly, and delicious!
