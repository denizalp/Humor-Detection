One of the better tasting AYCE for sushi. I have been going to this place for years now. The food quality is consistently exceptional. They have a large selection of variety and is always packed during dinner hours so always reserve during a holiday or weekend if you don't want to wait. The price is a bit on the higher side and also keep in kind they include tips on the bill.
