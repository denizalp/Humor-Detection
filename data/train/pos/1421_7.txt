Great medical practice.  I have thyroid issues and need to see this doctor on a regular basis.  Here is some great items I like:\n1. Calls to confirm apointments a week in advance.\n2. They answer the phone.\n3. They can look up my info and email me.  \n4. Professional group of individuals that work here.\n\n\nI don't know about you, but my past experience is that it is hard to get prescriptions at my regular doctor filled, or someone on the phone.  Glad these guys stepped it up and seem to be on the ball.  Keep up the great work!
