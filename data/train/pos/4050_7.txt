As a transplant to the Valley from Wisconsin, it's nice to find Culver's here. We stopped in for a custard. As I checked in I received an offer for a free one scoop of either vanilla, chocolate or flavor of the day. I chose the flavor of the day which was caramel cashew. My favorite! The customer service at this location is great, the store is clean and I will be back for a taste of Wisconsin every now and again.
