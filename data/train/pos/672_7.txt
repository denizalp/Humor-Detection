Wtf? The hype got to their heads, because the obnoxious service got even more awful.  We made a reservation and were kept cooling our heels for an HOUR.  Hey. This is PITTSBURGH, friend.  It's Pittsburgh. At the end of the day, you're still in a third rate town. Lose the attitude.\n\nThe food was mediocre.\n\nWhat a waste.
