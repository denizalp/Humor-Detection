Just walked away from the concession stand\/ticket counter. I gave a $100 bill to the \"supervisor\" cashier and said I have the .75 cents. I guess I took to longs counting out the money because when I handed her .75 cents she said she couldn't take the coins because she already entered the $100 into the cash register and the cash register told her the exact change. Uhm????
