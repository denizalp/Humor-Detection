While on the cheap side, the variety of food is very above average. I love how quickly items are replaced, the quality of the food, and how clean the place is. \n\nPros:\nCheap\nGood food\nNot crowded\nAway from the strip\n\nCons:\nNoisy\nIn a dark casino \nWeird validation policy\n\nI've only eaten here once and my one complaint is the ribs. They were the chewiest pieces of meat I have ever eaten. My date almost smacked himself in the face attempting to eat one. But, other than that at 24.99 for two folks on a Sunday, I will be back.
