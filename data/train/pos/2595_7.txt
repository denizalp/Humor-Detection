What can I say it's a belly filler kind of dig.  It was pretty crowded.  For $7.99 all you can eat you get what you pay for.  I don't see myself returning.  I just didn't find anything I really liked.  When they first opened they were really good.  Quality has gone down over the years.  Lunch seems like a better deal $5.49 per person.  On a positive note they are pretty fair on drink prices.
