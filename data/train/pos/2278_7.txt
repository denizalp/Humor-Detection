And on the 8th day, god created... the bobbie. That's how awesome it is. Awesome in its taste, awe-inspiring in its simplicity. Awe-inspiring awesomeness. Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo in a sub roll. So good I've had it three days in a row. \n\nMy only complaint is that it takes a while to make their sandwiches, so it's best to call ahead if you can and pick it up. It would also be cool if you could substitute mashed potatoes and gravy for the stuffing.
