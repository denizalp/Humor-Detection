I felt shafted after staying here. When we got there, the door handle from our bathroom broke. Even after they fixed it, it still wasn't sturdy. Their pool area is horrible. What 5 star hotel has a 3 feet pool? The Tao Beach \"Club\" was also a bust. In terms of service, when we called for extra pillows and blankets, our request was answered after ringing the front desk the THIRD time. It was obnoxious.
