I've only ever come on Mondays for their Happy Hour $1 tacos and $3 lime margaritas. I'm not a fan of hard shell tacos, but who's complaining...they're $1\/each! My favourite was definitely the chicken! \n\nFor some reason my lime margaritas tasted like tequila and old feet...? Not that I've ever tasted old feet before. Still got 2 margaritas because hey, they're only $3 right? Oh yeah, when you sit down they also give you free salsa and tortilla chips which is a great bonus!
