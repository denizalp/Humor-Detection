For a routine annual physical, we had to wait an hour after the initial paperwork was done. That when we had already booked our appointment (though ZocDoc.com) & showed up right on time.\nVery irritating experience. \nAlso, the front desk person asked us to fill up the form, even though we had already submitted all our information in ZocDoc registration. We had to tell her this & avoid re-filling patient information.
