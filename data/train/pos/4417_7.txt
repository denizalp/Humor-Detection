... we spent about an hour-twenty here.  So I'm told.\n\nWe INTENDED to catch a cab after lunch at Hofbrauhaus across the street [http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/hofbrauhaus-las-vegas#hrid:LFSpiDUZx54FA6cK7oTi9g], BUT \"hey, let's catch a cab!\" somehow turned into \"hey, let's do shots!\"  So I'm told.\n\n... which turned into 5 rounds of shots.  So I'm told.\n\nBut inside that hour-twenty, the packed restaurant, with its Rock history paraphenalia and memorabilia is entertaining.  Throw in a dozen televisions, blaring music, and impromptu staff\/customer singalongs and a good time is sure to be had.\n___________________________________________\nSingalongs to \"YMCA\" and \"Greased Lightening\" involve table dancing and bootie-shaking.  \n\nSo I'm told.
