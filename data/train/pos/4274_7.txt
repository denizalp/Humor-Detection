I...LOVE.... Vic's!\n\nHaving friends that live in Maple Bluff always means liquor runs at Vics.  It's the only place I know of in the greater Madison area where you can purchase alcohol after 9pm. That's the brilliance of Vics. \n\nI'm not a beer snob, but they carry every kind of beer a simple peasant like me could want; Lagunitas, Karben4, Ballast Point, and they evern carry Crabbie's!\n\nThey also have a great selection of liquor, wine, and munchies. \n\nThe staff were great, joking and helpful.\n\nOh, and they accept cards!
