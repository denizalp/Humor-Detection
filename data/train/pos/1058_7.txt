I love cities that have rail to the airport! It bumps them right up to the top of the list of places I consider for travel. And Cleveland is no exception with a train that take about a half hour or less to get from the airport to downtown.\n\nIt's easy enough to navigate the ticket vending machine and get onto a train. And the return is more than simple with clear directions from the train station to the airport.\n\nThanks, Cleveland. I had a great time and look forward to returning!
