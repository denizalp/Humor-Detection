I've been to Rita's before but never paid attention to the options. I stuck with the plain old custard.\n\nThis time, tried the mix of gelato and custard. What a crazy phenomenal mix! Try it. I was skeptical. Creamy and tart together, mixed???? Not what I'm used to. But yes. It works. It works oh so well.
