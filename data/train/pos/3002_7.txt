If I could have given this place no stars I would have. Everything about my visit was awful from the food, to the service, to the management, even the place was terribly cold and the restrooms filthy! Even the wait staff's shirt was filthy and she continually set her dirty shirted belly on our table! The only redeeming factor about this visit was the Greek salad which was not deplorable....so yay for Greek salad!?!
