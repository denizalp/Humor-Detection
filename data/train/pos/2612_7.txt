Curry curry curry!\n\nI love me some curry. We stopped in one night for a random side adventure. While I love Chinese curry, Indonesian curry, Thai curry, and Japanese curry, I never had Indian curry. I was impressed. We had a wide arrray of items like the Tikka Fries, Chicken Curry, Vada Pap, and Vegetable Fried Rice. Everything had good flavor and spice. I also like the ice cream here. It's a nice cool treat after you set your mouth on fire!\n\nThe wife likes it here so I'm sure we'll be back. I recommend this casual little joint to everyone.
