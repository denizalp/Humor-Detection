I wanted to love this place, and I really don't want to give a mean review but here's what I found. \n\nTables and floors....filthy on a Sunday afternoon. Ick right off the bat.\nOnion rings.....SUPER greasy. I have a tummy ache as I'm writing. \nDogs.....well, I've had better standing on a rainy street corner in NYC.\nPrice.....way high and not a great value for what you get.\n\n A clean restaurant and a smiling face or two would have really gone a long way in softening my review. \n\n(Lebowski's has nothing to worry about with their new neighbor.)
