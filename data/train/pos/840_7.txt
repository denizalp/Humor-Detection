Having seen Mystere, I had very different expectations for The Beatles Love. I wasn't all that impressed but perhaps it is because I cannot share the same passion for The Beatles as others can. I felt it was repetitive and lacking a story line at some points. \n\nThe stage is designed nicely however and there is an optimal view from any and all angles. More dancing than acrobatics, an older crowd and a very slow moving concessions line. \n\nI wouldn't choose to return nor would I recommend this to anyone.
