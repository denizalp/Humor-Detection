Just giving them 3\/5. They can make an effort to keep the place nice and clean. The place is kind of dirty and dingy.   Apart from this, food itself is amazing and pretty affordable.  Their chicken seekh kabab, chicken biryani, Nihari, and naans are outstanding. Very nice environment for families; free of dirty and nude bollywood song videos and award shows.
