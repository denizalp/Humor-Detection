Burgers, fries, and a coke. That's what they serve and they don't mess around. This location was manned by someone who was super receptive for my need to have a burger without a bun and I even heard him directing the staff to make sure they changed their gloves while handling my burger. I tried to banter about touching my buns but he didn't see the humor in my comments. I guess that's for the best.
