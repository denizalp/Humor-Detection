Leave it to me, but I have only really enjoyed an alcoholic beverage here. The Hot Peppermint Patty cocktail tastes just like sex on christmas. \n\nThe food, however, is kind of dull. Nothing stands out to me as particularly enticing. It's average, and there's nothing wrong with that, especially when you have picky eaters in tow, or are in the mood for something basic.
