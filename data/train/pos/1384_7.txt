I can't even.... words aren't enough Bad service, mediocre food but the price $$$$ is the same no matter what kind of experience you have.  I have been going to Mr Chows for over 21 years from LA to NYC and London and  on to Miami and of course Vegas and I have NEVER been so DISAPPOINTED! ...... wow. \nDavid is the worst Captain we have ever had......... Hate this because I used to love this place......
