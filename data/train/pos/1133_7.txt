My wife and I had dinner here on Thursday, April 17, 2014.\n\nThe staff were friendly and accommodating.\n\nWe had the polenta and deviled eggs for appetizers and shared the BLT and croque madame for the main eats.\n\nEverything was spectacular!\n\nNice selection of Arizona beers on the drinks menu and, as always with Tarbell's, a great wine selection!\n\nAnother great restaurant by Mark Tarbell!
