Went to the show last night for a bachelorette party. It's my second time and it was just as good as the first time I saw them! Some of the guys look kinda old but they ALL have hot bods and are great entertainers!! Great music, dancing and an overall interactive performance! It's a male revue so no full stripping but it gets pretty close! I screamed so much I lost my voice :) Highly recommend it for a fun-filled and memorable ladies outing in Vegas!
