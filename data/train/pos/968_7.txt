A new fave place to set up shop, enjoy REALLY good coffee\/espresso drinks, and get some work done with super-fast wifi!\n\nThe pastries have all been tasty and they have a good variety that changes along with the chef that is there each day.  And a special shout-out to the quiche that is ridiculously good.\n\nThe baristas are extremely personable and highly consistent. \n\nWhen the weather cools a little, I look forward to getting some work done outside during the daytime under their covered patio.  \n\nLove it!
