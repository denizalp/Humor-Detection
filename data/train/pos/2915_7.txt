AWFUL cancellation policy.  They just nailed me for their 72 hour cancellation, charging me 3 nights where I won't be there.  This is during CES 2012, so can't even begin to imagine that they really can't find another customer for my room.\n\nIndeed, the fine print of my on-line reservation did show the 72 hour requirement, but come-on, this is completely unreasonable and I did call them at 7 AM of the day I was to check in, giving ample time for them to find another customer.
