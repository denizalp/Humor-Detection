I came here for dinner with a few friends. I ordered a cosmopolitan to start. It wasn't too weak and wasn't too strong. \n\nFor my entree I ordered the G-ma's Mac and added chicken. This Mac and cheese dish was really good. It was nice and cheesy and it was a very big portion. I was only able to get through half of it. \n\nThey have a pretty big menu. We came on a weekday so there was no wait and the customer service was good. I'll definitely come back to try some more items.
