I stayed here for a few days, and I am impressed with the suite that I stayed in.  The room was clean, and it was beautiful.  I liked the decor and the layout of my room.  I enjoyed the super hot tub next to my bed in the master suite, and my stay was comfortable the entire time.  I also used their fitness facilities and it was well maintained, and the equipment was good.  I'd stay here again the next time I am in Las Vegas.
