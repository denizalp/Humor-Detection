Hotel room and property were nice, but felt like we were in a police state every time we came and went. There were motorcycle cops running a speedtrap between 101 and the hotel several times as well as sitting in the parking lot . When we asked the hotel staff about it, they laughed and said \"oh yeah, they're always here\". Definitely detracted from our stay here and I will probably look elsewhere next time.
