This place is ridiculous!! My daughter was pressured to buy $40 in product and I asked them to refund her money. No place does it say they do exchanges only and will not refund your purchase. Typical crappy customer service and given the typical line  well out manager already left and we can't do anything. Maybe you should start \"teaching\" how to handle customer service. \n\nI looked on the receipt and even pointed to their own policy on the counter. Great job Paul Mitchell hustling a young kid. We will not be back. Total BS.
