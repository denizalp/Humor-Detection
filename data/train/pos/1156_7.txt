The couple that owned this restaurant was super nice. Service is super slow. I ordered take-out and it took 30 minutes. When the food finally came out, the girl that bagged up the boxes took even longer! Sometimes you don't need to take your sweet time! \n\nIf you can imagine being on the verge of almost missing a flight and waiting for this food... it was a horrifying experience. The curry was good, the Pad See Ew was okay. Not worth the wait unless you have all the time in the world..
