Very cookie cutter. The food court, with the exception of the filipino kiosk, looks boring and tired. The bakery is sub standard. Parking is your typical nightmare although there's a garage under the center. Only one of the elevators was working which meant a long, long wait. \n\nA decent little mega Chinese dollar type store seemed to be the only place that was interesting.
