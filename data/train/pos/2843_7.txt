Im not a vegetarian so take this review with a grain of salt. I found the place to be a bit dirty and the food to be lackluster.\n\nIt was OK but if you want healthy and veggie I feel like Chop Shop is a much better type of option. This place is trying a bit too hard to be trendy. Hipsters working the counter and overall feeling of dirtiness to the place.\n\nThe Ice Cream is good but it's soy. Do your research on Soy before getting too excited.
