20 minute wait for a half empty restaurant.  Waitress was about as dumb as a post.  (Sorry post.)  Had 3 appetizers: Nachos w\/beef, Quesadillas with chicken and the fried mac and cheese balls.  The balls were the size of a racquetball!  They were served with a fluorescent orange cheese like sauce.  They weren't terrible, but they could have been hotter.  The quesadillas were just gross.  The nachos were okay.  The best thing about this place is that they serve Pepsi and it comes in a huge mason jar.  Avoid.
