I love this place. It screams Uncle Rico right out of Napoleon Dynamite. This is definitely his hangout. First off, they make a mean dirty martini. A real one and good. Second, this atmosphere is just swanky; an electric fireplace, a piano as a table, and of course, there's tigers everywhere! Third, a jukebox with old records, I'm talking Patsy Cline and the Pretenders kind of stuff. Fourth, the clientele is just about anyone you probably work with. Fifth, free popcorn! That old crappy kind from elementary school basketball tournaments, but it's perfect with any drink there.
