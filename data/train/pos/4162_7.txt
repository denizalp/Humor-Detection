Very limited selection of sushi. Every sushi roll contained mayonnaise. Nasty. The presentation of each roll on its own sushi block made no sense for the limited table space. Sushi rolls were also rolled too loosely. While service was generally attentive, we received the wrong sushi roll once (which was quickly corrected) and one of my dining mates got the wrong drink twice. E for effort, I guess.
