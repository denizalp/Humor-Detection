Went to Town Square location.  Food was adequate...drinks only slightly watered down.  Used a Groupon and what a waste...drinks are outrageously priced!  $22 for a double rum and coke..off the strip at a place that does groupons?  Holy wallet pillaging!  NEVER again will I go here....you've been warned.
