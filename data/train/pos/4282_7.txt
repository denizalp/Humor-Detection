New owner doesn't understand how to conduct proper business. Nice guy, however I certainly won't be bringing my business there due to principal. Quoted me a price for my muffler,  however, without informing me, the work went over the allotted time and he charged me. Doubled the price of the verbal estimate (which is binding ). Overall, I held my tongue because he's a new owner,  but certainly won't be going back.
