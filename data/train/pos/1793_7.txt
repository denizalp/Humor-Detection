I love their service! Decided to stop by after swimming at Wet n' Wild. Was suppose to pay $15 but the guy gave me a coupon for a buy 1 one get 1 free deal. Paid $8 for me and my friend who put a ton of toppings ahaha :P\n\n\nFro-yo so delicious!! Mines was gone in less than 10 minutes. It's a must to be here! First time being here and must I say was very impressed.
