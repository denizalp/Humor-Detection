I don't know about this place...\n\nFood looks good, taste good and all..\n\nBut the restaurant itself is sooo outdated and gross. We saw a bum just sitting, walking around, touching everything in the restaurant.. I say this because he smelled so foul!!! I'm sure that's not the first time they've let a homeless person just chill in their restaurant .. Seats are ripped and tapped up, tables are wobbly, EVERYTHING just looks old and dusty ..\n\nThe restaurant needs some serious TLC but their food never disappoints .. Bittersweet feeling.
