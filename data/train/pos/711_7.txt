Why do people wait in hour long lines for a buffet? I guess it's Vegas. We had passes to avoid the wait, and figured why not gorge ourselves a little.\n\nFor a buffet, it was fairly impressive. The sushi alone propels the Bellagio above most Vegas buffets I've heard about. But it is still a buffet. You won't spot George Clooney eating here.
