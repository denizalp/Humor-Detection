First the music was super loud. I couldn't even hear myself shop. I had to yell when talking to the staff. I felt like I was in a club but without the drinks The staff was busy organizing so they could leave right when the mall closed. I had to wave them down so I could look at their watches.  Not very customer friendly. They had a great watch and shoe selection but I couldn't find any clothes that appealed to me. The store was clean though.
