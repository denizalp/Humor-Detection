PISS POOR ASS PHARMACY!!!!\n\nI dropped my daughter's prescription off at 10am, was told 2hrs, come back at 7pm, wait in a line for 30mins to be told only 1 script is available, the other not until next week and my child has strep throat! Ummmmm no this is NOT acceptable I need meds NOW! I took my script and went to CVS! NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN. Always have issues at this sorry ass location!
