This Fedex Office is smaller than most, and is mostly geared for making copies for students (it is near ASU). \n\nIt also gets pretty busy with foreign students shipping off all things Stateside to their foreign friends and relatives, like ASU T-Shirts so their friends and family can look cool and the student can try to prove to his\/her parents that he didn't flunk out and is still enrolled. \n\nPlace is a little cramped, but the staff is knowledgeable and efficient, if not pleasant.
