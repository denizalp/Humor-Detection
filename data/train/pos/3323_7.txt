I had a big lunch and needed something different to satisfy my craving before meeting up with friends for a late dinner. I ordered their tropical cooler smoothie. It was supposed to have a puree of spinach and kale. I'm kind of obsessed with green smoothies. You don't actually taste the spinach and kale. All I tasted was just pineapple. I couldn't taste the coconut and banana. It was still a delicious power-packed smoothie. A great alternative to even skip dinner.
