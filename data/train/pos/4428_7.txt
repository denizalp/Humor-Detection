My girlfriend suggested this place for a midweek work lunch and it was perfect! The sandwiches are giant, delicious and the side options are great. My girlfriend got the \"orange\" flavored cookie for dessert and it was the perfect sweet treat! I ended up saving half of my sandwich for lunch the next day and it was just as tasty. It appears to be family-owned and operated, so the sandwiches take a little bit of time, but totally worth the wait!
