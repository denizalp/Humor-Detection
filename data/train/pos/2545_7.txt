Dazzling Cafe is great for get together especially on a weekday when it is quiet. \n\nSelections of drinks are interesting and they are all photogenic if you are into food photography. Taste wise is so so and overpriced as it is. \n\nWe shared a Strawberry waffles. I found the dough too heavy. The creamy is too thick for my liking. But it is nicely presented and pretty for the photo.\n\nThe cuteness factor might at least worth a visit. I do like the bunny theme, but I am a little bias.
