The Mon Cafe is a great place to start your day! We popped in for breakfast and had delicious croissant sandwiches and a fruit salad. Who knew croissant sandwiches could be so good?? My husband claims it's the best croissant sandwich he's ever tasted. Normally, he's an idiot, but I think he's right about this one.
