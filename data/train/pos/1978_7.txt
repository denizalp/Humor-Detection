They have a huge selection of tequila here. From cold to room temperature, they have it for you, and you can even have them in different flavors. Their tres tacos is a good deal for about $14. Comes with corn chips, two sides of your choice like beans and Spanish rice. You can also mix and match your tres tacos too. They have a fantastic outdoor seating area which at night, it's delightful to be out with your friends, enjoying the nice meal. Service was great, and the staff gave great recommendations.\n\nUntil then, Cheers! ~ :p
