I loved seeing this fountain show! It is definitely a must see along the Vegas strip.\n\nThe show starts about every 15-20 minutes.\n\nMake sure you arrive early so that you have a good view. There are speakers that play music so everyone can hear.\n\nThe great part about it is that there are many street entertainers along this strip. Plenty to see in between shows.
