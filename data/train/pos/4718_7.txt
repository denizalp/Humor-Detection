I thought I learned my lesson the first time I came to Vegas. But I guess old habits die hard.\n\nOnce a drunk whore, always a drunk whore.\n\nI went to Tao plastered.\nI took my time in the bathroom and was confronted by a security guard. \nMind you, by that time I already had maybe 6 swigs of captain morgan. She questions my sobriety and asks me who the president of the United States is. \nWhatever my answer, it was not Barack Obama. \nI was then kicked out.\nWELL DESERVED.\n\nGreat, now vegas thinks im a STUPID drunk whore.
