I have been on a quest to find the best fish n chips in CenPho.  \nI had heard they had a Tuesday fish fry at Maizie's and really love the place, so I had to give it a try.\nFour smallish pieces of fish, a stack of chips (with malt vinegar!!!), homemade tartar sauce and a couple of hush puppies.  Oh, and a side of slaw.\nI think the batter was a little bit much.  Hush puppies were dry.\nFor $13, I had expected more.  It's only $8.25 at Turf and way more fish.
