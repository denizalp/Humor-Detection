Unfortunately, my wife and I did not have a close to satisfying experience. Not only was my pregnant wife's chicken raw, but our waiter was extremely rude. Not to mention he only checked on us once. Lastly, he had the audacity to follow us to our vehicle for an explanation of his tip.  As his manager accompanied him outside after hearing the explanation of the horrible service, He proceeded to brush us off and went back inside the restaurant. I will not return or ever recommend this restaurant to anyone.
