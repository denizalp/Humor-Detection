I came here on the Thanksgiving morning after running a race and I was hungry and cold (running in a cold weather, my lungs were hurting. I was surprised how busy they were.  \n\nI ordered a cup of hot chocolate. It really helped me warm up.  Food was okay, gave me the energy I needed. Standard iHop food.\n\nService was great! Considering how busy they were, our server kept up with great service with nice smile. Food came fast, I ate very quick as I was so hungry, I was on my way with full tummy.
