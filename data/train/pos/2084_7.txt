This was the first male strip club I've been to and I was pretty disappointed. There were about 5 dancers and only one guy was good looking (IMO, see picture). He was also the only good dancer so they definitely saved the best for last. The first dancer from Cali was extremely awkward to watch, he must be new.\n\nI expected it to be much more fun and wild for a bachelorette party but it was pretty chill. There weren't very many people there for a Thursday night either.
