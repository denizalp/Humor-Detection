I'm baffled how this place is staying open , each aisle is in disarray , it's more expensive than Home Goods , Target & TJ Maxx & the layout is a disaster ! Perhaps I'm more accustomed to a more boutique feeling in Paradise Valley ...  I wouldn't recommend this Home store , for a wider selection , better ambiance & better price point I would steer clear .
