This place is overpriced and overrated. My first cut was $25, then $35 then it went to $45. The only reason why I gave this place a two is because Jaime who's an awesome hair stylist use to work there but now he's at Another wild hair on buffalo and Summerlin pkwy now. Otherwise this place isn't that great, unless your favorite hair stylist works there.
