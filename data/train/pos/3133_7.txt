AMAZING!!!!! love love love this place!! I went for my first time yesterday and it was the most wonderful experience! My stylist was the sweetest, such fun and did an amazing job with my hair. The salon is adorable and they pay great attention to the little things. I was offered a glass if wine when I came in, they had snacks out and about a million magazines, which is exactly what I needed coming right from work! Couldn't be happier to have found this place!
