Reminds me of Pei Wei or Noodles style menu, ordering, and service procedure - which is a good thing, because this model fits nicely between cheap fast food and overpriced, overtipped servers at full service places.  Prices aren't bad either.  It fits the niche quite well with reasonable prices, decent clean atmosphere, and above average food (especially the jalapeno cornbread).  Nothing spectacular here though, and I certainly would not go out of my way to eat here as far as the food goes.
