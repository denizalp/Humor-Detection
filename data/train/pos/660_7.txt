I get everyone is a fan but I honestly wasn't impressed. All the Flavors left me wanting more out of them and i couldn't find a flavor I loved. The quality was ok. It was kind of overwhelming with trying so many flavors and the guy helping making me feel like he was rushing me so unfair up and didn't get anything. My husband got a scoop of something that he thought was just ok. I'll stick to Gelatology if I want Gelato Desy knows what she's doing and is a gelato master.
