Just like everyone else says. This place has some of the best tasting burgers and fries. Although the choices aren't vast like the other burger places, whatever you get will be delicious, and inexpensive. I haven't yet tried the secret menu items, but definitely will the next time. I had the cheeseburger and fries combo, which cost about 6 bucks, and it filled me up. Really fast service too. Wish they opened in Hawaii!
