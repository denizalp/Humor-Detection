This Trader Joe's has some pretty narrow aisles which tend to get congested with shoppers and shopping carts. It is also located in another city from me. If any of the Trader Joe's where located less than eleven miles in any direction from me, I would give that store five stars for sure. This store suits my needs for now so I will continue to shop in Henderson. Some of the items I enjoy purchasing are: Extra Virgin Olive Oil with the pour stopper included, French Lavender Soap, Two Buck Chuck (cheap wine) and many of the produce items.
