We took my BFF to the Hunk Mansion last week for her 50th Birthday. We had the time of our life. The dancers were extremely sexy and went above and beyond  to make sure we had the time of our lives. My favorite was Tyson ( I think I'm in Love). Make sure to make a reservation, they will\nPick you up and drop you off from your hotel. You also get two free drinks if you make a reservation. We are already planning on going back in March!
