I wasn't expecting such a great gelato shop being located in such a bummy corner plaza. \n\nOnce we entered, the lady behind the counter showered us with samples on samples of her freshly made gelato. I was sad that there weren't any of the \"crazy\" flavors other yelpers raved about :( I believe the flavors of the day were Birthday Cake and White Chocolate Cookies and Cream, which is also the flavor I ended up with. \n\nI will definitely be back to hopefully try their chocolate covered potato chip flavor!
