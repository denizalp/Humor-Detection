I came because of the high ratings, I stayed because of the low dinner prix fixe menu.  $10.75, after tax, will score you any one of their special menu entrees.  My Hamilton garnered me a small cup of egg flower soup, a sizable deep fried egg roll, 2 crab puffs (which I could partake in, as they are not made from real crab) and a plate of kung pao chicken with fried rice.\n\nThe chicken was sparse, but the taste was ok.  But lets face it, why get Chinese when there's Thai?  Lesson learned
