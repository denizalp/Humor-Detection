Pretentious and rude staff, bad coffee with attractive design in the foam, gross donuts (sitting in open air to rot... in a cute box that matches the place) - all overpriced. \nThe owners are cackling (most likely at a table in Lawrence) as they rake in the gold. The design and branding elements are clever but it's all web styles, urban outfit, distressed, lifted, rip off.
