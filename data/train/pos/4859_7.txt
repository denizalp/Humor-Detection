Two Words: Hot Box\n\nTwo more words: Saag Paneer\n\nFor a mobile kitchen that normally serves hand crafted Reubens and Cubans, they had some incredible specials. Homemade Ramen and Saag Paneer. Talk about branching out and taking risks!!\n\nAnother word: impressive.\n\nThe Paneer had just an ongoing depth of flavors - just an all-around hearty dish with a mild creamy ginger curry base. Kale, onions, cauliflower, potatoes and huge chunks of fresh tasty Paneer cheese. Huge portion for only $8! Great 4 Star dish! Can't wait to try the Ramen next visit!
