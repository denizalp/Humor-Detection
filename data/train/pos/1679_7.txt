This was my favorite burger place in Vegas hands down! The fireball whiskey wings are a must! Trust me you'll love it. You can't go wrong with any burger. The tacos portion were a bit small in my opinion so I would stay away from those... I'm sure they're delicious but they don't come with the fries. Service was great but they didn't get the five stars because getting our food and getting seated took forever. They didn't answer when we tried to make reservations either. But this place is a great spot for a burger!
