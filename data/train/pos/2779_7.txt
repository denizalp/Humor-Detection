Charles is an artist. He always takes his time when working on me. I had juverderm injected in my lips over a year ago and they still look natural. He made sure not to make me look like the typical fake blow-fish lipped girl. Lol. I can't stand that look!\nIf you want someone who takes their time and listens to your needs, Charles is the man. He has never tried to 'up sell' me. Always fair. I recommend him for the many services offered.
