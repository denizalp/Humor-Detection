I'm currently sitting outside this fine establishment as the start of my vacation. I don't think I could've picked a better place to come. I ordered the prime rib benny. Everything about my order was perfection. My server is one of the nicest I've ever encountered. After my meal, she saw me just enjoying my coffee, so she brought me one of the best banana nut muffins I've ever had. This place is awesome.
