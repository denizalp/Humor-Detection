I was a little worried that a restaurant off the Strip would be chaotic, but In-N-Out was a critical stop. Luckily, we were pleasantly surprised, and this spot was quite efficient and handled the crowds well. \n\nNot only was the food spot on - delicious tasting and traditionally priced - but this location was also great for people watching. If you catch my drift. \n\nAnimal style all the way, my friends.
