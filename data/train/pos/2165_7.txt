I haven't had a carb since 2004. The other day I decided I would try something new and have a bowl of spaghetti. I am sooooo glad I chose Defalco's to break the streak.  The pasta was incredibly satisfying and the meatball was the best I've had in recent memory.  I can't wait to go back in 7 years to try one of their sandwiches.
