Pizza with tons of flavor, fresh ingredients, and topping options galore - quick and easy. \n\nThis is one of those make-your-own places with a layout like Subway of Chipotle, but with a much higher degree of quality and service. And the price is so reasonable! They don't charge per topping - get whatever you want for like $8.
