Was here for a Yelp event and had a great time. The food selection was decent; lamb, flat bread, poutine and Ceasar among others. Will I come back yes? Definitely!\n\nThe server was friendly and attentive. Seating is limited so I can see that it can get packed with over 40 people. The ambience is awesome. \n\nStreet parking on Queen Street but remember, don't drink and drive :).
