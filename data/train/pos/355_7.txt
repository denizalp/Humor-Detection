This is my first time at this hotel and it is awesome!\n\nGreat service at the front desk and housekeeping. You can text them what you need and they will bring it up to you. I needed shaving cream so I texted them and the very nice lady in housekeeping brought it to me in s few minutes! Great service!\n\nTheir rooms are very nice and modernized. Cool lighting, nice sofa, nice desk, wet bar and modern furniture.\n\nThe bathroom was also modern. \n\nGreat place, nice amenities, and good service!\n\nI would recommend this Hotel! They are customer focused!
