I can't say enough great things about Eyebrow Envy!  Susan is truley an artist and does such a wonderful job every time i go in!  Not only does she do a great job but she is a sweetheart!! I definitely recommend this place- i moved away from right across the street to Henderson and still make it in to see Susan to get my brows done...she is that good!!  Defintely worth it to go here!
