I visited on Monday, January 2nd around 8pm and was served two very friendly people! They explained the menu clearly and succinctly. I chose to make my own small bowl for take out (sushi rice, salmon, avocado, mangoes, tobiko, ponzu sauce) and I'm pretty happy with it. Avocado costs an extra $1.  The ingredients are fresh and tasty, even though many of them are out of season. \n\nThe shop itself is very clean and bright, but the service is what really shines.
