I am giving this a 3 star review because all I had was a deluxe pizza slice.  It's better than Pizza Pizza, but not as good as Pizza Hut. \n\nThe crust was kind of hard, but it was acceptable and as for the pepperoni itself, it was different. They were small, finely sliced with a good pepperish taste.  Decent pizza place if you are in the neigbourhood.
