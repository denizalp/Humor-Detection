One of the few places on Prince Arthur that doesn't make me want to puke. \n\n$12 (before tax and tip) got me a big bowl of guacamole, 3 tasty tacos and a refreshing glass of horchata (rice milk, cinnamon, etc - try it). The service was fantastic and the food felt authentic. There are also a few tables set up outside if you feel like people watching... or looking at the fountain... whatever you're into. \n\nAll in all, a fantastic experience. Can't wait to try their huevos rancheros!
