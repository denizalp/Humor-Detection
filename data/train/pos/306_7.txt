+1 star for not waiting in line\n+1 star for being a girl and not paying a cover\n+1 star for getting a bracelet for free champagne all night\n+1 star for having enough space to dance my ass off\n\nThings I learned while in Vegas: There are definitely reasons why champagne is offered as the \"unlimited drink.\" You can only drink so much of it. Props to myself for letting an \"old man,\" who I thought was 35, but according to my friends definitely was not, buy me enough drinks to make me think he was 35. Go me.
