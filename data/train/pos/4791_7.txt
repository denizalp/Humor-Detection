We were here in Scottsdale for a bachelorette party weekend and the bridesmaids planned a \"surprise activity\" and we happened to end up at this aerial yoga studio! None of us had tried this before and we were unsure of how it would go. But our instructor, Kassi was awesome and had such positive energy. She explained every step and simplified what initially seemed like really complicated poses. It was challenging yet relaxing (if that makes any sense at all lol). And so much fun! We all left talking about how much we loved it.
