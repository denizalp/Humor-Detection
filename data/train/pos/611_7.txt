$25 for a lollipop?! That lollipop should be dancing and singing in my mouth. The atmosphere in the store is like a nightclub and very loud. But I get it, it's fun and all about the candy. Don't get me wrong, I love me some candy. But for me, though, it's pricey and a bit overrated. \nBut if your thing is looking super hot with bedazzled lollipop in tow, Sugar Factory is the place for you!
