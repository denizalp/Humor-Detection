Dayum. Some people hatin' on this Smith's. Oh well. I had a very different experience. The place is hella large and has everything you are looking for from a standard supermarket plus a nice liquor section, a pharmacy and a small hardware aisle. I picked up everything on my grocery list and more. The only negative about this particular store is the small fruits\/veggies aisle, but the organic aisle attached to it made up for that. Need groceries? Come on over here. \n\nHuge bonus: large selection of Boar's Head meats and cheeses at the deli counter
