I just moved from New York a few months ago and had been living with my cousin in Gilbert. I recently moved into this apartment complex. Pretty sweet. Mark Taylor property with GE appliances. It just opened in January, so it is still really new and clean. Convenient to the 60 and all the Tempe hot spots.\n\nAny single ladies want to come check it out? You know, for Yelp research only, holla atcha boi!
