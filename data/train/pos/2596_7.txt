The food was feh (mussels were kinda tough but rolatini was good) I expected better marinara.  The beers were good. The service was slow. It's sort of like eating at someones house if that house was owned by an Italian grandmother that watched qvc and bought crap all day and wasn't cooking good food and\/or cleaning.  A bit overpriced for the quality of...well, everything.
