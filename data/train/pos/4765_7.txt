We were looking forward to this theater opening as we hoped it would reduce the crowds at Stonecrest.  Not sure if it has,  but the crowd at this theater on comparison was better, i.e. less crowded.  I think it's in part due to the fact that it does not have reserve\/reclining chairs...one can get spoiled by that option. \nStill, the chairs weren't bad and everyone didn't think much about that lack of offering. \nThe theater itself seemed very large and the screen and sound quality were fine.\nOverall great experience.
