They get one star only because I can't give them zero....poor layout, dirty floors and shelves. The deli is scantily stocked, but that's OK because you really don't want to eat the carb-and-fat ladened processed \"food\" they sell here. The manager is a total jerk. Why shop here and have your hard earned bucks sent to cincinnasty (home of Krogers evil empire corporate HQ??). Bashas down Indian School is a far better option.
