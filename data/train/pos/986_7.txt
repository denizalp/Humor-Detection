I cannot believe how disgusting this place is! Great for playing but otherwise this place is just a sad dump. \nI was going to MGM for the night and used the parking here at Hooters. But because I was parking there we went inside to gamble so we were consumers of the property. The charged parking down town is out of control and a huge reason I don't go there anymore. \nIt's dirty here, it smells and I never saw a cocktail waitress. But they might see me again for the parking convince!
