Walls are paper thin. Will never stay here again. You can hear people in hallway and their conversations, and people in the next room. It sounded like a pig was being slaughtered. At 1:30 am. No rest. Rooms very cold like a walk in refrigerator. Thermostat didn't work. Finally turned off fan and a\/c. Still super cold.
