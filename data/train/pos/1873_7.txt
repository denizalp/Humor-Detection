Good solid basic breakfast food with the best omelets, particularly the barnyard (everything in it), on the east side.  Dan the chefs folds them Greek style.  Basic pancakes and french toast but oh so good.  It's a no ambiance diner with a long counter and a few tables.  The charm of the place is the conversation and bs that goes back and forth between the customers, a wide spectrum of individuals of different ages, races, religions, political beliefs and employment backgrounds!  \nThis place is the definition of diversity without any pretensions.  It is priceless!
