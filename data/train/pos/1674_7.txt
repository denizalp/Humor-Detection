This shop supposedly specializes in Subarus, but they don't know a single thing about them. I called about a very common problem in my Subie that I had already diagnosed, and they acted like I was speaking another language. He wanted to diagnose it himself and literally told me no when I asked if he could help me since I already knew what the problem was. This place is a joke.
