I know what to expect when I walk into a CVS. A fast pharmacy, a large makeup selection, and some cold beverages. \n\nThis spot is no different. \n\nI was surprised to find that some hair and makeup products were on lockdown, so you'll need assistance there. It also alerts me, via loud speaker, that the staff knows I am in the cosmetic department. \n\nI don't need to stop here often, but they have what I need when I do. A gallon of water, some eyeliner, and my prescriptions. \n\nEasy peasy.
