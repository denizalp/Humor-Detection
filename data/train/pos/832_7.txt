Met a friend last night for a glass of wine.  Although we didn't eat, I plan to go back soon as the menu looked great.  Service was terrific even though we were just having wine.  My only concern is that the price point for wine is just a little high.  I understand why--but my comfort zone is always closer to 8\/9 for a glass.  Anyway-they did a great job on the interior--still has some of the sportsman's feel and still just as warm and inviting.  looking forward to trying the food.
