You ever meet someone and just know they are important? That's Ryan Pfile a server at the Tatum and 101 Humble Pie. He is the best in the biz. Our pizza was perfectly cooked and the calamari was amazing. But it was the service that truly made us become regulars here. Ryan is humble and sweet. I really love coming here.
