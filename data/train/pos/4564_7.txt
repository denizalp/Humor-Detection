Khoobsurat is located where Tommy Kwan's(my favourite hair salon in High School) used to be. \n\nKhoobsurat, meaning beautiful, is exactly how I feel after I walk out of here having just had my eyebrows threaded by Meenu. She's skilled, very receptive to requests and courteous. \n\nI'm very apprehensive to actually post this review up, because I want to keep coming back here at my convenience. Use it, but don't abuse it. :)
