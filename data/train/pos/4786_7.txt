Sad to say my last visit to my fav sushi place was not as awesome as previous experiences..keep reading. \nMy sis and I have been coming here for over 2 years, she works nearby. She is kinda picky about her fish, so she ordered a roll without tuna and added mango. Now the price of the roll with the regular ingredients is like 10 bucks, no problem there. But she asked for NO Tuna, ADDED Mango and was charged 2 bucks extra...wtf. Yes its only 2 dollars but why? \nThey must need the money...not cool Harumi, not cool.
