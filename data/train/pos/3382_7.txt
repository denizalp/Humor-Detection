Stopped in for a quick bite of something, while on the run, not really knowing what this restaurant was all about.\nWe had good service and a couple of really great nicely cooked well priced burgers.\nDesign your own checkbox menu allows a great deal of personal customization.\nCan't really ask for more that that.\nWould certainly go back when in the neighborhood.
