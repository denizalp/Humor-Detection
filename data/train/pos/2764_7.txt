I wasn't that impressed this visit. I didn't get the same person from last time though. Today the guy that did my nails seemed to be in a hurry. I was done in 40 minutes for a new full set, although they were white tips. Now as I'm looking at my nails, there are lots of small bubbles from the clear topcoat. I wish he wouldn't have rushed.
