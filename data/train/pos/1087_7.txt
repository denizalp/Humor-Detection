Ok, I got in for free because I was going to a private showing of an independent film staring a person I know. This place's bathrooms were FILTHY. I'm talking like, RV park in the middle of the Redwood forest bathrooms. Who am I kidding, the Redwood bathrooms are much cleaner than this. \n\nI've been to second run theaters before, but this one was just very run down and grody. The seats were ok though but the floors were super sticky. Ick!
