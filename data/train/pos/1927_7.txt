Another one of my go to fast food restaurants in Las Vegas. I haven't been to this location for years but it was delicious, especially after a night of booze. Fat burger with cheese and fries, we skipped the shake this time but they are yummy. Staff was friendly. Prices of course are higher since it's on The Strip. Bathroom was surprisingly clean for a Friday night. (lol).
