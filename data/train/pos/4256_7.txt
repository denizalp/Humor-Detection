Doesn't an LCBO at Dundas\/Spadina just scream \"BAD IDEA?\"\n\nAs others mentioned, be wary if you dare enter this location. I've been a few times and I don't think I have had an eventless experience yet. \n\nDrunks....bums.... drunk bums... they all hang out here.\n\nIt's worth the extra effort to walk to either the King\/Spadina LCBO or the Yonge\/Dundas location. \n\nOtherwise - Be Alert. Stay Safe.
