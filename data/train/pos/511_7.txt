I've been here on 3 occasions. All of them have been good experiences, and the only reason I don't come more Is the wait... 30 mins on a slow day and 1hr+ when it's busy.\n\nI have tried most of the meats. I'd recommend brisket and pork ribs for the first time. My favorite sides are the grits and beans.\n\nIf you have extra stomach capacity, definitely grab a pecan pie as well. It's very well done.\n\nThe people are really nice, and they owner's dad even gave us a tour and history of little miss!
