Ordered one social burger at 9:17 pm... it is now 9:47 pm and still no food... there's no one here eating so I really don't understand how it could possibly take this long. Even if this burger turns out to be the best burger I've ever had, it does not make up for the 30+ minute wait... RIDICULOUS.\n\nOk but the ketchup and mayonnaise bottles are cute  and service good so plus one star. \n\nEdit- added a star bc it was really good...
