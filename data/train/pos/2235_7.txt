I've only come here for pedicures. They usually do a great job, and give you your money's worth when you spring a little extra for the callous remover.\n\nThe chairs are pretty comfortable, and have the electronic vibration and massage settings, so lay back and drift off on a sea of comfort.\n\nI'm not a fan of the sea salt scrub, so I can't comment on theirs.\n\nDon't be a cheap-o. Bring cash to tip with.  Heck, bring cash to pay with as well.
