The Peppermill is a guilty pleasure as is the adjoining Fireside lounge. This is a great last stop of the night because it is so over the top, datedly bad, that it transcends into amazing. \n\n You will not crave the food here, but it will not disappoint you either. The portions are HUGE as are the drinks and the scene inside is like Starsky ditched Hutch and went into business with Huggy Bear....in 1987.
