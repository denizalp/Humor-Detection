Me and my friend were staying at the Wynn and wanted to try some buffets around the strip besides eating at the Wynn Buffet. \n\nThis Buffet doesn't have a lot to offer compared to buffet at the Mirage, Caesars, Wynn, Bellagio and Cosmopolitan. It's about the size of a 2nd rate buffet located off the strip but more modern. Food is meh and service is okay. \n\nI wouldn't eat here again and would rather walk a few feet more to the Cravings Buffet at the Mirage or the Fashion Show Mall Food Court.
