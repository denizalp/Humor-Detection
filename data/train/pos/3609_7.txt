The other reviews are right. I walked in on a Saturday night, and only one table was occupied. I can't help but think that this business is a front. \nIt looks like a restaurant that can easily transform to a night club.\nThe food is decent, a bit bland, but passable. I think this place could use some liveliness, but again, something tells me this place wants to go unnoticed.\nFYI: The waitress moves like a ninja. She could be behind you right now!
