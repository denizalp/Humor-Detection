Horrible experience, mainly because of the manager, Meagan Banks. We spoke with her about a misunderstanding, she treated us rudely, talked down to us and didn't assist at all. She made our experience quite awful. I would recommend not visiting this establishment. It was overpriced for being attached to a hotel right off the highway.\n\nAdd: The corporate offices called me about this and Walter was very kind and helpful and apologetic about my experience. I appreciate his kindness and feel better about this company.
