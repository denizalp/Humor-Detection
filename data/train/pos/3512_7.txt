Really good brisket. Everything else was mehhh\n\nThe ribs are much better at Texas BBQ House on Roeser right down the road and 1\/3rd the wait time. The brisket is too for that matter.\n\nThe wait at this place was about an hour and the pricing is fairly high. Their 5 star rating won't be around for too long once the hype dies down.\n\n\n\nIt is still the 2nd best BBQ in town.
