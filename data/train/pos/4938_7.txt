Not feeling this place. Cheaper than most sushi\/poke bowl spots, but you get what you pay for. No complimentary miso soup or iced teas like the other places, and you will be charged extra for toppings that are typically included at their competitors' joints (e.g. Seaweed salad)\n\nAvailable sauces are also \"creamier\" than others which is not my style - perhaps popular but just not my bag.
