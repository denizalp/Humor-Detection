Terrible. I don't get drive-thru food often, and my experiences here reinforce that conscious avoidance. Crispy tacos that are cracked right down the middle the second I unwrap them, fish tacos on tortillas that are torn in multiple places and drowning in mayo? It's like they're not even trying to make the food even remotely edible. The gal at the window was nice but not enough to make me want to stop here again.
