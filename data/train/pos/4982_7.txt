Thank you Schmitt Jewelers and thank you Megan for my ring!  Megan is super nice and personable.  They ship your purchase via FedEX too in case you're not able to go to the store in person.\n\nThe only problem was making a payment through the phone.  Josh was out of town for a training so one of the older ladies was taking my credit card information.  It was a chore.  \n\nHowever, I would recommend Schmitt Jewelers!
