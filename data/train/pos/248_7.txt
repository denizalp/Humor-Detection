Gotta be the most ghetto place to rent a car.  If you are two hours late to pick up they cancel your reservation when its high season so they can rent to someone else for cheaper.  Cars are old and usually always have issues.  They told me I could rent a car today but had to pay 5x my rate because I was two hrs late....puleaze.  First I ever heard of that  The reps there def don't know anything about customer service either.  boooo, the worst.
