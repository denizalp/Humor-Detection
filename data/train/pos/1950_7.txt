I recently just moved to Onnix about a month ago and have enjoyed the complex. The new management has been doing a great job! They have address all my maintenance request in a reasonable time and are always super friendly. \n\nIf you are looking for a decent place near ASU Tempe campus I would recommend Onnix.
