I can't describe the feeling of peace I get each time I enter a Catholic church when there isn't mass going on. It's just what the soul\/body needs. PEACE!\n\nThis church is historical & gorgeous. If you love to take pictures this is the place to do it. The light changes & filters through the stained glass & is just stunning.
