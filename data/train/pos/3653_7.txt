So the only Honeybaked Ham location I know of is in Colma, CA. I think my cousin had a short stint of working there and hated it and I've never heard anyone else talk about it otherwise. When I was visiting my company's home office in North Carolina, Honeybaked catered and I was pleasantly surprised. Visited the actual location and grabbed a sandwich - was made very fresh, workers were cordial and it was free cookie Friday. $7 is a bit pricey for just a sandwich, but the meat is high quality and delicious!
