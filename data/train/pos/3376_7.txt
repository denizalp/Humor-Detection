I'm not a techy but I do have a compooter and when my geek friends (and boyfriend) need computer parts, they go to Canada Computers.  The place is slightly cluttered but if you know what the heck it is you're looking for you will find it with great speed and accuracy and the price point for this place is phenomenally good.  You can also get memory cards for your digital camera at a much much better price than at camera stores.  Grab a geeky friend and go!
