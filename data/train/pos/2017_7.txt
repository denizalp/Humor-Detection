I love RED DOOR SPA.  It is a MUST trip at least 2x a year.  But this time I went to a different location to met up with my cousin.  We both had the milk and sugar body scrub, plus the 60 mins massage.  Love the location (upstairs).  Love the look of the place.  But the only thing missing was the bigger relaxation area and changing area.  Maybe because I am spoiled by the Wigwam location, but I like to lounge around a bit before and after my services.  Or course, the services is always top notch!!!
