I was excited when the shop opened. When I went in and saw the inventory I could have gone to Joannes and gotten better quality for much less money. I could not shop in peace.  The owner introduced herself and it was non-stop talking from then on.  As I was frantically searching for the exit, it continued.  Given the lack of inventory, the cost, and the chatter, I will never go back.
