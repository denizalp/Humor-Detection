It is true that everytime you call it takes anywhere from 5 - 10 minutes to get a question answered but this is majorly outweighed by the success of my procedure.\n\n\"Nervous\" was an understatement, but Dr. Kaplan assured me it was a routine procedure he does often and the entire process was about 10 minutes.\n\nIt actually ended up being about 3 minutes per \"side\" and no complications after. Very smooth procedure that was worth the \"average\" customer service.
