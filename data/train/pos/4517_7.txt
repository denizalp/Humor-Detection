The food ain't bad.  But their predatory towing practices are.\n\nI parked in front of a sign that said customer parking only.  I was a customer, and my car got towed.\n\nThe owners of the business say its not their problem, its the owner of the parking lot.  The owner of the parking lot says its not his problem either.\n\nSo, my $30 meal just got a $120 tax added on to it.
