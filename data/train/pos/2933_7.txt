Saw their ad in local paper and decided to stop by.  They have some nice patio furniture, but reviews suggest they deliver their floor models which I noticed had paint touch ups etc.  Overall their prices seemed high but I must admit they had one model I did like, but hesitant in buying from them based on reviews.
