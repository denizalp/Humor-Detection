This place has been really good so far.  They don't charge an arm and a leg like some places. They do not take credit cards but for the price I'll deal with that.  So far no complaints with their cleaning.  The clothes are nice and pressed and so far no broken buttons.  They are not a \"drop off by 9 get by 5\" so you do have to wait until the next day.  Not a problem since they are right on the way to work.
