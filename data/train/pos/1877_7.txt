O M G. I'm not even pregnant anymore and I crave this every day! \n\nFirst visit I had the \"chocolate fondant\" - so good. Mom had rhubarb, sounds like an odd choice but it was delicious. They take your average flavors and turn them into unique, savory creations. The place is pretty posh, not your average ice cream joint. Fairly priced and you can sample as much as you want before actually ordering. Do yourself a \"flavor\" and try this fast!
