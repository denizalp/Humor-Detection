Almost 9 bux for 2 little cups of ice cream with some crap sprinkled over it.  The girl working was nice but I could two sh*ts if there is dairy in my ice cream or where the friggin toppings are sourced from.  People need to have their heads examined for paying so much for this stuff.  There are people in this world that dont have any food, let alone vegan ice cream.  If ya wana piss away your money just give it to me.  Hell, Ill even put on a thong and shake my ass for ya...
