This is for the This was a very well organized event.   I loved the atmosphere.  Although, it could have had a little more carnival atmosphere to it, in my opinion.\n\nMy favorite cocktail of the night was the St George Spirits company's cocktail in the pickle.  I'm not sure of the name, but that was a great drink.  I did get the recipe... Yea for me.  \n\nVisited the Yelp\/Don Julio Suite.  Great Cocktails there as well.  I loved the Sangrita the best.  I have to try that at other restaurants too.
