As a guy, not to be too shovanistic, I really was weary of popping in and having a bump looked at but either way I felt better after leaving.  \n\nThe procedure was pretty straight forward and the people attending to me had a great bedside manner about them.  I never once felt awkward or embarressed, etc.\n\nThe interior is a typical doctor or dentist style office with comfortable seating and overall calming environment.
