I might be the biggest fan of hole in the wall places with great food in Phoenix, but the service here was so lacking I doubt I'd ever be back. The host threw a huge fit when we requested a small booth for two rather than a table, then I spilled my water allll over the place on accident & the waitress left me soaked for a little then tossed three napkins my way. The sushi itself was worth 4 stars for sure.
