Home warranty company has sent them out multiple times to replace my booster pump. Each time they write down parts numbers, but my booster pump has not been replaced or even repaired. Job is marked in their system as complete. What a joke.\n\nUPDATE: Aaron Pools has called twice within the past 24 hours to ask my husband to make me take down this review. Somehow the person on the phone managed to deliver even worse customer service than the rude technician who came to my house.
