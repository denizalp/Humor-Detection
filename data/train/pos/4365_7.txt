I have been going to Dr. Picot since I first moved to Charlotte over 2 years ago.  I get my teeth cleaned here and he also removed my wisdom teeth.  I always have a good experience.  The folks are very nice and they have TV's attached to the dentist's light, so I can watch ESPN while I get a cleaning.  Nice!\n\nI wouldn't take the previous reviewer seriously (1 review, no profile).  Can you say spell check?  Wow.
