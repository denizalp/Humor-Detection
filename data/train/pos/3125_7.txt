Adi√≥s to the mediocre DB Brasserie... Chef Lorena Garcia has arrived ;)\n\nChica is beyond beautiful on the inside! You can just feel the fiery Latin energy and soulfulness moving throughout the entire restaurant. The menu is creative and sophisticated but not pretentious, and it's full of indulgent and downright delicious offerings from all different Latin American countries.\n\nThank you to Oscar for being a vibrant and wonderful host during our first time at Chica. I'm so thrilled to return to the best Latin restaurant on the Strip over and over again!
