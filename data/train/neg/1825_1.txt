I decided to go to Spin Cafe again last night. After having a great experience the last time. \nLoved it!! Again!! Tried the \"sugar sugar\" waffle. So good. I love cake batter cookie dough ice cream. Love it!!\nService was great.  Very helpful and nice wait staff.  \nThe server offered me a sample of the monthly feature. It was good. But cake batter cookie dough is better. \nCan't wait to try next month feature ice cream. \nI have to check out Thursday nights. I heard from people there that they host \"open mic night\".
