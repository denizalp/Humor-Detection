It's a cramped and noisy place, but everyone was enjoying themselves, the selection of beers is good and the waiter who was serving me was quick and very helpful. I thoroughly enjoyed the Coconut Milk Curry Moules et Frites I ordered -- there could have been a few more mussels in the pot, but that might say more about me than it does about the size of the portion. I'll be back next time I'm in Toronto.
