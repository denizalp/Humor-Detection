If you happen to be waiting for a flight connection in Charlotte NC during the AM hours, do not hesitate to visit this restaurant. Breakfast is freshly made and coffee is really good. I ordered the Morning Tartine for $11.00. Although, my waitress was good an attentive, the overall treatment, from greeting to the end was average; this is so typical in airports.
