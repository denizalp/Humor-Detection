Was in Scottsdale for a couple of Spring Training games and found Anita's place and decided to get a facial, called and made an appointment. The air is so dry!!!!\nAfter sharing past spa experiences with Anita she explained the benefits of combining the facial masque with the deep cleaning. Adding the masque made all the difference because a week later my face felt like I had just walked out of Anita's. I've never been treated so well in a spa and look forward to my next trip to Scottsdale!
