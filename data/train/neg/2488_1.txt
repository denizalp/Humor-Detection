I got a steak, salad and potato as part of the Fitz of Laughter show. The steak was pretty mediocre...not well seasoned but it was tender and cooked rare as I ordered it.\n\nThe salad and potato bar are AWESOME. Fresh bacon bits! I also liked how they had a spring mix of spinach and arugula as well as regular iceberg for the salad bar. They have a good mix of pre-made salad as well.
