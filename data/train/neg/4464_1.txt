Earlier this year I had Stimulus give me a network assessment, they came in and looked at my phone, computer network, and internet systems. They provided me with comprehensive\/detailed reports on each and I could pick and choose the upgrades, system overhauls that I needed in priority order. Stimulus Technologies has great customer service and I was impressed with their work. Highly recommended.
