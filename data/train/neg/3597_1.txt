Food is amazing, service this last time was very disappointing. Waitress obviously forgot my dads beer and when she finally brought it, basically threw it on the table and walked away without saying anything. It wasn't even a busy time of day. Then my 3 year old burned her mouth on her super hot Mac and cheese (not their fault) but after we explained why she had screamed, I watched our waitress share the story with multiple coworkers who laughed and rolled their eyes while glancing over at us. Was very uncomfortable\/frustrating. But dang the food is good
