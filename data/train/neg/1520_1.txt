Standard hotel bar\/grille. If you expect more, you'll be disappointed. I had an interesting \"grilled cheese\", since it included pesto, chicken, tomatoes, etc. but it was pretty good. \n\nWe also had the breakfast buffet the next morning. Again, standard breakfast buffet fare, but it was hot, tasty, and the staff was very attentive. One could certainly do worse!
