A nice, quaint little local place.  The food is very authentic although the menu is quite limited compared to most Indian restaurants I've been to.  Of the dishes we've tried we like the chicken Tikka Massala the best.  The Lamb Curry is pretty good too.  It's not on the menu but the chef made me some Lamb Vindaloo and it was great.  Their Garlic Naan is OK but inconsistent.
