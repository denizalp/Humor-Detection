My family and I just moved here from Hawaii and have been craving meat jun. Luckily we found this place on yelp, and after reading the reviews,we decided to give it a try. The food was delicious!! We ordered the meat jun, hamburger steak and chicken Katsu. Everything tasted great, and the people there were very friendly. We will definitely be back again!!!
