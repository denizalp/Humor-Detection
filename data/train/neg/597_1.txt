So far my favorite Chinese restaurant since moving to Charlotte. The staff is SUPER FRIENDLY and great every time I visit. I usually just get take out but I'm sure it would be the same dining in.  I go with the sesame chicken, rice, and spring roll. The chicken is always cooked well and no super over cooked like a lot of Chinese restaurants offer. It's always been clean and inviting, and the location is easy to find. Prices are great for the quality that you get!
