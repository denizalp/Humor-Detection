First time at Ru San's... so so good! Enjoyed Angry Spider (meh), Cowboy Maki (so good with the mango salsa!), Dancing Eel (orgasm in my mouth), Mad Max (cucumber- licious!), Tootsie (so so good), and candy crush roll with strawberry sauce!!! Amazing service by Pamela aka D!!! Will definitely be back for more innovative sushi!
