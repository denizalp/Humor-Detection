Service is consistently SLOOOOOOOW.   Different staff members every time I've been there (3-4 times now).  \n\nFalafels are delicious, but the service is so dodgy that I think I'm done trying...   Also, my brother had a Chicken Shawarma, and had quite a few tiny little bones in his meal.  Very nervewracking, since you don't expect to have to watch out for bones in shawarma.\n\nWould be a nice option for fast food in the area if you could rely on it, especially with it's proximity to the movie theatre.  But you just can't rely on it.
