Walked in the day before Christmas Eve. First time here so didn't know they would be so busy. Waited for only 15 min or so which was not too bad. Mimi cut my hair and she did a great job. She understood exactly what I wanted and cut my hair in about 20-25 min. \nPrice was very reasonable. The place is clean and tidy. It's not one of those fancy salons but I don't care as long as the haircut is good. \nI would definitely come back and next time I will make an appointment in advance.
