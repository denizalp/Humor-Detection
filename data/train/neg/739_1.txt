The IKEA of downtown Toronto! It's so nice and it has so much class. However when it first open, the stock were flying off the shelves and they couldn't keep anything in stock. It's nice to see but they don't always have enough to keep up with the demand! \n\nI definitely think the highlight is personalizing stationary with their stamp collection!
