We wanted to take a moment to write about our excellent experience with Toronto Flower Company.  We got married last week and ordered a bridal bouquet, two corsages and three boutonni√®res. All I can say is WOW! The quality was absolutely stunning and our delivery arrived right on time. \nNala was lovely to work with and the flowers looked just beautiful in our pictures. If you want excellent qualIty for a very reasonable price check out this company!
