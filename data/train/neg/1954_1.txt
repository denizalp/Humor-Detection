Super thanks to Mike Ayala who actually helped me a ton to follow up and send me a lost receipt. \nGreat customer service, much appreciated.\n\nFresh burger and pretty good biscuit, the tater tots were really good and their live coconut was an unexpected treat. They handheld the lunch rush very well.
