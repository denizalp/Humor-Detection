This is strictly for the shaved ice.  I really enjoyed it, it came with plenty of fruits and red bean.  The ice was finely shaved, unlike some places I've tried.  The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars now instead of 4 is because something was wrong and their ice cream wasn't available.  Usually I love having a scoop of green tea ice cream on top of my shaved ice.  \n\nAlso I love the decor of the place.  It's very cute and cozy!  Good place to go and enjoy coffee and dessert with your friends.
