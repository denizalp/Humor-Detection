After My visit to the Medina Lanes on 6\/14\/2012 I hope to see them improved The staff never pays attention to the customers all they do is stand around in the office and not worry about who comes in to Bowl\/ Play pool or even use the bathroom when its not busy. Staff members were on their cell phones, and talking to other employees.\n\n  Oh Wait the bathrooms in the bar area were so discussing that it never got clean once since the bowling alley open. Oh and by the way you had no privacy what so ever.
