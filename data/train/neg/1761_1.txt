I came across S&L Dental while browsing reviews on Yelp. The excellent reviews and 5 star rating persuaded me to give them a call and I'm so glad I did! The staff was exceptionally friendly and attentive. Dr. Ngo greeted me by name when I arrived to the office for my teeth whitening appointment. After going into the room, he explained the procedure in detail and answered all my questions. The whitening itself went smoothly and I absolutely love the results! I will definitely be back for more!
