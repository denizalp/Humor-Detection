I had the windy city fries and steak tacos.  It is plenty of food thats for sure but the food was not seasoned and that was a huge issue for me.....you will be surprised with how far just a little salt and pepper will take a dish..... Im pretty sure I will not revisit this place when I return to Vegas.
