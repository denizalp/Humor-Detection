On May 18th my wife and I entered the store around 10am. The male employee was cleaning the door glass as we walked in. We walked by not being greeted at all. We staying in the store about 5 minutes while the employee was doing something at the check out counter. He never looked up, acknowledged our existence or said one word to us. We walked out and vowed never to return. That is very poor customer service in my opinion. If you want terrible customer service check out this place.
