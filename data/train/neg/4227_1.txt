They served us rotten soup ( their moroccon soup on menu) with rotten celery and potatoes which was sour as if it was a month old. The servers said the soup was from a frozen bag that they defrost and the owner thinks that the chef may have mixed old soup with new.\n\nIn either way never going back there. When heard my complaint, they were more concerned about the reviews although they offered a coupon for future vs returning my money which is inappropriate. This ruined my lunch with my daughter today :(
