One of the best lunch locations I've yet experienced in Toronto. The presentation of the wrap+soup combo is artsy and utilitarian; the soups are unique and full of umami; the wraps sometimes have a bit too many spices in them, but always end up satisfying you. The interior is beautiful: there's a large driftwood table in the center of the main room, and toward the back there is a lovely outdoor area. The staff is friendly and graciously allowed me to interview several people there over a few days.\n\n5\/5. Would bang.
