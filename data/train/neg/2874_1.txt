So there is a real lack of breakfast places near parliament and dundas.  It is a very sketchy area, so you really don't expect much, but this place is a hidden gem.  Clean, friendly service and good cheap breakfasts.  I get the usual, eggs scrambled, sausage, fried potatoes, toast and a juice and it isn't even close to ten bucks.  Good basic diner style breakfast served up lightning fast.
