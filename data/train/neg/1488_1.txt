2nd time coming here. Both times I've gotten a full set here (normally just get gel manis at my regular nail place) with pink\/white ombr√©. Phillip was really nice and patient, and was able to survive all my pickiness and gave me what I wanted and worked on my nails until after closing. He didn't rush or half ass the job like most people would do so I appreciate it very much. I would've gotten a little shorter tbh (because of my profession) other than that I'm happy with my experience here.
