This place is fantastic!  We ate here during our family's vacation and all four of us loved the dishes we ordered.  I had the Knights in White Satin and it was great. It got better with each bite.  My husband ordered the Buffalo Soldier and really loved it. The heat is just right and the bleu cheese flavor perfectly complimented the dish. My sons ordered the specials and devoured it. The atmosphere and decor is pretty awesome too.  We will definitely come back again when we visit Vegas!
