I always enjoy my experience at Snapdragon! It's peaceful and modern and elegant. I most recently saw Kyle for a cut. He styled my hair for my husband's birthday dinner and it looked great! Underneath my long hair he gave me an undercut that I'm loving during the hot weather. Going in again soon for color and look forward to something new. Highly recommend Kyle and Snapdragon!
