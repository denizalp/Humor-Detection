My brother has been going here for years and convinced me to check it out. I wish I would have listened sooner. I'm very impressed with my new haircut. They are priced right and the service is great. Ruben is the barber that cut my hair and I highly recommend him. He has black hair, glasses, and a Russian accent. Thank you for a great experience Ruben. You're my new hair guy!
