Honestly, I've been coming here for the past couple of weeks with my friends and it is by far the worst service I have ever received in all my life. They never bring the portions you ask for. Rude, unfriendly and act like they don't see you. Seated a table of 6 at one grill they seated other parties of 6 at 3 grills. They discriminate against certain races, very unpleasant and rude. Can't believe they're still in business.  Made a yelp account just to warn people of this place.
