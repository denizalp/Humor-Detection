Great little neighborhood gem. A real mom and pop restaurant. Everything is homemade and tastes great. The wife had eggplant parmigiana and I had the mussels. Both great. Had the fresh cheesecake. I'm not a real fan of cheesecake but this was really good. They have $5 corking fee which I'm sure we'll be using in the future.
