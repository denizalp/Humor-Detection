The breakfast was typical of a common breakfast chain. It was nothing special. The coffee in my opinion was horrible and they need to get new cups or a better dishwasher because all of the inside of our cups were horribly tarnished looking. Maybe get your coffee elsewhere before you come. The service was ok. I think there are lots of better options for breakfast.\nI'm giving this 2 stars, as there's tons of room for improvement.
