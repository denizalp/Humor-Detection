We were almost to the point of having to replace our carpet because of a few large stains that other carpet cleaners were not able to get out. When I came home after they had cleaned I was shocked to find they were able to get out ALL of the stains and the carpet looks brand new! I was really impressed with their work and would recommend without any hesitation.
