This place is a train wreck!  The lines they have you stand in are a joke.  Wait in one line, then another, then another and even another.  No structure.  I have eaten here a few times and the food is ok if you are fortunate enough to eat while its hot.  I wont come back now because the last time I was there, they were out of chicken at 6pm on a Sunday.  Waited in line for no reason.  Very disappointed.
