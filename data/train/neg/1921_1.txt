Went here with my Mom. She had tabouli  and hummus. I had the mixed kebab plate with rice and lentil soup. We were both very impressed with the taste of the food. Each meat was seasoned perfectly  and not with the same seasoning it seems. The hummus  was so creamy. Those were the stars for us but all dishes were great and the service was super fast. I recommend a dinner here. We are already planning our next order!
