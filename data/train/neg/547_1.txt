Went there for weekend brunch. \nGot the traditional breakfast with bacon and side salad.  The side salad was pretty bland,  but everything else on the plate was good. \nI also ordered a banana pancake which tasted sooo good.  It was light, fluffy and not too sweet.  The syrup had a really nice banana flavour to it.  \n\nNext time,  I may just order a full plate of the banana pancakes.
