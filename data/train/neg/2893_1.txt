Being from out of town I had no idea what to expect. Big screens, loud speakers, comfortable temperatures! The ticket price was fair ($10) and the seats are decent. The quality of the seats are excellent - but they sit you upright a little more than I would prefer. Best of all this place was clean. A nice theater.
