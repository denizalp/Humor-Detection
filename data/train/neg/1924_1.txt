If you want to be HEAVILY scrutinized and judged the minute you walk into the leasing office door, THIS is the place for you!!  I was told they had several 2 bedroom apts available on Sunday and Monday, when showing up to see them, I was told they had 'nothing' available!  This was after I was given a long look from head to toe and then a quick glance to her fellow worker. \nI'm also told that they do NOT make service calls in a timely manner and that their sales staff is rude and 'prejudiced'. Renter BEWARE!!
