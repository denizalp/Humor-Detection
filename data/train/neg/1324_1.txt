It's a beautiful hotel and yes, there are gondolas. And YES, they have arguably the best steakhouse in Las Vegas in Carnevino and one of my favorite all time restaurants Bouchon but damn does their casino floor suck the money right out of your wallet with the speed of a turbo charged vacuum cleaner. I've never, ever lost money so fast in any hotel casino floor. Ever. Ever. Ever. \n\nWalk around, eat, drink but run as fast as you can through the casino floor.
