Very snotty service at the gun department. Why make us pick a number and wait if ur gona ask people if they need help out of order?! and if ur gona buy a gun here dont bother way over priced found a local gun shop 150$ cheaper at wild west guns in las vegas, plus bass pro shop does not price match. Snotty attitude Male worker hope no one runs into him.
