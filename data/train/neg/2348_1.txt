Stayed at the LINQ and had two terrible experiences at this so called restaurant if you don't mind ridiculously loud obnoxious people and waiters and bartenders who completely ignore you then serve you overpriced food such as the ribs which were half fat while NONE of the online entrees were available then this is the place for you.   \n\nInstead of drunken fish tacos you get for 15 bucks three teeny literally single bite sized appetizers. this place is a joke. stay away, save your money go somewhere else.
