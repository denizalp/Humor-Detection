I really loved my visit here and sooo glad that my first visit here was to try the Sunday brunch with an all-you-can-eat cooked-to-order menu.  This was fantastic and so much fun.  We sat on the patio with the heating lamps (it was December), and it was a nice view of the swimming pool area.  We ordered one of most things (got full before getting through whole menu) and split each mini dish.  One of the most unique brunches I've ever experienced.  I would highly recommend it!
