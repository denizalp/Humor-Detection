I cant say enough about this shop\nHave a 6.0 ford that I'm too stupid to walk away from because I'm emotionally attached to it.\nBut i gotta tell you john and his guys have made my truck like new again. Even took my wife's Chrysler to him for some work. The best part is he is always extremely fair with me on pricing. I wont ever go to another shop as long as he's in business.
