Super Great Local spot next to the Phoenix convention center with FAB happy hour prices on drinks $5 HUGE burgers and 50cent wings with your choice of sauces. Each day of the week has a different special so keep your eyes open if your nearby. The staff was fun and charismatic. They also offer a great home cooked breakfast starting at 6:30AM that doesnt break the bank. I couldn't of wished for a better place to set up camp while I was in town.
