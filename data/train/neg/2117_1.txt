I was super exited to check this place out but the food was a little on the underwhelming side. I had the veggie lasagna and it was just ok. My friends ordered the pizza and I tried the margarita pizza and once again that was just ok. What I can say was amazing was their homemade mozzarella with local tomato and basil. Anyway, aside from the good the service was great and our host was super attentive. I'm a sucker for great customer service but I just wished the food lived up to my expectations.
