The bar\/patio outside is great for sunny summer days\/warm summer nights and the beer sampler is a great way to try their brews as long as you have someone to share them with as it's a lot to drink! I tried the beer cheese soup and was not impressed, I would not recommend ordering this, but I would highly recommend the Asian Nachos. Once again I will have to say that the burgers are delicious and definitely something everyone should try!
