Veronica is awesome!  I was getting married and saw Veronica to get my manicure and pedicure.  She was very responsive when I was scheduling my appointment and gave great recommendations!  She has a really great personality and I enjoyed her service.  The manicure and pedicure were perfect and you could tell she pays very close attention to detail.  My bridesmaid also got a wash and style by Veronica for my rehearsal and her hair looked awesome!  Veronica created a really nice half-up half-down style for her that would have even been great on wedding day.  I highly recommend Veronica!
