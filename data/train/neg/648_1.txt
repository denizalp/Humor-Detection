I could eat the garlic chips all day. Their .50 beer is great deal. Their pizza is good also. Would give it 4 stars but the host few months back was very rude and condescending. She's young so I'll try to not take it too personally but humbleness and humility will go a long way. Just few days ago, the waitress brought out the wrong order too. I like this place enough to go back but with better service, I think this place has a lot of potential.
