This was probably the best burger me and my father have had! Came here today (Tuesday) for the first time. Had the cheese wineburger lunch special for $6.50 and it was DELICIOUS. Also had a vodka tonic, and dad had shock top on draft which he really enjoyed. Nice father daughter lunch with beverages! Bartenders were very sweet as well. We will definitely be back! Thank you for a great lunch and drinks too.
