Rise & Shine is by far the best breakfast in Henderson! Maria our waitress was phenomenal; super friendly and kind. She recommended the Chilaquiles and it did not disappoint! Paired with Jen's Chalada and you have the makings of an All-Star breakfast! My family and I have found our new favorite spot! Cheers!
