Used Safelite as recommended by USAA for a windshield replacement on one car an chip repair on another.  They came out, emailed me in advance with name of technician, showed up on time and did great work!  \nI have had 2 windshield replaced an one chip repair now and tehy always gave excellent service !\nR
