I had been here in November with a girlfriend of mine. The service was very welcoming at the beginning. But I kept feeling pressured by our waiter to buy wine as well as dessert. \n\nThe oysters were tasty but not shucked properly. My fish plate which was the fish of the day was too buttery. And our dessert was hard. My friends ordered the halibut and that was very good. I hate the fact that the menu is written all over the walls (including wine) difficult to read since it is very dim.
