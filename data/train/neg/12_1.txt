The meal is decent. We ordered a chicken souvlaki and the chicken was freshly grilled and the potatoes was in good portion. \nThe greek salad that came with it was a little disappointing. They didn't even use greek dressing on it. I think it was just italian or something. Not that great, I used some of the tzatziki sauce as dressing. \n\nPrice is maybe double compared to a Mr.Greek on a food court somewhere.
