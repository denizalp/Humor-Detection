Surprised. I've heard so much about these places and I was really confused... I thought at first, \"maybe I'm in the wrong place?\". The service was just ok, and the burger was sub-par. They had a relish bar with different types of pickled enmities such as pickled peppers, pickled tomatoes, your standard fare pickles, etc. Interesting idea but seemed lazy in the presentation\/execution. After it all, It still really didn't add much flavor to the boring burger. Will not be going back.
