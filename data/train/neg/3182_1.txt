I've been to many places to have eyelash extensions and Charisse and Hanna at Crystal Beauty are truly the best! Charisse is my main girl. She is fast, efficient, professional and a sweetheart!! I've been going to her for at least six months,  I have the package deal I pay once a month and go once a week and my lashes look amazing each time.  I'm also having my nails done by Trish, who is also amazing! Fast and friendly service and it's the best experience I've had in Vegas!
