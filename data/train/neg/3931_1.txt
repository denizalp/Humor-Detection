Located inside the Eaton Centre, this Shopper's Drug Mart happens to be one the busiest, and most importantly best operated stores in the GTA area.  Wide store layout, well stocked shelves, and quick cashiers make this one of my favorite Shoppers location. Although I don't shop at this location too often simply due to distance from my home, I always check it out whenever I am at the mall.
