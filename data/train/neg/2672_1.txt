We're fairly new residents of Vegas from the northeast and have been looking for good Indian. We went earlier on a Sat night and the service was extremely attentive. Waiter answered all of our questions and the food came out quickly and was hot. We shared Dal Bukhara and chicken Makhani. The Makhani was a little sweet for me but the Dal was delicious. Yes, you do pay for rice and bread but in Vegas, where it seems good Indian food is scarce, it's worth it for us. We'll be back.
