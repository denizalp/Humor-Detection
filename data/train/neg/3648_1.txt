I love this place.\nIt is the really only true vegetarian restaurant in the area.\n\nNO booze.\n\nThey have tea, water and coffee.\n\nThe ambiance is amazing, being in a thrift store and all. \n\nThe food? Freaking delicious. Seriously.\n\nI want to eat here all the time and I would if it wouldn't be so creepy.
