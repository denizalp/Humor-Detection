Stopped in for gel polish today. Lin did a great job! \nGlad to find a nail salon close to home!\n\nUPDATE: first visit great, 2nd visit good, 3rd visit not so good. The gal seemed hurried. Used nail clippers to scrape off gel polish instead of letting nails soak longer. Left traces of previous color. Three days later, gel polish already chipped on two fingers. I have been sick therefore, haven't returned to see if they would correct the issues.
