I made a reservation an evening before, but when I came they claimed they didn't receive the reservation, so I showed them the call history but they still denied. The attitude of the servant was very arrogant, being very irresponsibly saying it's not his personal fault, and didn't positively seek for a solution for us.\nThe worst experience I've ever get on squirrel hill. We designed this to be a birthday dinner but it was all ruined.
