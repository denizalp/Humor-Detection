NOTE: This place has new management now!!\nJust had an unhappy experience tonight:\nWaiter delivered the wrong fish dish to our table (there was a fish dish in the combo that we ordered) and we had a bite.\nWaiter came by, didn't take it back, and then at check out, an extra $20 was added to the bill for the fish that I didn't order... we were not informed that it was $20 at all and didn't agree to it!\nFood portion was small for an $82 combo ... would not recommend.
