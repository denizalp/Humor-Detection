I made reservations through yelp for our anniversary, notating the special occasion. I was disappointed that the restaurant this not acknowledge the special night for us. Food was ok. I though the artisan board was very small for the price. Bruschetta was tasty, but not nearly as good as The Living Room or  Postinos. Service was very good.
