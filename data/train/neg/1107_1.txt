It was clean, looked fancy and had good service. There was no wait time when I went there which is normal for a weekday but there was also a decent crowd inside. \n\nWhen it came to food, it could have been better though. I have definitely been to better steakhouses south of the border. Still the food was cooked to order, I ordered medium 10oz tenderloin and it was exactly medium cooked. However, lacked the taste I was looking for from a tenderloin. If they work on the sauce and the seasoning they can be a 5 star place.
