The best hotel in Vegas in my opinion.. We had my bachelorette party here last august and stayed in the Bella Suite. 2 queens beds plus a pull out couch w\/sunken living room. The room was beautiful as was the entire hotel. Customer service was great too - my sister picked up something from the minibar then put it back and we got charged for it. I explained the situation to the front desk and they removed the charge without hassle. Would love to stay in this hotel everything if I could!
