Quality service at a nice location!  The staff here are super friendly and treat you like they genuinely appreciate your business.  I was impressed with the inside of the shop - by far the cleanest, most organized dry cleaner shop I have ever been in.  Had a comforter and a fuzzy throw cleaned here, and both came out beautifully and in a reasonable timeline. They even insisted on carrying my items to my car for me!  Will definitely return.
