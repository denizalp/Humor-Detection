I love this place so hard. \n\nV1 order the V1 why are you still reading this?!? you're mad!\n\nseriously though, V1. get it. \n\nApparently they have the best pho in the state too. I don't like pho in general but I have gone to this place with at least 20 different people. All leave phofilled, both physically and mentally. \n\nThey are unbelievably consistent and never disappoint.
