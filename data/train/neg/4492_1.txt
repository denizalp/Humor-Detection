The food is good. We come here for the pho because it's close by. The restaurant is small and there aren't many tables so I wouldn't go there hungry on a crowded day without reservations. Call to go orders in an hour before planning to pick it up. Waiting area to be seated is small and kind of awkward, I hope they get a bigger facility to accommodate for how popular they seem to be.
