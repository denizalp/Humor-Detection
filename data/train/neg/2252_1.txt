Dr Espinosa has been our primary car physician for 30 yrs. He is caring and has helped my wife and I through many medical issues. He knows his stuff and always takes time to talk to us and never makes us feel rushed. This office isn't a walk in clinic but we haven't had a problem getting an appointment. Hey also have lab services at this location which is very convenient.
