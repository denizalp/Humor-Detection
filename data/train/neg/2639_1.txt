I wish I'd read the reviews before I opened an account here. They don't have a real ATM outside so you have to go in, the A\/C is never running inside and the line is invariably long, the website and app aren't user friendly and the fees are really high. I quit Bank of America because of the shady fees and I thought I was doing something good by frequenting a credit union. Jokes on me! Same shady fees, different bank.
