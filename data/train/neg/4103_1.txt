Internet not free, missing tiles in shower. 2 stars because decent place and nice people but comparing to other place not having an internet is just bad. Yes I know there's a subscription fee but competition is just free. Balcony view is nice but the big cracks just doesn't give you the sense of safety out in the balcony.
