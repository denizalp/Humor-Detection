I have come to this bakery for two custom cakes and have been blown away both times! I sent them a picture of a cake I needed for my best friends baby shower and they replicated it perfectly if not better! The staff here always gets back to my emails promptly and makes it super easy to order!.....maybe a little too easy? :)\n\nAn extra special mention to Ashley who is always super helpful. The staff will make great recommendations if you are stuck and need an expert opinion.
