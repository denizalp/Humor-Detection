I choose to go to the Middleton location because their staff in the McKee Madison location is terrible. They mixed my order not once or twice but THREE times ( all in one night) and once I finally got my food it was cold. I get it, ok, it happens or it could be simply just a bad night? I'm not sure but The employees were unapologetic and the delivery driver treated me like I was the problem.
