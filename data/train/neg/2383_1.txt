Awesome customer service by Edwin. He was friendly, professional and knowledgable. I had a dead battery in my ford F150, again. Not only did he test the battery for me, he installed the new one.\nHe also checked the system and found that I still had some warranty left on my old battery and saved me 40 bucks.\n\nEveryone I've met at this location is friendly and knowledgable, but today Edwin went above and beyond. Employees like this are what keep me coming back
