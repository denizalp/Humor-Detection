When I go to Taco Bell at this location, I get nothing but a positive experience. The management is superb, the staff is gracious and friendly, and the food is always consistant and decent. Lucio the manager has done an incredible job at the staffing and the promptness of the food being done and right. Rarely have I heard or seen a customer unsatisfied there. They know how to do Fast food. Great job TB,
