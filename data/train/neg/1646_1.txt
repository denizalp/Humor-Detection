The food is good and service is friendly.  But something must be inefficient in their kitchen processes, because it took almost half an hour for our food to arrive. Had the Spanish hash and the fork scram. Would come back again to try their pancakes but plan to budget at least 2 hours from when you first arrive, because you won't get a seat right away. From the time we put down our names and number until we were texted that a table opened up, almost a full hour had lapsed.
