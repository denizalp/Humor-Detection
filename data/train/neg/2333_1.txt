I went in for laser hair removal with Stephanie Shields. I had my under arms done. Because it was my first time having laser hair removal I was a little nervous and didn't know what to expect. Stephanie was great! She explained everything and answered all of my questions. The actual hair removal was not painful and I am very satisfied with the results. \n\nEveryone at the spa is very friendly and it's a comfortable environment. I definitely will return and I'll be back soon.
