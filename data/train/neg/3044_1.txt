What happened? Your burgers use to be the best around. We tried your new Angus Beef burgers which were dry, overcooked and tasteless. It was like you squeezed all the juice and flavour out of the burgers. Fries were overcooked and dry as well. I know good fries are double-fried but these were more than triple-fried. Your service is always friendly but food very disappointing this time.
