Great little local greasy spoon! Cheap prices, good food, and GIANT I mean GIANT pancakes! Friendly servers and the the couple that own it are super nice. Usually not a fan of diner coffee, but there's is pretty decent. Nice selection of sodas and juices. Wish they were open later than 2p every day!
