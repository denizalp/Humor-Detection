Service was meh - now mind you, it was during the Phoenix Film Festival, but the Festival is 2 weeks, so management could have staffed better.\n\nAlso, the Food was bland and texture was off.  I always clean my plate.  Not this time.  Might be back, to try again, but with all the options nearby prob not.\n\nThe restaurant was clean, and the layout was good.
