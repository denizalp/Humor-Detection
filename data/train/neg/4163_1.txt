Its a cool bar to hang out and have a drink or two. The food options are very limited but the food was good nonetheless. I tried one of their beers which they brew in-house, and the corpse reviver cocktail, neither was great but they were Ok I guess. For food both the beef sliders and charred broccolini were good.
