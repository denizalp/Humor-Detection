Noticed this place had just opened up near my house so I thought I would give it a try. All I can say is the food is           PHO-REAKING awesome!! Started with the spring rolls and they came with a peanut sauce that was perfect! Then I had 3 item pho with the meatballs, flank and rare steak which was perfectly seasoned and very tasty. This will definitely be my number one spot for pho from now on!
