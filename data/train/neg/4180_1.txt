This place is a Cleveland gem.  I have been countless times and love trying different combinations of hot dogs, which area always delicious.  It can get crowded so search for a good barstool and don't move :)  Great beer list!  Love playing the pinball machines and the arcade games in the basement.  They started serving tator tots before everyone decided it was cool again.
