Don't stop at the Double Double order the fries animal style too! On a busy weekend don't be afraid to be dropped off by a cab you are not the only one with the same idea, it's almost like a cab line out front.  There is additional outdoor seating at the In-N-Out store next door.  If you are a party of two please share your table if it's crowded but no one expects you to share a booth.
