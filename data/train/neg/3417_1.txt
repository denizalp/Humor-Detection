Food is all right, employees not so much. An employee by the name of Christina was swearing and I'm almost entirely sure it's because she's having a bad day. But I don't think it that kind of language should openly be used when it's obvious that there are customers within earshot. While I do realize that it's just the way some people talk, it does not set forth a professional environment.
