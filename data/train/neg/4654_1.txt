We went for a quick lunch while I was on my lunch break. Two of us ate like kings for like $20 with their amazing Lunch Specials. I got the Peanut Chicken and my friend got one of the Beef dishes. Plating and presentation were excellent on top of that, making us feel like we really got our money's worth. Also, the soup of the day was AMAZING! It was like a Chicken Mushroom Coconut soup. Highly recommend, would go back any day.
