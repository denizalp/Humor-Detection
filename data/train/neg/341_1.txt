I've been taking my dog to this hospital for 7 years and not once have I had any problems. They truly love animals and are knowledgeable, qualified, and honest! Which is just so nice to find nowadays.  My dog has all kinds of problems and they always cured her and treat her well. Once when they were not able to help her with some knee problems they referred me to an excellent specialist who fixed her.  I love this hospital. I feel in peace my dog is well taken care of.
