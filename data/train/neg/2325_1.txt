This location was super busy, although I'm sure they all are! This was my first In-N-Out Burger experience and I really enjoyed it. We waited about 20\/30 minutes for our food but there were no seats inside. We tried to sit outside but there was no shade and the seats were too hot from the sun. I recommend trying to find a table when you first get in. We ended up just walking around with our food, but it was still good!
