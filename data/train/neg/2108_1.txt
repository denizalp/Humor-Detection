I had been here once before and tried the CF steak w\/eggs, it was very good but nothing I got too excited about. This weekend we went again and I decided to try the belgium waffle with candied pecans inside and sliced banana on top, it was the best damn waffle I've ever had in my life! Can't wait to go back and have it again!
