I've only been in the Stone House during restaurant week. However, I was very impressed. The restaurant has a great homey atmosphere. They give fresh muffins instead of bread, that were even warm when we got them. Plus, our waitress was nice enough to wrap up the ones we didn't eat. My food was delicious and filling. Definitely will be back.
