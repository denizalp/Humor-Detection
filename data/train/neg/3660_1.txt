visited during happy hour and was able to order a few breakfast menu items, so we tried the soft shell crab benedict, green eggs\/spam, pineapple fried rice, crispy pork belly tacos, kimchee kalbi fries, and all the happy hour sliders. we especially liked the flavors in the pineapple fried rice and the crispy pork belly tacos. i really liked the whole strip of bacon in the soju blue bloody mary. the food is on the heavier side so i would definitely come here ready to eat! its delicious and well worth the value!
