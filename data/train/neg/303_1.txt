I'm in the service industry and I appreciate a good dining experience. I was about to go to P.F. Chang's for my lunch break until I realized you guys have 2 pokestops in your restaurant. I sat at the bartop and I think my bartenders name was Rebbeca. She saw me playing on my phone and we ended up talking pokemon. Your menu is huge and I like that there are so many options.  Service was great, the food was great, and I got to get my pokemon fix. I'll definitely be back.
