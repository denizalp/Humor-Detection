Terry from RCVIP was a true gentleman and very professional to work with. \nhe set up my Brother's Bachelor Party in October, 2012. The Hostess for our big night was great and we had no issue with the table or entry to Marquee . I would absolutely use them again the next time I am partying in Vegas!
