Hit this place up!! Every dish we have had has been delicious and unique. The serving time per dish was 100 percent, everything came out in a perfectly one manner. The sake we ordered was promptly brought out before first dish which in my opinion is good. Waiters were friendly and knowledgeable. Decor is number in my book!
