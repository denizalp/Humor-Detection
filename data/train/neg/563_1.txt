Sushi Samba is an interesting fusion restaurant that meshes Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisines together. The food is good but not great. The decor is very cool and modern. The value is not that great consider most Brazilian and Peruvian cuisines are fairly inexpensive and the menu is not dominated by Japanese food. This place is good for a sensual experience or hot date oppose to a gluttony fest.
