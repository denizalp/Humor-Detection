3 items on the menu and all three are great. Fried baos are the star of the show and they are delicious. Soup and noodle dishes are simple but extremely comforting, like eating at mom's house (I would have the noodle + scallion oil everyday if I could...).\n\nLimited seating so you'll want to go off peak hours or be prepared to wait a bit. Food comes out quick so turnover is decent. This is not a place to bring large groups.
