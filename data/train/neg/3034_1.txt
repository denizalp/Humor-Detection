A friend brought me here for lunch once. She insisted I try the bean\/pork\/cheese puposas and have a big glass of horchata with it. She didn't steer me wrong! The puposas could have been a touch warmer, but came with delicious slaw and probably the best hot sauce I have ever come across. Tangy, spicy and soo flavourful! Get the horchata, it's the perfect pairing for this meal, just sweet enough and just cinnamonny enough to offset the richness of the food.
