Quality fun at low cost. The machines are a blast from the past. All worked wonderfully and an unparalleled variety. In addition to a large quantity of Pin ball machines, there's also air hockey, some old driving games, and more. Saw couples, families, and folks enjoying a good time on their own. Popcorn, sodas\/water, and some light snacks available for purchase via vending machines. Stayed in Vegas for a week on the strip and honestly had the best time here.
