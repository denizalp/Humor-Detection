Used to love going here, but the cleanliness of the place has greatly diminished.  They're trying to cover the stink with air fresheners, but it's not doing the job.  Here's a Pro tip for Sacks Management:  Get some water down the floor drains (in bathrooms, kitchen, etc.) on a regular basis, so the sewer gases don't bubble up all day.  Also, my last sandwich has a \"dirty rag\" sour smell about it.  I'm assuming from the dirty knife used to cut it, but who knows.  Obviously won't be going back.
