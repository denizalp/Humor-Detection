I shot the Barrett .50 here. The instructor took a good 5 minutes to explain the functions of the firearm, and then he let me at it. They pay good attention to safety, which I appreciate since it was my first time shooting anything that large. After shooting I spent 15 minutes or so taking photos, and he did not rush or pressure me. It was also the cheapest place I found in that area with the Barrett up for rental; overall, my experience could not have been any better.
