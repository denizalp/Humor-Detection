SO DISAPPOINTED. The course was in such terrible shape. The greens were slow and bumpy and it took 5hrs to play. It wasn't even busy, the group in front were playing more than one ball, the 2 some we played with were very nice but they were obviously new to the game. \n The greens and fairways were painted green, not even a natural grass green more of an astro turf green. It looked RIDICULOUS. I would rather of paid a little extra to play a nicer course.
