Decent spot, nothing really special. it has an extensive beer and liquor menu. hung out in their tented area, which is kinda nice. it's warm and has lots of TVs so you can watch a bunch of sports. but the bartender has to run inside to get your drink orders which slows down the service a little. \n\noverall it's a nice place to watch a ball game, but there's better spots around the area to go.
