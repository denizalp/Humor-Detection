The food and service was excellent. Get the Chicken Alfredo! My only complaint would be that the wonderful, very talented band was too loud. My friends and I could not hold a conversation due to the noise level. It was a Saturday night, so I loved the entertainment, but if that could change, this place would definitely be the \"go to\" place for my husband and I and our friends.
