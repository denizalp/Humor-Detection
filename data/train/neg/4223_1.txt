I have visited this location many times in month that I have lived I Scottsdale and every time that I have asked the staff to add something to a drink it has been poorly executed. My last visit I asked for pea protein to be added to my drink. The powder was thrown in after the drink was mixed so the top of my drink was half pea powder and half pea protein foam that had the consistency of half mixed pancake batter. I love the idea of Nekter but this location is sub par.
