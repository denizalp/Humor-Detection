The food is good. The chicken is well seasoned, the shakes are delicious, real cane sugar soda from the fountains, and the service is average. However, the price just doesn't match the quality. You can get just as good if not better meals for less elsewhere. The real highlight is the cream soda and root beer from the fountain.
