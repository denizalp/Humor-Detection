Forget the mystery bowl go straight for the volcano bowl. We are average drinkers and we ended up getting two drinks each anyways and there's a lot of ice in the mystery bowl. Chicken wings are fantastic - crispy and decent size. Our wait for the food was too long. Fries are good skip the chicken satay.
