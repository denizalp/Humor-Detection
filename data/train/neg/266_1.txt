Jun's was my first take on traditional Korean BBQ and it was delicious! A good friend of mine wanted to take me for lunch and recommended that I try the sampler of all the wonderful menu items Jun's has to offer (minus the fish).\n\nThe service and the food were all top notch and for the $11.95 price it was so filling. The spare ribs stood out by far as the best item and I cannot wait to return and try the fish.
