Love the ambiance here! The drinks (both alcoholic and coffee) are delicious. Loved the Moscow mule I had there. I've gotten the sweet potato cannelloni twice and loved it both times, highly recommend. The beet salad was light and refreshing. Everything is made in house, so their bread is incredible. This is a fun place to take friends for lunch if you can't decide where to go!
