I want to love this place, but each time it just falls short. Their food and margaritas are just... ok. Think like Sandbar quality, yet you're paying WAY MORE! This place is just way too overpriced for the quality they serve. This place is okay for a date or out on weekends at night, but definitely not a regular place to visit for a great dinner.
