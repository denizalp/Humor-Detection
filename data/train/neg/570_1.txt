The food there was horrible. Some of the dim sum had no flavor, while the other were too salty and oily. The service there was bad. The server pushed us to order from the more expensive dishes and dessert. I can understand that up selling is good for this company, but the way she went about it let us felt very comfortable. Sadly we will not be coming back here again.
