Great food, great service! It's pricier than your average Indian restaurant, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.  I had the chef's tasting which was great except for the dessert, which was mediocre and served very awkwardly - a cone dish placed on a bowl. There was liquid leftover in the cone and since it can't stand by itself I had nowhere to put it to get to the separate dessert in the bowl...
