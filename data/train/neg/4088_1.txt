We were craving fish n' chips today....so yelp'd it...Blue 32 Sports Grill came up and we finally decided it was time to try this restaurant thats super closer to our home.\n\nWe both ordered the fish and chips - the fish was beer battered and cooked to perfections. The fries were also delicious. I really enjoyed the coleslaw as well :) \n\nOverall our first experience was great! We can't wait to go back
