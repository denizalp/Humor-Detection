I've only been here on Sundays for brunch, but i'll speak on behalf of the buffet. It's impressive, affordable, and delicious. Even if you're a meat eater like myself, you'll enjoy it. Great staff, atmosphere. I wish i knew what kind of coffee they serve because, in my opinion, it's one of the best cups of coffee to get in the city.
