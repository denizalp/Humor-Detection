I had the chicken tikka masala and regular naan.  Tasted amazing.\n\nThey have the cool computerized soda machines.\n\nThe man who took my order gave me a really quick and detailed run-down of the menu and he was nice.\n\nThe service was really fast. I thought it was going to take longer because they gave us the little buzzer things, but it took like five minutes.\n\nThere were a lot of Indian patrons, which is always a good sign when you go to an ethnic restaurant.
