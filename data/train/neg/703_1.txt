Can I give this place No stars? Absolute WORST dinning experience ever! Manager was an absolute DICK. We were about to bring 20 people in for food, drinks, and football. They asked us over 6 times if we were eating and I already had placed my food order 20 min prior. As a hairdresser, I will make it a point to tell every one of my clients to avoid this shitty place like the Plague.
