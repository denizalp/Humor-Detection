Can't believe I haven't visited this place before.  They make a nice assortment brews and also offer a nice selection of guest beers as well.  One of their award winning beers is \"Head Hunter\" and you should try it if you are in to a good hoppy beer.  \n\nOn the food front be warned in that their portions are huge.  Nice assortment of sandwiches and I would suggest the \"melts\".  \n\nGreat local place and if you are looking for good beer & food you can't go wrong here.
