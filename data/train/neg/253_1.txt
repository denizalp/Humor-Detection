The food was actually pretty good, did not get dim sum there since it was pretty overpriced at around $2.60 a dish.\nHad two plates of rice which was average but definitely above my expectations while reading the other reviews. Gave them a solid 4 stars even though their food was nothing spectacular but being opened at 4am and providing food fod 3 hungry guys definitely puts it up there.\nJnlike what other people said, the service was actually pretty good. Food came fast, had our tea filled, cold water when asked and no rude atitude at all!
