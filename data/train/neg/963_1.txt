I've had Boiling Crab, Firehouse Crawfish, Crabzone, Clawshack etc. and this place tops every spot I've tried! Got 1 pd shrimp\/crawfish 2 pds clams in Cajun Mix medium. It was delish. I loved how they cooked the clams to perfection, not too done, so I ordered another pound Cajun Mix hot and flavor was still on point. Then I couldn't resist I wanted to try Cajun Mix extra hot, got another pound of clams and was not let down. Must try!!
