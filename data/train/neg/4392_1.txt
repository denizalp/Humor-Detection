We moved from California, and had yet  needed to find a great pizza place. Thanks to yelp, we found this gem! Pizza was by far the best I've had in a long time. You can taste the freshness of the vegetables and the wings were perfect. I ordered a kids spaghetti for my son and he enjoyed it very much. Great food at a reasonable price. Family owned, so you can feel like warmth of the place. The owners were very friendly and made sure we were taken care of.
