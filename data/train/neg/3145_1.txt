Good thing: the Beef Masman Curry with coconut rice is still delicious and the restaurant is so cute! Growing pains: I was first told there was no beef curry at all, only got two disposable creams worth of cream in my Thai Iced Tea, and my to go order came out as a dine in (but this was easily solved by getting me a take out bag). Service took about 10 minutes. Will visit again!
