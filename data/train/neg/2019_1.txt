im not really a comedy club guy but this place is really chill! tix are very reasonable at $10\/head. Food is standard and really cheap so you can always grab a bite to eat as well. Anyway the acts are funny as heck. I was laughing my butt off the whole time. I'ldd definitely be back. Beer and jokes. my kind of night. I wish they had some more food options but its pretty a ok for me!
