Had dinner at Bodega on Saturday March 18m 2018 and was pleasantly surprise by the whole experience. Greeted warming upon entering and seated immediately, had a reservation. The food selections were just as described on the menu. The cocktails and wine exceeded expectations. It can be difficult to have every wine available by the glass but several of the selections were only available by the bottle. The server and service was excellent and we felt like a welcome guest. Will stop in again.
