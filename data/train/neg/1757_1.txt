My favorite Greek restaurant in all of  Montreal! Home made style Greek food with unbeatable prices!\n\nTheir home baked potatoes are always moist with a hint of lemon.\nTheir feta and tzatziki is fresh and full of flavor.\n\nI also love their cozy atmosphere and the fact that it's bring your own wine. They've been open for years and I try to make it at least once a year when I'm back in Montreal. It's really that good!\n\nFYI - Their website says they're open weekdays until midnight but in reality they close around 10:30PM. They're open late on weekends though.
