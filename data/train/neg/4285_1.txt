I took my mom here around 7:15pm, two people walked in after us. People that came after us, were seen before us, because they paid the co-pay, and my mom had achcccs. You would think, it would be based on first come first serve. But I felt like there was some sort of discrimination against paying co-pay vs people with AZ health care. Very disappointed, and shocking.
