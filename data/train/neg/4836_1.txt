My boyfriend and I came here after church on Sunday and sat on the patio.  The server took a while to get to us but the drinks were worth the wait.  We had the lemon tini's and it was amazing.  The flavor was tart, sweet and the froth stayed at the top.  The pour was definently short for a martini but the happy hour price made that okay.  We also tried the beet salad.  This was amazing. Do not try the calamari --it was super greasy.  All in all we will make this a regular stop.
