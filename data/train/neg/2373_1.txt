Found this great little kitchen while we were visiting friends in Phoenix over the weekend.  Prices were great as was food. We tried the eggs benedict, burger with an egg, biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and the egg breakfast with hashbrowns, sourdough toast and house made sausage patties.\n\nWhen you come in, you seat yourselves at any open table\/booth. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. Servers were very friendly and provided great service. \n\nFood was prompt and very yummy. Prices were very reasonable and I'd highly recommend it.
