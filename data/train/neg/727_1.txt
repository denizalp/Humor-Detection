Just realized this new joint was near my office.  Had to take a look in and have a taste of the Pan Asian cuisine.  The restaurant itself is small but the menu is quite extensive.  I noticed everything on the menu from Pho to Singapore noodles.  I ordered the lunch special chicken Pad Thai and was not disappointed in the least.  Great flavors and the chicken was cooked perfectly.   If you're looking for a no frills Asian lunch\/dinner, this is a good place to start.
