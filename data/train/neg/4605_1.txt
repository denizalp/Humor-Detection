I return everytime i visit Vegas because drinks are strong & live music is always good! And to say hello to the hottest bartender in Vegas (ok, my favorite) James ~ Amazing eyes and a friendly, attentive bartender thats been there for YEARS! \n\nHit or miss on if its busy but love the open dance floor to really country dance!
