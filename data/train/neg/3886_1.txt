This place is a good sushi spot if you're not feeling for AYCE! Love coming here if I'm not that hungry for AYCE and just want some sushi. The prices are fair and you can definitely eat a lot with the variety of food choices the have! Try the seared choices, fire dragon roll, tiger roll, and rainbow roll! The restaurant also has  quite a nice setting, and the servers are friendly.
