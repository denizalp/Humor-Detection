Don't expect \"authentic\" on this, it's their own twist on enchiladas, that's not necessarily a bad thing. I had the green chili with bison, they were very good, although it's hard to reduce the acidity in the tomatillos, other than that you just have to add the right toppings. This joint uses a method similar to Chipotle's; everything is in front of you, which is good!
