This is my second Cirque du Soleil and they do not disappoint.  The acrobats the flips the rollerblades the bungee cords they bounce up and down on simply amazing. Artistic design and engineering fabulous. The stage choreography and costumes thumbs up.\nThey do have some dark scenes in it because they take you through history but they put a little love in our hearts!!
