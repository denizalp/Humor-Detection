This is a nice little chinese hand pulled noodle place. Though because of the limited space line ups can be long and service can be slow. Noodles are hand pulled on the spot because you choose the style of noodle you want. The soup is nice and clear. Overall was an okay experience cause waitress was pretty rude but the service itself wasn't bad. The food itself was good but not outstanding. I would still reccomend for people to go try because of the variety of handmade noodles they have.
