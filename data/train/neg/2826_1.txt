We've had 2 dental experiences at other businesses in Las Vegas where we felt scammed, both times after our first TLC experience. I don't know why we ever decided to go anywhere but TLC, especially because our first experience with them definitely would've warranted a return. We've been back now and will continue to go back. They have reasonable prices, trustworthy dentistry, and good service!
