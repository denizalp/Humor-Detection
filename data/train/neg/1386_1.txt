Really like this theatre.   Watched JLo here and I loved how close we were.   Small enough so that no matter where you sat you had a great view. It gets crowded coming in and our like with any venue,  but add the mall and casino,  a little harder...  Would definitely watch another show or concert here!   On the other hand, your closer to gambling and drinks right after show...  Oh and food!  LOL.
