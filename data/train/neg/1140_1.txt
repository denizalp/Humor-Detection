waited half an hour around noon, and register lady said they've been out of sluts for an hour already. decided to order a sandwich instead. while i was waiting for my order, a worker with thick black rimmed glasses and maybe shoulder length hair told me that a batch of sluts came out. he replaced the sandwich with a slut, no problem. i didn't get his name, but what an unsung hero of the day. give him a promotion.
