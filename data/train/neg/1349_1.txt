I don't know this company until I saw it had a 5 star customer review.  I called the guy and he said he will come to my house and he did in time.  Fixed my central A\/C and now blowing a cold air. His service fee is not bad as compared to others.  I highly recommend him if you have a problem with you home A\/C.  Thanks Joe for your help, I really appreciate it!
