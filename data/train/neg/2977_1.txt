They supposedly open at 12. Got there at 11:56 and sat down to eat outside. At 12:02 someone came out and said they wouldn't be opening until 12:15 because the chef was running late. Although she offered us water, they were pretty rude & not really inviting, not to mention lazy & late! If they're not this crazy about getting my money, are they really on top of other things, like health & safety?
