The best thai in the east valley!!  I've been trying a lot of thai for find a good one, there is a lot of average to bad thai out there...Tum Nak Thai is awesome!  Everything I've tried is excellent and will make this my go to thai restaurant even though I live in south Chandler.  The pad thai, veggie delight and papaya salad are excellent!
