For the price point this one's a keeper, especially for business travel.  The location is great because you can walk over to a variety of restaurants and to the Ayrsley Grand Cinemas to catch a movie.  There is a free business center where you can use their computers and print your boarding pass, a modest gym and plenty of free parking.  My room was clean, with a comfy bed and bedding, a Keurig in-room coffee maker (bring along your favorite K-cups) and a mini fridge.
