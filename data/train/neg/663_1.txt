Mofongo Mondays! Awesome authentic plantain dish cooked to perfection and the special on Mondays. Goes great with the fried chicken and a Dominican soda. \nStaff was super friendly and helpful, they even brought out samples of other dishes for me to try. The beef stew was delicious. Can't wait to try it with black beans and rice. Looking forward to my next visit.
