Everyone there is amazing and friendly. From the reception to finance to service to sales and even the GM, they're all great. We had a blast with Kurt test driving our Advantage Party Cat and Dave was awesome in the sales department. Seriously, if you're looking to buy a boat, don't waste your time going anywhere else.
