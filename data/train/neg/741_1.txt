I loooooveeee this thrift store!! Its a new addition to my neighborhood. The grand opening was Friday...3\/30\/12. This place has many designer labels. I have never seen a selection quite like this location. It is a new store, so I pray that the selections remain plentiful. On the first day it opened, I scooped up a Kenneth Cole motorcycle jacket for $24.99, a stunning Cache beaded top for $12.99, a black lace vintage crossback maxi dress for $9.99 along with some other goodies. I can see this being one of my new fav spots to shop.
