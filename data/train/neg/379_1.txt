This place is suitably named.\n\nDecent spot for grabbing some drinks on a patio, but you'll find dozens of similar places nearby and there is nothing particularly distinctive about the Standard that would make me chose it over other options.\n\nFood is pretty \"standard\" too, moderately priced pasta and pizzas.\n\nI've been a few times for drinks, service was always good (but not great)
