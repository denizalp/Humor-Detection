I normally come here for breakfast\/brunch. First time here was lamb burger. Really good. Went back here a few months later to try their salmon Benedict and went back a few more time for it since then.  Can't say much about their food, it's salmon benedict for me every time. \nWell staffed.  Clean.  $14 for salmon Benedict is reasonable to me.  Never waited too long.  \nA true hidden gem, I think.  (who goes to Freeport Rd anyway??)
