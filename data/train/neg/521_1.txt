Pittaya was my promoter and he did a great job taking care of me and my friend. He walked us in without waiting in line, brought us to a table at great location with tons of free drinks. Total VIP experience and we didn't cost a penny. We will def come back again. Club itself was very nice. I like it better than marquee(dark and dancefloor is smelly w tons of people sweating due to the crowding) or xs(people who work there are kinda snobby) overall my fav club in Vegas hands down! Thanks Pittaya for the great experience.
