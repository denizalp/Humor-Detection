I've been using Roadrunner Pharmacy for my shih tzu's compound eye medication for over 3 years and I've always had great experiences with them. They are also very courteous and helpful on the phone and easy to get in contact with. They also call you with updates if there is an issue i.e. a veterinarian needs to approve the refill request. Keep up the good work!
