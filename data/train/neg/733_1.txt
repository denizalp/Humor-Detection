I purchased all my furniture from Ruben....  I bought a sectional and a dining table a few years ago... everything looks great still.. I came back on Black Friday to bought another small sectional for my game room.... and more recently purchased a big wall unit to complete the living room. .. will continue to buy here, the prices are the best in town and the sales people are very helpful and welcoming.
