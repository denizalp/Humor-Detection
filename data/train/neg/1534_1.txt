Very clean. I believe in detox. At first I didn't but when I saw the color change after 30 minutes soaking- I believe! We did a couples foot massage with detox priced at $20 special. Very relaxing and quiet atmosphere. (Except for when disruptive customers come in- don't they know to keep it quiet and cut their cell phones!) I really felt the difference and will do this again! Highly recommended! Enjoy!
