I remembered this restaurant being delicious.  Sadly, the curry was bland albeit beautiful!  Pad Thai was ketchup like - somewhat like spring rolls (booo). \n\nThe service was slow, but there were several large groups at the restaurant whos food had just come up so I cannot find fault with the service. \n\nOverall, I won't be coming back which is too bad.  They have a great patio & it is always nice to go there in the summer months.
