I'm an omnivore that loves good meat - and Southern BBQ definitely fits near the top of the meat category! \n\nHogtown Vegan exceeded my expectations of a vegetarian BBQ spot, as they've nailed serving full-flavour comfort food without animals & dairy. Bravo! Excellent range of tastes & textures, with surprisingly big savoury flavours. Comforting indeed. Not healthy (but that goes for every Southern BBQ restaurant!)... but comforting. \n\nAnd btw the vegetarian bacon bits and sour cream on the \"fries supremacy\" is crazy good.  \n\nGenuine and great service, too. \n\nA+++++++++\nWill return!
