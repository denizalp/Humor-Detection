Stopped in for a late lumch with a couple friends and the place was super busy we almost left. Didn't wait as long as I thought we would to get a table. The server wasn't very friendly but the manager came out to our table,I think her name was Stephanie and she was the best. She recommended a burger and some kind of berry milkshake. couldn't have been better. Good service is hard to find these days and the manager was on point. I can see why the place was packed. We will definitely be back again.
