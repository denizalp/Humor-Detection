I came across Echo sushi after having my 2 year old discriminated before seating at Sushi Rock in the same neighborhood. \nEcho Sushi is small and they can get busy, but food is very good and the all-you-can eat is cheaper than the previously mentioned restaurant in the area. Staff is attentive and my friend's daughter got free ice cream when ordered a la carte! Nice touch. I'm so glad I discovered this tucked away restaurant! My new go-to sushi place!
