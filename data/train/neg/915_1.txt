My girlfriend and I just completed our PADI Open Water certification with No Limits.  Chris, Jeff and the rest of the team were awesome.  From helping us pick out our gear, to the in-pool instruction, all the way to the lake dive they were very professional and well versed in their profession of diving.  Thanks guys!! We cannot wait to go on one of the San Carlos trips in the near future.  Paul and Tina.
