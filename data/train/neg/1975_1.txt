This is a terrific place, and I see a lot of folks agree. I am weighing in to contradict the Chipotle comparison. This is a lot more interesting food with richer, spicier sauces than Chipotle, which is adequate in a pinch but resembles factory food, at least to me. This is a terrific LOCAL place with its own spin on Mexican food, and the folks behind the counter are always friendly and helpful. I love having you guys in the neighborhood! \n\nTry the pickled onion . . .
