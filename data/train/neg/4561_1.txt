We have been ordering from The Bar on Grand Canyon since they opened. I order a very specific burger cooked a specific way with a specifically cooked egg on top, (yes I know I'm picky,) :) and GC consistently screws it up...  This new location got it SPOT ON!  Literally perfect! Although it is an extra mile or so away, we will definitely be ordering from this location instead...  Thank you so much for making my taste buds dance!!  :)
