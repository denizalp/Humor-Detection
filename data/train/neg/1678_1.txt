Went for breakfast. Line was long but moved fast. Everything we ordered came out fast and was fresh. Ask for extra baguette with the slut. They don't have complementary waters just over priced bottled water, coffee and juice so pick something up to drink from the news stores before ordering. Seating area is mostly stools and 2 people tables. It was a fun stop food was buttery.
