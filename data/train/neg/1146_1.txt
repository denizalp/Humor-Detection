Mother's Day Brunch was average. Coffee was cold, other dishes barely warm. LONG wait at the one outdoor restroom in a trailer. Tables were crowded together, making it difficult to navigate back to the buffet area for anything. High price for medicocre meal that didn't even include a mimosa. Those were extra! The grounds are definitely beautiful, though.
