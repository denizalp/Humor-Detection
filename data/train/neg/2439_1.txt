Many, many issues at this property which are primarily service-based. \n\n1. The slot floor staff at night is miserable. They are not welcoming or responsive in the least. \n2. Cocktail service: Virtually non-existent for high-end players\n\nThat's enough for now. \n\nWill be visiting this spot maybe 1 or 2 more times before I say goodbye forever.
