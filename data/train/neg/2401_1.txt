We tried to get in on 3 Mondays between noon & 1 PM, but the doors aren't open, no hours posted, no info on the website & no message on the phone; deliveries were being accepted at the back door. The online coupons offer discounts from 11 - 3, but are they even open? Originally went on a Tuesday, and the food was amazing, especially the fish & chips!!!
