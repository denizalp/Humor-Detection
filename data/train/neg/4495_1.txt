We had a delicious Sunday morning breakfast at Cafe Touski. Prices not bad. The chocolate and fruit crepes were absolutely delicious. My friend ordered an eggs Benedict dish and raved about how tasty it was. Coffee and tea were included in our meal, which was very nice. The vibe of the cafe was laid back and cozy. Definitely recommend!
