What in the actual fresh hell is this? $17 for two burgers with no sides or drinks?? $1 for a slice of cheese? Holy ba-nae-naes! Avoid this location at all costs people. **I would like edit add, that we got the single patty burger, and not the double patty burger. For an even larger awe inspiring view of why this price is outrageous.
