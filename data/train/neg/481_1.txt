This is my favorite cafe in Cleveland.\nThe place has a unique atmosphere, its cozy and easy going. The staff are friendly and welcoming.\nYou can sit there for hours sipping your drink without feeling awkward.\nYou can read, study, work , watch movies on you laptop (the place has Wifi).\nI love the food and their selection of drinks.\nMy absolute favorite is the Coconut-Pineapple smoothie, its delicious.
