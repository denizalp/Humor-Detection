My husband and I absolutely love this dentist!  Dr. Robinson really takes the time to talk over any concerns we might have, and everyone in her office goes out of their way to know us and our history.\nI recently had a dental complication due to pregnancy and Dr. Robinson was able to squeeze me in for an emergency visit that day, offer calming advice, and recommend a specialist.  Her office even followed up a few days later.\nSuper friendly staff and a great overall atmosphere.
