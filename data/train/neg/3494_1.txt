The workers are very talkative and fun. I went for a pedicure while my friend got a manicure. Although the prices on their wall say $30 for a pedicure and $20 for a manicure we ended up paying $50 and $35. I'm assuming because they failed to mention that the colors they handed us to choose from were gel and would cost more. The pedicure was nice, for the most part, but the woman kept using a towel to rub my toes and I left bleeding. Not a good experience.
