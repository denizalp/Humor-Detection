Hired McVay Plumbing for two large jobs (to repair a sewer line and a gas line) and one small job all in about a week's time. The people in the office were very helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, and responsive. All of the work was done quickly which was key, because two of the jobs related to closing on a house and one related to a sewer backup which was causing damage. They were extremely professional and did everything they said they'd do. I'd hire them again without hesitation.
