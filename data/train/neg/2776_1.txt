Worst ULTA I have ever been in to.  The help on the floor was unfriendly and not helpful.  I normally go to the Surprise and Arrowhead locations, and I would never come back to this one.  Maybe I landed on a bad day?  Also, they do not let you combine your club points like the other stores.  So it was a completely wasted trip.
