Huge waste of money. We paid $84 for a dinner buffet for 2 people. That's almost $100 wasted on bland, no flavor food . The buffet wasn't even that big and if you dont like seafood there's really not much for you. My advice: spend your money on a more upscale vegas buffet. The bowls where you get the frozen yogurt were also dirty. My boyfriend had to literally wipe the dirt away and after grabbing about 4 bowls we finally found a clean one.
