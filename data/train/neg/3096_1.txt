Nice location but wish it had outdoor seating. First things first, the margaritas are delicious (though maybe a taaad on the weak side). I love the Jade Olmec!! The house marg with Jack Daniels is ok as well. Now, the tacos are amazing! Don't be fooled, these aren't your ordinary tacos! You have an abundance of meats and toppings to choose from to make your own or you can order some of the specials .. All good! Queso is good! Guac is good! \n\nI will return just for margs and chips and salsa!!
