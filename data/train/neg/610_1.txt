Place has been around for years, that says something about the restaurant.\n\nThis place is Korean run, it's not a bad place for Japanese food.\n\nIt's comfortable for parties of 2 to 6 people.. And the price is reasonable and selection is also fair.  Food comes pretty fast and is well staffed.\n\nNot your high end Japanese restaurant.. Pound of salmon sashimi take-out is 17.25 including tax.
