Amazing tacos! We really enjoyed the Pork Belly and the Bengali Fish. Super tasty, and only $5!\n\nI consider myself a taco expert, I've tried all of the popular, and unpopular tacos in the GTA, Tilde is absolutely worth a visit.\n\nThis was my first visit of many. The staff was friendly, the decor was fine. After reading below, and my experience, I'm confident things have changed for the better since opening.
