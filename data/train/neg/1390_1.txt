Want to go for a run or hike, walk your dog in a safe community, or watch your kids play all day with joy? I have found that this park has it all and has fields of grass and trees to lie under on a hot day. It is a fun place to enjoy your day that is free, whether it is getting your sweat on or running through the splash pad I find it very enjoyable.
