Always like this place.  Always something different, they had candied bacon that was perfection before anyone ever knew what it was... except those who had to make themselves.   Can be a bit pricey and service not always great but always good. Menu is huge and a dog friendly patio with happy dogs on the weekends!  Fun bar area and setup.
