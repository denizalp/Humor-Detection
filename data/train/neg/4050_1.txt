Great little mom and pop coffee house. Outdoor patio seating and a nice area to sit inside. Staff was very nice and helpful.\n\nHad a hot white chocolate mocha and it was spot on. Very flavorful and had a great coffee flavor. Not super sweet like a Star$&@$s. Sorry but I hate that place. Looked like they have a great selection of food. \n\nMy favorite type of place, not a chain. If you're in the area stop in for a cup.
