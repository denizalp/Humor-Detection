This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. I had been looking for a close replacement for my favorite Red Iguana in Salt Lake and this was just as good!  Food is amazing and the staff is awesome.  The only thing that's a little annoying is if you eat inside, everything you bring in will smell like fajitas  but that can be easily solved by eating outside. I also noticed the smell wasn't so bad when we ate in the bar area. I still love this place but wear things you can wash easily!
