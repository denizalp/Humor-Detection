This is the worst. I took my two year old son today. We got the all you can eat pizza buffet for 5.99. They didn't have it fresh pizza or fresh salad. I lost so many tokens in the little ride ons and the games. They have the worst prizes the \"prizes\" are so little Anbar not worth the 10,20 tickes they want. Ill never take him back to that place
