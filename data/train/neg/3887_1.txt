I offer this as a warning to others:\n\nMy experience at this restaurant was exceptionally bad, although it wasn't due to the atmosphere or the service. The food my girlfriend and I received was undercooked, soggy, and unseasoned. We should have sent it back considering the price, which was not cheap. I was immediately sick, and spent the rest of the day lying in bed or in the restroom.\n\nThis is the first and last time I will be eating here.\nQuite simply, this was the worst food I have ever had at a restaurant.
