Yes - it's a must. We were there a Saturday evening and there was quite a wait but well worth it. The beautiful garden courtyard and excellent jazz band was everything we wanted. The food was decent, a bit pricey but expected for that part of town. The only thing I would not do again were the sangrias as they were way too sweet. If you are out for a memorable experience, I would recommend you dine here at least once on your visit to Montreal \n\nFood: 3\/5\nService: 3\/5\nLocation: 5\/5
