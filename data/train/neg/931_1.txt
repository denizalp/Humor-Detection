This is a brewery owned by women. Awesome right there. They have a small menu of beers, but the ones the have are unique and tasty. They do serve food here and the presentation is nice and the flatbreads I tried were yummy. This is a nice brewery with outside seating as well has nice cool inside seating. The staff is friendly as well. The Nobel Dubbel was great with hints of cardamom and chamomile flowers.
