Living in middle east for a portion of my life, it's nice to eat food that brings back so many good memories. The food was good, the establishment was modern and clean. I think the owner was there because he asked us how the food was and of there were any problems to let him know. \n\nI will definitely come back when I'm on that side of town!\n\nOh, and the cucumber chiller was good!
