Great small little cafe. Up for a weekend trip and staying in a hotel near the Basillica of Notre Dame and needed a quick breakfast. Stopped in and had an excellent breakfast sandwich. Coffee and teas were excellent too. Conveniently located, very friendly and helpful staff for us American speaking tourists\n\nWould recommend
