Literally go here twice a week and that's so bad, but it is so good! I absolutely LOVE the chunky French toast and there delicious syrup and you can't go wrong with adding bacon or sausage! Steven always switches it up with different croissant sandwiches and even a sandwhich in general and we love them! Can't wait to go this week! Yay!
