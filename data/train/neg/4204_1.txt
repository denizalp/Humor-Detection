Good food and great music.  Went with a friend Saturday night and the Dj was great.  I had the chicken and original waffle and it was perfection.  My friend had whiting and grits.  Her's was great as well.  Wish they had more of a drink selection.  They were only okay.  Would recommend you check this gem out and there's free parking
