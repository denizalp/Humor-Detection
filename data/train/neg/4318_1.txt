Went to this place about a year ago and was not all that impressed overall. The service was just OK, the price was quite high for what you were getting and nobody was all that impressed with the food. The lobster and crab soup they boast was OK but not great, not sure I would come back here myself. There are just too many places I know that are better for me to want to go here again.\n\nI would recommend searching out a different place in the area if you are looking for a good meal.
