Great place by the canal for a waterfront feel. I've had the salmon and the ribeye and both were incredible. As far as cocktails I didn't know what to think of a strawberry thyme martini but it was pulled off really well.\n\nPlan to come back again. Only downside was the bruschetta was a little underwhelming but overall a pleasant experience
