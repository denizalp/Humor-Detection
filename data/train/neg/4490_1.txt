AVIS is the WORST. Terribly high prices and they don't even care about lowering their price when you find a competitor is lower (which is all competitors it looks like). Booked days in advance so we chose the pay now option since it was cheaper. When we found an option on Alamo which was HALF the cost and cancelled they charged us $25. If we had chosen the pay later option (at the airport) we wouldn't have been charged. Contacted customer service and they didn't care. We are never renting from Avis ever again and neither should you.
