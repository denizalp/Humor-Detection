The service was great, however the pizza wasn't the best.  We ordered the \"All meats\" pizza and noticed it was undercooked and full of grease.  I literally could have filled a shot glass of grease with the amount that came off the slice. \n\nThe location was great, however during the summer time it seemed a little muggy within the restaurant.  The desserts were great, I had the tiramisu, but I probably wouldn't come back for the pizza.  I think the pizza is comparable to SAUCE but more pricey.
