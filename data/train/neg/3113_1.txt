The resto is a great spot: a stone's throw away from Rene Levesque parc in Lachine. So it's a nice spot for a break from biking if you're riding from downtown - especially w the family. The food is essentially Tex-mex and it's solid. Nice virgin pina coladas too (no alcohol for me when riding w my 10 year old! - but adult versions and beers are available too).
