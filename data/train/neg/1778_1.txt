I wish I lived closer! I love doing work, having a date or catching up with a friend here. The options of a comfy armchair, big communal table, patio or window bar stool make it ideal for any scenario. They only take cash, so that's the only downfall. But the kind barista let me enjoy my beverage and food and then bike down to the bank to get cash later!\n\nMy fianc√© and I came here on our first date and played Scrabble on the big table. It will always have a special place in my heart :)
