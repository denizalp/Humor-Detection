Sometimes you can't tell whether or not a hotel will live up to the online advertisement, but this hotel did. Gorgeous lobby, great service, nicely decorated rooms, good food and nice relaxing pool. Plus the location couldn't be beat. It's next to an outdoor shopping center with lots of great restaurants. Would definitely recommend!
