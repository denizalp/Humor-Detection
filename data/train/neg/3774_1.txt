First time there.  Food was great! Service was not.  I had to call the waiter over twice for drinks and once to ask where the food was.  Very slow and the weren't all that busy.  Waiter said the kitchen was slow that night.  he was kind enough to bring us a piece of fabulous chocolate cake to make up for the slow service  i guess.  I would definitely go back again
