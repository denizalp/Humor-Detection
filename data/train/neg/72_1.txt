Ordered Teriyaki Chicken and was told it would be a 10 minute wait (which is ridiculous for \"fast\" food). I would've declined it, but we came to Panda specifically for that dish. So we said we'd wait. My husbands food sat out, getting cold, while we waited closer to  15 minutes. In the meantime the one person in the kitchen was openly just standing there on their phone.  It was infuriating to know we were waiting for food while someone was just standing there playing on their phone.  Super unprofessional.
