They serve toby's estate, which allows me to get a little piece of new york, since I've moved back to Toronto. Some of the staff are actually french, which is great. \n\nThe food here is decent. The salads are pretty good and the $6 size is decently feeling. The egg salad sandwich is pretty good, but has red onions, for those who have afternoon meetings... The croque is pretty tasty but very heavy, also for those who have afternoon meetings..
