I do love the Smiths Franchise, I've been going ever since I was a child. But this one isn't the best. I don't think they're up to the seasons with what they have. And don't go anytime past 8, because there will only be 1 lane open, and it'll be the lane the manager and a worker are having a full on conversation with someone checking out one item for 10 minutes. Then the lines pile up to 5 people. No baggers either to help the cashier.
