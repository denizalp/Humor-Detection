After returning a second time and trying the grits and chorizo I am more confident that the food here is 5star. These grits are flavorful and delicious, but the star is this red sauce on top. Overwhelming depth of flavor and just the right texture. I'm actually genuinely excited to try them for dinner if the brunch food is this interesting!
