So much flavor!  Everything we had here was so full of interesting flavor. We shared multiple small plates to taste more and were completely stuffed. Empenadas were a tad over cooked but everything else was so great. The small fried chicken pieces which I thought would be my least favorite were actually a huge hit. And the corn!  Not overrated. We went kind of late but the place wasn't busy at all. I feel like people are missing out. Beautiful decor & distinct flavors. We'll be back!
