I went here looking for some birthday gifts for my daughter. I really wasn't sure what to get her, but the staff was very helpful and made a few suggestions. I was able to find a few things I know she will really like. I really appreciated the fact the staff was willing to help me look around even though i had no clue what i was looking for. I will definitely go back next time I am looking for some original gifts.
