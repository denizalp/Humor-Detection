Took my wife, her dad and brother to watch some football and celebrate her birthday. The first thing I noticed was that it was dead on a Saturday afternoon with college football on. It should have been a telling tale. The server was excellent which is why this place got a 2 star instead of 1 Star. The food took a while to get to table, and it was awful. I would never go back just based on that. Now I know why it was slow
