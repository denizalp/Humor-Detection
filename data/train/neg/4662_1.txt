I love this place!  The decor is right out of a magazine. It is bright and beautiful inside, lots of times restaurants are dark and sleepy but not this place.  The food is excellent as well and the dishes are full of flavor.\n\nService is fantastic as well.  The staff are very knowledgeable on how the dishes are prepared and what ingredients are used in the dishes.  I was very impressed and will definitely be returning. This is a must try restaurant, especially if you're in the GVR area or staying at the hotel there.
