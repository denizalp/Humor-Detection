Friendly and helpful staff.  Excellent rooms,  clean, comfortable beds, great amenities.  We stayed in a two bedroom suite. Plenty of space for 6 of us. Spacious bathrooms, soft towels with neutrogena bath products. Great breakfast including fresh fruit, eggs, bacon, pancakes etc.  Will definitely stay here again when in the area.
