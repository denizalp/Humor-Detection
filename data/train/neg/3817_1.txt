Nice little hole in the wall find. The crunchy french toast is amazing. The biscuits and gravy is different. It has a smokey taste to it. There's a small outside patio and a dozen tables inside. Service was prompt and everyone was friendly. There's a few parking spaces around back. The bathroom is outback. It's just one bathroom, so it's co-ed. If you're in Boulder City, give it a try.
