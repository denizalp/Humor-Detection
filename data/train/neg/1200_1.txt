What a nice surprise on the CSU campus.  My retired uncle was in the hospitality industry and was coming to see my swim competition at CSU for GG9.  I wanted to take him to a place he would surely enjoy and he was very impressed about the diversity of the menu and the quality of the food and presentation.  Service was very attentive as well.  We did lunch there.  They are hoping to offer dinner in the  future.
