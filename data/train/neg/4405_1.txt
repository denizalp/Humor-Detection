Nice atmosphere and very friendly staff. This was my first time trying Hawaiian food so I'm not an expert. Everything was good but personally, it's just not my preference. If Hawaiian fusion is something you like, I would give this place a try.\n\nNice atmosphere! They have NYE specials and a special menu for dinner that night.
