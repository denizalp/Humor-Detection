Pretty good, but a little pricey for ramen. I have had better for about 33% cheaper in other cities but I don't think there are many ramen options in Charlotte other than Yama. Tonkatsu and miso are probably the best of the ramen. Wish they had more than 2 pieces of pork belly because that is seriously some of the best pork belly in Charlotte. Also, 2 pieces doesn't balance with all of the noodles. Must try the brussels sprouts. The pork buns are teeny tiny. Trendy place right on the light rail.
