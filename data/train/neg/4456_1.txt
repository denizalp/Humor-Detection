Absolutely top of the line.  I called Dawn after an alteration catastrophe and having my gown ruined. She was so calm and so reassuring and absolutely correct- it all worked out. \nThe service I received was above and beyond and kept me calm.  After going to countless boutiques and not finding anything- at Couture I was actually between 4 amazing gowns!\nTheir gowns are extraordinary- and they make everything better!
