Okay haircut at a good price. I have been a few times and will probably go again. I like the atmosphere and the service was fairly responsive to my needs. I haven't tried the shoeshine guy cuz I like to shine my own shoes, but I think it is cool that they have one there. They also had a good selection of magazines unlike their competitors on the other side of the building.
