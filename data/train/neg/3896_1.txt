We came here on a rainy day and were really craving some soup.  We were disappointed that they only had 1 choice of soup on the menu! Aside from that, we did enjoy the atmosphere here as well as the quality of the other food items on the menu.  Portions were just right, not too heavy, and the ingredients seemed fresh and of high quality.
