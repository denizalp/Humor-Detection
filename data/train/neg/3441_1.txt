Using this service now and am worried after reading reviews. My stuff has sat in Vegas for 2 weeks before leaving to Wisconsin. They say this week delivery Tue thru Friday.  So we shall see. I used this company for my expensive stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get broke or lost. I would not recommend this company due to the fact my stuff sat in Vegas for 2 weeks.
