As compared to the other reviews of Steamer's, I'd have to say . . . ditto.\n\nAt first glance, it looks like it's going to be a world-class seafood establishment, bounding with class and luxurious ambiance. \n\nUnfortunately, the food doesn't quite hold up against the high standard that the appearance sets for it. The sushi is a firm no, while the rest of the fish served is good, but not quite good enough to justify the price tag attached to it.
