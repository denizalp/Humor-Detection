Came here from out of town just because it was Dierks Bentleys bar, but was pleasantly surprised by how great it was. We came on Friday during happy hour and the place was pretty quiet. The food was excellent. Highly recommend the whiskey burger and bbq chicken fries. The homemade bbq sauce is on point. Service was great too. I definitely would come by again next time I'm in town!
