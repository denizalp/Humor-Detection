Great shop. I have been going to this shop for years and they have always been extremely knowledgeable and helpful. The turnarounds are great and the service is always friendly. They have helped me with everything from purchasing small accessories and  tune-ups to helping me spec out and build a custom bicycle. There is a reason I've been going here for years and will continue to!
