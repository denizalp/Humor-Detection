This is a very cute ice cream shop on Bloor. They have such creative flavours and all that I've tried so far have been delicious. I really love the ice cream here. The staff is also super friendly and will let you sample the different flavours. There's baked treats as well such as cookies. The shop has a variety of Japanese snacks and goodies. I highly recommend stopping here!
