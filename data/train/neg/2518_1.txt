I'm not the biggest fan of getting my haircut. Strangers touching my head for about half an hour...no thanks. But I've grown to like coming to Corrado's. Both the guys are great. I believe Adam is the owner who is awesome and I've never caught the name of the other guy who always cuts my hair but he's great as well. There is always hilarious banter being thrown across the room. And most important of all, the cuts are always fair priced, quick and oh so fresh.
