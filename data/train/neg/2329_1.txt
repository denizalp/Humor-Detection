Ok so I was a virgin before this show so maybe I can't write a review and compare to others that may be better BUT for those of you that are virgins and on the fence about seeing a show, I say DO IT!!! Go for it. I loved LOVE and would see it again. So glad my girl talked me into going....thanks baby.
