WoW ! .. Wasn't expecting it to be as good as what people are saying about this place, but it's all true .. The food is great .. The service is awesome .. The price is less than what I expected. Our Server Dennis even took requests for our background music preference, make sure to ask for this guy .. All in all, this is our new go to spot when it comes to KBBQ and K Chicken Wings !
