I met up with my Co-Workers here for a late lunch before a big meeting.\nService was quick and attentive.\nI ordered the cheeseburger and when I first saw my cheeseburger it was beautiful. The bun was soft and toasty in the inside and did not break at all. The size and portion of the burger was perfect. My coworkers were surprised as well. Will be coming back here again for  work lunches.
