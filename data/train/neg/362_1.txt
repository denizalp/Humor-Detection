I cannot stress enough what a terrible company Hudson Overhead is. They don't have a showroom, they can't provide you with any customer testimonials, they can't show any of their work, all you have to go off of are stock photos. The owners wife is incredibly rude and insulting on the phone. Trust me, do yourself a favor and find someone else, you will be happy you did!
