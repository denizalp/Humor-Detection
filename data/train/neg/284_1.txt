I absolutely love this place and have gone for lunch, dinner, and yes, an occasional breakfast. The chicken, which is advertised as being roasted for a day, is perfectly seasoned and still so tender. I'm a huge fan of fried chicken myself, but these roasted ones I'd say are just as equally delightful.  What really makes the chicken perfect though is the salsa verde, which when mixed with some mayo make the perfect dip for both the chicken and the yucca fries. I highly recommend it! And of course the plantains mmm.
