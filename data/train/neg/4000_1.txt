I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had high chairs as it looked very bar-y when we walked in.  We ordered the fried pickles, which were pretty good.  The wings were just ok and the bill was huge for what we had.  It just felt very overpriced for very average food.  We didn't even finish our wings, and that's saying something.  Our service was mostly attentive, however.  This would probably be a good place to drink and watch a game.
