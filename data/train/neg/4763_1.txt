I have gone to Nancy at Galaxy Salon twice and she does nails very well. The wait is short and they have a ton of designs that they have displayed that they can do. The salon its self is kinda old looking but the prices are pretty good. \nFull Set Pink & White Powder - $45.00\nFull Set Pink w\/ White Tip - $23.00\nPink fill - $18.00
