Nice spot to get some breakfast if you are looking for something that is made fresh to order. Getting something good on a morning break for breakfast can be hard sometimes but they are really quick here and are really accommodating in making your order exactly how you want it. Everything from eggs to pancakes here. Can't beat the prices either with the generous portions.
