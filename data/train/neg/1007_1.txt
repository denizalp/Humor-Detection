You can't beat the value here, I come once a week. The rice is well cooked and fish is fresh. It's a very extensive menu too.\n\nThey have tempura shrimp which is pretty rare at this price. As well as dragon rolls. my favorite though is the spicy avocado rolls. some how the avocado is always perfect. Highly recommended.
