With all the hype, I was expecting a lot from this restaurant. I was pretty disappointed. Food was good, but Just good. We had a reservation, and still had to wait for a table for over 15 minutes. The wait for our food was also very lengthy. Service was ehh. Overall, I am not impressed and will not be returning.
