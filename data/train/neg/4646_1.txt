Incredible! The super combo is what it's all about. Ordered 2 to take home with me because who knows when I will get it again. Love the sauce too, they make it there. All the times I've been to a la bamba they haves always made my burrito correctly. I can't wait to go back. Wish we had one in St Louis. Anywhere around st louis would be fine. Please give us a la bamba in the st louis area!
