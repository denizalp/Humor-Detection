This is my #1 local, go-to restaurant in Belmont. It's a relaxed pub environment with plenty of TVs available for sports viewing and that type of entertainment. But, it's  also typically calm enough that conversation is certainly pleasant as well.\n\nThe menu at Glenway is pretty extensive with something everyone can enjoy. There's a pretty wide array of offerings spanning from some just-right-greasy-comfort-food to some fairly healthy offerings. The staff\/kitchen is also willing to meet any needs or tastes, beyond the menu as well.
