Wow 1st off SK is our favorite place to eat and now Dennis has stepped it up to another level with the expansion. We just had a new appetizer \"Vietnamese bruschetta\" was delicious We also tried 2 new entrees Lamb w\/ noodles and Pork tenderloin BANG it was really really great. SK should be on your list next time you want an extraordinary experience Can't wait to go back!!!
