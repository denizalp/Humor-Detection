Ill-advised move by ownership. Moved to a run down bowling alley with a parking lot that equals the number of potholes in all of Parma. Their pizzas now come in one size (12 inch medium) at the price of their old large 16 inch. That may be the most disappointing part. The middling quality is not nearly enough to overcome the cost of that pie...not even close. Anywhere else will do.\n\nAlso the steep incline\/decline getting into\/out of the lot will scrape the bumper of most sedan models with unmodified suspension.
