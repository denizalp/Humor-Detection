This is a good downtown restaurant. The decor looks very clean, sleek, and welcoming. It feels sort of like a high end restaurant, but the food is at reasonable prices. I ordered the burger with my friend, and it was 17 bucks. The burger was cooked well, but at 17 bucks I expected bacon and cheese included. The wings were well cooked but were a tad too spicy for me. Next time I go here, I'll try the flatbread because everyone says it was very good.
