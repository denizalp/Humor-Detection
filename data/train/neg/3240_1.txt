Stopped by on my way to Southern Hills Hospital. it's just across the street, so very convient when visiting someone at the hospital or to bring doughnuts to the great staff there.  Clean store, friendly staff,and great tasting doughnuts . A perfect blend. Even though it's not close to home, I am sure I will be stopping by again. BTW, their GLAZED Doughnuts are outstanding!
