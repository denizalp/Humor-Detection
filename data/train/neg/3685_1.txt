I love getting my eyebrows done here by Amie. She is amazing! I've been going to her for about 5 months now and she does not disappoint. She takes her time to make sure your brows are looking great. Also, the day before your appointment, she'll call you to confirm your appointment, which I find great because sometimes I'll forget when I have my appointment. Overall, great experience. Ever since I've been going to Amie, I receive compliments on my brows! I highly recommend her!!!
