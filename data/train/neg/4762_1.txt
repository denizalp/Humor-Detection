Thank god for people that can style, cut and color hair. They are super fun and super professional at this salon. I will never go anywhere else, and I love Jeremy. \nI see people bitch about prices. They are turds, and if they want to spend 10 dollars on a cut, go to best cuts. I think the prices could be higher, given how beautiful my hair looks after Jeremy does his magic. I love them. I could live there. The End.
