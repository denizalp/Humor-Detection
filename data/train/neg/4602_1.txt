What a pleasant delight. We came here while visiting family who live there in Henderson. We also were there with family visiting from Brazil. Everyone enjoyed their meals and found if to be prepared with quality ingredients which makes all the difference. Don't let the location or size deceive you of the quality of food they provide. We had very good service as well. Good food takes time to prepare.
