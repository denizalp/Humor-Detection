My family has been here a few times and we love the pizza and before yesterday the service was always good. Last night was another story, seems our waiter was having a bad night. We were sitting outside with our son and I had to ask the waiter 3 times for water. And each time he acted like I was asking for too much. Someone at another table complained about he attitude as well. Not sure if will be back, for the price we pay we should get good service period.
