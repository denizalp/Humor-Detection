Had a great meal with some friends. Everything was great at the restaurant. Love the breadsticks, by the way. You can never have too many on the table! Cut to 5 hours later waking up at 1 am to spend the next two hours vomiting violently. Sea food + vomit = ROWDY!!! Maybe it was my fault for ordering sea food in the desert??? Would normally give OG 4 stars but just can't do it this time.
