Love this ramen spot! Definitely add the spicy ground pork to any of the ramen bowls and you will not be disappointed. Just a note for first-timers, because the restaurant is tiny, the seating is unique and shared at one long table (I think there are a couple small tables in the back), so you might sit with strangers! There is also seating at the bar, along the window (barstools), and a great patio!
