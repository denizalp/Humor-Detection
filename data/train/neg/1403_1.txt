I bought my air conditioner last year from dukes of air. It could have gone any better. Always on time and followed thru on everything. I have had 2 \ncheck ups with my unit. Tom the most recent tech that came out was great he was on time answered all my questions and I had a lot. Thank you dukes of air .It is great to due business with a company that really does what they promise to do.  Keep up the good work\n \nJeffrey A Jeanette
