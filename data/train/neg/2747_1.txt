Trader Joes is great for some things.  The staff  is friendly.  I feel like you really have to know what you are looking for... I don't go there too often because I try to keep my trips down - and usually prefer Woodmans, Willy, Metcalfe's, or Jenny Street.  I also prefer to go to more local establishments.\nThe parking lot is below!  Just one of the many \"have-to-live-here-to-know\" charms of Madison :)
