This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  I always take my family\/friends here when they visit.  The prices are reasonable and love the food and design of the place.  The staff is awesome too and every time I go I get the same thing (Turkey Cranberry Sandwich) and they remember my order every time.  Go try it and it'll be your new favorite place too.
