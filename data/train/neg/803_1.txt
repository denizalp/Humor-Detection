If it's actual sushi that you are looking for, Shinto's is right up there.  I'm giving it a 4 not a 5 because they no longer carry ikura or uni but what they do have is great.   Tuesday is half priced sushi so the place is packed.  If you are interested in trying out some excellent Japanese appetizers go on Wednesday, it's half priced appetizer night.
