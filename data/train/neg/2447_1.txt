I am really liking this place the more I visit.  I tell myself every time I go that I'm going to order something different.  That of course never happens.  I am partial to a certain salad ordered the way I want it.  Last visit however, I found a chunk of foil in my salad halfway through eating.  Not cool!  I brought it up to our server and she sort of shrugged it off with a \"sorry about that\"...I'm sorry I had to pay for it!
