The Queso Verde here was pretty good, and given what I've tried, their appetizers in general are up to par. However, the Tinga tacos were not completely cooked, and the corn tortillas were a bizarre consistency (not as soft as flour but not very crunchy either). All in all, definitely not a go-to for Mexican food.
