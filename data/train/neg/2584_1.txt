Finally!  A movie theatre that has comfortable seats!  One of the issues for bad-back movie goers is the very long and tortuous time spent in seats originally made for the Spanish inquisition (that's you, Harkins theatre!).  This theatre is the best in the valley.  The food is excellent, the sound system fantastic and the location superb.    Ultrastar need to fix their website, though.
