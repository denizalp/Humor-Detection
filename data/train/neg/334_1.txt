Not very kid friendly. No high chairs. Other oddities include the grilled cheese only came out halfway - where's the other half? No coke only Coke Zero. They want you to order up front but the menu is large - so it's a weird in between sit down and fast casual.\n\nWith some very basic improvements this place would be great.
