I was very disappointed in the quality of their clothing. I went shopping in Denver at this store and was very impressed, prices wise, and the styles fit me perfectly. Today, at this store, was very unorganized, would find something affordable and cute, yet once I put it on, it seemed as if it would wear and fall apart after the first wash. Fabric is thin. I'm a fan of comfort but something that lasts. But I guess you get what you pay for, right? Ugh
