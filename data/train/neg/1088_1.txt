Bought an amp and subwoofer for my Chrysler 300 and had Frys install...as in all dodge chargers and Chrysler 300s the battery is located in the trunk. The installer didn't know this and grabbed power from the fuse box on the motor side and ran it all the way back. Well long story short, it burnt the amp 2 months after! Now they are telling me it's a Kenwood issue and won't replace it, that I have to send it back! BULL! Never again will I go there for any car audio system items!
