Been a favorite breakfast stop for years. Don't know why I've never done a Yelp review.  Great, yummy French Toast. They use a light baguette that just melts in your mouth. When I want a special treat, this is it. Best French Toast in the Valley!!! And the location is perfect with great mountain views,  and if we have smog free skies you can see the buildings of downtown. Love this place! !!
