Incredible food and service. I was blown away by my bento box and my boyfriend loved his po'boy. They were slammed and there was a mix up at the bar, so didn't get our drinks until after our food came out. However, the drinks were both delicious and strong. They also took them off our check. They were so kind and polite to us. I wish I could eat there every day, such unique flavors and fresh ingredients.
