If there were more stars to give, this place would get them!! I've been going here since I was a little kid, not too long after we moved here from IL. The fries are amazing, the hot dogs are amazing, the italian beef is amazing.. Honestly I haven't had anything here  that I haven't liked. It's way better than Luke's and I even drive all the way to Dazzo's even though I live only a mile or so from Luke's.
