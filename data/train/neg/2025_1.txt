Just wanted to say that affordable flooring is an amazing company! From beginning to end it was a smooth process. Mike the owner helped me pick out the material, Eddy and Gomez helped follow up everything, and the installing team run by Jose, and Tito did a great job!  Also the carpet guys were great too. They were quick and made sure they were on time. Thanks again!
