UWCU is a phenomenal financial institution. In all my dealings they have always been straight-forward and honest.  Tellers are always friendly and helpful and their financial advisers are great at sitting down and distilling complex financial topics in a no-nonsense manner.  We have worked with Matt Deadman in the past and have been continually impressed.
