Still delicious! Had the chicken salad this time...what a surprise presentation! The strawberry lemonade the table to my left had looked divine ...they confirmed it. Love this place! The husband has reservations with his friends for Sunday brunch and I have already filled them in on this place. I wish I was part of the celebrations! Keep up the great work!
