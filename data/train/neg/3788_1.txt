A pretty consistent and nice staff Starbucks in my opinion.  Having lived in the neighborhood for awhile, we would go here quite a bit.  We still go here quite a bit even though we live closer to a few others now, and I think a lot of it is because of the nice staff and consistency in terms of the drinks here. \n\nI highly recommend this location.
