The crepes are very tasty with creative ingredients that are not run-of-the-mill. Presentation is definitely top notch. My favorites are the Papa K and the Grand Prix. Not a lot of portion but nice quality. It's cool that they have local artists' art for sale but that is the art Decour on the walls. It's on of our favorite neighborhood breakfast spots.
