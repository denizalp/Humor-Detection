I love their juice! Best in vegas by far. I believe in juicing and have been to many juice bars. The owners of this bar take a lot of pride in being the best. Just stop by sometime and let them tell you how they buy and prep their veggies. And also their fair priced. It's same cost as buying from whole foods but at least ten times better. Keep up the good work fellas!
