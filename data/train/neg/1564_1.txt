Suffer through their god awful website\/scheduling system.  It's worth it.  I've taken a few dance classes here (from pole dancing to hooping to yoga booty ballet) and they have all been a blast.  Their instructors just have a light about them.  There's a huge focus on self-love and fun and I swear you come out of these classes just sparkling.  If it weren't for the sweat, I'd hardly even dare to qualify it as a workout (workouts are not supposed to be THIS MUCH fun)!
