Great chicken and decent side dishes that comes with.\nBut the Clams were the biggest waste of money. It was basically salty empty shells that took almost an hour to get to the table. \n\nI will probably only go back for take-outs...and chickens only, as the guy doesn't seem to know how to run the restaurant efficiently. We felt very neglected during the whole dining experience.
