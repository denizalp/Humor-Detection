I called to see if they had a last minute appointment. Tammy in service answered the phone and was extremely helpful.  I told her that I knew it was last minute and she put me on hold for a minute. When she came back she told me she could lock in a 8:00 appointment so I could take my trip as planned!!!  Thank you, Tammy in service!!!
