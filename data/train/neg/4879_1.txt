This Doubletree near CLT is reasonably priced and perfectly fine if you're not expecting fancy. Standard DT set up - cookies, breakfast, free wifi for premium HHonors members. The rooms have not been updated in who knows how long, but they are clean.\n\nLocation relative to CLT and downtown Charlotte is about 20 minutes for both. I'd stay here again for the convenience factor but if there was something newer within the same price range, I'd probably go with the newer hotel.
