Loved everything about this restaurant.  The ambiance, food, and service were all excellent. Our wine and water glasses were never empty and the food, even things that I don't love like mushrooms were incredibly flavorful. The restaurant was packed but we were treated like we were the only diners there. We will be returning anytime we are in a city where they are located.
