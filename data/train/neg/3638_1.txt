Stopped in with a few friends after a Yelp event. Great music country music and good drinks. I was the designated driver for the night and the bartender made me a delicious pineapple\/fruit drink on the house. The bartenders were nice and accommodating. It started getting busy a little bit after we got there, but the ambiance was still decent.
