I was disappointed by the prices of veils, jewelry, and hair pieces. The name of the store invokes something much different than what I found - an overpriced and limited selection of albeit nice-looking accessories. I ended up purchasing a veil and bridal jewelry set for a quarter of the price on Amazon.
