Called at 10:30 to see if i could pick up early. Was told no problem, but it was an additional $80. So i passed to pick up at my original book time. Got there, and there was no car available. Offered one for $40 more. Or a discount on a lower end model. Should have given me a comparable vehicle at the same price.
