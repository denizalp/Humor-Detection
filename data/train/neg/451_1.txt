One of the better clubs I've been to!  The people seem nicer and more down to earth.  Good music, good set up, good service, good drinks, same pricing.  It's not as packed as the other clubs, so if you'd like to go to a place where you don't get smooshed between two sweaty people, definitely give this place a try!!!
