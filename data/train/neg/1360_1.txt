I can't say enough good things about this dry cleaners. You have to have cash to pay in advance. If you forget, they have a ATM. The prices are fantastic and they have done a fantastic job dry cleaning my clothes. The young ladies who work at the counter at very nice, too the point and get you in and out with out any problems. The parking can be challenging but I've Ben able to work with it.
