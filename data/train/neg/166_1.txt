I've been wearing glasses since I was 7 (I'm 35 now) so I've seen tons of Dr and different vision centers. I have to say I'm very impressed with Walmart's Vision Center. The staff has been friendly and made me feel very comfortable. They honored the year warranty for a part of the glasses that I thought might not be covered. And the price was reasonable (duh its walmart). For the price it was an excellent experience. \nEnjoy!!
