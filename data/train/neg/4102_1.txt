My dad always needs Korean food on trips, so I found this place on yelp. As the reviews show, definitely worth a visit. May look kinda shady and closed from the outside, and it is in the middle of a complicated plaza. But don't run away. They have such friendly servers and the warm tea (boricha) is delicious - freshly brewed - I had 5-6 cups alone. I got the kalbi-tang and loved it.
