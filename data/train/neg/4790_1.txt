This is my new favorite nail place. It's got a great location and the salon is fresh and clean. I usually come in without an appointment and have never had to wait long. They always do a great job on my mani and pedi. Definitely feel pampered and relaxed after. I've recommended it to a few friends and they've been repeat customers.
