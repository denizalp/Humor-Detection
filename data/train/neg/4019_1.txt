My go to Asian restaurant when I stay at the Palazzo or Venetian and when I'm hungover to go somewhere and I'm dying of soup. Be prepared to overpay on your meals but expect that anywhere in Vegas. A bowl of pho is $17 or regular soup dishes or congee is around $11-15. Thai tea is not that great. Food wise, I've had better but it's not bad.
