Just found this place today and couldn't be happier!  Got the BFF, Peanut salad, and fried Brussels sprouts.  Yum yum yum.  Placed the order to go and picked it up in ten minutes.  The place is warm and inviting, staff was friendly, prices were great and the food was fantastic.  What more could you want?  Highly recommend you give it a try.
