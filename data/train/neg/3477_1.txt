LOOOOOVE this place!! I pass literally four nail salons from my house to go here. They are always busy - but never a long wait. They are staffed properly for their high demand. I've had about five or so different nail technicians and they are all great - I do have to give a shout out to Van, she has definitely been my favorite. The attention to detail and thorough work is fantastic.
