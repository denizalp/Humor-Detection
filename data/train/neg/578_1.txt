This was our fifth time at the Bellagio. We walked away saying it was not that special. We have been amazed in the past but this time there wasn't anything really special about the buffet. It was not worth $40. I believe next time we will look to another location. We ate at the MGM breakfast\/lunch buffet And the Bellagio dinner buffet was not very different.
