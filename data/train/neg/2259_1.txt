I Love SUSHI... This place is the best sushi I have ever had...But soo expensive.\n\nWe ordered 3 Oysters, 1 tiger shrimp tempura, 3 sushi rolls and 1 alcoholic beverage= $130\n\nThe oysters we very fresh.\nThe 3 sushi rolls, had very good taste and texture. best sushi Ive had, they all had different taste to them, not like other sushi rolls where they taste similar too eachother.\n\nI would go back, just for their sushi rolls, BOMB ...
