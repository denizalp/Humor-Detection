Having grown up in Kansas City and went to school in central Texas, I know how I like my BBQ.  Little Miss BBQ is probably the best BBQ I have even had.  I prefer the brisket and beef ribs.  I am a fan of baby backs which they do not have. The standard pork ribs I thought were better than average.  The sides are wonderful.
