I came here with my boyfriend and to be honest I'm not really knowledgable about guns. The guns were cool but their customer service was so incredible. Austin who helped us shoot was very informative. Jelea the girl behind the bar was so sweet and Greg the man who drove us to and from the shooting area was really positive. All in all the team there was so great and I really enjoyed shooting big guns. :D
