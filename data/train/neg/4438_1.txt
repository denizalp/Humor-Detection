I had such an amazing time at Las Vegas Motor Speedways!  Everything was top notch and the racing was awesome! \n\nI cannot post this review without mentioning that all my questions were answered by the Speedway on Twitter in a very timely manner and the food at the track was delicious!\n\nI would easily come back and go to another race here.  Hope they can fix the traffic issue leaving the track in the future.
