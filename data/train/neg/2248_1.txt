My favourite place for both nails and facials! This is definitely the best on the Danforth. Love all the ladies who work here, they always give me the best service when I come as well as over the phone. It is a super clean, friendly, and relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommend this place especially if you are sick of the typical high volume crowded nail salons, they do not make you feel rushed at all.
