Found this place on Yelp (surprise ) and decided to try it. We did a very reasonably priced couples massage. My therapist (Korinna) provided a very balanced customer pressure session for 80 minutes and I left feeling renewed and relieved. Not too far off the strip and a calm atmosphere. Good massage spot.
