Found this absolute gem while walking down Butler Street the other day.  I remember my grandma and mom telling me about Foster's Meats and this is apparently the new version.  The employees were incredible friendly and it seems like exactly the type of neighborhood shop I love to support whenever I can.  The kielbasa is the original Foster's recipe and it was absolutely amazing.  I brought some to a barbecue and it made all the other kielbasa taste like hotdogs in comparison.  I will definitely be back... and often!
