I found Erica years ago and thought she was fantastic.  Then I moved to Washington, DC and found that she is totally amazing.  Aside from being, cheerful, respectful and really cool to talk with, she listens and understands hair very well.  I have curly hair which can be a challenge to cut, but she cuts it just right and even fixed the bad cut I had in DC - which I actually had several bad cuts.  Just go to Erica. You won't be sorry.
