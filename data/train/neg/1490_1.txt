I go here most Thursdays for sushi. Pablo is the best sushi chef. He bows what I like and don't like. He makes rolls that he knows I will enjoy. He makes sure my water is always refilled and I have the things I need. The servers also know my order and always provide me with a salad. The ginger dressing is scrumptious. I can't wait to go back.
