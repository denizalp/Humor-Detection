Kneaders has so much character and charm it's hard not to have an awesome experience here. The staff at this location was prompt and friendly and displayed they work great as a team to serve all of their customers. My food was great and service was so quick-I received my food within 5 minutes of ordering. There was more than enough room for all to sit and enjoy meal time with privacy. I can't wait to go back!
