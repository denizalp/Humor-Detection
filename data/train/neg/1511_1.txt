BEWARE, AMY is a terrible technician. She is stubborn, Hateful, rude and does poor quality work. She seems angry and bitter. NO TIP FOR HER and wont go back to the salon. I work in marketing so I am spreading the word about this horrible place. I saw them reuse pedicure implements on others without sanitization. Im reporting them to the board of cosmetology in Harrisburgh
