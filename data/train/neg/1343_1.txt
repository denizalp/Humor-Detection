Since I found Gladis and the barber of choix, coming here for a haircut is hardly a choice but more of a habit. Gladis is super friendly and very down to earth person. Great person to talk to and very easy to connect. Everyone praises my cuts and I couldn't think of anyone I would recommend more than her. Overall 5**** Keep it up!!
