I have only been here for drinks so I cannot review the food at this time. \n\nThe design of this restaurant is great.  I love the wine room with wine stack floor to ceiling.  \n\nWe ended up ordering drinks at the bar then wandering outside to sit by a fire  outside. I had a very nice view of the river and it is a very nice area of Scottsdale. It was a fun place to dress up and go out. I will have to come back and try the food.
