I've bought jewelry from this place but after the way they tried to jack me a couple weeks ago I will never do business with them again. I had a Honda generator 6500. Brand new it's about $2500.00. It was in real good condition, starts first pull every time. Took it up to them and they said they'd give me $150 max. I sold it on Craigslist about a week later for $900. These guys are shady.
