The food was good, certainly up to the reputation Hank's has, steaks were cooked perfectly, sides were generous in portion size, service was ok.\n\nThe main issue was the amount of time the meal took, I can understand not wanting to rush a good meal, but it took roughly 90 minutes from ordering to delivery of the food, way to slow IMHO.
