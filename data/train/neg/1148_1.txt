Worst salon ever. I came once and a woman helped me and she did a great job. The man I saw today was a younger guy and tall. He kept staring off while doing my nails and accidentally clipped my skin and it bled. Half of my nails are crooked and lumpy. He was so quick to get me out the door. At least do your job correctly. Rude guy.
