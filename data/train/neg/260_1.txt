If you are looking for an optometrist that is knowledgeable, professional and friendly look no further...  Dr. Nguyen is all of the above plus more.  My family has frequented the office at the District and always loved the convenience of the location, but the new office in Seven Hills is beautiful. It's clean, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly and the overall experience is fantastic.  Not to mention the best selection in eyewear. If they don't have it they will find it =))
