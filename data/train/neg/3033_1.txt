My Little Pizzeria is a good neighbourhood pizza joint. \n\nPick up Special with a large for $9.99 and additional topping for $1.45 is quite decent and it was ready as promised.\n\nI personally found the regular crust too doughy and thick and there were hardly any cheese or sauce. Maybe I would order a thin crust next time? Or even their gourmet pizza?\n\n3 Star for now, I just wish it was better!
