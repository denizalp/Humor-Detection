This small location was hopping at lunch. The small staff run the small kitchen like an assembly line. Prime burger and fries were fantastic. Will definitely be heading back with friends. Prices are reasonable for what you get. Compares well with my favourite (by way of reference, that being Five Guys Burgers).
