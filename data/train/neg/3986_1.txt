The quality of food has deteriorated so much recently that I have to write this review. Burnt naan , extremely spicy curry, paneer curries have less paneer. The price is very high for such food. The menu has very few items listed. Naan is around $3.\nThere are better alternatives for Indian food around.\nI am not going to return to this place.
