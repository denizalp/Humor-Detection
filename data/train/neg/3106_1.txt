I came here yesterday for dinner with my cousin before the VGK game. I don't know if I came on a bad day but I ordered 2 cocktails & barely tasted any alcohol in either one. I brought this up to my server too. The shrimp po' boy sliders were good & the tater tots were nice & crispy. I may or may not return
