Definitely a dive bar- no questions asked. It is usually surrounded by people smoking outside the door so I am never sure if they are actually busy or if it is just a smoker's hangout.\n\nThey often have live bands or something like it. The music is generally terrible but it a pleasant surprise when the band is tolerable. \n\nWhile I've not known it to get rowdy, it usually geys pretty loud- mainly the music.
