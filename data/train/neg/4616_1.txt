This place is awesome. The food is fresh and very good quality. I had the chicken fried steak and it was like I had when I was a kid in Texas: fried cube steak, not hamburger. As everyone says, the homemade jam is amazing. Too much talking, just go, you will not be disappointed if you are looking for a classic American breakfast. The staff are very friendly and welcoming.
