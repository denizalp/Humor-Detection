So - the reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is solely based on Wednesday.99Â¢ fish tacos - I'm super spoiled from living in San Diego and Rosirito, but for the middle of the desert this place is doing pretty good - the chipotle cream sauce they use on the tacos is great a compliment to the crunchy fish  - and feeding my family of 4 for $20 is also a nice treat
