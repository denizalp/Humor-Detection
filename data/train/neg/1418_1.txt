Their entire menu is awesome. During my lunch hour I order the westerner with a side of mac and cheese. One of the best BBQ I've had in a long time. The sides they serve are also worth checking out too. They have barbecue beans, backed potato casserole, coleslaw, and much more. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves outdoor BBQ. I will definitely be back soon enough.
