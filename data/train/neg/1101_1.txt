Good for platinum members - the lounge upstairs has pretty good hor d'ourves and nice views on both sides (I watched fireworks from there once) and sometimes you get upgraded to a jacuzzi suite (on crowded days though, you might get stuck with a smaller junior suite or a regular room - the junior suite is tiny too).\n\nIts location is probably its biggest attraction for me.
