I ate here for the first time while looking for a car when I first moved to Phoenix about 5 years ago. I love this place reminds of the Midwest! Not that the food is anything great but that's what makes it good just a simple burger place that you can take your kids to to enjoy themselves and to get a little flashback of your childhood! I come back every so often for a double bacon cheeseburger and I can't get enough of it!
