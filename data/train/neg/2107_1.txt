This is an awesome place for grooming! Our dog is a rescue and really fearful of new people. The staff at Bogart's is so patient and took time to snuggle her a little extra before she got groomed so that she wouldn't be as nervous. After getting groomed our dog looks wonderful and isn't scratching like she normally does when we bathe her at home (they offered us the hypoallergenic shampoo for her sensitive skin). I'd recommend this to anyone who wants their pup taken care of!
