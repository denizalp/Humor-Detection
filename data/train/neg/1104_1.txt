Great experience. The atmosphere was awesome and the service was nice and fast. The food was amazing and the portions were great. They even have a salsa bar with beans, salsa & veggies. The Mexican street corn was good. The highlight was the el pastor meat taco with the pineapple salsa. AMAZING!!! I really look forward to returning.
