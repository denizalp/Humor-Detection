Amazing dogs and great customer care. I gorged myself with the Amanda Kay and a side of fries. The hot dog had the perfect balance of spicy, sweet and savory (for my preference). The manager also came up and followed up with how we were doing afterwards. Very recommended! \nThe place itself is in he back corner of a bigger pub but not a hard find.
