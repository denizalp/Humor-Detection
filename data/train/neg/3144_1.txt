My friend took me here for 3 times but they either closed too early (10pm) or still on renovation. Lol Finally tried it after coming the 4th time. And become a regular customer here.\nPopcorn chicken is good. Remember to add their flavour powder. \nLove their chicken steak too but is a bit too sweet for me. \nOverall it is my fav Taiwanese food spot in Mississauga.
