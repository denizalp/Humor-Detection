Greens are in good condition however the fairways are kept long which I was   a little disappointed with. The course is a little on the easy side and suitable for someone with a high handicap or has just started playing. Some of the par 5's can be reached with 2 mid irons!\n\nOverall the experience was good, the staff took care of us from start to finish. Try the bloody Mary's from the cart ladies, they are great (even improved my golf game!)
