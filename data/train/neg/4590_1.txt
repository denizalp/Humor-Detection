Actually, was a little disappointed .  We ordered the eggplant parmesan sandwich, meatball sandwich, and the Italian beef sandwich. All three sandwiches were Luke warm, and the bread wasn't crusty. We ordered them on the seeded sub roll and the \"crispy\" baguette. I'll try this again because I want to love this place.
