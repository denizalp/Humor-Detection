Food was excellent. Had the calamari, salmon and the fig and prosciutto pizza. Everything was perfectly cooked, and tasted great. \n\nService was a bit slow, nothing major it just seemed like it too a bit too long to get items that were order. \n\nOnly major downside was the noise. The music was too loud that it was hard to hear the person next to you. If that was lower and more of a background this place would have been 5\/5. \n\nI'll definitely be back as the noise level didn't offset the great food and friendly staff.
