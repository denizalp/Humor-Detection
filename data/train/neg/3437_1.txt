I don't come here everyday, but I am a repeat customer and do on occasions go out of my way to come here. This place is a quiet joint, but even with that sometimes has slow table service. For examplex today we sat there for nearly two hours and not because we were having some revolutionary conversation we were sucked into. Food is amazing, no doubt. You must try this place for yourself and create your own opinion. I will keep coming back.
