Mozza Laval or Mozza West Island, they both have the same in common. Excellent food, excellent service. I frequent the Dollard one more and we never are stuck deciding between restaurants. \nMenu has choices but not too large that you're overwhelmed. \nThe pizzas are made to perfection. \nService is constitant from visit to visit. Well priced.\nA must go of you're looking for REAL Italian food.
