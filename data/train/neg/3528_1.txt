I have taken the Pho Beef Noodle Soup for several times,  which named Pho Ga, its noodle is thin and long smooth strips with some fresh chicken and vegetables like bean sprouts, the soup is hot but tastes fresh and salty. Another one I would like to recommend is Chim Cut Chien which is fried quail. The skin of fried quail is crispy, but the meat inside is smooth and tender. And it tastes sweet and salty which is warm and delicious. That is a nice restaurant.
