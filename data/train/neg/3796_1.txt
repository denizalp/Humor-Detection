Food was excellent BUT our WAITRESS was even BETTER! She was so sweet. So attentive and very knowledgeable of all their dishes. Me and my friend asked a lot of questions and she never got frustrated she just kept giving us different suggestions. Her name was Janelle and she was awesome! I will be returning for the food and the staff!
