They denied service that clearly said walk in. I walked in with my 2 nieces just to get their nails painted. They asked me what I wanted and I told them. They clearly said they don't have time. I asked how long is the wait. They just said no. We have no time. So basically they don't want to waste time on getting 2 little girls nails done. Because it's not a full set or gel. This place is ridiculous don't waste your time OR money!!
