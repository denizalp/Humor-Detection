While being processed here I had to sit in a chair for over 24 hours being sleep deprived. It shouldn't take that long to process an inmate. And they once tried to tell me I couldn't use two debt cards to post bail...I had to use one. You have a right to bail, nothing in law says you can only use 1 payment method! Please train your staff and update them in accordance with the right to bail. Oh, and to charge me twice with prostitute, lol. Ya, I beat both cases. Total corruption!
