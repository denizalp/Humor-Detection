Not only is the food great but so is the service! The banana nut bread, potatoes and Veronica are awesome! Eggs are good too, but that goes without saying! Despite the hustle and bustle of the New Year Day crowd, she was still upbeat and very attentive. Made our dining experience superb! The next time you go to Egg Works make sure you are seated in her section. She is awesome!
