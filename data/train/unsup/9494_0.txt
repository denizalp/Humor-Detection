When customer service does answer the phone, they immediately put me on hold.\nWe set up auto pay. They never implemented it.\nNow they claim we owe 89 dollars and they won't deliver!\nTerrible follow through. Terrible customer service.\nOh yes, it took them a month to get the first delivery out as well.\nUse someone else.\nStill on hold.....
