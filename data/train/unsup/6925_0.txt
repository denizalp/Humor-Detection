This review is worth updating.  The pizza at this place is somehow getting BETTER every time we go.  We know they're working on making the atmosphere more of a sit-down eat-in type of place, and we CANNOT wait for that!  \n\nIf you haven't been, GO now.  If you have been, TRY THE SOFT SERVE.  Somehow they have the best ice cream in the city too.  That makes NO SENSE.
