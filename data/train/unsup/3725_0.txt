Nope nope nope!\n\nAte at 6pm, waited in line to pay, waited in line to get seated then waited in line to serve myself. No thank you!\n\nA bunch of mediocre food at $41 a pop.\n\nThey must use preservatives because I got sick after eating there (because I'm allergic to fake preservatives).\n\nOverall a huge waste of time & money'
