I can't understand what's all the hype about the Secret Pizza?!?!? Its definitely a \"secret\" because we couldn't find the darn place. The Pie can't be compared to anything close to the real deal in NYC - Bleeker St. pizza. The dough was thicker than expected, chewy and not crispy. Their meatballs was good, the best part about this experience. If you're planning to visit, the wait is long so call in your order in advance. Merely mediocre, I've had better.
