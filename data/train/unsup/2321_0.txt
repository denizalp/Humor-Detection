Terrible. Do not come here in a rush because the service is slow.\n\nI ordered the farmer's breakfast and it was very overpriced for what it was. The biscuit was so hard that I did not eat it. We also tried the hearth benedict and it was decent. I recommend that you spend your money at another spot in the airport.
