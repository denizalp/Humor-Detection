Pros: Ample parking, quick service - I just moved from out-of-state, and was in and out with a new license, registration, and plates in under 45 minutes.\n\nCons: The idiot helping me listed me as being \"bald\" on my license, despite the fact that I quite clearly had a full head of hair and am (hopefully) still decades away from even beginning to lose any of it.\n\nAt the end of the day, I guess it's kinda cool to be considered legally bald, now...
