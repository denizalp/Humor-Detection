We have family in the area that loves this restaurant so we wanted to send them a nice gift for the holidays. We called and they directed us to their website where you were able to order and personalize the gift with a message. Their online process worked seamlessly. Perfect for someone who wishes to send a gift from afar. \n\n5-stars for the ease and convenience of being able to purchase gift cards to this restaurant.
