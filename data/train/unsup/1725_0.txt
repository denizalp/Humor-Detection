Dr. Holt and his staff are fantastic!  We have 4 dogs, some easy to handle, some not so much.  Dr. Holt really made our dogs and us feel comfortable during the visit.  I would highly recommend Animal Kindness Veterinary Hospital and Dr. Holt to anyone who has animals.  Everyone who works their treats you like family!!!!
