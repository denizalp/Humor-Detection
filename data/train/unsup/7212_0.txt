Love this place!!! Every time I come here, the staff is always smiling, helpful and polite! Great place to grab cheap drinks and great food. I recomend any of their pizza's and their meatballs! Ohhh my goodness, their meatballs, so tasty! I wish they offered more than just 3 to a plate. Go sit inside the bar and ask for Lexi! She is so much fun, attentive, polite and great at what she does! Mellow you are lucky to have her! You guys are AWESOME, keep it up! :)
