If not for the wait I would have given this place five stars but it is definitely worth the wait! I get the double steak tacos meal with their lime rice. I love the rice! I get the mild sauce that is pretty much just tomatoes,onions, and cilantro. The handmade tortillas are delicious and while you're waiting in line you can see the lady making them! My other favorite that is a must get is their guacamole with salsa and cheese on top!
