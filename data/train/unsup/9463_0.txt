Kylie is a great stylist. I have been to her twice and each time she cuts my hair exactly the way I wanted. She is very kind and professional. I will definitely go back to her. The new Seton location is very nice and easy to get to and there is a lot of other stuff around it, so I can run errands after I get my hair done (and look great while doing them!)
