Let me tell you the food here is off the charts it's freaking amazing !!!!! When I first walked in I was greeted by a employee with a smile on her face, I ordered #1 a chicken shawarma and it was A+ the taste was just perfect . All employees where all nice and respectful .Overall rating is 5 stars . I will definitely come back to this restaurant in the future when I am back in town .
