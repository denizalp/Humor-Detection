Hidden House is the ultimate dive bar, no more and no less. It's no more a \"cocktail lounge\" than I am a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader.\n\nHidden House is the quintessential \"Hole-in-the-wall\", with a great bar, good prices, stiff drinks, and genuine-article characters all around. Serious salt of the earth here, people. No fooling around.\n\nThe pool is great, the atmosphere is chill. No pretenses or fronts, just a good time.
