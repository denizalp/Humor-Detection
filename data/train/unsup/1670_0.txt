Wonderful customer service!! I purchased a pool and spa from them about 6 months ago and received nothing but the most attentive service. The dedication and passion that Jay had for crafting my pool was impeccable. Jay made himself available to answer my questions. I even had to leave town one week when the pool plaster needed daily watering and Jay personally came over each day I was gone and watered the plaster! If you're looking for a pool & spa builder, look no further- Laguna pool & spa is as good as it gets!
