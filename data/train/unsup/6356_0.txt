Can't beat the beet symphony!  That's what my bf got while I had the chocolate one.  SO yummy!  The squab was okay, kinda heavy with foie gras stuffed inside.  The service was impeccable, except for the 12 year-old-lookin bread boy who came to our table practically beggin us to take some bread.  \"Please sir...take my baguette!\"
