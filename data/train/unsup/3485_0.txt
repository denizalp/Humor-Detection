Wow what amazing flavors. We got the bone marrow and it was one of the best we've tried. The Brussel sprouts were also delicious and had a lot of flavor. Service was quick and friendly. Drinks were different; mixes we hadn't tried before but surprisingly good! Would definitely recommend this place.
