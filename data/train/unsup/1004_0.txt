I come to this location primarily for their large book selection. It is like a library, no joke. So big. They have a lot of little trinkets as well for the house which are cool to browse through. They have a pretty large clothing selection including a lot of jeans. Didn't see any high end jeans. A lot of old navy, levis, etc. The clothing selection was pretty organized by size and style. They have a small jewelry section as well but haven't seen anything to write home about.
