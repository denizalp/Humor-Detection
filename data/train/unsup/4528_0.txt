Maggie Oakes is a lovely restaurant. Semi-casual, with a great variety of food. Their daily soups are light and tasty, and the burger are also delicious. Normally Brie on anything is pretty damn good! I first visited here during Igloofest when they had a special set menu. I had duck, and wow was it ever delicious. Melting on my tongue with each bite. If you see duck on the menu, eat it and thank me later. Side note, their desserts are different from the usual fare and rather tasty.
