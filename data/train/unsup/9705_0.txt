I'm updating my review due to my recent experiences at Providence dental. I am not sure if they have had staff changes or if they don't have enough staff. My appointments have been getting rescheduled or scheduled incorrectly. I have been misquoted pricing numerous times. Each staff member you talk to tells you something different. There advertised hours are deceiving, kids can only be seen on fridays and a root canal specialist is only available twice a month. I really liked this dental office when they first opened but recently have had bad experiences.
