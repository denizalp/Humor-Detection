This restaurant has never failed me. It's our go to for special nights out. Yes it's pricey but the food and service make it completely worth it. The waiters are very knowledgeable on the menu and provide wonderful service. \nMy favourite dessert is definitely the chocolate torte. Some other standouts have been the oysters, quail dishes and sea bass. Absolutely everything I've eaten here has been amazing. My favourite restaurant!
