The Hush Puppy on Charleston is so good. We came for our 2 year anniversary last night June 21, 2016 for dinner. Got the all you can eat with boiled shrimp fried shrimp and catfish. Everything was amazing and our waitress Penny was nothing short of a Southern Bell. She even gave us a tour of the restaurant before we left. The hush puppies and honey butter are my favorite. Can't beat the price either $15.95 and it includes a small salad bar. Can't wait to come back.
