One of the best brunches i have ever had. The chicken and waffles were superb but the real winner was the smoked trout avocado toast. Boomers can make fun of us all they want for loving that dish because it was amazing! Drinks were on par and perfect strength for the morning and the entire place was served by happy and entertaining staff. If you spend the morning at West Side Market come here after!
