Had a 2 for 1 entree coupon so what the heck.  I got the seafood fradiavolo that came with the grossest caesar salad in the history of the world.  Just mayo mixed w\/ parmesan...seriously?  \n\nMy wife went with the shrimp scampi.  Both pasta dishes were fine and the shrimp were pretty large.  \n\nI can't imagine I would ever come back here.  It certainly wasn't excellent.  Just ok but there are SO many other Italian places w\/ better food and better prices like Nora's.  Brio is definitely better.
