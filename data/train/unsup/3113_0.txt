While the food is reasonably good, what left a bad taste in my mouth about this establishment is the treatment of staff and customers. While I was there, I saw the woman who I presume to be the owner or manager speak to a delivery driver in a manner that was completely disrespectful and probably illegal. There are also receipts posted in blatant view of the customers which read \"asshole customer\" and so forth. I will likely seek a more ethical business for my next pizza craving.
