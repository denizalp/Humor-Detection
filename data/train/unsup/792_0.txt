I've been to encore beach club several time and today was by far the WORST experience I had. We were at a table we PAID for and I accidentally knocked over an ICE bucket that we PAID FOR! And MULTIPLE men who work for EBC felt entitled to kick me out. IT doesn't take 5 MEN TO MANHANDLED a 4 foot 9, 80 lbs girl out. I've never felt so objectify in my life.
