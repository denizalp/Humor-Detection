Will not go there again.\nWas welcomed by an older rude man (owner?) who told us we could not sit outside when they had seating available. Place was hot and crowded. The waitress seemed to be in such a hurry that when we asked a question regarding an item on menu she looked like she was bothered. Food super salty.  All in all not happy about this one!!!\nYou get what you pay for mind you I feel no matter the cost service is most important!
