Horrible service at the bar. Super slow. Only 1 computer \/ credit card machine for 8+ bartenders. But the servers are idiots - lazy, inattentive, slow, and do things like CARRY CUSTOMER's CREDIT CARDS AROUND IN THEIR MOUTHS, and STICK THEIR FINGERS *inside* the shot glasses after they've poured a shot when they're carrying three shot glasses at once!!\n\nNo draft beer yet.\n\nOUTRAGEOUS HAPPY HOUR PRICING.\n\nNo smoking on the patio, unlike the old location.
