Spent a day of shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter and thought I would pop in for some sushi.  Place was dead but the service was good.  The food is always high quality and fresh.  I sat at the Sushi bar and chatted with the Sushi chef, which was fun considering there was no one else in the joint.  I wish I would have waited a bit longer for the HH prices but over, its good food and good price.
