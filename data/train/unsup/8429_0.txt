This place is BAD. Don't waste your time and money! The cost of the buffet is $23 per person before taxes. The food stations are limited and the selection is very lacking! Priced expensively for what they offer if you ask me. Everything was dry, cold, tasteless and the only flavour to any of it was grease!! In conclusion, there are better restaurants than this for your buck. Seriously, the food court below would have been better. I'm giving it a 2 star because the service, atmosphere and drinks were good.
