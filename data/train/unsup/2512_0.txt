Great price for value. A bit complicated with a shuttle bus to Viscount Station then our  luck that a driver was dropping off a client so we got picked right up.  Three clients were waiting for the one person who was checking people in.  Thirty-five minutes later we had keys in hand! A long process for great savings over the competitors.  Worth our time to save on the final bill.  They have a 59 minute grace period (yes, this still exists at this company) which was another savings for us.
