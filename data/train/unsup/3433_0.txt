I had the misfortune to try some food of theirs at a festival earlier in the semester and I was distinctly disappointed. The spring rolls in particular were very bland and uninteresting. Also the people serving were not friendly, which is odd because many of the reviewers seem to like the service. Given the number of options in uptown now, I don't see any reason to go to this place.
