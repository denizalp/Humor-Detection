Yum. \n\nI love when places surprise you! Brunch is my passion so I am always on the hunt for new spots. I love the Pamela's scene but sometimes you need that bloody mary to hold you off until you can dig into your home fries. \n\nBLOODY MARY BAR, O HEY! \n\nPros: breakfast and booze, huge portions ( I got a side of oatmeal and it was double a meal portion), CHEAP!!!!, Early hours \n\nCons: Parking is a bitch, slower (a huge party sat before us though) \n\nDef will be back for some day drinking
