So much better than we expected. We were passing through and wanted to find something to do with our for year old.  I expected something much smaller. We were pleasantly surprised. For putt putt there's were two courses so there was no bottle necking. The arcade was full of games for all ages, and again well placed. The rides were way more fun than expected. There are rides available for all she groups and the employees all seemed to thoroughly enjoy their jobs.
