I've been going here for almost three years.  I do the monthly plan, I like the atmosphere the therapist for the most part listen and work well to accommodate my needs.  My regular person left so that was a bummer but I still am able to get a nice deep tissue massage at least once a month.  It is a great deal and the facility is neat clean and everyone is friendly.  I've recommended folks to try it if you are looking for a good massage home.
