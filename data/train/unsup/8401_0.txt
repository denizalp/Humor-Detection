This place is the best all you can eat sushi on the north side! I only like Haru sushi chef because he is the only one that knows how to make sushi... I ordered a poke salad from one of the other guys and it had literally 5 dinky pieces of sushi and a handful of seaweed! I ordered it from Haruand my god it was the best poke salad I ever had... Haru is ironchef of sushi tachi!
