MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE. Went to pita Kitchen for the first time today and loved it. My husband and i ordered a few things off the menu to try and everything was hot and fresh. You must try the gyros egg rolls so delicious. If you want to try all their appetizers you can order the Mediterranean sampler and try a little bit of everything. We definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great Middle Eastern food. My family and I will be back real soon!!
