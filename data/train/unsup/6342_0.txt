Hype hype hype hype hype..more hype..\n\nThat's what I thought about Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan. Maybe, I'm spoiled by many great pizza places in Portland, so this one just doesn't do anything for me. We had one slice of the White pizza. It was just ok. It was soooooo greasy. \n\nYes, this place is cheap for Vegas standard and especially for Cosmopolitan standard. Does it worth it to try it? Sure. Does it worth to come back again for it? Probably not.
