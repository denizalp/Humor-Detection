Very nice venue for a wedding, it's got a dance room, outdoor patio with a nice view of the fountain, it is surrounded with lots of trees for shade. If you don't want your guest to sit outside during the summer you can use the dance room, very versatile venue. They also have a separate room for your food, if you want to do buffet style (which my friend did). Wonderful place! So earthy.. To be with nature..
