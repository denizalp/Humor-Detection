Lady took me here on my birthday! The service is amazing. The complementary bread is amazing. Tastes so buttery and melts in your mouth. I think there's too many spoilers already.\n\nIf you get the chance to enjoy Alo, the 5 course (10 total different courses between 2 people), it's filling, I doubt we could handle more than that. \n\nCome for the bread. It's worth the price of admission. Everything else is a bonus. A delicious bonus.
