I've only really been here for concerts & it's a great venue! Lots of grassy space to spread out on, great sound, more than enough parking surrounding the area & lots of restaurants within walking distance. \n\nThere is no shade, so word to the wise, ALWAYS wear your sun screen ;) This is AZ people, even when the sun isn't out, you're gonna toast. It's painful to see the sea of bright red people!
