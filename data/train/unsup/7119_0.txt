Garfield has a collective of art-related establishments on a corridor of Penn Avenue spanning a couple of blocks and Workshop is smack dab in the middle. They offer DIY classes where you can make anything from picture frames and other household items. The sessions or classes often include a snack and beverages; alcoholic and non. Enjoyable outing with friends. It's nice to spend an afternoon creating in such a welcoming space.
