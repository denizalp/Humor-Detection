I'd say middle of the road as far as buffets go.  The usual expansive selection, but I'm more concerned with the quality of the food.  With our $5 off coupon, we paid $15 for a Sunday champagne brunch.  That alone was worth a star considering it was actually tasty champagne.   Another star for the great service from our waitress.  She was awesome.  Last star for the chocolate fountain for fresh strawberries (buffet ettiquette tip: DO NOT try to stick your bowl of ice cream in the chocolate fountain-idiot!).
