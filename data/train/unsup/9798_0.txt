Went here the other day.got there around 2pm not crowded, order a double cheeseburger & onion rings...the onion rings are great the portions  are small..the burger was off the charts juicy, flavorful and I think I'll be going here as often as I can..oh and the servers are nice especially the short brunette that served me ;)
