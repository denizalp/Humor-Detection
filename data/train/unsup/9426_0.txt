Value meals... that's where it's at for cheap eating, as long as you're not looking for healthy.  And egg, biscuits and gravy for $2.  You know it's cheap when your tea costs more then your meal.  \nI wouldn't call it a good meal by any means, but if you're broke on the strip from plugging all your $ into an one armed bandit, it'll fill the hole in your gut (but not your soul... it's a lost cause).\nBut... free wi-fi!  Hard to find on the strip.
