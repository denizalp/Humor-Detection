Well from what I understand its one of the most popular Gay bars in the Scottsdale area.  First of all i am not gay but dont mind traveling around with my friends who are and having a couple of drinks. I ventured into BS West only once but when i was there i was rather dissappointed in the scene.   It was a karoeke night so overcourse there were attempts a singing but mostly just screaching into the microphone.  Not a bad patio area, I hope it has better nights.
