I called today 2\/19\/15 at 2:30pm for an appt. The receptionist was very unfriendly, mumbled her name & wouldn't repeat it. Then, told me the dr was booked until April. I explained that my condition had been going on for awhile & was getting worse & that I need to see a dr soon, not in 6 weeks from now. She didn't care. I said I would have to find another dr, she didn't care about that either. It's nice that the office is so busy & successful, but the care of a patient should be more important.
