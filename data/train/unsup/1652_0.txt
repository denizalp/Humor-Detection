This is a gem in sw Las Vegas. Tropicana and Grand Canyon, just behind In n Out. Arguably the best Mexican restaurant I've eaten at in Las Vegas. Good prices for outstanding food, and the salsa is great! Coming for dinner? Get here early, line is out the door. Very casual with good lunch specials and drink specials.
