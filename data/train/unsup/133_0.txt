ABSOLUTELY HANDS DOWN THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD! \n\nI have purchased numerous things from rc willey including a couch \/ love seat combo for $500 and even through house parties and 2 dogs it is still in amazing condition! \n\nI also recently had a terrible expereince at best buy and immediately went to rc willey and made my purchase at a better price with a better sales man and it took me longer to walk over to the electronics than it did to make my purchase!\n\nI refuse to buy anything from anywhere else from now on!
