They facility is clean and well equipped.  They were able to schedule me within a few hours of calling.  I am glad I called because they were busy!  Surprisingly so for a Wednesday mid-day.  My technician was Venus -- wonderful!  She did exactly as asked and kept checking in with me to be sure everything was ok.  I will definitely use and recommend.
