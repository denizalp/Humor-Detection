I love coming to Lenny's for two reasons. The first reason is that the burgers are awesome and the second reason is that it is right by my work.  It is easy to get in & out of and the service is quick.  \n\nIt is a really cute little burger shop in downtown.  You just go to the cashier and order your food and then a couple minute later your food is ready.  My favorite burger here is the bacon cheeseburger with fries.   \n\nHappy Yelping.
