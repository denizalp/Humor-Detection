I enjoy Wendy's very much and usually don't mind ordering at this location. Today I went through the drive thru at about 12:10 a.m. And was told \"Sorry you missed us, please come back tomorrow at 10 a.m.\" That's why I am only giving this location a 3 star for stating they close at 1a.m. but not actually being open that long.
