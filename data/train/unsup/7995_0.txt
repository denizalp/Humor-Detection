Me and my girlfriends loved this place the service was excellent as was the food\nThe tea time looked wonderful \nAmazing food \nIt was a great lunch spot\n\nVery relaxed atmosphere and yes over priced because it is the Four Seasons \nThe food though is good quality \nWent into the gift shop and went nuts
