One of my staple go-to places for lunch. The food is always great, with high quality, fresh ingredients. The owner is super nice and always remembers what I order. I have tried several different dishes but always find myself going back to the spicy green beans with beef.\n\nDefinitely worth a try if you're looking for something new.
