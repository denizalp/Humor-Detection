The food for brunch is amazing and the bloody Mary bar is great.... But the service is absolutely atrocious.  What's worse is its consistently horrible, it's common knowledge for brunch goers in the area know how bad the service is.  If you do decide to eat here just block a good 1.5\/2 hours out of your day.
