I've only ever been to 2 Gals for breakfast before, which they don't technically do anymore. But it was delicious! They focus more on lunch service now, I believe.  All of the staff is really wonderful and during our meal the chef even came out to make sure everything was good. They really give you the small town feel and they are definitely doing the food right. It's worth the trip to downtown Concord to give this one a try.
