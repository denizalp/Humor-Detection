i love this place! i love its cleanliness, friendliness, and consciousness. First, they understand how to make bulletproof coffee for me. The dense flavor and richness and quality is well in there on your first sip. I came here with my Aunt, and it being situated in Downtown Summerlin, is a win. :) Will probably work here, read here, hangout here in the very near future.
