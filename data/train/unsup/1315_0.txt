This place is great. It has a very bright blue and red sign in the front. Pool tables are always open. The bartender is the nicest person in the world. They have Kirkland water bottles for $1.00, which is great water. The bathrooms are clean. The glasses are clean. The prices are great. You can't ask for anything else. It's clean, honest, a great value, run by people who care. A gem.
