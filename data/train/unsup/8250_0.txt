For whatever reason, my F-250 is attracted to big nails...and I run straight to Jimmy at Big O Tires on Gibson and 215 for help! Jimmy has always been kind and fast to diagnose and fix any problem, while also being open about anything else he observes along the way. The shop is efficiently run, and is clean.\n\nI can honestly say I have never had a bad experience here...it will always be my one-stop tire shop!\n\nI trust them.\n\nThanks, Jimmy!
