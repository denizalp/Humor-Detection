I had the Fish and Chips special today. Loved the Fish but despised the shoe string potatoes. They are simply too hard to eat. Darn little things are hard to grab and dip and don't try eating them with a fork! Fish coating was crispy and the white cod was very fresh. Change the fries and I'm good to go! I had originally given the restaurant 3 stars but increased it to 4 start because the wait service and great attitude of the staff made it a very enjoyable experience. Lynnae was really great! I will be back!
