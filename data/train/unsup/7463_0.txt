All you people are idiots. The lobster game rules and the beers are a buck on wednesday. Yuppy scum with high expectations and 15 percent tips can just stay in and watch a romantic comedy with your turd significant other. The place is a dive and i love it. Its trashy and has all walks of life.....so deal with it.
