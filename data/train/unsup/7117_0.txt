This is my new go to place! Meetings, homework, work, hanging out, anything. The atmosphere here is amazing! It is very calm and relaxed not to mention they have outstanding coffee! Some of the best I've found in North Scottsdale. I wish they were open later! I love late night coffee shops but this place for sure rocks
