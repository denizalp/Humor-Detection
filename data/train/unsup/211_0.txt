It's sad. This useta be a pretty good place. We asked one of the merchants what was up and she said it should bounce back after the Wal-Mart opens. I kinda think a Wal-Mart will really drive this place into the ghetto even more. DO NOT GET PIZZA IN THE FOOD COURT! We got a pie to take home and there was a fuckin PUBE on it! Took it right back. Nasty ass place.
