Found this resort on Trip Advisor while driving to Scottsdale from San Diego. The resort grounds are really nice with big pools that weren't crowded. The staff were very friendly and eager to help with anything we needed. Especially the valet staff. We wanted to go downtown but weren't sure exactly where and they recommended a few places and also used their hotel shuttle to drop us off. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in town.
