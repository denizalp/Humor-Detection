Marino's is a prefect local dive bar. The staff is sparse during the week and it may require you actually belly-upping to the bar rather then the seats near the pool\/darts. BUT they make em the way you like em. I love they pour correctly. \n\nThe bar seats are generally filled with the locals, as they should be. The darts and pool table get a decent amount of use and all work properly. \n\nThe previous posts of the place being dirty are no longer accurate. It is clean and inviting.
