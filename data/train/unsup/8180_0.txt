I can't believe I just tried this place for the first time. I've been going to Prana Bodhi yoga and walk by this place all the time and it never occurred to me to stop in until a friend recommended that I try it. \n\nGreat place to come for manaeesh, my favorite is the zaatar. The bread is perfectly toasted and crisp, just like how grandma used to make. \n\nPrices are unbeatable and so are the flavors! The owner is very friendly. There is street parking available, which shouldn't be a problem. \n\nGo get manaeeeesh!
