Literally the worst experience of my life.  Waited in the most disorganized, chaotic \"line\" (really just hundreds of people pushing, cutting and fighting) for three hours until we couldnt take it anymore and decided to leave.  An absolute nightmare.  And the tickets were nonrefundable so $80 tickets wasted for three hours of a living hell.  I will NEVER be back.
