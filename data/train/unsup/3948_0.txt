Nice building, but I haven't had any stellar experiences here. Just average. Everyone is very polite, but I did have an issue that I was assured I'd get a follow up call about, and I never got the call. When I went in a second time about the same issue, it was taken care of. Parking lot is small although that's the trend in the entire shopping plaza even though it's an extremely busy area.
