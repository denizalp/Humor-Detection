The dinner we had was awesome. Food was delivered super fast and piping hot. \nWe had the General Tsu's chicken, friend rice, noodles and egg drop soup and some egg roles and all tasted fresh. They supplied all sauces and utensils without us asking so All was great. \nNo complaints here at all and we will definitely order again!
