I found them on yelp, and am so glad that I did!\n\nJinia was my stylist and did such an amazing job. I had a pretty dramatic cut (took off about 7 inches, added layers, and add full bangs) which could have easily gone wrong and it looks AMAZING.\n\nI have never really been one to \"spend money\" on my hair, but I wonder if I ever won't again. I will absolutely go back and would recommend them to anyone.\n\nSide note: very cute decor, good music, and fun art.
