I'm not sure exactly how I feel about Blueberry Hill but I do know I always eat breakfast there at least one time when I'm in Vegas. The food is a-ok as are their prices. The palce itself looks like it crawled out of the 80s and no one has done much to it since, including the staff uniforms, silverware, plates, glasses, mugs, etc. What balances that out is the superb service. Every waitress in the past has been a sweetheart, which is refreshing these days. I'll be back next month, Blueberry Hill.
