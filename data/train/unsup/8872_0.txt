Olga did my laser hair removal, and she always made sure that I remembered to take care of my skin afterwards! She was extremely courteous and kept checking to make sure that the laser wasn't set too high for me. \nThe office is always clean, never anything out of place.\nThe only downside for me is that this place is all the way across town for me, and is quite a drive.
