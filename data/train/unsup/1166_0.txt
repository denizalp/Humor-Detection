My wife is a huge fan of this place and she was eager to share it with me.  The great food, the service, and music add up to an experience that one will remember.  We arrived for a late dinner and were seated promptly.  The design is quite unique, giant, umbrella-like contraptions  allow for outdoor seating when it rains. The  walls and the foliage definitely make one feel like one is dining in a garden. \n\nThe sounds of a jazz quartet waft through a the beautiful night and  definitely cap a romantic evening.\n\nHighly recommended. We would totally go back.
