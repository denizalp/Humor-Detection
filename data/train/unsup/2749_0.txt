I was just told by an Associate that I need to be a member in order to spend my morning net at the Pizza Kitchen. I've never had this happen and I've seen others (who don't appear to be members) purchase from the Pizza Kitchen. \n\nCostco, please streamline your message to ALL Costco Stores! Absolutely unacceptable.
