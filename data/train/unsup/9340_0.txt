This Starbucks is located inside the SuperTarget at Steele Creek and South Tryon. They do a pretty good job of maintaining the Starbucks brand with the usual drinks and snacks that you might expect. And they no accept the Starbucks Rewards scans. Bonus!\n\nStill, it's inside the store rather than being a standalone.
