Not bad. I judge most of my Mexican restaurants by their chips and salsa followed by their sauces. \n\nThe service here was great! Friendly and fast. The food was... well good Mexican not the best MexiCAN not Mexican't, just average. I do like the option to get a sandwich for the picky eaters in the family. Decent vegetarian menus but what Mexican place doesn't offer one? \n\nIf you're in the area stop by but I wouldn't go out of my way...
