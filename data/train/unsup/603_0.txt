A little gem in a strip mall in Ahwatukee.  They're seriously lacking in ambiance but they have great specialty rolls and fantastic lunch specials.  I like the california, cucumber and tuna roll for $8.50.  It comes with salad (with yummy sesame dressing) and miso soup.  My husband is a huge sushi snob and he'll even come here (though it's not his favorite, but like I said, he's a sushi snob).  Their menu is extensive and has lots of choices for the non sushi lovers like katsu (panko breaded and fried meat) and ramen. There's a little something for everyone.
