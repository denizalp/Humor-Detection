I've only been here a couple of times because the rest of the time I tried to eat here they were randomly closed. Nonetheless, the food is great and you can really taste the freshness and LOVE in the food. Even if you're vegetarian or whatever you want to label it. It's still a pretty good spot. They only have one big table that is shared amongst whoever is dining it there. Cash only though!
