My husband has been a patient of Dr. Sielicki's for 15 years now! When we were engaged in 2013, I became a patient, as I was not happy with my dentist at that time. I have been very happy that I made the switch to Sonoran Dental. The entire staff - Andrea, Irma, Kim, etc. are wonderful professionals who truly care about their patients. Dr. Sielicki is such a superb dentist, and she has kept our smiles sparkling!
