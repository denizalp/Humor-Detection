Excellent view if you get a window seat. It really makes the experience much better.\n\nThe food is good... I'd hope so, given it's so overpriced!!!! Definitely better than the food at the CN tower, but I wasnt wowed!! Best place to go if you can expense your meal!!!\n\nBig disappointment - this is a top-notch restaurant and it still doesnt have their own in-house sparkling water. What the heck!! Most high class restaurants serve their own sparkling water now, doing their part for the environment and offer better tasting sparking water at reasonable price. What a let down!!!
