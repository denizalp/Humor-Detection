This is probably one of my fave sushi places downtown! Decently priced, food is amazing and it's walking distance from the office!\n\nYou have to come around 11:30, it's set up cafeteria style so the tables fill up really quick.\n\nI usually get the teriyaki chicken and tempura bento box and order some sushi on the side, you're pleasantly full for just under $15 (a rarity for places downtown!)\n\nPlus they have a frequent customer card, so after 7 stamps you get a free meal!
