I'm Indian, y'all. Trust me.\n\nI came here for a weekday lunch buffet and was rather pleased. They had a good variety of items to suit different dietary needs - lamb, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, raita, tomato soup, fried zucchini, etc. I was avoiding gluten when I came here, but I had a lot of choices. Their saag paneer is second to none... and I've had a lot of saag paneer in my day!\n\nService was friendly and laid back. Lunch was $17 after tax and tip, which is pretty standard for the King Street strip. I dig this joint!
