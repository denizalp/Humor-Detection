Dim Sum in Vegas is a great thing.\n\nProblem is these idiots don't know how to sit people in order. Stood in line for 30 mins while people behind was seated first because they had bigger parties. First come first serve numb nutts.\n\nFood was decent, but shu mai never came our way wtf?\n\nThey should call this place Ping Pang Pow, because I was about to slap the dam mgr upside his fat head.\n\nI gave a 20% tip anyways, our server was ok and I am not a monster.
