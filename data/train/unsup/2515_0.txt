Daisy Mountain coffee roasters opened a new coffee house in the Tramonto marketplace and it is awesome!  It is locally owned and operated by a family that has a passion for coffee.  They use an in-house roaster which master roaster Al, the owner, uses to create different blends of coffee.  They are all great!  \n\nThey also serve breakfast and lunch with plenty of good eats to choose from.  They also have teas, smoothies and other drink options as well.  \n\nIt's a great new coffee house especially for the neighborhood area.  I hope to see you there someday soon.
