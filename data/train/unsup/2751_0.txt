Beer selection is best in town and this is my local, but we rolled through for an after-work pint tonight and found out they no longer have TSN or Sportsnet. Not sure what's going on but it's ridiculous. \n\nEnded up at Belfast Love to enjoy some local craft beer with the game on. \n\nBring back the sports, Barhop!
