Had lunch here today and there wasn't much that stood out.  It's right next to the Chandler Mall Harkins, so we decided to stop by.  The burger I ordered was good enough (the classic) but the fries were sub-par and were limp, un-salted, and flavorless.  My sister's swiss-mushroom burger was super greasy (the bun was soaked and dripping wiith grease)... looked gross.  Their chocolate milkshake we all shared, we agreed, was tasty and thick...\n\nIt was OK for me.. nothing that was special or unique eating here for me.
