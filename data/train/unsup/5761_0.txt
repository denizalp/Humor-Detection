Came in alone, instantly scored a seat at the bar upstairs. The bartender\/server was very attentive. I ordered the kimchi in a jar and the extremely spicy noodles. Both were hot and lived up to my chili head expectations. I was feeling a bit stuffed up before my meal but afterwards I was breathing clearly. I really liked this place and it's vibe. I will be back next time I'm in Toronto.
