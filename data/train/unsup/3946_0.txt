RATING FOR CATERED FOOD:\n\nWent to a health seminar that was catered by Spoonful. Menu included: fried rice, chow mein (thin noodles), fried chicken, shrimp tempura, sweet and sour pork and mixed steamed veggies. Visually appealing, fast food quality Chinese food with less oil and less seasoning. Nothing stood out as amazing but it was free so I can't complain. My friend was disappointed because they didn't have sushi; she says they have really good sushi.
