This restaurant came highly recommended, however, customer service needs much improvement!  The food was really tasty, but the service was less than desirable.  Our server made a point of letting us know that there would be a 20% gratuity added since we were a party larger than 5 & that there was no splitting of checks!  Seriously?!!!  With all of modern technology, what is the big deal in splitting the check?  It's a shame because the food was really good, but we will NOT be coming back due to the poor customer service!
