The omelet I ordered had 12 eggs in it. It was huge! The place is full of color glitz and glam. Huge bar with a fire pit and lush carpeting and drapery. This place is fun exciting brilliant and very delicious tasting. I absolutely loved the atmosphere and I would recommend this place to any beauty that wants fun food. It's a  hangover's dream. \nFull bar and hot wait staff. Pink electricity. The lights throughout glowed as I ate. Fast pace food finders dream. Love the DINNER. amazing, UPSCALE VEGAS FEEL.
