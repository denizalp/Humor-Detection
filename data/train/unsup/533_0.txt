We sat outside on a beautiful day. \n\nI ordered some plain two egg special. The hash browns were drenched in butter. The eggs were okay. Bacon is what kept me pushing on. \n\nMy husband had the pancakes. They were delicious. It reminded me of funnel cake because it had some crisp to it. I don't know how they did it but it was good. \n\nService was good. I'd come back for the service. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have the people watching of the strip there.
