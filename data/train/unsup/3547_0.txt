We checked in for three nights with two comp tickets to the 2015 Miss Universe what an exciting night! Steve Harvey was the host and slipped up and announced the winner as Miss Columbia when in fact it was to go to Miss Philippines.  What a huge mistake, people were so upset.  We were told to accept the apology and leave but, people were shocked and weren't leaving.
