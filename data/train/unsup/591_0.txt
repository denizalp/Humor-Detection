I'm a serial mover and I've used a lot of different moving companies over the years. Christopher Moving is one of the best experiences I've ever had. They returned my initial call promptly, set an appointment for the next day and had a quote to me immediately. They packed everything beautifully and moving day was organized and on schedule. John, Marvin and the Steves made me laugh and remember to breathe and Cameron, Wilber and Alex figured everything out. Amazing job. See you in 12 months!
