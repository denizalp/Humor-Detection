I went here for brunch with the family! \n\nThe food was great, the portions were large, everyone was very pleased!\n\nI got the All Day Breakfast, my partner got the Trucker's Special (with extra sides!), and the other people at our table got the Mexican Benny or the Eggs Natasha. It didn't feel too greasy, the pancakes were fluffy, the coffee was good. Happy eaters all round.\n\nWe would definitely return!
