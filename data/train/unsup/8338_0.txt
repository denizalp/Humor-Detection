Ok, Lynn...I know you read these reviews and I'm not going to leave one until you contact me. I left you a message on Facebook. Yes, had to use social media. Please contact me ASAP! This phone tag\/answering service\/no show has to end. You scheduled a time for a second install today from 12-3pm. NO ONE SHOWED nor CALLED! I called, have cell records to prove and no one returned my calls. Let's get this job completed and per your contract. Thank you! Marlo V.
