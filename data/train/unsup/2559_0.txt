Had an extremely stressful week of traveling and was very grateful to have  found Tatyana. I have had many massages before and think that this one is up there with the best. The massage was very relaxing and helped me lose the stress I had been experiencing. I went with a body scrub and massage and next time I am in the area would drive to see her for a repeat. Very comfortable table, lightning and music. I highly recommend!
