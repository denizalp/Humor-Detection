First time trying this place. At the beginning of the line seemed normal but within five minutes it seem like we're getting backed up.  They didn't have it quite organized for the seating as both lines were complaining about the wait.\nWhen we first approach the food and the sign is the not match the food but I noticed the lady trying to fix them. Maybe we got there st sign changing time. Had a variety but cramped in dining area. Our waitress Ebony was most helpful.
