Disgusting! This place serves huge chunks of fatty meat to mostly the Phillipino community. I couldn't imagine a more unhealthy option. Did I mention a salad consists of just iceberg lettuce and a few shredded splinters of carrots? \n\nAlso I got ID'd for a 3 dollar debit card charge. Are you serious?? I refused to show ID and left! What a joke!
