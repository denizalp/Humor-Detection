This is the place designed specifically for the young, hip crowd. Something which I am not. It is where the stockbroker who makes $500,000 per year takes his $450\/hr escort.\n\nThe place is gorgeous with a pink neon bar, open stairwell, and hot waitresses. The food I had was far too salty to be edible.
