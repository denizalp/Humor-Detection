We love this place! If you like spicy you must try their beef satay soup - totally original and not like most other places where it's just regular pho with a satay sauce added to it. \n\nAlso really love their grilled lemongrass chicken - so so so very tender!\n\nI'm actually shocked this place is only reviewed at 3 stars now.
