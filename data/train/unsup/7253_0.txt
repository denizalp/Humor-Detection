I stumbled across this store on my way to Nest.  They are right next door to each other.  I love, love, love the furniture here.  It is very expensive, very high quality and very traditional.  The store is small, but it jammed packed full of furniture and fine accessories.  I have been looking for a classic design floor lamp and they had some real impressive designs.  I also liked several of their wall mirrors as well as buffet lamps.  Nice artwork.  They also employee professional designers to guide you in designing your perfect new room.
