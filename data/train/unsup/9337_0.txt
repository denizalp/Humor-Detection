I try to stop here on a regular basis for ice coffee on my way to work. I am usually here between 8:45-9:00am. No matter how long the line is, it always moves pretty quick. If I had to give a few tips to this particular McDonalds I would not know what to say. I think this place runs better than any Mickey Ds I have ever been to. Trust me I have been to many. If you decide to go here and the line is long, don't worry. The line will move quicker than you think.
