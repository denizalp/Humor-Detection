Sweet Thang pushes the edge of the sweet envelope.  The decor is sweet, the size is sweet, and the menu is sweet as.... well.... sweet as sugar.\n\nSo many have said that a cupcake is a cupcake, but there are things that set these cupcakes apart.  They decorate them so sweetly, it almost sends you into a sugar coma.  My red velvet cupcake had marzipan decorations, and one of my other cupcakes had fondant icing.\n\ntoo cute... i loved it!
