What do you do in a failing economy next to a failing mall? You blow up the old Benigens and open a new TX Roadhouse. ??\n\nI think I saw Patrick Swayze there too? j\/k\n\nThe service was nice a tad slow but nice. The food was good, prices were good.\n\nI had the pork sandwich which did not disappoint. In fact if fed me and my kid. The free bread is better with the normal butter not the flavored one. IMO\n\nThe do an annoying yet entertaining dance thing every 1\/2 hr or so.. it was fun to watch the first time.
