First experience here. This is a place for young 20 year olds. It's been years since I did this type of scene. We went out for our daughters 21st Birthday.\n\nBottom floor is nice a cool and cozy until it gets packed. That's when it's difficult to move around.\n\nThe roof bar you have to get their early else it's a line to get upstairs. When you arrive it's hot and packed. It could be more like Sienna Mercatto.\n\nNice experience.
