If you are a fan of Kabuto, this is definitely a place to try! If you never tried Kabuto, this place is more worthy to try. Every details of sushi and course selection are perfect and extraordinary. \nOther than the superb quality of food, i just hope they improve their interior decoration to be more authentic and classic japanese style. \nBottom line, I highly recommend this place.
