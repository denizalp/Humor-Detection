I did not use this company's service, however a neighbor did.  They began pouring concrete at 6:25am - which is too early.  The cement truck woke me and my 16 month old child up.  When I confronted them the owner knew they couldn't start before 7am but told me to call the police and have them give him a ticket anyway.  That is not a respectable way to present yourself to your customer's neighbors, or to anyone, when you are clearly in the wrong and you know it.  That reflects on character.
