We have gone to the Hub twice a week for almost 3 months and we are usually 10 or 12 people. We all agree that none of us have ever had a bad meal or bad service. The food is consistently delicious and they serve meals that are not on every menu at all the other restaurants. I would recommend The Hub to anyone. It's a great restaurant all around.
