Let's just say this. Should you be one of the multitudes that needs to deal with the Tempe Po Po, they have a nice, clean place and I got served promptly and politely by really nice staff that assisted me without any stress. \nNuff said. Don't mess with these guys, or their parking meters. They mean business.
