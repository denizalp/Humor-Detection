What happened? Since it's under new management the service and quality of food has gone way down. Very uncomfortable sitting down trying to enjoy a meal while the servers sit on the other side of you cursing and eating their non-restaurant food. I use to enjoy their Rock shrimp and now they cut three shrimps into fours and still charge you the full price for it.  What shame I won't suggest this place to anyone!
