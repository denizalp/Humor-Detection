If I could rate this place with no stars I would. Had the worst experience. They are scaming customers. Be ware!! Had my car \"fixed\" but not really, got a second opinion and to my suprise was charged for labor and  parts that were never replaced. When complained with parts they had replaced and asked to verify they said they dont keep record or documentation of such parts. Keep away they dont diagnost correctly and try to replace parts which do not even need to be replaced just to make money.
