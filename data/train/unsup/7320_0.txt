Dana Realty Group rocks! You can tell from your first encounter with them that they are very knowledgable people and know exactly what is going on in the Real Estate field.  Brent and Wendi make an awesome team and are by far the most honest and friendly real estate agents I have ever dealt with. They definitely go out of their way to help you in the process. For me buying my first house was a scary thing and they walked me through it step by step. I highly recommend them! Thanks Dana Realty Group!
