Very friendly staff, who were very informative and eager to help. I only gave it 4 stars because I really like more sides with my sandwiches, and sauces, I also am veg so would prefer more veggie options. With that said, the falafel sandwich was AMAZING! Probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, I will definitely be returning.
