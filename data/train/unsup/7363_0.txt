I honestly don't get why people go crazy for this food.  Cheap, overcooked, smelly seafood served in a plastic bag?  It's really disgusting.  I was sweating garlic out of my pores for a week.  You have to peel the crawdads and shrimp, which is fine, more flavor up in there that way, but it's so overcooked the meat turns to mush and your fingers will stink of farm-raised crawfish from god-knows-what southeast asian cesspool and garlic for days.\n\nBleccch.\n\nDon't know why I went back.
