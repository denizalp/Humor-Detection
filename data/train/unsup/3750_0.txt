Across town for us but I was in the neighborhood and decided to check it out! It was fantastic! What a great breakfast spot! The staff was truly warm and so gracious and welcoming. We said it was our first time and we got wonderful detailed recommendations and they were so yummy!!\nI had The Goombah breakfast sandwich and it was so perfect! Great flavor and the bread was so soft and yummy! We will definitely return! \nThank you!
