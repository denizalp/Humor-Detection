I spent New Year's Eve here. It was like... the coolest New Year's ever. This is the exact type of place I imagined making my hangout when I moved to Toronto. The red velour-y wallpapered walls, the old couches that create an awesome little \"lounge\" at the back, the mirrors, the lighting, literally everything about this place made me go \"OH MY GOD, THIS PLACE IS TOO COOL FOR ME.\"
