Michelle came by on a Friday to check out our situation.  We had an estimate by Sunday via email and she was here that following Thursday to do the work.  Of all the people we've had come to our home to do work Michelle was far and away the best in every category.  She arrived at 10am (as scheduled) and was done before 4pm with everything.  The most pleasant experience I've had.  I cannot recommend her enough.
