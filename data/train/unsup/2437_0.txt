Waited in line for about 10mins on a Saturday night and one of the bouncers were walking up and down the line eyeing our group the whole time. Once we got to the start of the line to get in, the bouncer switches spots with the bouncer checking the IDs and denies my friend entry because his drivers license photo has a different \"jaw line\" than what he looks like....he even showed him his health card and credit card too.\n\nOverall, bouncers here are racist and I don't recommend going.
