I am a ramen lover.\nI live in California and I love to drive to Little Tokyo for their ramen.\nWell.. While visiting Vegas I have to say this place is a must!\nI ordered the Tonkatsu Shoyu ramen and it is delicious!! I ate everything that came in the bowl and also slurped up that broth.\n\nThe wait IS long but I won't deduct stars for the parking\/wait line. \n\nThe food is well worth the wait.
