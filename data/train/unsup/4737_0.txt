Best Vietnamese sandwiches ever! Cheap too (bring cash). I have had almost all the sandwiches, and they are all good, but roast pork is the best. Also, try the pate chaud (baked buns with meat inside) and the steamed buns! Me, my wife, and kids love them both! I also really enjoy the honey chrysanthemum tea! You can get a ton of food for cheap and its awesomely delicious!!!!!
