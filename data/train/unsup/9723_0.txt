I tried going in once when they first opened and was confused and over whelmed and left immediately... However, I was pregnant so that may have been my bad.  \nWent back with a friend post baby and it was great! I appreciate the counter service and their food is healthy, quality and yummy. Staff was very nice. Great, clean and a unique concept.
