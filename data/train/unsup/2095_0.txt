I have been an internet customer of LV.Net since February of 2012 and I am so glad to finally have found a no hassle, customer-friendly, internet provider here in Henderson. I currently have their 25mbps download and  5mbps upload plan and find it more than meets my needs as a  remote worker and multi device TV streamer and I've yet to experience  any service  interruptions.\nLV. Nets rebates are comparable with other internet companies but with so many added bonuses, such as 24 hour support, user friendly portal and people that actually will listen to me and care.
