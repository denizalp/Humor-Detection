I stopped in this morning to pick up a few dozen bagels for my coworkers. The manager saw me carrying out multiple boxes of bagels and offered to help me and walked them out to my car. It was a simple gesture that really brightened my day. Thanks Einstein for providing great service beyond what is expected!
