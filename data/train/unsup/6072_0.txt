Seeing amazing pieces of neon art that were going to be destroyed, BUT HAVE BEEN SAVED FOR POSTERITY by the Las Vegas Neon Boneyard.\n\nKudos!\n\nPersonal faves: The Lamp from Aladdin's and the Silver Slipper's silver slipper.\n\n\nTOURING HINT: Bring a parasol if you go during the heat of the day. Everything is outdoors with very little shade.
