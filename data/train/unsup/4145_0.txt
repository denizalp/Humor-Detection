I picked my girlfriend up from the service center at Toyota down the street. We caught up while working at OHSO. She loves their mimosas, it's a pretty generous pour in a large glass. \n\nThe service was great, nice open area, free WiFi, the food is pretty good. We had some small appetizers and a salad. I would come back for a proper meal although I believe they are better known for their extensive selection of beers.
