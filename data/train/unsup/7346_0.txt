Very peaceful and possitive atmosphere,  This is are second time here, living in California. Every time we come to Las Vegas we just have to stop here. The sushi was fresh. My fianc√©e loves this place. Great service are waiter was very attentive and helpful both times that we've been here. The rolls are amazing. The parking situation could be a little hectic.
