It's true that this is a little store front that only sells frozen dumplings but they are quite good and good size. If you speak Chinese it is easier but the lady will help you if you don't. I liek the pain fried dumpling the best, then her soup dumplings although they are a bit small and then her boiled dumplings bc their wrapper is quite thick. \n\nWould go back to buy more pan fried ones in the future.
