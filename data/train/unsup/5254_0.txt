Rehab was a first and last for us. The online reviews were misleading in my opinion. No seating\/chairs aside from reserved cabanas. A typical, 32 oz. mixed cocktail is $41.00. We stayed at Hard Rock and were admitted for free, had we paid, I would've been unhappy at best. If you don't mind cloudy pool water and an urban crowd that gets their thrills from drunken attempts at twerking, you may enjoy it. Music was decent.
