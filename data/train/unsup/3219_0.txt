This is a great place to watch a football game in a rowdy, loud and fun environment. It's an epic college sports bar with a legacy I'm sure. \nThat being said, I expected cheese curd glory to happen here and it didn't. I guess my standard are a little higher no longer being in college and having a more refined palate when it comes to beer, food and libations. State street has a lot to offer I guess I just need to continue on until I find the right fit.
