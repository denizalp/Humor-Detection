Fantastic smoked meat sandwiches and awesome poutine to go along with the sammys. The smoked sandwiches are on deli bread and mustard nothing else, accompanied with some pickles on the side. Nothing too fancy but packed with flavor. Their is a very hospitality vibe about this restaurant that makes you feel welcomed.
