By far the best Ramen I've ever had. The base is called a \"white broth\" and looks as though there might be cream or milk in it, and I've never had better. I love Ramen and have taken it upon myself to try as many places in Toronto as possible, but I can't help returning here time and time again. My favourite is the beef ramen. Always perfectly cooked with tender meat and crisp beansprouts. This is my ideal comfort food.
