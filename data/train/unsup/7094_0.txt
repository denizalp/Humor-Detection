Very disappointed in this place. \nHas gotten ghetto and dirty. \nThere was an altercation with 2 guys where it broke out into a big agreement\nAnd THE STAFF DID NOTHING.\nI talked to one of the guys and he said\nThey didnt do anything because it wasn't their problem\nIT'S YOUR GYM!\nAVOID coming here. \nToo many little kids \"working out.\"\nWeights left all over. \nGhetto ppl\nBut it's now only 10 bucks to sign up\nSo I shouldn't be surprised.
