I had reserved a uhaul van the night before for first thing in the morning. I wasn't sure that they would have it ready. When I arrived early they were already open and ready for business. They had my reservation in the system and my van ready to go. The process was flawless and the employees were top notch.  The same goes for the return process  You no longer have to go back inside for the return. The employee uses his smart phone to check your rental back in and email you the receipt. Just awesome.
