For a chain restaurant, I really love this place.  It was recently updated so it is really clean and tidy.  The wait staff is really helpful.  The new menu has the calories listed and our server, Gregory, even looked up the calories in my garlic bread when I asked if it was included in the calorie count for my meal.  It is never busy so they get to us immediately.  They are really patient with kids, who can be rowdy or want to order for themselves.  Plus kids eat free with adult purchases!
