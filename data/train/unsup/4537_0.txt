I walked into this store on a Saturday afternoon and the place was pretty empty. I want to say there were more employees than folks shopping.\n\nThe store isn't that big. The jewelry section is separated from the rest. \nPurses are up front.\n\nI love the purses and the jewelry is very beautiful. \nMy favorites included a baby blue Chanel purse and a beautiful Chanel y-shaped necklace with drop down earrings. I'd never seen those styles before. Super lovely & elegant.\n\nSmall store, nice selections.
