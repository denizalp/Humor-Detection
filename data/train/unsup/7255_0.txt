Paramount is okay. Bear in mind that they're trying to have mass appeal, so their flavours are generally milder than real Lebanese food. Many people like Paramount for that reason however, and it's a safe choice for groups - moreover this location is nicely decorated. They use fairly good ingredients too, so the food is still enjoyable, albeit unspectacular.
