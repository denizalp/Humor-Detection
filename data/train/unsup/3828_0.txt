Gotta love your foodie friends!! \nA friend of mine recommended this place and who would have thought i would eat the best ramen in the planet in Vegas?!!\n\nHere the reviews:\n\n-Ambience: place is tiny but cute inside.\n\n-Service: waitress was nice and friendly.\nThere is always a line outside.\nI went 2:30pm so it wasn't that busy.\n(Smart move)\n\n*Miso ramen ($7.25)\nOne of the best ramens ever!! \nThe broth has something i cant express in words and the char siu!! Mmmm!! Just by typing this i want to go back again!!!\n\nOverall, every time i am in Vegas, this will be my MUST stop! \n#happybelly #iaminlovewiththisplace
