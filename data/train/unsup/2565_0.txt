Customer service was great! Our server Brittany was very attentive but not overly so. My sirloin was supposed to be cooked at a medium, however it was almost completely well done. Since we waited so long to eat I just sucked it up and ate it instead of waiting. The side of \"fresh vegetables\" which I ordered for all three of my kids was fresh STEAMED veggies. Had I know they were steamed we would have chosen different sides. I'd still go back for their rolls and butter but probably wouldn't be my first choice for a steak.
