Very helpful staff.  \n\nThe store is as great as every other Banana Republic but this one was ridiculously hot inside.  When you're selling $100 sundresses in an outdoor shopping mall in the nations hottest state, why would you want to skimp on the A\/C?  Let you customers cool off while they shop and before they try on your clothes and wipe their sweat all over the inside of them.
