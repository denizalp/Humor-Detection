This restaurant has gone from a 4 star to a one star in a year.  Our waitress deserves the star but the food was horrible.  Lobster salad should be taken off the menu.  It had no flavor at all.  So disappointing! Will not go back again.  What a shame...beautiful location!  Understanding it's under a new management.  Get a new chef.  Change your menu also.
