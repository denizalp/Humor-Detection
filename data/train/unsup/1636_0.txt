We were greeted courteously by the staff.  However, our waitress wasn't friendly.  We felt rushed, perhaps the tone set by her as she scurried from table to table.  Not a comfortable ambiance.  My wife had the San Francisco Eggs Benedict and I the meat loaf.  Both meals were delicious.  As good as the meals were however, we'll likely consider another before returning.
