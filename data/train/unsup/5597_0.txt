I have not seen Blue Sky Pest Control in my home since April of this year and here we are August. It was my understanding that they were to come out every three months to treat. I tried calling the number several times on the card provided to us. Cannot get anyone to answer the phone. I'm not happy with them at this point. I still continue to see critters inside the house. Unless someone calls me back today, we will discontinue using them which is a shame because they came highly recommended to us by a friend.
