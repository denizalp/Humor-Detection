This place is the best. It's not so good for clothes but it's in a cool old airplane hangar, the upstairs floor is pretty creaky and you're scared you'll fall through but the inside is a painted mural of trees and the sky and I kind of wish I lived there. Things are organized pretty well and there are cute little itemized rooms and sections for everything. A lot of my favorite things have come from here.
