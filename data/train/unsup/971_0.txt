When I walked in and saw that they make the pizza in front of you, I thought it would be mediocre, like subway pizza. NOT THE CASE!! This was one of the best pizzas I've ever had!! We sat outside and the atmosphere was great. The had the friendliest guy ever working in there. He made the experience so much fun. I'll definitely go back next time I'm in charlotte!!
