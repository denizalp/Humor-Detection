Shades of blue!  \n\nFinally arrived after all these years that this place has been opened! \n\nThis reminds me of the nightclub that would be for Chase bank because all I was seeing was glowing and flashing of blue hues!\n\nDJ wasn't all that great that night and the stairs were killers.  DJ makes it or breaks it in terms of music. Space was adequate, but small and centered dance floor. \n\nThe Hakkasan restaurant in SF is much better and tastier in terms of food, brand name and ambiance.
