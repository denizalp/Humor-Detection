Man do they have options! I tried to get things that I wouldn't be able to get such as perogy. Of course I got the traditional as well and I have to say, it hits the spot! Thankfully there's a location by the area I'm staying in bed this will be the last Canadian meal before leaving the states! Give it a go! It's poutine!!
