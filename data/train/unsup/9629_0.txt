No matter what time you go in, it is always slow. 4 people in the drive thru and you spend 15 minutes waiting for your order. Go inside and it takes 20 minutes to be acknowledged. Tonight we ordered a sundae and a blizzard in the drive thru. The kid (quiet voice, corn rows) repeated both items and only handed us one, look at the receipt, he only charged for the sundae. Sat there for a few more minutes to get the blizzard, he refused to come near the window until we pulled forward.
