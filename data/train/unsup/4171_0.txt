By far one of the best massages I've had and with all of the back and neck problems I've had MANY massages over the years let alone months. Crystal was amazing and applied the perfect pressure to relieve ALL of my pain which is a first for many months. Thanks so much and I can't wait to stop back in when I'm back in town!!!!!
