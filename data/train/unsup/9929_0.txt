Meh.  For people who have shopped in Asia, this is like a desert and I don't mean desert oasis.  Its ok and nothing more.  The only thing that I will say is that they have a good selection of womens' cosmetics and the sunglasses section is acceptable.  Clothing is a big meh for me at this location.
