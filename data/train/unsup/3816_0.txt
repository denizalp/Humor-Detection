It's just a big man cave. Shut your trap and chug some $3, 25 oz. drafts while you spend your Sunday watching the game. The selection ain't fancy, but the seating is nice. When I watch my team kick some ass, I need nothing more than a mug and some elbow room.\n\nIf you need to light up, there's a little patio by the front. This place is chill.
