24 hour bakery?  Um..yes, please!  Expensive, but if you select carefully then you win.\n\nBUY:\n- Napoleon\n- Salted caramel brownie\n- Palmier (aka: elephant ears)\n- rosemary lemon iced tea\n\nCONSIDER:\n- tarts\n- little fudge like squares (some are better than others)\n\nPASS:\n- chocolate croissants (dry & kinda stale)\n- macarons \n\nAs you can see, I did a lot of market research for you guys.  Not 'cuz I'm a total fatty, but for Yelp.  Yeahhh..............
