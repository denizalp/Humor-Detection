So here's the thing. I don't eat raw fish, or even a lot of cooked fish, in the landlocked state of Arizona. I know it's imported, but it's just not for me. So the mere fact that I even went for sushi is a g-damned miracle. Go for the great happy hour. Mushroom appetizer is the best of the menu. And hot sake for $5...you'll be lit up in no time. Don't eat too much...bloat city!
