Chicago Pizza is the best. Good food at good prices. Ordering pizza for the family won't break the bank here. Cashiers don't show too much enthusiasm, but it's to be expected with the high volume of business they do. I still find their pizzas good. I always order to go,  and the wait time is average, considering they're making your pizza fresh.
