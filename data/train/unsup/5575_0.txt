We really like this place. The staff are friendly and courteous, the doctor is also friendly and very good! My son doesn't like going to the dentist except for this one.  The doctor helped him overcome his sensitive gag reflex! Their place is clean with a homey and welcoming environment. they serve free coffee! I would recommend this place.
