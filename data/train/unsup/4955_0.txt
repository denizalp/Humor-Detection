Decent, that's all I'll say. Great lunch deals, but the pad Thai is good and they give great portions. However, I just wish that they had a better ambiance in the restaurant and nicer employees. That's why I stick to take out, I really would rather not sit in there. It's kind of drab. That's just my opinion though.
