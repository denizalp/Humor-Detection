Amazing place, a friend suggested and we loved it, not only was the food delicious but we were very impressed with the server, was very attentative and very helpful.  The spinach ravioli was delicious and the scallops dish was excellent.  Had the chocolate cake for dessert and unfortunately it did not match the quality of the place would not reccomend.
