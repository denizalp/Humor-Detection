I finally tried this place and honestly it tastes like other good gelato shops.  The hassle of the parking lot and rude drivers just gives me anxiety.  I'd rather not get stressed out before I try to enjoy dessert.   The next time I eat at La Grande Orange I might stop in for dessert but I don't see myself making a special trip.
