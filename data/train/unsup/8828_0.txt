Went here for lunch. Not many young people were eating here but the atmosphere was great. I had the trainwreck sandwich. It was loaded with meat and the bread was freshly made. Everyone else in my party had a gourmet burger and everything was devoured. My husband said when his family comes to visit he will be taking them here.
