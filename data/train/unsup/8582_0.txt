I had a very frustrating brunch at DT Bistro. \n\nThe menu is out of date. I ordered a Nicoise salad with seared tuna, which apparently is no longer available. The server didn't speak a word of English and was unable to relay this to me, and so I was served a thai mango salad with seared tuna. \nVery frustrating.  The Nicoise salad should be crossed off the menu.  I wasn't looking for substitutions I did not order.
