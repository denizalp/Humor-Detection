I'm not trying to defend this store or anything cause it is ghetto but I mean it's not always the store's\/employee's fault. I mean, look at the neighborhood it's in...look at the people who shop at this specific Kmart...the answer is in itself right there. People let their kids run amuck pulling things off shelves, ruining things, not putting things back where they found them, damaging product and not paying for it...people are the REASON the store looks so sh!tty in the first place!\nSo really ask yourself...are you SURE the store is ghetto...or is it just the PEOPLE??? Hmmm??????
