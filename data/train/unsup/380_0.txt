SHOPPERS. I'm on to you!!!!! I go here literally 3-4 times a week to buy milk, club soda and household supplies. Their \"sales\" on club soda 12 packs are BOGUS. One week it will be on sale for $3.33, then another it will be on \"sale\" for $5.... \n\nHowever, the girls at the Post Office in the back are awesome. They are super nice and patient and answer all the dumb mailing questions I have.
