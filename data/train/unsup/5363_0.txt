I love the flavor of original KFC chicken!\nHowever, the size of the chicken varies from each location. Sometimes they are huge like a turkey and sometimes like a sparrow. It's a luck of the draw. More often than not. Wish they'd change their recipe for biscuits too, they are so dry and flavorless! Church's have the best biscuits.\nI sometimes get the chicken at KFC then go to Church's for the biscuits. Pain in the a$$.
