I don't understand what all the negative reviews are about! I've always had great customer service & good cleaning especially for the price! If I have a very expensive, limited edition item, I don't bring them to a $2.00 cleaners... I use a more expensive specialty cleaners for speciality items, but my husband & I have had nothing but good experiences with our basic, work laundry & dry cleaning items... They even did a good job with our comforters...
