The food is very good. The texture and taste of their pastry is amazing and all gluten free.  I shared the 2 different macaroon I bought. We thought they were the best macaroon we have ever had. It was a pleasure to find this cafe in my neighborhood. I went during their new later hours and still found plenty of goodies to choose from.
