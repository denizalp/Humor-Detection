please.... i repeat, please do not waste your time here! first off, this restaurant is soooooooo unorganized! the food is average, but the service... ohhh boy.... absolutely terrible. a waste of our time and money. who wears gym clothes and a baseball hat while serving semi-fine dining cuisine?!? \n\ntip for management and restaurant: pay attention to your guests.
