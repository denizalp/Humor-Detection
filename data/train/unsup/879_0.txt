Good lunch. Pho was hood. Had the #4 and it was comparable to other vietnamese restaurant in town. Also had the beef hor fun and it was tasty. Quiet at 1145am because they just opened in September and not many know about the move from Monona to Madison. Would recommend eating here in the spacious room. Tip: look at the lunch menu before sitting down or else you will have to walk back to the door.
