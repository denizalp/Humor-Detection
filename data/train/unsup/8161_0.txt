Filthy. Slow.  Painful to watch the poor girl try to do simple tasks.  It was weird.  She took my husbands order.  Cleaned a tray.  Zoned out.  Took my order.  Cleaned a tray.  Took my sons order.  Cleaned a tray.  Took my daughters order.  Cleaned a tray.  Talked to her boyfriend who was lounging against the counter.  Took 3 min to fill the drinks.  5 min later, the food was ready.  We were the only customers.
