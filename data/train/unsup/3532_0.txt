a family run neighborhood gem and filled with local diners.  can't beat the warmth, food, and ambiance.\n\na table next to us started a lovely conversation that lasted through the evening where we exchanged well wishes, kisses on the cheeks - deux bisoux of course, and business cards.\n\nenjoy large portions for classic dishes such as foie for veau, cotelettes d'agneau, and poulet piccata du chef.  the tiramisu is worth losing one belt notch.\n\ntip: make rezzies and bring your own wine.
