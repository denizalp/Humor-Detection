I was charged $85 for a gel pedi and a full set. By \"full set\" I mean the lady put tips on my nails, a couple of base coats and a couple of coats of gel polish. She did not create a hard gel or acrylic base. So, my nails are freakishly thin. I had no time to argue or ask for a redo, but I'll be back in a few days when they start to break.
