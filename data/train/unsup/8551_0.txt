For a fast food franchise, 5 Guys has some tasty juicy burgers. You can get it your way with toppings that suit you.\nI like the Little Cheeseburger with lettuce, mayo, ketchup, and grilled onions.\nIf you're going to cheat, this is a good place to do that because you'll leave satisfied and knowing you did something bad but ohhhh soooo good!\nOh and love the cool space aged drinking machine with every kind of soda plus they have my favorite green tea! Hi five to 5 Guys!
