WHY IS THE MUSIC SO LOUD IN THIS STORE..I'm yelling cause that's the only way to talk in the store! It's stressful to shop with the music so loud. I couldn't even take a call due to the blazing loud music!!! And it's EVERY time I'm in the store! The clothing is cute and the store is nice but it's my last resort when shopping the mall due to the stressful shopping experience. Someone please address this so this can be my first stop when shopping not my last.
