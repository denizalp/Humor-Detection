Standard Sunset Grill -  good breakfast done cheap...but this location has no soul.\n\nIt's a big, open place that caters to business people and tourists distinguished thusly - the business people were on their Blackberrys while the tourists were on their iPhones.\n\nOur waitress was friendly enough but a tad slow on the coffee.\n\nThis is a safe bet if you're in the area craving a quick, standard breakfast, but if it's your first Sunset Grill, I'd recommend the one in the Beach.
