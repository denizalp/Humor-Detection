Aiden did really good job, he suggested couple things and I'm very happy with how natural my nails look like. But... cleanliness of that place was freaking me out! He used same tools on me as the previous pedicure customer, his table as well as other tables were super dirty and all the ladies that work there didn't seem to mind... I would not recommend it to anyone!
