Wa\ny overpriced for what you get. The menu is so mediocre as is the service and the portions are ridiculous! I know this is prime real estate but the empty restaurant should have been a warning sign. $30 will get you a teeny piece of FARMED raised salmon. The waiter was arrogant and we will not be in a hurry to return to this place!
