My husband swears by this place for his dry cleaning, and I needed straps brought up on a dress, so I thought I'd give them a go as tailors. They did a perfect job. They're kind, accommodating to your schedule and they genuinely love your clothes as much as you do. If it wasn't super weird to throw a party at a dry cleaning joint, I'd probably ask them to host my birthday. They're that cool.
