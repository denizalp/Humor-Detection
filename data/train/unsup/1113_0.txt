Nice place.  I haven't lived in an apartment for over 20 years, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  But the place is nice, clean, the staff is nice.  I don't like the parking, but that comes with the territory I guess.  I just hate how close the parking spots are and I'm getting more door dings than normal.\n\nFor the price, not a bad deal for someone to camp out for a while as they are looking to buy.
