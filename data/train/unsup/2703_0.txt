if you are comfortable being in the middle of a crowded mall.. and not embarrassed by having your eyebrows done in the middle of everything... then go for it! its a decent price for brows.. my lady charged 12 and its over in minutes. the gal was very nice, and asked how i wanted my brows done.. it was a good experience.
