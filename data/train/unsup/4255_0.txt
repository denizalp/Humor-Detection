I've been here a handful of times and have had positive experiences with the staff (friendly and knowledgeable) and the space (organized and decorated). Sadly, I recently went for a bio-gel refill and got \"the greenies\" on two nails - basically a bacterial infection under the nail caused by either unsanitary conditions or a gel nail lifting due to improper application. This makes me sad because I've really enjoyed going to Kim Nails, but won't be going back because of this unpleasant experience.
