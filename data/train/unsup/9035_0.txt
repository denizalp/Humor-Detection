Tacos De Juarez has been on my to-do list for awhile.  A few Sundays ago, my friend and I wanted to get something within walking distance of my place so we decided to finally check it out.  Lets just say this:  I had both lunch and dinner at Tacos De Juarez that day.\n\nThe red salsa is awesome.  The cheesiness of it all is heavenly.\n\nJust talking about it makes me want to enjoy some right this minute.
