This was AWESOME! Had no clue WNBA was this amazing. Between the passionate loud fans, the great music to get you going and the skill of these ladies, it was a super fun night! I wasn't thrilled about going and now I want to go back! These women are very talented and it was a close edge of the seat game. Their fans are as fun to watch as the game, they are very passionate and into it. This is a great date night, family event, etc. Anyone would enjoy these games!!!
