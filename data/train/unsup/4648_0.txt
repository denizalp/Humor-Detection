This was my go to place for many years.  The food has slipped to an all new low.  Burnt burgers, stale buns, greasy fries.  It is sad because I loved this place.  I now will got to Burger Priest on the Queensway.   Much better quality.  I hope they can improve their quality and return the the burger bar they used to be.  If they do they have my loyalty.  Many of my friends feel the same.
