The worst rental car experience I've ever had. They tried to upsell me to a more expensive car due to \"elevation,\" then sent me an invoice for damage to the car that I didn't do. The invoice amount was for the amount of \"pending\" and they wanted a credit card for the payment of an unknown amount. Avoid this company at all costs.
