Disappointed. The pizza I ordered was over cooked and lukewarm upon arrival which took over an hour to be delivered. The pizza was so tough you had to rip it away from your mouth to tear it off and chew it. It was Bad enough to have to throw it out. Probably would have been good if the crust was not so horrible. What a waste of $30. Will not order again from here.
