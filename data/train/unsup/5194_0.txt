Sometimes you've got to take a break from the madness of The Strip and get a little taste of life back home (malls & movies). That's where the Town Square Mall and AMC Movies comes in and does the job well. Some of the screens have extra plush seating and are really comfy. It's the best cinema close to The Strip.
