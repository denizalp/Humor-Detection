This morning the younger idiot lady in the am took my order I told her #28 and she doesn't put a hash brown in my bag I go inside and she acted dumb like,\"oh you ordered a combo?\" Yes idiot that's why I ordered a #28! she even repeated my order. It's not rocket science and ordered one combo that's 2 things, the sandwich and the hash brown. I am sorry but there is no hope for you if you dont even have common sense.
