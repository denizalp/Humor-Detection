This new cozy restaurant within the new Union Shops is a great addition to my favorite shopping mall.  I loved the indoor seating but noticed some people enjoying their meal outdoors which seems like a great option on a perfect day.\n\nI enjoyed a salad from their menu.  Although it was smaller than some of the large trough size salads we are used to it was sufficient.  They could add more greens to fluff it up a bit, but it was very tasty and had a great dressing.
