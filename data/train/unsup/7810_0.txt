We had a corporate Stampede event in the tent at Osteria. Food was O.K. Service was adequate. However we later discovered they double charged us over $1,000. When this was brought to their attention they agreed to overcharging us and told me they would reimburse. Three months later we had not been refunded and when we showed up in person to discuss we were ejected from the building!
