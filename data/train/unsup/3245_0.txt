Best hookah lounge in az. Great atmosphere to meet new people and enjoy your time with friends. Large selection of flavors to choose from and you can also create your own mixes. Multiple large tv's and pool tables as well as a great jukebox. The thing that stands out the most to me is its vary clean, from the hookahs themselves to the furniture and everything else in between unlike the majority of other hookah lounges. Most definitely recommend this place!
