We were warmly greeted by our host, Georgie, as we were settling into our seats. She kindly brought out our drinks and recommended the Deviled Dates which was an interesting dish  \n\nGeorgie was extremely friendly and kept checking in on us, which was greatly appreciated. Would highly recommend Therapy to those would like a break from the usual restaurants & ambience at The Strip in Vegas. Therapy indeed provided us with a chill & relaxed sweet escape from the typical hangouts in LV.
