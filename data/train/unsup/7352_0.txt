Annette, cookies, and several European cool sounding herbal\/Ice teas tucked into a cute lil Down Town Glendale shop and what more needs to be said. I love the salted\/caramel cookies the best, although they are all Delish! Just a heads up, this is really not a full service or large bakery. Don't go in thinking they have a lot. They only sell about 6 types of cookies but they are fantastic. YUMMY!
