Marty is amazing. Initially we were his only table and he was appropriately attentive without hovering. He was knowledgable of the menu and wine store. He recommended a great bottle of on the road Grenache. Which paired well with our lobster pappardelle. While dining our flight was cancelled and Marty was just perfect. I mean perfect.   I couldn't have envisioned better service. \n\nGreat food. Great company. Great service. Been talking about this place for ten years and it lived up to all my stories.
