We had a great experience at Mercedes-Benz of Gilbert! Our sales person, Peter Cramer, was clean-cut, friendly and very professional.  Most important, he was not high-pressure. Our purchase was a used vehicle in great shape, and despite not being a Mercedes-Benz model, Peter was familiar with the car's function and features. The paperwork portion of this sale was also pleasant- notably the finance manager, Giuseppe Ferrera, also offered an amicable, professional experience. Our time was respected and well spent. I'm pleased to share with the Yelp community this was our best car buying experience to date.
