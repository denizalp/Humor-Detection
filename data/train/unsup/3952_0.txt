The wizard lured me in. The wonderful wizard Oz, that is!\n\nMargaritaville is a good addition to the Strip. I like going to the Flamingo and this is definitely a nice extension. I love how smoke-free this place is and there's not a lot of people. I hope I didn't just jinxed it by mentioning that. I like going early, as in, before breakfast early so your experience may vary.\n\nEverything is so bright and cheery and just makes me wanna keep drinking margaritas. After all, it's five o' clock somewhere!
