Rat Spotted.\n\nYou read correctly. A group of friends and I had just finished dinner when we saw a large Rat running around inside of the Wellington location. Though I've been here in the past and the food is good, I was very disappointed with the way they handled the situation. We spent about $80 + and left half our food (instead of packing it up) and all they did was offer us a $30 gift card!! We obviously will not be dining here again.
