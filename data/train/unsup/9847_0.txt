Came in to get a pair of the \"Go walk\" shoes. Although there are Skechers stores at Galleria and Town Square I chose the outlet mall due to their selection.\n\nBoth the girls working in the store were very friendly and helpful. I found exactly what I was looking for and was in and out in a few minutes. The selection of shoes is HUGE. Every style, color and size imaginable. \n\nA really good experience that will bring me back the next time I need Skechers.
