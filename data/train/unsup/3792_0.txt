Places like Makkah perpetuate the stereotype that food from the sub continent can only be greasy, spicy and heavy handed.\n\nMakkah does a decent enough kebab: juicy and flavorful. Heaven forbid you order vegetarian curry: tasteless and chances are pretty old, since no one seems to order their veggies.\n\nIt's a one-curry-fits-all kinda place and grimy as hell.
