I came here back in September - Labor Day weekend to be exact - and the place was popping!\n\nIt was full of people enjoying their dinner and drinks. Their outdoor seating area is huge and the decor inside was beautiful. It's a mix of industrial, rustic, and sultry. Very cool.\n\nService was awesome from the hostess to the bartender and ending with our waiter. Food was OK but the drinks were good.
