Last Friday for lunch we decided to go to Main Ingredient.  OMG,  this place has the best BLT in town.  I'm not really sure what bacon they used, but it was awesome.  So the sandwich had chipotle mayonnaise,  lettuce, tomato and the perfect amount of bacon.  Normally when I get a BLT from somewhere it only has a couple of pieces of bacon on it.    Thanks, Main Ingredient for the best BLT ever.  :)
