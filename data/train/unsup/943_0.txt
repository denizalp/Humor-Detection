We had a group of 5 gals (pretty good looking girls, if I do say so myself! ;D) waiting outside to get into Surrender around 1 AM. \n\nFirstly - there was no one there. No line. And 5 chicks, let's do the math here. You want to charge us $30 for each girl? And then you want to let 4 of us in for free and make the 5th girl pay? I'm not really sure how that makes ANY sense.\n\nSurrender, you be tripping.
