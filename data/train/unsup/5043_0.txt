I stopped in yesterday to have a beer and check out the new brewery in town.  They have a great location right on Scottsdale Road and have a great looking tasting room.  Lots of high end finishes including a gleaming copper bar.\n\nUnfortunately they aren't brewing their own beer yet but that should happen in the next couple of months.  They do have a good list of local beers on tap and I enjoyed my Huss Brewing grapefruit IPA.
