The Rusty Nail is a neighborhood diner-style restaurant that serves Pittsburgh-centric comfort foods.  Meatloaf, pasta, and hot roast beef all grace the menu.\n\nI came here with my dad who ordered a hot roast beef, and I ordered a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs.  Both meals were right around $10 and delicious.  The portions were huge, and the waitstaff was very friendly.\n\nI'm guessing it was the owner, but a nice guy came around asking everyone how their food was and making small talk.  Nice touch.
