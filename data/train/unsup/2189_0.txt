I am giving this place 2 stars because:\n\n1. The Waiter was a douche bag and argued with a guest at my table.\n\n2. Waiter got multiple orders wrong (this was before the arguement)\n\n3. Drinks are way over-priced and not even that good.\n\n4. The food wasn't that great.\n\n5. You are basically paying for the name and that it is Eva Longoria's restaurant.\n\nThe only thing I really liked was the decor.
