Recommended by the hotel I was staying at, this place rocks! Open seating and fantastic food... perfect set up! I had the Hot Chick, which was a perfect grilled chicken sandwich with arugula, roasted tomato and smoked mozzarella served with spicy avocado spread on ciabatta bread. Topped that off with their sweet potato fries and you will be in heaven!
