I usually get a top tier car wash but today I opted for the basic wash and vacuum etc. I had to wipe my car down when I got home and dig my vacuum out to vacuum my seats. Very frustrating. Freddie must have broken up with his girlfriend \"fabulous\" and is dating a new girl \" terrible\". Time to look for a new car wash.
