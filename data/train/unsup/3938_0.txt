This coffee bean is very conveniently located. It is in the Venetian, in a place where I've walked through consistently.\nMany times I've stopped by here when I'm either headed to or coming back from Tao Nightclub. This place has definitely been a life saver at times, providing me with a steady flow of caffeine for my nights of Vegas debauchery. Usually, it's a latte with a triple-shot espresso at the beginning of my night. Right before I call it a night (or early morning), I pick up some yogurt for a light meal before catching some shuteye.
