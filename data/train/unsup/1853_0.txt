Great food and even better service!!!! They were really busy for breakfast when we went so it took a little while longer than normal to get our food so our waitress brought us out a complimentary muffin to hold us over and apologized. The muffin was INCREDIBLE!!!!!! Talk about great customer service! Love this place!!!
