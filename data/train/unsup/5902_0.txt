Wow too bad this place has such low reviews? I had a wonderful experience here. Staff were extremely friendly and prompt and took plates away with impeccable timing, providing napkins and drink refills as soon as needed. I was really impressed with the selection of seafood! Seafood everything! Clams, mussels, oysters, clams, crab claws, surf clams, shrimp in every which way shape and for - baked, boiled, raw, salad. HUGE SELECTION! \n\nDefinitely got my monies worth and I'm a happy camper.
