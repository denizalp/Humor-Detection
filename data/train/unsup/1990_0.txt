Wow I was recommended by this and didnt get a chance to look it up on yelp so when I got here I was shocked of was just out of my expectations. I liked that they did play to the theme a lot. The theme is a hospital type the servers are good looking nurses and the owner is the surgeon. When u walk in you get served and you wear a gown. They also have made up news stories on the TVs talking about there place. Overall it was a different experience so it was good.
