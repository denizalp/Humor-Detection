My favourite Just for Laughs show at La Chapelle Theatre was Deanne Smith. I was laughing the whole time and so was my partner Brian. We had a great time. The prices were reasonable and the venue was small which we liked. Staff is friendly. Deanne was hilarious and we would love to see her again sometime.
