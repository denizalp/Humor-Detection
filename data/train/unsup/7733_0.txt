Maybe I am a little bias because they are from Hawaii, but the food here is so ono. \n\nThis is a mom and pops restaurant and they have a wide range of Thai food, some with Hawaiian fusion. My favorite dishes are the papaya salad and pad thai with shrimp. If you check in or come during lunchtime you can get a free thai tea. The price is fair and the food is delicious. I can't complain. The best part is the complementary tapioca dessert. Mmmmhhhh so sweet and flavorful.
