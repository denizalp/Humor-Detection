Have you ever stood in an isle with glass containers in hand, just staring at them? No? Me neither... I love TJ because they have lots of things I normally see at other stores for a way better price. I like to get things like toys for Sweet Baby Brutis (my dog-child) here, kitchen accessories, bath accessories, random stuff I probably don't even need....\nWell at least I am saving money by getting it for a better price! Right?\nThis location is clean and tighty. Staff is pretty friendly and seem to be well stocked.
