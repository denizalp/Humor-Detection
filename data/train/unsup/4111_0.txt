I loved this place! I went with my family thinking it wouldn't be very fun but we ended up staying all day. The animals are very interactive and we're always out. My favorite part was the aquarium and the new African Safari. There's a lot you can do without paying for the rides. I would recommend to do the skyline ride, you get to see the animals exhibits from above and it's really cool. Also be sure to go to the petting zoo it was a lot of fun.
