Literally some of the best Pho you can get in Charlotte. Nice mom and pop tucked away in a shopping plaza. The House Special Pho is delicious. The vegetables are fresh and fragrant. The broth is rich and delicious! The meat is never chewy and always flavorful. Doan's will always be my go to whenever I get that part of South Blvd.
