Super tasty brunch (not a buffet). I highly recommend banana pancakes (banana pudding between the layers), tasty big bacon, homemade cinnamon rolls are buttery sweet goodness, and the bloody mary's are spicy and yummy. One tip- on Sunday's they have a build your own bloody mary bar for $5. On Saturday its $6.50. \nNancy is an amazingly attentive waitress and their manager Tina is willing to assist in any way possible. I will be back!
