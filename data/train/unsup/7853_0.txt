I am not usually a fan of banks in general, but this location could sway me back towards the dark side. No charge to cash a check drawn from their bank (other banks typically charge and give you attitude) \nNicole was very friendly even while soft selling me on the advantages of switching to this bank. I regret that I forgot the name of the teller after I left. She was very sweet. If I ever decide to switch banks (which is always a possibility) this place is my first choice.\n\nAlso Saturday hours, open until 4pm.
