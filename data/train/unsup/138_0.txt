Greenland Supermarket is Las Vegas' koreatown supermarket. They have a cool little food court inside where they serve a variety of Asian foods. \n\nInside the supermarket, you should find everything that you would need for an Asian dish. They have a lot of Asian products that you wouldn't find in your typical Smith's or Albertson's. \n\nThey have a butcher shop too and seem to be very quick in their service.
