Hands down, this is the best spa ever! Everything from beginning to end was executed beautifully and flawlessly. I can't wait to go back in April for my next appointment. True definition of luxury! \n\nWord of advice: show up early so you can enjoy some peace and quiet in the relaxation room. You'll be sipping various exotic tea by the fireplace while waiting to be called in for your treatment. \n\nRemember to ask for RMT insurance receipt for your employer. :)
