Always comes with dessert with whatever you order. Quality is up there but the price is also there with it. Seemed to be a bit pricier these days but for the quality it can be worth it.\n\nOrdered the Sashimi dinner with some nice selection of fish, next time will try the 15 piece non dinner combo one to see the difference. Also ordered a scallop hand roll but seems like the seaweed could be crispier. \n\nI personally would prefer Aoyama for the price.\n\nThe plating was good too btw and also the atmosphere. More spacious than Aoyama.
