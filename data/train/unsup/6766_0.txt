Whoop, I'm the Duchess of Gas!\nA gas station, specifically.  This Terrible Herbst is in our 'hood and it's where I buy gas and get my car washed when I want one in a jiffy.  Sometimes the line for washes can be long, so I recommend getting yours done in the morning because night time is busy, especially on the weekends.  The staff has always been friendly to me so this Terrible Herbst isn't so terrible to me.
