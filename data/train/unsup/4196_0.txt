This is the best sushi buffet I've been to out here.  The quality of the fish is outstanding.  The fact that you get 2 pieces of toro, amaebi and uni as part of it already makes it worth it.  We sat at the bar and chatted it up w\/ our sushi chef, Nobu, who was awesome and made a couple of interesting pieces of sushi and rolls..guess it helps having a Japanese wife!!
