This is one of the best Chipotles I've ever been too....wanna know why??? They don't question the amount of fillings you put in your burrito. Meaning if you want a copious amount of cheese in your burrito then they WILL put your desired amount. Chipotle's in LA are skimpy when it comes to burrito filling. Perhaps cause they are afraid of rolling a girth-y burrito, but here in Vegas, the City of Sin, they roll em big. This is a must go for on-the-road\/hang-over food. Yummz x 40
