I've tried a few more dishes and have been very impressed with the food and the service. The owner is always so nice and friendly and I love how this is a family run operation. My latest favorites are the Mee Siam (Rice noodles with crispy chicken), roti canai (Crispy, chewy flatbread with curry sauce), and a seafood dish with flat noodles (Wat-Don Hoa). It can get a little warm in the dining room in the afternoon but their refreshing cool drinks will definitely cool you down. Upgrade one star!
