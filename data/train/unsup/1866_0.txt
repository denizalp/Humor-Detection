I can't believe this place stays in business. Last couple times I went during what what most would consider normal business hours they were closed. The hours posted stated they were supposed to be open. Another time I walked in at exactly when they opened and the owner started berating me because they weren't ready. Now the hours are changed again. Too bad cuz the food is good. I'm loosing my interest.  Too bad cuz I usually make a significant purchase.
