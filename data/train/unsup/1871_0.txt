4 stars for now because it's not palette and because my food was still hot. 2 huge things that make local breeze pretty damn good. \n\nMimosas are strong so I'm buzzed. I orders a BBQ burger with a side of 2 fried eggs and crafted my own egg burger. Fucking bomb. Should be on the menu.\n\ni will continue to give Local Breeze my patronage, but i will say...the first cold plate of food i get, i'm outta there.
