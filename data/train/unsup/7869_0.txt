Went here for lunch.  Very mediocre in every respect.  The food bar does not keep the food hot, and at 12:30 in the afternoon, the food should have been hot and fresh.  It was neither.  The Hot Pot bar that they advertise was not open.  That may have been a plus, we will never find out.  There are many more Chinese places in the area.
