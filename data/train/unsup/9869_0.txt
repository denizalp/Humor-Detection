A great hide away off the beaten path. FRESH would definitely describe the cuisine. We tried the meat and cheese board and the Hummus tray to start. Both wonderfully prepared and presented. Dinner was lite and early for us this evening. Caesar with shrimp and chicken was our entr√©e selection for the boys. Ravioli and Bolognese for others. Nothing but complements. We enjoyed the patio and golf course views. Just a nice experience. We will be back to try more of the menu!
