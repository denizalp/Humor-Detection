This club sucks. Calvin Harris is a douche. But not as much of a douch as the bouncer who pushed me! My girlfriends and I were already admitted to the club and we were trying to take the elevator up. We walk over to get into the elevator and the bouncer pushed me back and said \"take the stairs!\" How rude. Also they had minions at the bottle service. Fucking minions. I'm offended. Thats too cheesy for me.
