The staff here are super friendly and accommodating. They are happy to answer any questions and offered me a free sample late to help me decide. The curried chickpea salad and broccoli and mushroom salad were wonderful; savory and full of flavor. I had the peanut and coconut macaroons for dessert, and I had to resist the temptation to get a dozen of them boxed up to take home. They also have various juice tonics which I wi have to try in the future.
