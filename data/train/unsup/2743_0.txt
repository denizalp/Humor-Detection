Stayed in line for nearly 2 hours...on a Wednesday, right when they opened. Ordered a sampler of every meat, so I could really make that wait worth it. End result....wouldn't do it again. Does not live up to  the hype. \n\nThe samples they give out while your in line is completely different from what you actually eat. Pretty upsetting if you ask me.\n\nThis is no Nashville or Kansas City BBQ
