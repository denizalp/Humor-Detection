Ahem. Upon landing: \"Well, folks, the Asheville airport stayed open late for us, otherwise we would have flown you into Knoxville.\"\n\nThat would have been nice to know before we took off.\n\nI opted to sit in a car for 8 hours rather than deal with the flight back.\n\nThe plus side: They sent me a $50 voucher, which was essentially half the cost of my flight. But if I used it, I'd have to fly Allegiant again, so, nah. They also offered everyone free Cokes and waters at the gate.
