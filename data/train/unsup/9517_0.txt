The toenail in the carpeting and booger on the desk told me all I needed to know about the Omni.  I won't even go into the mildewy bathroom ceiling.  \nI can scarcely believe this is an Omni after staying at Pittsburg's Omni.  The lobby is beautiful, but they have a long way to go to be a decent hotel.  There are swatches out all over the place connoting a redecoration, but I wonder if it's all because the Ritz is being built across the street...
