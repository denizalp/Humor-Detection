Something new to do in Vegas for the regular visitors. They give club card discounts do be sure to bring your card. Very high up and you can't bring anything with you. Super friendly staff and amazing views. Wasn't scary as long as you don't have a fear of heights as it doesn't go very fast. Glad that I did it but wish I would have done it at night.
