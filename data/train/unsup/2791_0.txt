Overall, great golf course! The two tracks we played were The Hawk and The King, both were fun to play and kept up beautifully. The staff were super friendly and the rangers did a great job. This course is busy so on a pretty day don't expect to be done in 4 hours, our round took over 4.5 hours due to waiting on others. \n\nOn Sunday's, they have a nice looking lunch spread. You cannot order lunch until 1:00 pm, but they have pre-made wraps for $5.50 that taste good.
