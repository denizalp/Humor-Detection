I am only giving this rating because there are none lower!  The hotel was very poorly maintained!  The carpets in the hallways were filthy and the walls were marked up.  The beds were uncomfortable, the room carpet was dirty, and the plumbing did not work properly!  The doors also stuck and were hard to open in the ground floor hallway making for a safety hazard!  I personally would not stay there again!
