We arrived and the place was packed. (Mothers day) the hostess and the rest of the staff was super friendly and although there was a 45 minute wait they ensured we were happy and comfortable. Maria (our fabulous server) brought me coffee as we waited in the lobby. The staff worked their magic and we were seated within less than 10 minutes. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was friendly and very nice. We will most definitely be back.
