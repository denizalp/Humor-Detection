For a bit more cash you can either go to a good chinese restaurant or a buffet. Absolutely not worth it!!!the food is passable but it all taste exactly the same. I quess the curse of chain restaurants. The fish depending on what day it is apparrently goes up 2 or 3 more dollars with your meal . the lomein has soooo much celery in it that is literally all you can taste. Eeeeh.  Ill just go to the china joes place up the block located next to yama sushi
