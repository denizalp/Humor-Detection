We highly recommend Allstate Self Storage! Bob and Ellen's customer service is top-notch! They are always friendly and greet us with a smile and wave. The facility is very impressive; very clean and there are always plenty of flatbed carts. We also appreciate that they are security conscious and that they keep an eye on the people coming and going in the parking lot.
