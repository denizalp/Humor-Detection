I have been here many times. They rush you to order and they keep walking near your table to see if you are done, so that they can take your plates and rush you out. \n\nThis is NOT a place to hang out with your friends if you plan on talking for more than 1 hour. \n\nFOOD: Average. \n\nVERDICT: It's  for a quick eat and go. They expect you to eat quick and leave.
