Dim Sum on a Sunday Morning in Vegas?  Sure why not.  We've been to other places and wanted to give this place a try.  \n\nWe were seated by the kitchen area where the food comes out however they keep missing us until the end of their rounds.  It seemed like their pathway needs to be improved somehow.  \n\nThere were good selections and the food is mediocre.  I'll still come and eat here if I'm in the area.
