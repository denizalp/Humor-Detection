We recently joined the A-List program. You are allowed to view up to 3 movies each week for $19.95\/month. My honey loves to watch movies and so this deal was pretty much made for us. lol\n\nThis is our go to theatre because it's close to home. It's clean and we know the drill. Park in the garage and validate your ticket on the way out. \n\nOne of the best features has to be the reclining pleather seats. Bring a throw because it's usually chilly in there.
