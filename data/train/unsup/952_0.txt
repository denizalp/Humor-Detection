I used to go here a lot for haircuts and eyebrow tinting. Recently I got my brows waxed here and the lady could not stop complaining about how my eyebrows are uneven! well duh! If they were perfect I wouldn't be coming to you to fix them for me!\nI am embarrassed to say that while she was threading my face and talking nonstop she accidentally spat on my face.\nThey need to learn that it's not necessary to talk to the customer the entire time. Just do your job!
