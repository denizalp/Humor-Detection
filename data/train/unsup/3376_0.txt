Have never been before but had heard good things about it, so tried it out.  It was enjoyable....not as good as some of the Mexican restaurants I recently experienced in California, but I'd say better than the Mexican chain restaurants you see on every corner.  The food was good, service was fast and it seemed like a popular spot.
