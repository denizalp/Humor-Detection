I don't like the attitude of the people working here. We came in Saturday around 12 to get my boyfriend a hair cut. They were understandably busy and said it would be a 30-40 minute wait. No problem. He signed in and then we went to some of the surrounding stores to pass the time. When we came back 20ish minutes later and asked how long, they said 25-30 more minutes. They were pretty rude about it too. We left and decided not to come back.
