Buh Kut Teh Noodle soup for brekkie??!!  Who eats that for breakfast?  I DOOOOO!!!!!  For whoever in the mississauga area is hankering for some Laksa noodle soup or other yummy dishes, get yer butt over to Breakfast ING.  my 2 year old and i enjoyed a bowl of Buh Kut teh noodles in soup and boy were we impressed.   So delicious for breakfast.   Fall apart pork rib meat and noodles soaking in a super yummy broth.  Oh ya!  Next time I will try the Laksa...  Until then
