Super cute bakery with plenty of pastry and dessert selection, coffee and boba drinks, and even some seating- space looks small from the outside but is really quite spacious.\n\nAlmond cookies are legit, macarons are just okay (but they have several flavors), chocolate almond cake is flavorful, and the almond tarts are the closest  moderately-healthy alternative to pecan pie. I'm on a baked-goods-with-nuts kick, can you tell?\n\nFriendly staff, open late, but irked that they have a $10 card minimum- I never carry cash, and should not be eating $10 worth of baked goods. Ever.
