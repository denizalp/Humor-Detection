We had lunch here one day while in Charlotte. Ordered their Chicken Tortilla soup and some of their Chicken nuggets.\n\nSoup was tasty and hot! The nuggets tasted texture-wise like they had been sitting for a bit. The Buffalo dipping sauce was pretty good.\n\nVery popular lunch place - place was packed!
