Doesn't live up to the hype. Tried twice. The decor is cool but the tacos are woefully underwhelming. Food lacks acidity and tends to taste alarmingly the same. It's a busy place and sadly the service reflects that with the typical malaise of high volume service folk. Last, a few drinks, 2 apps and tacos for 4 will set you back about $175. Bummer, moving on.
