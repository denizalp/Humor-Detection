This place just keeps getting worst and worst to me. Not so much the service, but the customers. In the Summer it was great, but now every single time i go in there, it's like the customers don't know how to add as they shop. Every time, i have to wait 10mins for the cashier to ring up 80 things, and another 10 for her to take off 60items, because the customer only has $20. I'm so over having to deal with people that can't count.
