For some reason, these people seem to think it's OK to price a tank top, that probably has less thread count than my thong and cost about 17cents of labor to make, at $50. \n\nThey also seem to think that dressing up their mannequins like paraplegic color and pattern blind grandmas gives them business. Oh wait...it does! Because this is Tempe. And Tempe, as I can't over-repeat, is the devil.
