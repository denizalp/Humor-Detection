Everything was and is still the best! Anytime you want a great meal 24 hours a day or to grab a drink in the Fireside Lounge, its worth it.\nTonight we went for burgers, and I have never ordered a burger here, but my mushroom\/swiss burger was tasty and super large!\nAmbience is calm and old style classic Vegas.\nIf you have never been, I highly recommend!\n5STARS
