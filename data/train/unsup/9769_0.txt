This place is rock solid! Me and my wife were on our honeymoon from Houston and this was one of the restaurants we tried while staying in the casino. We ordered a couple hand rolls, tempura, and a roll. Food tasted fresh and the service was excellent. The restaurant has a really nice vibe and trendy look. A great spot for a romantic or relaxing dinner. Try this place out now!
