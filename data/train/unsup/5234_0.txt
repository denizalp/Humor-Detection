La Santisima is not an ordinary taco shop like a hole-in-the-wall Mex restaurant. This restaurant offers vegetarian dishes on the menu. This time around, I tried the cauliflower taco, its a bit dry. But with an amazing selection of salsa and it a sure thing to make dining enjoyable. I tried the salsa La Mexicana it was  a good compliment with the taco. The variety of style and uniqueness of the food is a sure five stars!
