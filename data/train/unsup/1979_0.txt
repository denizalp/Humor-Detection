Was on my way to visit the Glockmeister and ran across this pawn shop next door.  I decided to drop in to check out what they had and saw that they had a large variety of guns on sale.  They had quite a few AR-15's and around 30 pistols.  Very nice.\n\nThe jewelry selection was limited and there was a decent amount of electronics and golf clubs.  It'a an average pawn shop with above average gun selection.\n\nI'll be back the next time I'm in the neighborhood.\n\nReturn Factor - 70%
