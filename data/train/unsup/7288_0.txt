Good coffee, good sandwiches, so-so desserts (be careful, they're not all good), GREAT atmosphere.  Considering Charlotte's lack of good coffee & cappuccino, Amelie's doesn't have to be great to do business as a coffee shop.  It's their Parisian style decor and cafe-esque layout that stands it apart from every coffee shop I've been to in Charlotte and elsewhere :)\n\nIt's no wonder this place has been around for years!
