One stop shopping.  Pampering.  Hot coffee.  Homemade cookie.  Robes.  Hot towels.  Makes you want to get your mammary glands squeezed in a vice.  But with all I listed above and 3D technology, it made a usually uncomfortable visit perfectly relaxing.  And in this season  of holidays, I was treated by Joy, and that she was.  And after a three hour experience of squeezing, ultrasounds, more squeezing, I'm not even worried about going back for the Ultrasound Guided Biopsy tomorrow morning.  I expect the same courteous and helpful treatment...and maybe a touch of Joy.
