RIP OFF. So the only thing I came for was of course the famous soft serve from Milk bar.  I got cereal milk and added the corn flakes.  $6.  The worst $6 spent.  It was the smallest portion of soft serve and there was no reason for the corn flakes to be charged.  Corn flakes are worth nothing! As interesting as the flavour was, the ice cream was not that great.  Definitely will not come back for the desserts, but I am still curious about the ramen and baos.
