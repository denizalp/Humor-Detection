I wouldn't recommend this show as an introduction to Cirque du Soleil. I recommend this show if you are a Beatles fan. \n\nThis is Beatles meet Alice In Wonderland, meet Willy Wonka, meet Tim Burton. Not the typical Cirque Soleil stunts I'm accustomed to, but the psychedelic acrobatic dancing is definitely a sight to be seen. I'm a huge Beatles fan so I definitely appreciate the surround sound in my head rest. The constantly moving stage is phenomenal. I am definitely e-baying one of their costumes I don't care which one it is.
