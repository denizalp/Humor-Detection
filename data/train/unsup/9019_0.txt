Every damn time.\nIt's always something. \n\nThat advertise 1\/2 off ALL drinks during happy hour. \n\nThere is no asterisk, no fine print.\n\nAll means all  \n\nWe ordered 2 Funkwerks beers. \nGuess what?\n\nSecret Surprise!\n\nFunkwerks excluded.  That was not disclosed on the placard, or the beer list nor by the waitress. \n\nToo bad because (in her words)\n\"That's just how it is\"\n\nI hate myself for coming back here.
