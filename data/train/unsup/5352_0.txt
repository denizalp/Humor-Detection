Got sucked into the hype because the food is very instagram worthy but too bad the food isn't as delicious as it looks.\n\nThe black rice pudding tasted like nothing. Super bland. Might as well be eating my napkin. \n\nThe mushroom toast (I don't remember the name) was cold, the bread was harder than Ryan Goslings abs, the flavour was bland.\n\nBeatroot latte was pretty to look at but also bland af. Their coffee also sucks. \n\nNeedless to say if you're looking to satisfy your eyes and not your stomach, Early Bland Kitchen is the place be!
