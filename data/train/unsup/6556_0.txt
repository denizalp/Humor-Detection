Small Japanese but good. Very good service, even you go to just order take out they sit you down with tea and miso soup. Speaking of Miso it's so simple but the added touches of crispy tempura bits and a bit if noodles makes it stand out. It's all a la care here, like most decent japanese places. The price ls are fair and food is delicious.
