I don't think this place is awful, it's just not my thing.  It's a rebuild from a place that burned down a few months ago.  Inside looks like a mix between a sports bar and a middle eastern restaurant.  The food is average. That's what I say, and that's what everyone else around me said.   \n\nIf I was in the neighborhood and needed a beer I'd go back, but I wouldn't search this place out, like I said it's just not my thing.
