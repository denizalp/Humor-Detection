One of my favourite spots to take a meat lover - always blows their mind. There are still plenty more flavours I need to try, but like many people, I keep coming back to the Fat Mac. All of the taste, far far less of the guilt. Tonight I had the Toronto Island - no surprise it was delicious. Their crust is truly superb, and that's really the foundation of a good pizza. The fake bacon coated in sweet BBQ sauce doesn't hurt either!
