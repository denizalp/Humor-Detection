Great service, classic environment and delicious food. \nWe ordered chica burger and chicken sandwich. The burger was juicy and flavorful. The sandwich was good too. \nOur waitress did a great job explaining the menu items and checked in with us twice. Our leftover food was packed nicely and they even remembered to pack extra napkins and forks. \nOverall, it was a fantastic dining experience.
