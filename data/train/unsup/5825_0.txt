This cafe is small and could be easy to miss while walking along Avenue du Mont-Royal. This is a sweet find. The coffee is made just right & it's local. The interior is modern & rustic, with a long table situated right down the middle of the space. A nice place to commune over coffee with others or have a solitary experience.
