Great location (on the way to the Panther's stadium), friendly & fun staff, a variety of beers with new ones always being released and plenty of entertainment options (arcade games, board games, events galore). My personal regular favorites are the Hospitali-Tea and Over the Edge IPA. Unknown is a great spot for all types of beer drinkers and there's always something on tap for everyone and for any type of drinking session.
