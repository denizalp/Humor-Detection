This is definitely not the same as Roxy's in NYC.  My husband took me to the NYC Roxy's for my birthday.  It was an amazing experience.  When searching on yelp, I saw it here in Las Vegas and brought my father for something special.  The only thing special was Bryanna our waitress.  Adam the manager, reported the entertainment is only on at 2pm to 2am and advised us this was posted.  I don't see it, does anyone else?  Very disappointing.  Maybe a sign or something said by the hostess who is seating you would be nice.
