The most beautiful club I've been to in my life and now my new favorite.  We ooh'd and aah'd when we walked in. Probably the best night I've ever had in Vegas for reasons that shall stay in Vegas.  I think it cost Steve Wynn something like $100 mil to build this 40,000 sq ft club. Completely worth it.
