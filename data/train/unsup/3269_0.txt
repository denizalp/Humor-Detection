I went to JJQs for the first time on Monday and had a great time. Our server was very attentive and always checked up on us. Some of the pool tables feel a bit worn out but they do the job. There is also a ping pong table as well. Depending on what day you come they have a few daily specials such a wing night, fireball night etc. This pool hall is perfect for groups looking to play some casual billiards.
