Came here for my first year anniversary. It was truly the best meal we've ever had. The omaha steak was incredible, cooked on the bone and then served already cut in two halves ready togo.the wine was perfect for our meal. The service is top notch! Considering everything from the food, service, experience,and atmosphere it's money well spent!
