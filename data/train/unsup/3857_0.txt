Good work on the whole. \n\nThe headphone jack on my son's iPad Mini 2 stopped working, so I brought it in to get replaced. It was a Wednesday; they said they'd get in touch a couple of days later. I called them the following Wednesday after I didn't hear from them. It turns out they'd ordered the wrong part, and I had to wait another couple of days...\n\nDid they fix it in the end? Yes, they did, but it took two weeks.
