No toaster. NO TOASTER. WHY must the best bagels in CLT be forced into a sauna to steam away all their crusty, crunchy potential?\n\nToppings are diverse, coffee is good. Staff is cute and stoned. Decor is rad, and I feel totally comfy, until EVERYTHING IN MY 6 DOLLAR BREKKIE SAMMICH comes pouring out, onto my lap, onto my dry-clean-only Interview Shirt, and then that's it - I'm throwing a tantrum (in my head at least) and tossing the wet mess into the bin. Give us the option, kids. Don't be Steamer Fascists.
