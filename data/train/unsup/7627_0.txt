This was my 2nd stop on my first night in Vegas during Turkey weekend... \n\nUnfortunately I cannot provide a proper description on this review because I was somewhat intoxicated after being at The Double Down Saloon prior.... \n\nI do remember\/ recall great atmosphere and cool decor.. Loved the fire place.... \n\nAt the back they has another room with a DJ, playing Techno music, which was proper and european-like... Again, wish I could provide more info right here... \n\nWell, I guess I just have to arrange another Vegas weekend and make this place my first stop.. LOL....
