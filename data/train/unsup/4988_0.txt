We ordered from Eat24 for lunch yesterday, my boss's treat, and they brought the wrong order. We called and let them know. The lady who answered said that their printer ran out of toner so she couldn't read what we ordered. So I guess they just brought what they assumed we wanted. \n\nThe owner came by today and brought us a free lunch, which was so generous and also generously sprinkled with PUBES fried right into the batter. \n\nThanks. Won't be eating here again.
