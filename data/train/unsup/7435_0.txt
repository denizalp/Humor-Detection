This place earns zero stars to be honest. horrible service. Raw fish was warm which was nasty. Thank god i didn't get sick from it. They use this purple rice which was nasty and i just didn't understand the taste. The place wasn't busy at all but then me and my friend waited 30 minutes for two rolls. Horrible horrible horrible! Don't waste your money on this place. Kaizen, sakana,& kaya are still my top favorites lol
