I'm a Juicy Bitch so of course i had to check out the store while i was in Vegas. The girls in the store were very helpful and nice. The store was laid out nicely and had a nice selection in everything from clothes, jewelry ( LOTS AND LOTS of charms)and even kids and baby stuff. Not as many purses as i would expect but regardless i was still in heaven.\n\nGo Juicy!
