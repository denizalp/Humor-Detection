I thought the food was o.k. The portions minimal and the service awful. There were 6 of us and she missed one item and we waited and waited and finally received the final item when everyone else had eaten. Usually for 4 entrees in a Chinese place 4 would be more than plenty. But with only 3 entrees delivered and waiting forever for the fourth I feel Joyful House did not live up to its name. For $70 I feel there's more joy elsewhere!
