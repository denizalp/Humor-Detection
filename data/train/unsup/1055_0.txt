We waited 5 mins to be seated and it is NOT busy (10pm).  I have my daughter  with me and shes only 18, the hostess  seated us  by the bar that has a sign said only 21 yrs or older in this area ( fail ).   We had  better ramen then this place. Pork belly skewed  was good. Steak with fries  for $28 is way over price.  \n\nWe are not coming  back.
