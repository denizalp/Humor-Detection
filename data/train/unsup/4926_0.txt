Pho Mi 99 located outside Vaughn Mills Shopping Center is not a bad place for pho in the area.  The noodles isn't too soft and the soup base is quite tasty.  Pricing here is decent as well and the service is fair.  Pho Mi 99 is quite big here and is busy usually.  Spring roll is crispy but not that tasty.  They have good mango shake as well.  Will probably stop by again after making a run at Vaughn Mills.\n\nRating:\n\nService: 3\/5\nFood Quality: 3\/5\nComfort 3\/5\nDecor  3\/5\nValue: 3\/5\nParking: 4\/5
