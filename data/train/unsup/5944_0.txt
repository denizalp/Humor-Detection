What happened?\n\nI went here, a few years ago and it was great. It was live and packing and it had people.\n\nBut I guess when the Piranha comes on your turf, then it eats up all your business. Everyone seemed to be there, next door.\n\nThere is the extra star because we came twice this weekend. And we were served by the most bossiest, sassiest bartender. And she was a lovely diet version of Katy Perry.\n\nOtherwise, no. I can't imagine this place charging cover. If then, then make like Amy Winehouse to rehab and just say no, no, no.
