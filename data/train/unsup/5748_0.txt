I dislike chains, but its 1am on a Thursday night. After a horrible night I needed some good old fashion comfort food. Place clean, no wait, waitress on the ball with refills. Went with the tooty fruity breakfast platter. YUMMO. I feel full and ready for bed and to wake up in better mood thanks to my fabulous waitress.
