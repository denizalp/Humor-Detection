This H&M is HUGE! I felt like I was in a 70's party with the glitter balls hanging from the ceilings. \n\nI can tell this H&M is frequented a lot since they didn't have my size in stock. I had seen a wool coat in San Francisco that I was thinking about purchasing and since I was in H&M in Vegas decided to get it. No size, unfortunately. \n\nI did end up buying two flannels and luckily I did since the casinos had the A\/C on high!
