The aesthetic of the store is absolutely TOP NOTCH! Their ice cream also is super aesthetic with the liquid nitrogen floating around the ice cream! In terms of flavours though, not absolutely amazing. I tried the Tiramisu flavour and it didn't taste very much like tiramisu? Had the bitter coffee hint but not enough of the biscuit flavour. Will definitely try their other flavours out again when I'm in the area :)
