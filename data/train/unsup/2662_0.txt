I came here to see JLO! Here are my quick pros and cons:\n\nCons: Be prepared in a long line to get in that goes all throughout the shopping mall.\n\nPros: Bar inside to purchase cocktails.\n\nCon: Only one bartender at the cash bar! Ridiculous. One small bottle of champagne $21\n\nPros: Lighting was amazing\n\nSound: Great\n\nSeats: Comfy and plenty of security
