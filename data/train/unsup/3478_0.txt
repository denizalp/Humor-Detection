Overpriced, everything was fresh but lasagna was too salty and kinda like a thrown together mess. Mimosas were $9.00 EACH! this is outrageous! We also got a pizza and it was good but nothing special to pay $75 for lunch. I wouldn't return because i think they are overpriced but if you want a fancy pizza joint to spend lots of money at this is your spot.
