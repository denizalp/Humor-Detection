I love this place. I have an LVAC membership too, but I only use it once a week, because you can't lift there because it's always packed and it's filled with douche bags. \n\nThis place is great. It's got cool equipment like (sand) medicine balls, TRX bands, and the usual gym stuff. \n\nThe only drawbacks are: I have to drive through the intersection of terror (Blue Diamond and Cimmaron) to get here, and there's no group X. But, they tell me that the new location will have a cardio room.
