Tied with Breakfast Club as my favorite place for Breakfast\/Lunch in Scottsdale!  The breakfast Nachos are amazing! The Banana French Toast is amazing! The Green Chile Pork Omelet is Fan-F'ing-Tastic!  Probably my favorite of the 3!  Good comes out fast, prices are reasonable and the service was great.  If your looking for really good food in the Scottsdale area, you can't go wrong with Daily Dose!
