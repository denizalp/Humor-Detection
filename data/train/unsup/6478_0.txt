Amazing place! Haven't had this much fun shopping in forever. The prepared food is spectacular, and the selection of other food is delicious. As well, I've had some incredibly long-lasting flowers from the florist. This place is very out of the way for me but well worth the trip to get some of the prepared food once and a while. \n\nOnly real flaws were the prices-- more high than I'd like to pay, but the product is much more premium than anywhere else I'd go.
