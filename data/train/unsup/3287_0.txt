Our friend called in to pay for our room for three days prior to our arrival which I believe for the weekend came to around $650.00.  Upon actual early arrival they charged us for an early check-in for $20 however they messed up on our room so they waived the charge.  The rooms are extremely spacious, the bathroom is amazing with a hugh tub and separate shower, we also had double beds that were...I'd say each were a king size.  I would definitely recommend the Planet Hollywood!
