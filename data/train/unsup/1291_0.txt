Just experienced Block & Grinder's new brunch menu. There aren't enough stars! SO amazing! Premier service! AmAZing food! Had Shrimp & Grits with scallops and venison sausage. DANK! Tasted the Duck Hash. SUPERB! And their Potato Cakes are\nlike nothing I've had before, but want over and over again. Oh, and let's not forget the perfection of their Pork Belly appetizer (available on other menus as well). Always a great experience. Both in taste and service. Breakfast, lunch and now brunch. KUDOS B&G!!
