So much more than expected! Yes a wait but we were there on a holiday weekend. Good beer selection, amazing Bloody Mary...the drink part was good as was the accompanying sausage, pickle, bacon, peppers, and olives. The ahi tuna wonton\/tacos were delicious and not too fried, loved the chicken wings, and the Greek salad had olives, hummus, garbanzo beans, carrots and more. The staff was super friendly. We would eat there again for sure.
