What can I say, this is the biggest athletic trade show I have ever seen in my life. Seriously, it dwarfed the renounded \"San Diego Comicon\" and many other massive trade shows.\nIf you are in any way interested in cycling, sports, or just having fun, this is definitely not one to miss. So head out to Vegas and check it out!
