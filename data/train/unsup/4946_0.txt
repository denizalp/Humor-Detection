Amazing customer service! Hands down easiest transaction and deal I've ever done!\nThe associates here are friendly and well trained regarding the features of the cars. Surprisingly at other dealerships I've been to in the past,  their car sales associates are sometimes not very familiar with essential technical background. Not here though! \nOverall this was a pleasant experience from all aspects of the purchase!\nThanks United Nissan
