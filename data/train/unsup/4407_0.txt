Second visit today, first was for lunch and while I don't recall what the menu name was it was a combo teriyaki dish. Today was a happy hour stop,  rolls were good (I had the yellowfin), restaurant was clean and well\/run staffed, prices were fair and I like that there's separation between the bar area and the dining area which seemed popular with groups\/families and those that wanted a sit down dinner.
