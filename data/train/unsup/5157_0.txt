Excellent customer service and very friendly staff\n\nI started going to Fast and Friendly 2 Carwash after my favorite carwash closed its doors . While I definitely agree that Fast and Friendly takes longer than other car washes I've visited, however, it is definitely worth the wait.  \n\nFast and Friendly is committed to giving the customer what they want, a great car wash at a reasonable price. Fast and Friendly is committed to making each customer happy and satified. Give Fast and Friendly a try you won't be disappointed.
