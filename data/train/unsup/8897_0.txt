My boyfriend and I go see Dr. Woods every week! \n\nMy lower back was hurting so bad I could hardly walk. After a few visits, I feel amazing. Once you start, you will want to keep going. \n\nIf you've never gone, DO IT! It is so worth it. :) \n\nWhen my boyfriend leaves he always says he feels as \"nimble as Gumby\", and that is a direct quote. .
