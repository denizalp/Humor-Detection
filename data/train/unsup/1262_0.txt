Piece of shit place. Crappy tables and extremely rude manager. Asked for a glass of water and he declined, told us we had to pay for a bottle instead. We then proceeded to inform him about the Toronto Public Health ordinance law and how he was legally obligated to provide free drinking tap water...he then became very aggressive, swore at us, and kicked us out. Over a glass of tap water that would have cost him essentially nothing, he lost two customers that otherwise would certainly have returned and spent tons of money on pool.
