My husband and I dined out here the weekend after Valentine's day.   This restaurant is located at the end of a strip plaza and doesn't look like much on the outside.  However, the interior of the restaurant was very cozy.  The service is excellent and our waitress even comped us a dessert simply because it was our first time dining out at Vogue.  Speaking of the desert, we had the bread pudding and it was fabulous.  I had the Salmon entree which was also very good.  We will be returning here in the future for sure.
