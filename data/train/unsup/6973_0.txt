This is Always a place my daughter wants to visit when she comes to Arizona! We love ice cream so it's only fitting that we enjoy a classic soda fountain treat at the historic Sugar Bowl!! It's a sweet nostalgic blast in time to enjoy an ice cream concoction at the bar! I love to concoct my own sundae or get something off the menu!!
