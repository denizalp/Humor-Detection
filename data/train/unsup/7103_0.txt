McKenzie, Dr. Sadre, and Darla were such a sweet staff. They took the time to explain all the messed up things that are wrong with my teeth (ok this is embarrassing, I have A LOT to work on!) and on top of that they offer so many great incentives not just on your first visit but to come back. With Yelp I received a free toothbrush and my consultation was complimentary. I'll definitely come back.
