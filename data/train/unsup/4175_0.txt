Love this place the food is great chef really knows how to throw down on the chicken wings especially (hot) and all the bartenders are very good people Randy being my favorite. This place always has good locals, good conversation and fast service Randy never lets your drink get low and has a really good personality so come check him out you won't be upset I promise!
