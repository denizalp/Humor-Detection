Drinking only (since our server forgot to put in our order) \n\nGet the Caesar. It's Canada version of a Bloody Mary, it really just taste the same. Supposedly they use Clamato, but many bars in the US uses Clamato juice too. So not sure, just another name. But it tasted good and we enjoyed it. Love the garnish on it, especially the beef jerky! \n\nWe ordered the poutine but the server never put it in... so we were severely disappointed. Service obviously lacking. I'm sure it tasted good.
