Stopped in for a drink while waiting to meet up with friends. Handful of people at the bar but not busy at all. Sat at the bar for a few minutes while a woman bartender ignored me. A Guy came out finally and asked for my drink order. Almost seemed like I was annoying him by being there. Not friendly service at all. Will not return.
