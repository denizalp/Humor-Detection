Very very pleased with Gigi. I've been through a terrible experience with a previous pet sitter with my kittens and their behavior completely changed. Fortunately Gigi was just what my boys needed and kept me in the loop on my trip. That is so important to me and I am very grateful. She will be my \"go-to\" for pet care from here on out.
