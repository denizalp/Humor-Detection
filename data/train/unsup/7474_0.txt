Went through the drive thru June 9 at 12:15 pm and ordered pretzel sticks. I watched the woman drop the tray they are cooked on on the ground, pick it up, and cook my food on it. When I told the woman at the window that I no longer wanted it because of what I saw she just closed the window and came back with my money. Not even an apology or denial. Absolutely disgusting and terrible service.
