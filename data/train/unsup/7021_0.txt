Lovely hotel. Everything was big and clean. The staff was friendly and everything was done right. \n\nThere was ample parking. \n\nWe enjoyed our dinner and lunch buffet there. I was comped for a dinner after playing blackjack for just an hour at $5. a hand. \n\nWe will stay there again and think that it is a good place to stay.
