Always love the Hub since their days on Shaw. I don't live in Toronto but I always make sure to stop by for a breakfast BOB sandwich and a coffee. Always friendly and always good. Wish we had something just like this in Austin TX. Lots of great places there but no Hub. Check it out. Worth the trip.
