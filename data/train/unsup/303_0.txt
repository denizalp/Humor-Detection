We had a problem with the service last week, but I can't express how impressed I was with the way Roy's and the managing partner handled it afterward.  That is why I recommend Roy's and keep coming back.  Everyone stumbles--it is how you acknowledge the fact and then fix it that matters.  BTW, Roy's is great with food allergies and gluten intolerance.
