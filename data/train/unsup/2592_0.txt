Terrible experience! The first time I went service took forever but the food was pretty good. The second time I decided to do take out and called them an hour an advance to get my order ready. And when I arrived my order was not even started. Not only did I have to wait 15 more minutes  but they got my order completely wrong. Terrible customer service and food was not the best. Not going ever again to this place.
