The food was first poorly seaoned, then it was over seasond with pepper sauce the 2nd time i went back to return this food. What a waste. These people think that just because this is charlotte,nc that west indians arent down here and know what good west indain food is. EXTREMELY HOT! Beyond the stanards of what quality is. Please cross them off the list. I will can only endorse \nCARRIBEAN HUT ON NORTH TRYON!  There consistently consistent! \n\nPros, the food portions were good, and they tried to make it feel cozy inside i guess.
