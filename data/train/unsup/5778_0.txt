I've been to Coconut Hut twice. The energy and vibe are amazing. You walk in and feel relaxed and at peace. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. I've had the Traditional Pitaya Bowl and the Pitaya Limeade. Both were delicious. My 12 year old daughter is vegan and this place is an awesome and cool place for her to treat herself. I highly recommend this place and will be back soon.
