After all the hype from my friends, I decided to visit Chino Bandino.\n\nI was somewhat disappointed. I got the dual meat combo. The jade option was spicy but lackluster in flavor. The carnita was super salty! Not the best tasting either. Black beans seemed low quality too.\n\nThe prices are good- but the quality and taste was not there.
