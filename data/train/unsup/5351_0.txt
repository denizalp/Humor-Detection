Really cool place in the area.  Definitely reminiscent of the Queen and beaver.  \n\nThe patio area is nice,  didn't really get a chance to check out the interior but the food and beer is very good. \n\nThe menu is very small and they don't offer too many items,  which is good and bad.  I enjoyed the service and didn't feel rushed.  Definitely a place to check out.  If you like this place,  you should also look up the Queen and beaver
