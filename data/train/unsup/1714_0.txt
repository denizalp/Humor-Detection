FAST!\nCHEAP!\nGREAT WORK!\n\nThey only accept cash and parking stinks, but it's FAST... CHEAP & they do GREAT WORK! \n\nI brought some curtain in on Thursday to be hemmed and they were ready Friday for a cool $30. Sounds like a lot? They were velvet, 115 inches long and 64 inches wide... I was ok paying more than I would for a pant because these things given their size were like a bajillion pants.
