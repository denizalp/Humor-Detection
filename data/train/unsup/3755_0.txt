Do you like France and miss French baking? Please go here and stop missing it.\n\nI would happily pay 2x as much for everything they sell. The pastries are perfection. The sandwiches are life saving.\n\nGo early and be amazed. Get there late and hang your head in shame. The goods will be gone by the time you arrive. That's how 'fresh' works. Better luck tomorrow.
