OK, last time I was here, I gave it only THREE stars. Why? I was with friggin DUDES. Nothing wrong with that except:\n\n(1) No free drinks\n(2) No free drinks\n(3) No free drinks\n\nYou get my point, right.\n\nLet's just say it's a totally different experience when you go with CHICKS.\n\nVIP, free drinks ALL NIGHT, hanging out with awesome bitches. We danced until 4AM and we had no idea.\n\nThis was one of the best clubs hands-down in Vegas. Pool, VIP tables, and hot bitches. You can't go wrong with that triple combo.\n\nThank you XS for making Vegas so memorable.\n\nHighly recommend.
