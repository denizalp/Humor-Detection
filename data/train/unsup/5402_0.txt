Stopped by this place when roaming Mirvish Village today. Gorgeous boutique with lots of cute things from local\/Canadian designers. We had a good chat with the store owner and she was super friendly and knowledgeable. She herself makes jewelry and the other owner re-purposes vintage clothes.\n\nDidn't buy anything today, but I'll be back to browse around some more. \n\nVery chic.
