Staff in the front never smile specially jessica, i dont even understand why she works there, she needs to understand that people coming in the clinic are in pain they have to see a happy or friendly face. Staff from inside is the best and they have a great massage therapist \"PAM\" very friendly and really good.. Ill give it one star because even the doctors is not that great.. And cleanliness wise, \"fail\" pillow is all over the place, floor most of the time.. Not recommended..
