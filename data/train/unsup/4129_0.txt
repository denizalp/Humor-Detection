Usually has what I need.\n\nLet's face it, when you need something for your home or apartment, Home Depot  is a store we think of. \n\nHome Depot  is the place to go for pretty much everything you could need for any home project. The prices appear to be in line with Lowes which is just down the block.\n\nThe store is neat, organized,  and the staff,  if you can find them are very helpful.\n\nMy only issue with Home Depot is the customer service, which is usually  hit-and-miss,  depending on who you're lucky enough to walk up to while shopping.
