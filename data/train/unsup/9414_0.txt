I came here for lunch with the hubbie. He works across the street from it so he's always talking about it. lol. I ordered the butter garlic noodles, ( because that just sounds amazing, lol) and added beef to it. I really liked the noodles and their portions are pretty big and it came with rice.They have a really big menu, so i'd probably come back to try some other items, however they are very Americanized. It's a cute little lunch spot though.
