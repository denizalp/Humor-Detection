Was near by and stopped in to have breakfast. The restaurant was pretty empty, but for some reason our server Patty was very slow. \nMy husband's double cheeseburger was greasy, he needed to place napkins underneath it. Stated no pickles, burger had pickles. \nOnly thing going for this location is they give military discount, don't forget to show your id.
