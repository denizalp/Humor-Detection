Today was my second time coming here and only because my hair stylist became the store manager of this store! Her name is Holly and she is truly the best. I love the way she cuts my hair and how she never gets crazy and cuts more than I would like her to. Store is clean and staff is friendly. I will be coming here all the time from now on.
