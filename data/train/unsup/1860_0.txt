Nice Gym, lots of equipment but that's why you pay 1400$+\/year\n\nStaff: Trainer are great\nManagement: Really snob and not help full they think they own the GYM not only that they have attitude issue but when ask to speck to some one hire up they will leave comments one your account and basically threaten you to cancelle your membership.\n\nClosing hours: Gym closes at Midnight but at 11:30 you have to be out of the pool and they will be announcing every 5 to 10 mins basically to get out......\n\nPlace is excellent but needs management change urgently!!!!
