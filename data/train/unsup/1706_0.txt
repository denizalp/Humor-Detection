This place is alright. It's a bit pricey but the portions seem to line up with the price so that's fine. The menu has typical Italian fare but it's largely limited to pizzas and pastas. There's a couple salads and a burger but that's mostly it. \n\nWe can here twice and both times they seemed to have issues with flies which was a bit of a turn off. Consistently pleasant staff though.
