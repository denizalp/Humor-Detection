From booking to my actual visit this is now my favorite hotel I have ever stayed at. We stayed for my birthday weekend and walked across the street for live music at copper blues and arcade games at gypsy bar. They have bikes for you to borrow during day , awesome views and beautiful decor. Very reasonably priced as well.
