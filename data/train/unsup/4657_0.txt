We've stayed here a few times. We always get a good rate for the weekdays. The buffet isn't that great anymore but the rooms are good, the casino is fun with giveaways and bands and the shopping is great at the Miracle Mile. They have free self parking and the MM has free valet parking. The location is nice as its a ten minute walk to Bellagio and Caesar's.
