I avoid Rex's when I can, but large group meals or when dining out with friends will often bring me there.  I've eaten there easily a dozen times, both lunch and dinner.  \n\nThe food is adequate.  Generally more institutional than you would expect for the price (soups are not homemade, potatoes are instant, meat is usually pre-sliced and merely heated).  The service is decent and usually not offensive.  \n\nThe bar is pretty decent.
