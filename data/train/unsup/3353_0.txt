I love Fresh on Spadina Ave. Only a few blocks from home. The Food, staff and atmosphere is perfect and even though I go there at least once a week, I have never had a bad meal. Tonight I had the laska curry soup and was delicious!  Feel like a boost, go  for the mega life salad and green dressing.
