Went for Photofacial treatment and had Dr. Shannon York as my provider. \n\nWas very impressed by Dr. York, her professionalism, \"bedside manners\", the facilities and the treatment I received. I've only had one treatment so far and probably need to go back for two more as expected, but so far I'd highly recommend Expert Aesthetix.
