BRUUUUCE!\n\nOk, I admit it, it's been like, nine years since we used Bikeworks, but his repuation holds with our bikey C-U friends, and he and the guys had the best bike fu anywhere.  They did several tune-ups and more major work for us.  We had no issues with his bedside manner.\n\nIt was one of his guys who introduced \"tacoing the wheel\" to us, still my all-time fave bike accident term.
