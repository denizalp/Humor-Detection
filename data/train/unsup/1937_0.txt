Warning: Buyer's Remorse sets in almost instantly after paying. I spent $15 on Gummi Bears. $15!\n\nThey sell candy by the pound and no prices are listed. If you're not careful it can get crazy pretty fast.\n\nThere is also an ice cream\/gelato stand where you can get custom ice cream sandwiches. I had one made from snickerdoodle cookies and vanilla bean ice cream. Lackluster to say the least, but that might be partly my fault since I designed it.
