I was in town with my 15 year old nephew and we wanted to do something. Since many of the shows and bars are obviously adult oriented we decided to do an escape room. We figured a Saw themed one would be good.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised! It was very fun and had several scenes right out of the movies. I thought the best part was that the actor who played Jigsaw did the voiceovers for the puzzles. \nWe had a great time.
