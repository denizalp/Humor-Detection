This place is now closed. This used to be a quiet oasis in a sea of frantic shoppers trying to find the best deals. \nIt has been replaced with a couch, two easy chairs and a kids' carousel ($1 per ride).\nI'm not sure how close the nearest wine bar is now but, if you want a beer, the Thirsty Lion Gastropub is just down\/up the mall.
