As soon as I saw the kitchen nightmares episode, I wanted to visit ABC ASAP! All in all, this place was fine, not the best food but it wasn't as bad as the show portrayed it. I met samy and said hello to him and asked him if I could buy one of his gangster shirts and sadly he said no! There food was fine and pastries were good! I just wish things could have been a bit crazier, maybe a yelling match between samy and a customer! But sadly not.
