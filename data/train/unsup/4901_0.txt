Tacos were on point. They were good and the salsa was spicy. Cooked over a real charcoal grill (not those briquettes you buy in the store). Price wise, I would have expected $2 per taco would have been a fair price but they're $3. Being Scottsdale I guess you just have to expect to pay more, I can get just as good if not better tacos elsewhere for cheaper.
