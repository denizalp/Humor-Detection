AT&T is horrible. They lie and the customer service won't help you at all. Stay away from AT&T & Directv. Worst customer service on the planet. I am running back to Verizon and switching from Directv to Cox. They do not care about the customers or honor their word. They put you on hold forever and nothing is ever resolved.
