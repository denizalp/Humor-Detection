I saw this Nazi cross there 2 weeks ago and the manager took photos of it and said they would remove it.  I went there today and it was still there.  As someone who has read over 100 holocaust memoirs, I find it incredibly tragic that Merchant Square would try to profit off of something so symbolic of human suffering.
