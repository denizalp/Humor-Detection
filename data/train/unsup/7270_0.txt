Terrible experience! Took an hour for food to come out and table's drinks were completely empty before being re-filled at least twice through the meal. On the bright side, we were offered a comped dessert, then later that night I saw that they charged us for a beer we never ordered! Takes more than a name change to to improve this kind of terrible quality service!
