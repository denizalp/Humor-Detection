Understaffed. Placed priority on the drive-through patrons & ignored people in line inside for a solid 10 minutes. Then they were really curt & had an attitude the whole time serving customers in line, treating every patron like they were a bother despite no one in line warranting that kind of treatment.\n\nThe only reason my guest & I didn't leave was because it was literally pouring outside. No thanks.
