For Montreal, this place is a 5 outta 5.  I am a native (southern) Californian.  So I known way around authentic Mexican food.  And this place is legit.  He tacos are HUGE !  And burritos?  They are more like BURROs massive!  Big enough for three meals.  Spicy too!  I love this place!  \n\nNot much in the way of seating so get it and go!
