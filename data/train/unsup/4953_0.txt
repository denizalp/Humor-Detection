Food is whatever, old and cold and greasy and certainly unhygienic.   \n\nlastly, i hate to eat at a place where someone is constantly watching me eat. hate their staff who looks at every guest as a food thief.\n\ni do not like Chinese food to begin with and this place totally turned me off after what i saw the other table.
