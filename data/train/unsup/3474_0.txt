Very pleased with my experience here. I've been waxing for many years, and have tried so many salons here in town, and I have to say this was by far the least painful wax I have ever had. The wax Marianne uses was phenomenal, and with her expertise, I was in and out in 20 minutes. She does both men and woman's services, and with summer coming, I highly recommend you check her out!! \n\n*boys take note, no one wants to see a sweater at the pool :)
