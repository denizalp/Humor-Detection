Good food decent prices... But who is managing this place??? A stoned ghost??!!!?? I mean so disorganized I was about to walk out.... People are nice enough but stuff took forever and it wasn't busy.. You order at a cashier or sit at the sushi bar staring blankly at people ready to order for an hour?! \n\nFigure it out. I can't deal.... As I now live in vegas, I'll only be back if im desperate for sushi and broke!!!!!!!!!
