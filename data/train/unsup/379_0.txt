We purchased a 15 year old model home in Anthem CC. It was very nice but very outdated. Laguna rebuilt our entire landscape, hardscape, pool and outdoor cooking area. We even added a large fire pit and covered gazaboo for our new gas grill and Memphis Smoker.  The quality of construction and materials was second to none as was the service. The entire process took less than 60-days. We are so happy we went with Laguna for our home make over!
