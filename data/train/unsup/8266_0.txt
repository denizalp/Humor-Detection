What a nice little hidden Sushi place in the middle of Scottsdale in Phoenix, Arizona! We were pleasantly surprised!\nClean, Modern, Fresh Fish, good selection of Sake, very friendly hosts, yummy sushi rolls. Spicy chunky yellow tail, white spicy tuna, scallops and fatty yellow tail were great!\nAnd we didn't get a chance to check out the specials, so we'll be back!\nGreat prices too!\nThank you!
