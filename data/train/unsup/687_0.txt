Filiberto's is pretty predictable... Greasy semi decent Mexican food served until late hours of the night. Their red sauce is delicious and I usually buy it and bring it home and use it for my own Mexican dishes or for eggs. This location just got a grade of D by the board of health. Eat at your own risk
