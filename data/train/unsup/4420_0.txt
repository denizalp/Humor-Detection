Shoo Mercy Sweet Potato Pancakes. 5 stars. That's it. It's delicious. I've read prior reviews and my guess is some of the lower ones may have been a result of kitchen staff being temporarily off their game or rushing things during peak hours. But the recipe, when done right, is down right delicious. \n\nAnd it's sweet potato... so it's good for you right:)
