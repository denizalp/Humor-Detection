Dont bother! We went for breakfast on a Sunday afternoon. Took 3 hostesses 15 mins to decide to seat at the worst table right next to the buffet line under a television that was blaring a football game. Half the restaurant was empty so asked to be seated outside where it was quieter.\n\nOrdered simple breakfast of eggs, bacon hash browns and toast. Eggs were overcooked and hard had to send them back, bacon was limp and greasy, hash browns were  basically shoestring sticks with cheese on top, toast was dry and burnt.\n\nWorst breakfast I have ever had in Vegas!
