The valley-girl speak \"I can't even\" was totes invented for Little Miss BBQ. \n\nIf disliking something renowned is fun, I had no fun here. \nIf the best fatty brisket I have ever and will ever have is fun, I might as well die now. \n\nAll the hype, the lines of cars on the street, the lines of people out the front door.. all of it is 110% true to reason. Reason being: BBQ THAT IS AMAZING.\n\nI can't. I really.. I just can't.
