As Terry K told me, \"don't go looking for Asian food on the Strip, go Spring Mtn\", but yep we hard head!  But this place, we really like.  Our usual over order of mix fried rice, beef udon stir fry, Won ton soup, Har gau and spring rolls.  Only the spring rolls were mediocre, but everything else tasted really good.  So yep five star for me for finding good Chinese food in a casino.
