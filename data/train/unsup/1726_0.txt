Our lunch trip here yesterday has been the best meal experience of our Vegas trip so far. Hash-House was way too full of people - over an hour wait. So we decided to go here and had zero wait. Service was on point, atmosphere was great, food was really good, and the drinks (mimosa and watermelon mimosa) were fantastic!!
