This is long overdue.  I've completely fallen in love with LashDaddy!  His space is adorably decorated\nand luxuriously appointed with your comfort in mind.  I love his playlist too!  I love that it's current music and not the same old boring spa noise!  As a lash artist myself, I love that Kai is meticulous and takes pride in every lash fan he places. I think his OCD and my OCD have become BFFs! Lol!  So get in quick...he's worth much more than he's charging!
