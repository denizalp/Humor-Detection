Don't shop here if your preferred payment method is American Express. They don't accept the card. \n\nJust showed up with $150 worth of AMEX gift cards to do Christmas shopping for my kids. Not only would they not take my AMEX credit card, they also refused my AMEX gift cards.\n\nCongratulations Hobby Bench on losing out on a sale of at least $150 and probably more.
