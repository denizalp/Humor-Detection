Service was good and the restaurant was clean. We ordered the Fried Wonton appetizer and it was over done, not good. I ordered the Pad See Iw and ordered it medium which was bland it was so mild. I added chili sauce to kick it up a notch.  I have been testing out other Thai places in the area and from this experience it doesn't rank near the top. It's not terrible. It's not great either.
