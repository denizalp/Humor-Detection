I scheduled an appointment with Carrie and she is apperantly feeling under the weather and tried to reschedule my appointment and I said no as I'm an active duty service member and leave to my duty station tomorrow morning, she's refusing to refund me the cash I put down as a deposit. And will not allow me to pick it. \n\nHIGHLY pissed off.... never again bad apple...
