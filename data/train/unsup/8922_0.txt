I checked this place out during Yelp Spring Break and bought a pie for some out-of-town Yelpers.\n\nThe place has an old NY style charm, with intricate details on the ceilings, walls and corners. The vintage pinball machines are great additions and add so much to the atmosphere.\n\nAs for the pizza, if you order a pie it comes out HOT HOT HOT! So hot it was hard to eat, but I tried my best! I believe we ordered half ricotta (?) \/ half pepperoni. I am a big fan of soft cheeses and this one here was quite delicious.
