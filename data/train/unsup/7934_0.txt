Not by choice, but by coincidence I have been to The Joint about 4 times for concerts and every concert I have been to here has been memorable. The setup of the place is fabulous and makes it great for those even in the back to see. I could still see the artists from the bar area all the way in the back of the showroom. The sound systems are never overpowering and the entertainers they bring to this establishment know how to put on a performance. I have not seen one bad performer yet.
