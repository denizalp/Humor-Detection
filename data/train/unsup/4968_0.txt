The foods not bad but they definitely don't want you to come and socialize while u eat! They want their customers to just shut up and eat or order to-go! Once u hit the 30 minute mark from minute u walk in the door, they are ready to pounce on you and kick you out! Therefore the environment makes u feel quite unwelcome!
