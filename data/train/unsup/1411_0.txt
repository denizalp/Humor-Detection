Thought about giving it a four because we waited for a long time since they are not very organized with their waiting list (they don't have one) and even once we sat down it was still another hour before we got our food... However, this is by far the best Thai food in town! I can't wait to go back to try more dishes. Just don't plan on going at busy times, like Friday nights :-\/
