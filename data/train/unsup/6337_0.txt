These dumbasses sold me a dinner deal on a night the place I wanted to go was closed. The ticket said it was god for 7 days from date of purchase, but who goes to a place known for selling tickets for the day of, and gets something for another date? They should have warned me, but didn't bother.\n\nThey seem a little too upbeat there... I don't trust them.
