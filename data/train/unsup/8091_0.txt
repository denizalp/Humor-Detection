If I worked closer, I'd have my lunch here daily. Filet sandwich hit the spot but the sides are the real deal. We had the roasted red potatoes, mushrooms and corn. Delicious! Plus, all the homemade sauce options are bottomless. Try as many as you want, and get as much as you want! What's better than not having to ask for extra extra extra extra hot sauce?
