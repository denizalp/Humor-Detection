\"I love musicals except for all the singing and dancing\" - Ralph Furley\n\nIf you are a macho man like Mr. Furley and not a big fan of show tunes then you can surely appreciate Jersey Boys. You won't find any flashy but spectacular sets like Phantom or too much dancing like Moving Out. Instead you will find a simple story line: four Jersey boys dream of stardom, fame, fortune etc etc. The actors do a wonderful job singing like Frank Valli and the Four Seasons, no auto-tune here folks.
