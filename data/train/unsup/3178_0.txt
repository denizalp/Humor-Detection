I really don't know how to begin this review other than WARNING this historical  \"Landmark\" restaurant is entirely OVERRATED: The food is NOT delicious, the price & portions are laughable, service is mediocre___honestly, the ONLY redeemable quality is the decor.\nI left this restaurant still hungry; more broke___feeling like I got taken advantage of by very  \"seasoned Old Town Scottsdale Swindlers\" accustomed to preying on innocent tourist. *Note: This place actually does not deserve the (1) little star automatically defaulted. \nZERO stars!
