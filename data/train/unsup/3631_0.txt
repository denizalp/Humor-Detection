I USED to love them when they were a 1 location restaurant off of Glendale. Maybe they had more, but I felt is was very hole-in-the-wall, mom and pop, with great quality and care.\n\nTonight we ordered from the Bell Rd location. We asked for light sauce, and the pizza came without sauce. There was way too much spinach overload on the pizza, and mounds of garlic that made every bite taste just like, well, garlic. \n\nTheir breadsticks with mozzarella was the equivalent to poor man homemade breadsticks. Melt the cheese on a slice of bread.\n\nNot impressed.
