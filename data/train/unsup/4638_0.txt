We gave King Windshield another try after a few years as they brought the wrong windshield then.  This time still disappointed as they didn't bring the rain sensor for my windshield and we had to come to the shop on Sat. morning.  The day before the tech told us NP, he would be bring on to install at 8:00am the next day.  He didn't show up, it was never scheduled and we had to come to the shop for them to complete the work.   VERY DISAPPOINTED AGAIN,  WILL NOT USE OR RECOMMEND!!!
