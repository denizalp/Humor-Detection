Went to the Killers show last night and my ticket was for a seat that was never built in the arena.  Their solution?  Well it was to put my wife and I in the top of the upper deck in the GA concourse seating.  Maybe they are just running the airline ticketing policy of overbooking, but Section 209, Row B, Seat 15 does not exist and they still took my money for it.
