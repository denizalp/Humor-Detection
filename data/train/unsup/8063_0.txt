Wow. This was awesome. Food was top notch (duck burger was off the hook but a bit salty). The short rib tacos were a perfect flavor blend, and the jerky was delicious. However, the service was the best part of the experience. Ask for mike to make you a beer cocktail. I am a bit of a dabbler in trying different drinks and was very impressed with both his service and his drinks. Definitely will be back here!
