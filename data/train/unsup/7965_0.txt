This restaurant wants to be in Manhattan and close at 10pm, they basically run you out the door at 9:50. The waitress came to us and said last call. The bar was packed yet they want customers to stop spending money and leave. Change the music and stop trying so hard!\n\nSave your money and go to 18 Asian on Rhea Rd.
