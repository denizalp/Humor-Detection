4 stars for the super friendly service. 3 stars for the food. \n\nThe menu here is more limited than Wildflower's outside the airport - I wanted to try the Wildflower Triple Club, but unfortunately it's not offered at this location. They did have the Turkey Cranberry Walnut Stuffing and most, if not all, of their Classics. \n\nThe food wasn't bad, my chicken lemon soup tasted pretty good, although I wouldn't say it was great. All in all, a decent airport option.
