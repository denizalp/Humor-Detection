Went for lunch today with the wife and offspring. I was feeling traditional so I just went with pepperoni. Wife went with the new Carne asada pizza. It was surprisingly good. \nMy wife likes this better than grimaldi's, I prefer grimaldi's. \nFood was good. Service sucked. \nI'd give it 3 stars, my wife would do 5.  So there you go, meet in the middle.
