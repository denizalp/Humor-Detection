Same-O, Same-O but fresh, hot and healthy.  Caesar salad with crisp romaine minus croutons, grilled half salmon and steamed broccoli.  Not so sure health wise on the hot out of the oven rolls where I had to have an extra one and less so for the frozen classic margarita. Service was fast and efficient even entertaining while Tyler spun the serving platter like a pizza waiting for more customers.
