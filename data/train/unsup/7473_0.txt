If you have to get a root canal I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dr. Fife.  Walking in there I was scared out of my mind.  I cried and was shaking.  He helped calm me down and explained everything he would be doing.  As the procedure was in progress he often asked me to make sure I was okay.  His staff was wonderful, and I felt very comfortable.  He was OUTSTANDING!!!  I hope I never need another root canal but if I do I know exactly where I will be going.
