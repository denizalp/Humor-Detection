This is the king of all Walmarts in the region. The Airdrie Walmart Supercentre has everything and at good prices.\n\nIt's not as great as the American ones where you can buy liquor and guns and groceries and anything you want, but it's our best hope. They do offer groceries at this location and anything else you can imagine a department store selling. They even have products you can't find in the more urban Walmarts.\n\nIt's worth a trip to if you need everything....
