So incredibly delicious and comforting. Walking in, one can smell the umami in the air. It is warm and friendly, with excellent prices, and beautiful atmosphere.  I had the Morris Ramen bowl. It was huge, and I was able to get a full second meal out of the take-home container. It had so much deep rich taste and smooth texture, and was hot and satisfying. Perfect for winter time.  I also started with the kimchi which was fresh and flavorful. Our server was sweet and attentive. I love it there and am going back soon!
