This is the best Chinese food I've ever had. Period. Nothing close. I don't live in the area but whenever I come I or even come close, I go out of my way. They are a small family owned restaurant with the same nice older couple greeting you. This place is worth every penny (which is crazy low priced as it is) and I pray that it will be around for years and years to come since it has been part of my life for so long already.
