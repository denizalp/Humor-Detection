Despite what food companies would like you to think, most smoothies are not health food. Most smoothies have enough sugar to sustain about 50,000 hummingbirds. Knowing that, you are probably craving a smoothie because they taste good. A good smoothie can be as good, if not better, than ice cream. Sadly, despite the fact that they contain mounds of sugar, Smoothie King drinks often taste chalky and flavorless. In terms of smoothie stores, I much prefer Jamba Juice and I often fantasize about a Jamba replacing this Smoothie King.
