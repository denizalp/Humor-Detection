I had excellent service at this location. Took in a water sample to have tested. Eric did a great job with the analysis. His report saved me approx $250 from my pool service suggested I drained the pool and add new chemicals due to a very high calcium. Found out the water calcium levels as well as the pH and all the other indicators where in the average tolerance range...BAM..saved me $250.
