What a great market and deli - I can't believe I've never been! We got two Boars Head sammiches that were positively LOADED with meat and cheese. I'd almost say that you could even split one. The selection of chips and other snacks, sodas, coffee, and local ice cream was impressive. Two cons: They didn't put very much of the condiments on; and, the price was a bit hefty. Two sammiches, chips, and a tub of dip was $25. But, despite the cons, I would definitely go back!
