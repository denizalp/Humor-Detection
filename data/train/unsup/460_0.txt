I wanted to go to Bouchon but ended up here instead.  Super starving and I knew I would be waiting in line for Bouchon so we went here.  We waited for about 10 minutes before we were seated.\n\nThis place is overrated IMO.  Why overrated?  Because my food was average.  My carnitas omelette was just okay.  Nothing special.  Yelpers also mentioned how good the coffee cake was.  Did I like the coffee cake?  I like the fact that it was warm.\n\n3 stars!!\n\nThe Cracked Egg is almost yumylicious!!
