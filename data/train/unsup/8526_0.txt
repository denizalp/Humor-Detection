Can't comment on their coffee as I'm not a coffee drinker, but I like their chai and matcha, and the desserts that I've had here have all been delicious. Downside is that it is often really crowded, so it's not a good place to go to if you want a relaxing place to sit and read or something--I tend to just grab and go unless it happens to be quiet (which I think has only happened twice in all the times I've been here).
