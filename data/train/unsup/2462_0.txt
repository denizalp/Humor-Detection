this new Location just opened last night. \n\nLove the clothing they have, brings a fresh style and culture to Pittsburgh while incorporating what it is to be from Pittsburgh. They guys who run the place are funny and charming and always willing to show you something you might have not seen before. I adore the vibe and the pieces they've brought out to the people of PIttsburgh. \n\nDefinite stop if you're in need of some sneakers\/shirts\/hoodies\/hats you know all the things you make you SEXY.
