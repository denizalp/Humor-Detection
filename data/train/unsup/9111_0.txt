August 1, 2015 update: They have sadly discontinued their lunch buffet.  \n\nTheir $9.99 lunch buffet is great!  Yes, it's not as spicy as some people might expect, but the flavours are good, there is plenty of choices for vegetarians and carnivores (and there is actually plenty of meat in the curries), the mango salad is delicious, and their rice pudding is AMAZING.  \nThe decor is a little tired, but the location is great, the waitress was friendly, food at the buffet replenished regularly.  \nEasy choice for a quick and delicious lunch.
