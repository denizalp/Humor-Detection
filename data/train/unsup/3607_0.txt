The staff here is always so friendly. \nI went in on 4\/22 for their Earth Day special. If you brought in an old product container they were giving out full size face wash in return. Even though I'm sure the staff's whole day consisted of people looking for free stuff they kept their composure. \nI love their products and I really like that the company is environmentally conscious. \nNicely done!
