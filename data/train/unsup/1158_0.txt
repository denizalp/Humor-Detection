Meh. I came here for a bachelorette party dinner with a group of 7 girls. I liked my dish alot (sea bass) but wasn't really feeling any one else's dish. The pork belly skewer was good too but everything else was very forgettable. Nothing bad, but nothing outstanding. It's a fun place to go with your friends and the prices aren't as steep as some of the other \"nice\" Vegas restaurants. Service was great too because they brought out free dessert for the bachelorette without us asking.
