So...update.\n\nStarbucks apparently has 'enforcers' who then come onto Yelp and harass anybody who gives them a bad review.  I've now had TWO separate people private message and or *ahem* \"compliment\" me and calling me names that I'm pretty sure Yelp wouldn't approve of.\n\nSo the attitude thing?  Yeah.  That's pretty much even more pronounced now.  It's funny because I have other not-so-positive reviews on here and nobody has ever stooped to name calling or threats.  What exactly is up with that?
