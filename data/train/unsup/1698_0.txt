Best service, great food, not sure about it being the best sushi in Phoenix. All dishes were good, each bite was scrumptious. I was most disappointed when I got the otoro glazed with a soy reduction... sacrilege! This might have been the best otoro in Phoenix... soiled by a reduction.\n\nGreat for a nice dinner, not sure we'll come back.
