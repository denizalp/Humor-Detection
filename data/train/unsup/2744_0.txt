Dependable Auto Shippers transported our vehicle from MO to CA and it was ten days late. The delivery date changed four times. Due to the delivery date changes we never picked up a rental car. However, they only offered us $100 for the delay and no rental car. I spoke to their Manager, Renee and the VP, Jim. They were not helpful at all. They ended up saving money on their end. We will never do business with DAS again.
