2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 59\/100\n\nWe went here a while back when they were located in the South East Henderson area. Needed to get the front window tint lightened. Staff was super helpful and great to work with. They showed us our options, to see what each tint would look like. Didn't have to wait that long to get it done, and the quality was excellent! No bubbles, quality work. To this day, a couple years later the quality still looks amazing. \n\nWe used the yelp check-in offer, $30 off... what could be better?! \n\nI'd recommend them to anyone.
