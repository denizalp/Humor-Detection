Christmas Eve dinner. Yippee.Food was just OK. No return. Had Tempura. It was cold and greasy. Dip was gross. Husband had chicken and beefskewers of some sort. He eats anything and wasn't happy. Service weird and no one in regular restaurant. Teppanyaki was busy. This is our punishment for going somewhere weird on Christmas.
