Great, clean place. Went there for work and stayed for lunch. \nTheir burgers are absolutely gorgeous. The best I ever tried, and I tried quite a few. If you ever have a craving for the burger and a putin, don't spoil it with a large fast food chains. \nI definitely suggest trying this joint. Once again, those juicy burgers are amazing.
