I had great expectations but I ended up disappointed. \nThe staff was nice, place looks good, coffee was good, cheese cake was good. But, floor was dirty!, I had to bring my food to my table, crepes are overpriced and not that good. \nI don't know if it was a bad day for this place but is definitely overpriced for the quality.
