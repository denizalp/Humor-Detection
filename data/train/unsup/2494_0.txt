I love Pita Jungle, and I'm pretty certain it loves me, too.  This location is one of the best with their big patio, and with very necessary misters in the summer months.\n\nThe selection is expansive, the service very friendly and efficient, and the food is always outstanding.  I like the hummus (like a lot) and falafel, but I most often get the Chicken Combo Platter, or the Broiled Chicken Salad.\n\nThey have a phenomenal happy hour, M-F 3pm-530pm.  About a dozen items $1-$2.\n\nBut perhaps the best thing about this location?  Heading next store afterwards for an ice cream...mmmm mmmmm.
