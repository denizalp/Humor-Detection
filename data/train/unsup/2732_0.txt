This rating is specifically for, CHRISTY. I have gone here for a year and a half and will only go to Christy for threading. If she isn't there, I turn around and go home. My heart goes out to the women who reported the low reviews because I also had that experience the one time I didn't go to Christy. Sooooo, hint hint wink wink. \n\nShe is there 6 days a week until 4 pm (including Sat Sun). I think Tues is her day off. I go every 2 weeks and my eyebrows are on FLEEK everytime. Thanks, Christy!!!
