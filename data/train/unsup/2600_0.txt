My husband and I chose this place because of the rave reviews. Yardbird lived up to the hype. We ordered the fried chicken, Brussel sprouts, wedge salad and the butterscotch cake. \n1-fried chicken lightly crusted and incredibly juicy.\n2-brussel sprouts, OMG, I wanted to open my mouth and shove them in with one fell swoop. I don't even like brussel sprouts, but these were delicious! Fried in honey (who knew) magnificent!\n3-salad was also good, their own dressing was a nice touch.\n4-cake-skip it, just okay. Try something else.\n5- staff- so friendly and at the ready . Great service!
