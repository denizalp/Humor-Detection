Cosmic Comics is my new favorite comic book store. It beats anything in L.A. While not the biggest, it has a terrific layout, and a great inventory of comics, the best I've seen. They've got a section of hard and soft cover books devoted to artists, and subject matter. They've got a section of models and cards and t-shirts. They've got it all, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. What more could you want?
