Had dinner at Don Vito last night.This was our third time there and it was just ok.We were seated in a booth near the kitchen and had a fishy smell wafting about.They serve some tasty bread and soup or salad with dinner.Both were good.I had lasagna and it was served hot and tasted pretty good.My wife had the eggplant parm which is raved about by the waitress and it was just ok.The atmosphere is comfortable and old school.The wait staff was attentive.I think we will be trying some of our other jaunts for Italian next time.
