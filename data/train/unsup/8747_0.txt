Sun City Express is certainly the West Valley's #1 shuttle service. They have taken excellent care of my family and friends, especially my young sister and niece. Management is always very responsive to questions.... setting a high bench-mark for other shuttle services to try and emulate. I'm looking forward to using them again this coming week.
