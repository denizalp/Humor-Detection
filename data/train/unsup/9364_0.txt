Forever 21 has a small men's section. Everything looks like what you'd get at Urban Outfitters with prices to match. You got your plaids, your hoodies, your ironic tshirts. Yawn. I guess the derivative looks are not unexpected. Forever 21 has a history of knocking off fashions (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Forever_21#Controversy). And if there's only one dressing room, it would make the shopping experience even more unpleasant than Urban Outfitters. Who asked for this chain to come to Canada? John 3:16? I'll raise you 2 Kings 2:24 (http:\/\/bible.cc\/2_kings\/2-24.htm).
