I went not expecting much and left feeling lucky I was alive. Went on the roller coaster and was not restrained well enough. I seriously almost fell out of coaster. My sister in law got whiplash from the ride. I've been to county fairs that have had safer rides than this place. \n\nService wasn't the greatest but also wasn't the worst I've had.
