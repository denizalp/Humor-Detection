Very nice fancy hotel located right by Chinatown.\nLobby area is large with plenty of seating and a bar\/restaurant attached to the lobby. \nThe rooms were very nice and modern. Seperate bedroom which is nice. Very comfortable beds. Shower and bath in the bathroom. Mini bar with snacks as well. \nGood location as well as far as walking distance to plenty of restaurants.
