Like so many others, we went here because Hot and Juicy had a forty minute wait...BIG mistake!!\n\nThe service was awful:\n~ waiter forgot our \"Cajun\" fries\n~ our order came out with at least 10 minutes between everyone's dishes\n~ the waiter's English got shaky when we asked which flavor our shrimp were and complained about a mix up\n\nAlthough the shrimp are bigger, they don't compare to the bag of goodness the waitstaff delivers at the REAL crawfish place! Hot and Juicy is worth the wait...don't waste your time wit bad imitations
