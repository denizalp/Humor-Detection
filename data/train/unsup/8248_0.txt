Wow - just delicious food. Fairly limited menu and nothing fancy but the food was just fantastic. So much of it was made in house (including the bread and strawberry preserves). Their fresh squeezed honey lemonade was awesome. It gets pretty busy on the weekends but I can see why. I wish we had something like this in Tucson!
