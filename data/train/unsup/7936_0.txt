Before last night I was unaware that there was a zip line at Rio. I was very excited to learn that it run at night. I have been sky diving before so I am not scared of heights. But I was nervous as I signed the release form. The zip line looks a lot scarier then it is. It's a very smooth ride with great views of the Palm hotel. If you are going to go on this go at night. Your allowed to wear a dress and heels and enjoy the club after.
