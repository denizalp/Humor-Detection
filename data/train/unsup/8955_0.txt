When I was picking up my car, I was served by a racist and condescending service lady. The service lady had short, pixie blonde hair and dark skin but didn't have a name badge (Or else I would have called her name out here). She had disgusting service and behaviour and had refused to serve or acknowledge us as we stood in front of her counter. \n\nEven after catching her attention, she continued giving attitude and made us continually wait without explanation.
