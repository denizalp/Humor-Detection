For a cheap sucker like me this place is where I'd build a home. \nYou'll be swimming in cheap beers and gorged with after 8 specials on pierogies, tacos, and pizza boats. The people are friendly enough, the food is good for the price, the place isn't too dirty (or if it was I didn't notice it), and your buddies can smoke all they want inside.  \nThe area is a bit sketchy at night, but I've seen worse.
