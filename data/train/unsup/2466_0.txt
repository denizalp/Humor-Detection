First of all, this place is first class and it was built for its residents, not for the folks that live down the hill or Buckeye. If Talisa U is complaining  about not letting her join our residents club, it's because you're not a resident within the community.... I get that you like shopping up here instead of buckeye, that's why we all live up here, it's safe and clean and we want to keep it that way, move up here is the simple answer.
