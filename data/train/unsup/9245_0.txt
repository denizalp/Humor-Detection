I am convinced that this original location is better than the second location. If you've never tried Komex, try this one! The cooking surfaces are more well-seasoned here because it used to be a Chinese restaurant?\n\nStick with the fusion tacos, and order the Korean wings if you're tempted.\n\nThe bulgogi and kimchee here don't necessarily impress as standalone items, but in a taco you should enjoy them?\n\nIt used to be really cheap to eat here, now it's not as cheap, but still somewhere between Chipotle and Lindo Michoacan...
