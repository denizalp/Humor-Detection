Good College memories! They have decent drinks! Specially the blue guy! They have good themes different days, it's a nice small bar  and with a nice dance floor and a nice patio. The only nasty thing is that the floors are ALWAYS sticky, and it is a 50\/50 chance that the bar will smell like puke! Other han that it is a decent bar!
