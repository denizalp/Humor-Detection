This is the only Taco Bell within decent distance of University Circle, so naturally, this location gets super overwhelmed at the drive-through. It's also in East Cleveland, but that never stopped anyone before.\n\nI've seen huge lines for the drive-through, but they get through it in 10 minutes. It's a sight to see.\n\nAnd the food? It's Taco Bell. It's just fine. I've never had bad food or an order mixup come from here, so it deserves my high marks.
