The PB&J milkshake is fire. Great decor and great service. No idea what that Donna lady is talking about, the coffee is fantastic. Desert winds uses their Burundi blend that isn't plain at all. Gotta love yelp food\/beverage critics that have no concept of taste. Nice to see a local coffee roaster providing the coffee to a business on the strip.
