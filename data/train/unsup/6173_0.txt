Sushi was good. Happy hour is worth it. Can't really judge the service, she was new. Still did good. The kitchen took foooooorever. 45 minutes to get a chicken teriyaki bowl. Restaurant wasn't busy at all. No excuse. Only one sushi chef working so the rolls took a long time to come out. 2 hour overall experience. Way to long. But like I said earlier, the sushi and rolls were good. Worth a 4th star if it didn't take so long.
