So so so awful! I really don't understand people that like this place. Their salsa is 99% FROZEN corn with a couple chunks of crappy, tasteless tomatoes. Stale, cold chips. Asked for another salsa because heard another table ordering the \"tomato salsa\" and they literally brought us jarred salsa-- like Pace or Tostitos out of a jug and it was ice cold. They didn't even try to dress it up. The tacos were okay-- the white cilantro sauce looks good but had no flavor. So bad, so so bad.
