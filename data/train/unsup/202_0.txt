Are you LGBTQ? Do you hate dealing with clueless health professionals (sample clueless doctor convo: \"Are you sexually active?\" \"Yes\" \"What kind of birth control do you use?\" \"um, none. I'm in a monogamous relationship with a woman.\" \"Oh. do your parents approve of your 'lifestyle'?\" - asked when I was THIRTY!) This is the place. Very caring doctors and nurses, diverse staff. lots of services, very active in the community. I hate the process for making appointments, but other than that, they're beyond great.
