This stunner was a block from our hotel...and it is just that.  Loved it when they rang the bells.\n\nI am a bit odd, and loved the old building alongside better.  I guess I am not into the architectural *over-indulgence* seen here, and in many churches. \n\nA *must see* for sure, most folks seem to love it.
