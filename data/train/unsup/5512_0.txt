I'm visiting NC from MD and I told my husband for breakfast today I wanted diner food. We yelped away and found this gem. The service was excellent and the food was awesome! We had a bit of everything. Veggie omelette, bacon and ham omlette, grits, and a waffle. It was all awesome! I highly recommend this place. The price is juuuuust right too! Its definitely nicer than your usual diner. We may actually be back for dinner.
