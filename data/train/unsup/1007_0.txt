The espresso is good. Pastries are okay. Atmosphere is uptight or maybe it was just during my visit but the owner micromanaged EVERY LITTLE THING the employees did, down to how the put whipped cream in a dome lid! Back off and chill out, dude. Geez. Oh and no wifi, which is the main reason I wont be back. The owner sat on his tablet for an hour, using wifi, but doesnt want customers to be able to do the same? I dont know if hes cheap or just egocentric, but Im out!!
