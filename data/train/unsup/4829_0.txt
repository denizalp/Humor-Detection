Love the sweet potato fries here, it's worth the upgrade! I always get either the mushroom burger, royal red robin, or the regular chicken sandwich. I love how they cook my burger med rare, and the strawberry lemonade, or the flavored teas go great with the burgers. If you're extra hungry, try the stacked onion rings, but don't forget the fries are bottomless, and really yummy. There can be a long wait some nights, but Never too bad. :)
