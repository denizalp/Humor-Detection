Deliberately OverBilled- Had to call Credit Card Company to void the transaction. \n\nI had the Chicken & Shrimp Pad Thai for Lunch. Small portions... and overpriced at $14.22. Now i know why that place is always empty on any given day....(Ballantyne Location). The servers are rude, and the manager Jennifer is extremely uneducated and unprofessional. Will Never Go there again including the uptown location.
