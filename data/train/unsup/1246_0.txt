Vegas for my first time? Like I had to do it.\n\nSo after a bottle for Hennessy for breakfast, I believed it to be very clever to chug as much Fat Tuesday as I could. (Don't do it I threw up out of the car)\n\nEven though I survived many brain freezes, the Mango Fat Tuesday was so good and I felt like it tasted like alcohol which I like. They have this giganto lanyard to drink and walk but damn I missed arm day cause it was heavy.\n\nYou must sin in SIN CITY!!!!
