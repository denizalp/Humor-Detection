I just moved in and the office staff has been nothing but helpful. They are very receptive, friendly, and got back to me within minutes of reporting a problem! I highly recommend Bella Sera to anyone looking for an accommodating, fairly priced, and family friendly apartment complex in the Phoenix area.
