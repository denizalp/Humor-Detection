Great salon, great haircut and style with the friendly and artistic Biz!  Thanks for making my day better.  :) \n\nShe gave a great shampoo and even rubbed my neck during the conditioning!  Listened to what I wanted for my haircut and took extra time styling it.  If you are in Vegas and near Mandalay Bay, take the time to go visit Biz at the Robert Cromeans Salon, you won't regret it!
