Great Gallery in the Miracle Mile. I am used to seeing Wyland's art as I appreciate it, but this gallery also had quite a few other artists. Each piece was worth studying and we really enjoyed Alexei Buttirskiy's work. He has a way of making something with a cold background come to life with a warmness that is comforting. \n\nThere was a very kind associate that worked there and even gave us a copy of the artist's background information. \n\nIf you like art, and you like learning about it, this is a great gallery to check out.
