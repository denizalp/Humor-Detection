Guys I had so much!! Thanks for the meet up with 3 different ladies. You girls were the best at having dinner with. The food was spectacular! The drinks were on point. I even left with a slight buzz. I can't believe I won. Sadly, my dog was extremely excited to see and made me drop my basket and I shattered my Arizona coffee cup (crying emoji) i had an over all good time. The bartender Catalyna was the sweetest. She really did a great job this evening.
