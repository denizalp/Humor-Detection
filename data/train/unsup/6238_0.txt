Beware of Darren, the manager who will threaten you with collections even when you don't owe them any money and who will refuse to give you his name when you ask for it and will hang up on you when you insist. \n\nIf you want to join Massage Envy, go to a different facility. Keep your blood pressure low. Avoid Darren. And if you're wondering how I got his name? I had to call my home facility to call this facility to find out his name.\n\nYes. Seriously.
