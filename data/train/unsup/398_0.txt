I am so disappointed! I stopped in yesterday to see if they had a boneless turkey breast. The guy behind the counter asked me to come back in 20 minutes and he would have it ready. I assumed it would be an unstuffed boneless turkey breast. When I returned I was pleasantly surprised when he said it was ready and at the cash. I bought it and cooked it tonight with all the thanksgiving trimmings. What he actually gave me was stuffed chicken breast! What the hell?!?! I am so angry and will never shop there again. Shady business!
