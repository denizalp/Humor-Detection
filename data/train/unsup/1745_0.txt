Nevada Chicken Caf√© catered my companys Christmas Party and man did they bring a TON of food.\n\nThey do Chicken-rotissere-grilled chicken-a little dry compared to El Pollo Loco but good non the less.\n\nThey also had ribs which were VERY tough & dry.\n\nDefinitely would NOT do the ribs again.\n\nThe side were a little bland & boring-mac-n-cheese,some orange looking rice and salads.\n\nThey have great prices so it may be worth checking out again when its NOT catered but made to order.
