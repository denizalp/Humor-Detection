I love Canada, Canadians, Poutine, Maple Syrup,  and are considered by many to be a true and longstanding friend of theCanadian people which is why I cannot remain silent about the airport,  which is beautiful and great, but is such a slog to get through.  It took almost 2 hours to get  a bag checked and through security. .. and that's for a DOMESTIC flight... on a Tuesday! .  International flights are even more torturous and maddening. Why? \n\nThese poor people were in line in front of me at security.  The horror...!
