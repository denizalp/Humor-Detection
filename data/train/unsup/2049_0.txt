Stopped in this Saturday morning without an appointment to get my dog her annual shots.  I was a bit frustrated trying to reach anyone on the phone, so I just stopped by.  Thankfully they were not busy and took me right in.  I was in and out in about 30 minutes.  She got all her shots and friendly service to boot.  No muss, no fuss.  Just how I like it.  They do need to install an automatic door though as when you are carrying an animal, grabbing the door handle isn't the easiest thing in the world.
