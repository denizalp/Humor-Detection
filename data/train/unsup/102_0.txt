A standard issue Game Stop - small, nice, clean, good selection. The sales person was knowledgeable an pleasant, and they had both items we came in to buy. They sell most things at suggested retail price, but it's nice because you can trade in games that you're tired of.  It's definitely a small, spendy place, but for video game fans (and their loved ones), it's a haven :-)
