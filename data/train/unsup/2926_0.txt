To Update this even further, No TIptoeing around it anymore.  The Broker's name that was the offender is named Michael Lucchesi.  I was trying to be nice and not call him out, BUT he had the nerve to continue his harassment today and called me at home when he noticed the Yelp review.  So, DO NOT EVER USE Michael Lucchesi.
