I love going to eat here. I really like the outdoor and indoor dining areas. All the food I have ordered has not disappointed me at all. Their onion rings are to die for and I am not a fan of onion rings at all.  I love the different flavors of lemonade. I like how they have a lot of options on the menu. I would recommend this place to any and everyone.
