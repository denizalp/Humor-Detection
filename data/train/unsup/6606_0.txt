Just had lunch here with a friend. I had the orange chicken lunch special. The service was good, they refilled my water quickly, and checked in on us multiple times. However, the food was \"alright\", I didn't really feel like it was anything special. It wasn't bad, but I probably won't be craving this or going my way to get it anytime soon.
