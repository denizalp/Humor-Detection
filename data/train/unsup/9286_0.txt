They have a great patio and great food.  \n\nTheir bar menu is very good and substantial so you can eat delicious food for a reasonable price.  \n\nI also really enjoy their wine list.  You can get many great wines by the glass and they also don't mark up their by the bottle prices either.  I have never had a bad meal and the service is friendly too!
