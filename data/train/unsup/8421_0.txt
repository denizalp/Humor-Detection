I live within walking distance and have been coming here for over a year and never a problem...The Barista's  are fabulous....They are ok with remaking it if you are not satisfied...The customer service here is 5 plus!!! I sit and write from time to time and they offer extras...Love this location...Warm Springs off of Stephanie is horrible...Customers beware!!!
