One of the #WORST experiences I've ever had at your bar! Tonight on September 16 sitting at the bar waited 17 till I got served. I waited for my order to be punched in. It seemed like a bunch of newbies working that night! I've been in this industry for 16 years and I found tonight to be the worst experience ever!
