Heard many things about this steak house but if I could give it a zero I would. I ordered the most expensive steak expecting it wonderful only to find out about 95% of the steak was inedible. The rest of my party was the same way the food was bland and I should not need to cover it with a bunch of steak sauce. If you are looking for a good steak house stay away from here.
