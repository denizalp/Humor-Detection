1st time here and had a great experience. Initially sat at bar while waiting for a table. There was a long wait while there where several open tables. Maybe they were short staffed. Only 1 bartender for a bar full of people at 3pm on a Saturday. \nOnce we got our table for 6 our waitress was good. We only ordered cocktails but she was attentive. \nDefinitely be back. I can see what the rave is with an interesting and big variety of food and cocktails. With our favorite 3 Olives grape vodka.
