Cute place but what a rip off. $30 for a pedicure and my feet are still extremely dry and the \"massage\" that cost extra I could've done myself. I will not be returning here..customer service was terrible and the lady that did the pedicure was extremely rude and acted like she was way better then anyone on the planet.
