Solid neighbourhood burger joint. Fries are good, rings are good, burgers are really good. I get a side of chili (small one is like a buck) and drop it on my burger - awesome. Been going there about once a month forever. Magoo's and Magic Spot are the two great places for burgers in the Royal York\/Bloor neck of the woods.
