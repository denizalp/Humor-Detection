Not 5 stars just because it's Americanized Chinese food, but not meaning it isn't good! I'm definitely a person in favor of authentic Chinese food, but this place is pretty good. \n\nI've been here twice and very pleased with what I got. My favorite is the flavorful beef stomach. They're delicious.\n\nAlso, the oxtail soup, dao mew vegetable and sea bass is very good as well. Quite pricey but it's vegas. So it's okay!
