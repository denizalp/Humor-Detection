This is not a lifetime fitness by any means, but compared to where I was it offers quite a bit more, e.g., dumbbells that go higher than 75lbs, aactual squat racks, and many true bench presses so I am thrilled.  Albeit some of the equipment could be in better shape however.   For the price of  $10\/mth and basically 24hrs, I'll be a member for awhile.
