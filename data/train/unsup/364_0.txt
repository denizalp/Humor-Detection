This gelatto joint has the perfect name. The owner of this store is legitimately an artist with her edible creations! She gave me a sample of her strawberry, vinaigrette, pepper gelatto and I was amazed. That sounds like a terrible mix, but somehow she makes magic happen and continually creates masterpieces with all of her flavors.
