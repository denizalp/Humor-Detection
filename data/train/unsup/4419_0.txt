Went to try this place for the 1st time from yelp. We had a party of 7. We ordered food and only 3 people got their meals. We waited for 30-45 minutes and finally went to complain to owner He very rudely said that it is a Sunday night and we are very busy. When my husband finally received his pasta, it came out cold.
