This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Vegas. It's small and intimate with it never being loud or crazy busy even on a Friday night. Our favorite items are the Sizzling Eel and Dragon Roll with Edamame being our appetizer and using their free ice cream for dessert (you get the coupon upon check in on yelp). For two people, that fills us right up. Quite a hidden gem!
