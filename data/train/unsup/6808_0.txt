Tres Potrillos is just your average tasting Mexican cuisine.  I've eaten lunch there way more than I should but it's because of two situations:\n\n1.) The Default Route:\n\"Where do you want to go for lunch?\"\n\"I don't know....where do you want to go?\"\n\"F#$k it, let's just go to Tres.\"\n\n2.) The Squeeze:\n\"Want to go to lunch?\"\n\"Sure.  I only have 30 mins though before my next conference call.\"\n\"Welp, I guess that means we're going to Tres.\"
