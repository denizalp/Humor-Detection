Do not ever I mean ever rent a car from this place. The worse damn customer service ever.. This low budget a$$ place, take your money to dollar or budget anybody but here.  Thought hertz was top of the line, boy was I fooled. But believe me if they were the last rental car place on earth I will just have to walk, bike, boat, uber, lyft or taxis.. Never will you ever receive one penny of my money ever again!
