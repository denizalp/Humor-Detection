Are they my nails or acrylic? Second time going to Nab and I absolutely loved and appreciated how well my nails held up between the 2weeks! Prices are reasonable and fair. Nail technicians didn't make me feel rushed and made me feel comfortable. Salon is super clean and the energy is professional but fun. Think I just found my forever home nail spot for sure!
