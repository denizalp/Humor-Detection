When the place  first opened it was very good.  The food was fresh and very tasty.  Every since those first visits the food and service has been on a downward slide.  My last visit featured a broken toothpick in my corned beef sandwich.  They didn't even comp the meal, they acted like it was my fault.  The owner walks around like he just swallowed a turd.  Avoid this place!
