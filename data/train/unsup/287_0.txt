We went for lunch on a Monday (2 adults; 2 teens).  We all ordered something different and everyone was pleased with what they got.  The Spoon  Salad - was a large entry and we ended up bringing half of it home.  My daughter who is a big FATZ fan got the Soup and Spread and indicated she likes this place better than FATZ.\n\nPrices were reasonable, about $7 per entree for lunch.  Desserts were interesting served in mini- mason jars.  Not a coconut fan, but I liked that one better than the apple cake.
