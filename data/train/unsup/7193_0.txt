My Husband Beau had been complaining for a while about his haircuts so he did some research and finally found Dylan's Salon! He ended up with David as a stylist and ended up with a pretty debonair cut that was perfect for him! Mix of trendy, professional and classic! My husband and I are very particular and picky so we do t take a strong liking to many things but so far so good! If your looking for a talented mens hair stylist then see David.
