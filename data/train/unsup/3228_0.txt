Awesome!  I had a busy day and found out about this place by looking up laundromats in the area, I just dropped off my laundry and picked it up on the same day, everything sorted and folded, awesome!  One note that should be mentioned is that it's a cash only business, no interac but I had cash on me so no worries!  I would definitely recommend.
