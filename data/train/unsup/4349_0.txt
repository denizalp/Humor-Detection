Nice quaint place to sit outside and have some drinks but forget the food! No bueno for the price! Our Ahi Tuna Cevechi was all ketchup liquid  with about one table spoon of chopped of jalape√±os and onion and 1 tablespoons of tuna it's served in a large margarita glass! But Francisco was wonderful he made it ALL RIGHT! Thanks Francisco your the best
