WOW FANTASTIC SERVICE, FOOD AND DRINKS!\n\nRonalea & Daphine were both extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We had many questions and they answered it throughly and were very patient. Quick service! Friendly! Knowledgeable! Thank you! I would defiantly come back because of them.\n\nUbe monster is a must if you love ube\/taro! The drink is so fun, perfect for kids with candy and marshmallow toppings.\n\nLychee crush with real fruits, sooooo satisfying and refreshing.\n\nPopcorn chicken and fries are very good too!\n\nFavorite boba tea spot in Vegas, this location is closer for me but they have other locations too.
