Came here in the afternoon with a friend. The place was super cute and clean, and the service was reallly awesome! Our server was extremely friendly. We got our orders very fast.\n\nI had the blended honeydew boba, and it seriously tasted like honeydew-flavored Bubble Yum- which was delicious!\n\nUsually when I pass this place by, it's in the evening, and it's very crowded. I'm glad I had the unfettered experience of checking it out in the off hours!
