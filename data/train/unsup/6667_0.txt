After coming back from eating a lot of ahi poke in kaua'i I found this place on yelp.  I go there and it looks like they are sold out.  Dennis the owner said he can make it to order so I order three pounds spicy, shoyu, and limu.  So far I ate about a pound and a half and I would say it is good.  Also Dennis is a nice guy.
