The bartender Sierra and server Cage are the combo to have. The wife and I sat down for a Sunday dinner and unfortunately the steak the wife ordered came out over done... Sierra and Cage took care of it. Cage insisted that it was cooked to order. It was a great experience having such great customer service and the wife and I will be traveling back to that specific outback because of them two.
