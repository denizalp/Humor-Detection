Vinny was amazing! I am not a pizza fan at all. In fact, I only like pizza in New York... My friends wanted to eat here & I opted to just hang out but Vinny wasn't havin' it. He went out of his way to make me two slices exactly the way I wanted. It was delicious! Not only does it taste amazing but the service is unbeatable!
