Starpoint\/Sapphire Resort group is a huge scam.   They make all sorts of claims and promises to get you to buy and then don't come through unless you give them more money for \"upgrades.\"  We tried a few of their resorts and they were run down, far from tourist areas, and unavailable unless booked far in advance (we were told it was perfect for last-minute getaways).  Please don't let them fool you, they just want your money.
