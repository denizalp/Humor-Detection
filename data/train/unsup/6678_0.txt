We have been to Jason's Deli in other cities and never really been impressed but this one impressed us! We had a quick light lunch on a Saturday while touring uptown Charlotte. From the minute we walked in, the staff was very friendly. We split a sandwich and they even put it on 2 plates for us. They reminded us of the complimentary muffins, crackers, pickles and ice cream and the panini sandwich was delicious!
