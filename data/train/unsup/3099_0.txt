After years of swearing this place off like the plague, I went back Friday night.  Why?? A gift card for Christmas.\n\nThe good part is it wasn't the ordeal I remember.  Actually I hadn't ever been to this location before, but definitely smile every time I pass the CLOSED store in Chandler.\n\nFood and service were as expected.  I didn't expect much and they fully complied.
