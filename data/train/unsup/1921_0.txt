Oh my god the cinnamon bun pancakes were DELICIOUS! I only ordered off SkipTheDishes but this place was really good. We got a basically breakfast plate with eggs and all that which was good. But the pancakes were really the star of the dish. I dream about these pancakes sometimes when I have a craving for something sweet. I highly recommend them.
