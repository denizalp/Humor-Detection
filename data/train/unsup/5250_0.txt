Absolutely awful. I wouldn't feed this slop to my dog. Sent it back twice because it was cold. After watching them prepare it I understand why. They cook the meat far in advance and then put it back on the grill for a few minutes, slap some sauce on it and put it over steamed rice. Nothing fresh here. Move along...
