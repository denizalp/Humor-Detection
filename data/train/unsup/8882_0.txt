Great spot for a group. We ordered a lot of dishes to share and glad we did. Empanada trio, brussel sprouts and chimichurri steak stood out. Shrimp cerviche and gnudi were just ok. We also took advantage of the special price wine (Decoy for $30!). I'd recommend making a trip off the strip for the Fremont experience.
