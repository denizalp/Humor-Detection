5 stars for the filet mignon.  I was thinking that maybe it was the 5 drinks I had before dinner but my wife agreed and said this was one of the top 3 filets she had ever eaten.  How did they cook it so well and different from every other place we've been?\n\nI wasn't that big on the atmosphere..I didn't think it was that romantic but I did appreciate the whole \"tucked away\" factor.  And is the menu even really that French? Who cares!!  Get the filet and be happy.
