This is not real Jamaican food. Made reservations for 8:30pm had to wait for 8:30pm on the dot to get a table. Informed owner it was my Husband's bday celebration, no acknowledgement what so ever. Drinks are okay, not worth the $150 check. I recommend to go back to the island and do some tasting. Don't spend your money here.
