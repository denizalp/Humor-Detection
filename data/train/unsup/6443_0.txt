Ended up having to stay here after power outage on base... I definetely underestimate this place! I've been to the casino many times prior to staying here, and the casino is really not all that great, so i expected the rooms to be old and outdated- wrong! Our room was so nice! and the bed was amazinly comfortable and the rooms were all up to date. we didn't want to leave so we extended our stay!
