Reviewer # 42\nWalmart is Walmart. Everyone know who they are, what they sell (which isn't much) and how the lines are crazy bad usually. I was visiting Vegas and forgot a few hygiene related things, so we went to Walmart. It seems as though everyone here just didn't care and was rude as can be. \n\nI left feeling a bit flustered with the customer service. Not everyone is a criminal!
