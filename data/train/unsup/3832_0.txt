Typical Panini's.  Nice interior.  Crowd can be a little strange, I think it just depends on the day.  \nLast time we were there my friend and I got hit on by a man that had \"no game\".  We actually wrote him a list of all the things he did wrong.  We felt that we needed to do this for all woman kind.
