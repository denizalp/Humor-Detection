I've been a regular for more than a year and the past few times, I've been extremely disappointed in the food.  Poached eggs were closer to hard-boiled, and today's short rib hash was barely warm, the potatoes were under-cooked, and while the menu describes the dish as having onions and peppers, there was literally one piece of a roasted red pepper and one piece of onion.  That's a lot of disappointment for $15.95.  Has there been a change of kitchen staff?  The service, on the other hand, did not disappoint.
