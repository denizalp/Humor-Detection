Been searching for an rv for a while, wasnt sure if i wanted a travel trailer to pull with the jeep wrangler, which means a tear drop ( light weight) or a class c coach and pull the jeep.\nFinally decided on a winnebago fuse, sent out quote request to a few dealers. Findlay the only one to call me back in a day.\nThey had the model i wanted and helped get into it within a week.\nNo regrets, lots of info an training when i toke delivery.
