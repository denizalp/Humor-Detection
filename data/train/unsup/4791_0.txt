Used to eat here often, especially since it has outdoor seating and is family friendly. The Fontina Burger and Tuna Burger were our favorites. We stopped going here after we saw that Joe's hosted a fundraiser for a local Tea Party candidate that featured none other than the Queen of Mean herself--Sarah Palin. So this may bolster Joe's reputation for those of you who love Right-Wing politics, but for us, it was a huge turn-off. We would rather spend our money on local businesses who put their funds into Progressive candidates or simply back into the community.
