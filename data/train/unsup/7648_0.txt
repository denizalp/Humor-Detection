Eh, not sure if I like this place or not. \n\nThursday oysters for 1.50 were good. Large and cold. Too much cocktail sauce served with them. The other specials looked enticing but questionable. \n\nMy drink was weak and pricy. \n\nNo smoking in it. Bar or restaurant? Confusing.\n\nCustomer service was just ok. I like my bartenders  with a smile.. A little flirty too.
