We arrive a waiter takes our drink order. Then informs us. There is a shift change. As we wait for this (2)min change they keep seating ppl around us. Ignore us as they take everyone else drink order and food order. Before us even tho they arrived way way after. We waited about 20 min so finally ask for a check. \nDo not come here.
