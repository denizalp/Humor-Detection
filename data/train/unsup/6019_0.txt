Might be best to stick with the noodles here. The carbonara was rich and flavorful, enjoyed by all. Big thumbs up for the pork belly bao bun. Friendly service.\n\nDisappointed in the rice dishes mainly because the rice itself was soggy. When the abundant juice from the meat toppings is added, then the bowl turns rather soupy and unappealing. Strongly suggest to reconsider the rice cooking process or switch to a drier rice variety.
