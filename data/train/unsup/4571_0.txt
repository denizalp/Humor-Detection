I ate here today for the first time since I was an ASU student long ago - it was as good as I remember. Better, because i have a more sophisticated palette now.\n\nThe hummus was yummus.\n\nThe baba ghanooj nearly made me spooj.\n\nThe tabouli ruled me.\n\nI love the olives. Real olives. Not from a shitty can. I am an olive snob. Trust me. Order the side of olives. Do it!\n\nYes this review is shamelessly blatantly fishing for cool and or funny ratings.\n\nGive me one then go to Hajis.
