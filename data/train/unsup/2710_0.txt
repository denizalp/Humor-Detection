I love this little joint. The restaurant is small but it truly makes one of my favorite pizzas in town. They have a pretty diverse menu with unique pizzas. Their price point is also very reasonable and affordable. One of my favorite pizzas are the white pizzas, in particular the art of chicken. The service is also good they try to make you feel as comfortable as possible. So if you are looking for a laid back and tasty pizza this is the place to go!
