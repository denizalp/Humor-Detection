I've been to Yeti twice now, and both times I haven't been completely satisfied with the service. While the price is decent, I wasn't happy with the quality I received. Both times my pedicure chipped within a few days. Additionally, I spent more time under the dryer than I did in the actual pedicure chair (40 minutes under the dryer without someone stopping to check on me was a little ridiculous). Needless to say I expected better service. Maybe third time's the charm, but I don't think I'll be back to take that chance.
