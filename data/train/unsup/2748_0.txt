Saturday night vibes were welcomed here as we listened to a great band for the second and third set\nThey have a mandatory cost check of $2 and mandatory fee if $10 per person that the Maitre D tells you will be added to your bill\nThe dinner menu choices are prefixed or a la carte\nI enjoyed a pre fixed menu\nI would definitely return here
