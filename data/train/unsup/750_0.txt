My favourite coffee shop in the city with one of the best patios, reminiscent of Paris. The patio seats are all lined up, overlooking Riverdale Park and with expansive views of the Toronto skyline. Try to leave time and have your coffee outside. \n\nThe interior is nicely decorated. Coffees are amongst the best in the city and staff very approachable if you have questions. They have a a large assortment of beverages and snacks, and decent pricing.
