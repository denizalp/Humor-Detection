I keep getting a leak in one of my tires from a dented rim that stems from a previous run into a massive pot hole.  I went into this Big O so that I can get some pricing on new rims and Nick was extremely helpful and gave me a # of options, including repairing my rims to purchasing new rims.  I will be visiting them soon once I decide on what option I would like to take. Thanks Nick for your honest help!
