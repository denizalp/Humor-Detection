Pei Wei is one of our favorite fast service chains. This meal was definitely missing something. Mine was Coconut Curry Chicken, husbands was Chicken Pad Thai. We both agreed it was missing some zing and depth to the flavor. This is not a Pei Wei issue, this is a local issue because we have had these dishes elsewhere and been satisfied.
