I would give 0 stars if it was possible. I find it very hard to believe that I was ignored by accident! Felt very discriminated against here. Oh! And when you ask for names so you can speak with the owner about it, they'll tell u they don't have to give it. Very convenient! Never returning, going back to PHOENIX WELLNESS CENTER! Do not waste your money or time here!
