I had never had this glorious treat until one of my fellow writers on GotGame introduced me to it at a conference in LA. Lucky for me, Rita's is not in LA -- it's right down the road from me.\n\nI mean, what's not to like? Cool treats that melt on your tongue, plenty of flavors, nice people... it's simple goodness.\n\nSometimes simple is just plain nice. YEAH I SAID IT LAS VEGAS WITH ALL YOUR FANCY PANTS LIGHTS AND MAGICAL DANCING FOUNTAINS AND CIRQUES OF SOLEILS AND STUFFS! So there.
