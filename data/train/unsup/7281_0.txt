Bought a hellcat. Brand new off the show room floor. There's a hole in the back seat, and a few major paint defects. Runs in the paint, paint missing in the door jams and a huge fish eye that it looks like they tried to cover up and hit a piece of molding.\n\nUpdate 4\/11\/18 \n\nWorking with corporate to make this right. I will edit my review for good or worse once they reach out to me.
