Always delicious!! I wish more people came here to give them more business as well as their location in Ahwatukee. \n\nOnly thing they need to work on is staffing. Everyone is so nice but they need more help. Sometimes the ones taking the orders cook as well making people who walk in wait and I saw people walk out after waiting so long.\n\n\nFoods delicious!!!\nThe lunch special with the beef is outstanding and the green chicken panini is a must.
