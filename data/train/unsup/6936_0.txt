Busy all day, everyday for sure!\n\nThis is one of the very few spots i know of that can serve two people and keep the total bill under $20.\nOther than ramen on the menu, you can get some fried rice or fried pork to munch on. Variety is always better when theres more than one belly at the table.\nSeating is very limited.. we are talking about 5 tables and a bar to fit 10 people total so be prepared to wait for a table to open.\n\nToo cheap to not come and stop by for some fast served ramen! =d
