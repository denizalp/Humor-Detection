Had to give it another try. Big mistake. The waitress acted like we were a bother to her (there was one other table; it was no where near closing time). She was rude from the minute we sat down until we left even after many attempts to \"kill her with kindness.\"\n\nWhat is the point of having \"the best craft beer list\" if your staff knows nothing about the beer, serves it in the wrong glass, and the glass they do serve it in reeks of  bleach and is filthy?\n\nI won't be returning and I'd advise others to stay away.
