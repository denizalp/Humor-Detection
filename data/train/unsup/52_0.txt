I knew a year ago I had to get the carpet out from upstairs and decided to go for last month. Travis was able to match the wood laminate from my downstairs perfectly. They were in communication with me often in the days before the install. They move anything I couldn't out of the way and did everything in one day. Absolutely gorgeous! There were 3 guys and they were friendly, professional, and cleaned up when they were done. I would recommend them to anyone and everyone for whatever flooring needs you have!
