Surprisingly good. I was just walking out of the South Point sports book and saw this place. Excellent steak. The Decor is a little out dated, but very good food. I had no idea this place was even there. Glad I walked by. Someone was telling me they have been around for quite some time. I guess they moved from the strip to this location a while ago.
