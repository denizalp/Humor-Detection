When your biggest complaint about a store is the long checkout times... and that's only because there are so many customers and all of the registers are already open, then it's not really a complaint at all.  Their executive membership also is a bit steep at $120 per year... but at least I get cash back on my purchases.\n\nWith all of that said, I loooove Costco!  Their Kirkland Signature products are high quality and you can also expect too quality from the rest of their products too!\n\nAnd those $5 rotisserie chickens?  Get one on each visit!\n\n*****FIVE STARS*****
