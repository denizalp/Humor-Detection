Very decent coffee but the counter people were extremely impersonal to the point where they don't even look you in the eye, I had to wait like five minutes to ask for a coffee while the employee was texting somebody like while I was standing and looking at her, talk about rude. Then I asked for a bit of soymilk and the other counter person just shrugged, and it was like my request was ignored. Plus the prices were kind of high. Might as well rename the place Pompous Lion.
