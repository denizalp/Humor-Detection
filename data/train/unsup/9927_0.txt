Adjusted shift to work a late Friday and ended up here for dinner before punching out.\nI have done my best to eat pencils and avoid ever having to come back here.  On this particular occasion, I was out ranked.\n\nWhat I found was a completely different experience.  The two super friendly ladies making delicious sandwiches behind the counter were hustling all the while with smiles on their faces.\n\nI wonder just how successful this franchise would be having these two wonder woman rocking the lunch rush?\n\nMy sandwich was awesome.  The side of happiness added to my combo meal made it pop!
