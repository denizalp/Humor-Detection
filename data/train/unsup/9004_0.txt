Went here around 10:45 on Saturday night. It was pretty busy, but we were able to grab a seat at the bar. The bartender came right over & we had our drinks within 5 minutes. Good atmosphere & crowd. Nothing fancy but they have a gold beer selection & full bar. Not too expensive by downtown standards either
