My order was wrong and when I called they wouldn't replace it so then I ask if I bring them back can they be replaced still no. So then I start to place a whole new order, because we're still hungry, and they charged to have it delivered I asked if it could be discounted and was told no. So I cancelled the second order.. and have to deal with this wrong order.. they didn't even apologize.
