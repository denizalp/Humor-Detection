I had the Eggs Benedict.  The English muffin was like cardboard (OK, that may be a little flattering), and the sauce was flavorless and failed to add anything to the eggs.  The juice came in something akin to a shot glass.  There are lots of better choices to get breakfast in Las Vegas than this place.
