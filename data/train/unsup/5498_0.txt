I wish that the seating here was a little different but it was a food court so keep that in mind. I ordered the lobster Mac which was decent and my fianc√© ordered a lobster roll with fries. He says the lobster roll was very well made and the fries could've been cooked a little longer. All in all for a quick bite, this place is okay. Prices are a little high.
