We've ordered here twice and it always took at least 30 minutes for our food to be ready. The first visit, I ordered the tinapa fried rice. There is no tinapa AT ALL! It was just all rice and barely had any flavor. The second time I ordered bangusilog, tapasilog, and arroz caldo. The bangus was a good size, like half of the fish. The arroz caldo and beef tapa were really salty. \nI don't think I'll be coming back here again.
