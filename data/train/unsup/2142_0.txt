The Sunday Breakfast buffet was amazing! Hands down the best breakfast restaurant I've had in a while. Will come back for sure.  Make sure you're hungry because they have everything you can imagine in a Mexican breakfast plus more. Omelettes made to request, fresh tortillas, beans, rice, menudo, ceviche, cereal and all types of desserts. They had unlimited aguas frescas and pan dulce!!I can't wait for Sunday.
