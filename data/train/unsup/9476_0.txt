Easily the best tree service in Pittsburgh.  I needed a 30ft pine tree removed and, where most other services didn't want the job because it was too small, Hellman's Tree Service was more than willing to help.  I left them a voicemail and they got back to me the next day with a very reasonable quote.  They came out about a week or two later and had the tree cut down in only a few hours with no mess.  Overall, very professional, prompt, and reasonably priced.  Call these guys first.
