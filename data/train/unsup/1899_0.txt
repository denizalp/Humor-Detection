I traveled 20 miles from my office to near my wife's office as she invited me for lunch on my birthday. She took me to this restaurant and indeed it was best selection. \n\nQuality food , quality ambience and good time together. Must try crispy chicken thighs appetizer. Don't come without eating it. Also we took fish and chips. Their courtesy that they plated it for us and we felt like they brought 2 quantity of order for us. Good service as well. Must place to visit in phoenix downtown.
