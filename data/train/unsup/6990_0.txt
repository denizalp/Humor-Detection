2 years later and still the best buffet in Las Vegas hands down.  The presentation of the dishes, the quality, and the variety all make for an enjoyable experience.  The design of the restaurant in also so beautiful !!  They make all their ice creams in-house, offering unique flavors like Thai Tea and Peanut Butter and Jelly.  Sooooo Good!  Save room for dessert!
