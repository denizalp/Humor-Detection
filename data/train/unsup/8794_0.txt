What's a good way to make up for a night of getting all dressed up and just standing around? \n\nI answer that question with, Sonic. Open late and providing decent food and beverage is always a good look. Snack sized Popcorn Chicken and a Cherry Limeade Slush, was just the tits. Couldn't ask for a better way to wrap up the evening. Service was a little slow for my tastes, one star dockage, but all and all, good filling stuff.\n\nNow I'm just hoping to fall asleep soon.
