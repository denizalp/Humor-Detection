***This National is a good car rental option at the Phoenix International Airport; their prices are reasonable and their Emerald Aisle provides a great selection of vehicles for you to choose from; their fuel refilling options are also a much better deal than Hertz***\n\nI am not sure if parking is available for people just needing to stop by at this car rental complex.
