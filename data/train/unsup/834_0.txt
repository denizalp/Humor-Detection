Chef Rudy welcomed us seated us at our table.  The first service was very slow outta the gate and first server, a young lady never brought my iced tea. It took a long time for the next server to take our order and the garlic rolls to come. Once we were served our salads the service improved immensely and the entrees were delicious. We had chicken scallopini and chicken parmesan.  Chef Rudy came by twice to check on us.
