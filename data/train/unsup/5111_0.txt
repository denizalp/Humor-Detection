While I was out and about one day I stopped in here to get my toenails tended to. My toenails griw faster than lightening speed and my workout shoes become painful if  not cut short.\n\nThe place is clean, a major plus in my book.  May did my pedicure and she was very thorough.  No complaints.\n\nI'll be back fo sho!
