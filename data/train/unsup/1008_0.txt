Do you like it when your bowels want to explode?  Then this is the place for you.  The sad thing is, the aroma coming from the restaurant is hypnotizing as it drifts through the neighborhood, and the staff is really nice, but holy jeebus, does the pizza suck.  Every time we went there we spent the rest of the night in the bathroom.  Awful.
