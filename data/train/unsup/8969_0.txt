The waits are always long. My appointment usually ends up being an hour after it was scheduled, but it is worth it for Dr. Taffett. That man is thorough and good at his job. He was voted one of Phoenix's best doctors! He's performed two surgeries on me and did a great job. I trust this guy for when I go under the knife (I still won't let you have my tonsils, Dr. Taffett!). He's to the point when he talks, so don't expect no bedside manner. Good doctor.
