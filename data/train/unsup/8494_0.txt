Love this place! Service can be slow, but the food is so delicious and authentic. My friend said they have the best croissants she's ever eaten. And lord knows making croissants is a VERY difficult process.\n\nI always get the Moroccan chicken sandwich. I've tried the chipotle sandwich and the pesto sandwich, but the Moroccan has the perfect blend of complex flavors that makes for a fantastic sandwich. Sandwiches come with a (small) side salad. \n\nI don't recommend the juices--they aren't the most appealing.
