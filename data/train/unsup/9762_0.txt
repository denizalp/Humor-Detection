Nothing special in my book. Service in AZ seems to be very leisurely. It's OK if you're used to that, but where I come from, we don't wait 10 minutes before they even take a drink order.\nFood was average, nothing special. They did have some interesting garden to table features. Ordered the market sunflower salad, kale cuban and brussels sprouts & pancetta flatbread. The best being the flatbread and the worst the kale cuban.\nCute ambiance, but I probably wouldn't visit again.
