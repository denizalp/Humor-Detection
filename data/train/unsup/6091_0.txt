Excellent food, service, atmosphere and overall experience!\n\nI love the Boiler House. I've been here about 3 times now, first visit was during Winterlicious a few years back and I have always have a positive experience! Everyone is on the ball, the food has been top-notch and the classical guitar playing during dinner my last time there made the experience all the more pleasant and memorable. I only have positive things to say about this fantastic restaurant.
