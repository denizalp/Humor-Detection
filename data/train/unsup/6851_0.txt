Crepes, delicious crepes. Savory and sweet! And great beers on tap or if you prefer it, French press coffee.\n\nMrs. K and I popped in here on our way to north Charlotte and we were very pleased. She absolutely raved about the Crepe Suzette that she demolished while my crepe with duck confit and caramelized shallots was absolutely excellent. One pot of French press between us was enough to chase away the spiderwebs.\n\nGreat service, not too busy when we stopped in, and excellent food. All we need now is better parking!
