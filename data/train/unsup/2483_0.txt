When we head back to Vegas for our next weekend of trouble and fun, I look forward to stopping at NuWu again. Their clothing selection was awesome, as well as lots of other items in the store. They are building a second building on their property, so that purchasers of cannabis can enjoy on private property. For now, no smoking on their premises, or anywhere publicly in Vegas. \n\nVery large building, really pretty with fountains in side and a great layout. Friendly staff as well.
