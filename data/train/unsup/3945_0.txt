So my experience here started off as positive...nice vibe good decor. The person that seated us said happy hour special was $1 off drafts but by the time the check rolled around they informed us that oh well that 1 beer wasn't on special even though it was on draft. The waitress was told we were informed by host all draft $1 off but she wouldn't honor it... False advertising! If you don't honor what you said then unfortunately we wouldn't return to that establishment.
