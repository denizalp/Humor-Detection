My son bought a beautiful kitchen table set there when their house was built. Within 2 weeks (maybe less) the chairs were falling apart. After many calls and attempts to repair they wouldn't give their money back or exchange. The chairs were not abused. This is a young family, work long hours and take very good care of their household. The price they paid was a very expensive lesson.
