Just started going here (2 visits), and it's my new favorite place. Cool steel heritage environment, great craft beer selection (go just to check out the tap handles), and the stuffed meatball appetizer is awesome. If you're going to the waterfront, you need to check this place out on 8th avenue near the gas station, which is right by the waterfront (less than a mile) and spare yourself the boring chains you usually eat at when you go to the waterfront.
