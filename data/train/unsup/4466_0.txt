Among the most worthless shit-holes I've experienced in Toronto.  More overpriced than a normal convenience store, bad customer service, expired products on the shelves (including cereal even!).  Avoid this place at any costs.  You could take a taxi to the next closest minimart and buy a basket of goods, take a taxi back, and still save money. AND you'd get better stuff and deal with less attitude.  If this store were a human I'd punch its kidneys out.
