I was never a big DQ fan to begin with, but on a hot summer day driving around the suburbs we thought \"Why not?\" Unfortunately, this particular location lacked a few things that most of the newer locations have: a dining room\/seating area. So we stood around the small soft serve spot with our cups and cones as we tried to enjoy the overly sweet and seemingly toxic blizzards that we ordered. Sure, they've got more bang for your buck, but it's the quality of the product that is lacking.
