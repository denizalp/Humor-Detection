Came here for clockwork coffee, which shares the same space, and the people behind the bar were super friendly in educating us about pour over coffee. They were great at telling us how it was and explaining the finer details of the process. \n\nBut it is pretty pricey for what you get and the coffee is good, but not amazing. I personally would not go back.
