Absolutely phenomenal!  Brandon is incredibly reliable, efficient and cares for your belongings as if they are his own.  He made so many accommodations for me (moving cross country can be hectic!) that made my move less stressful.  I promise you won't regret hiring Brandon for your moving needs.  Top notch!
