Food was good but service wasn't the best. We ordered our food and that came pretty quick. They forgot our drinks and my husband let the girl at the register know. She said they were behind and she will give us our drinks when she can. There were only 2 people sitting down, beside us. There were more people working in the back, and if you can't take care of your current customers, you shouldn't take in more customers.
