BEWARE!! I sent my soup back because it was cold. And when the server was bringing it back to me, my girlfriend saw the server spit into my soup!!! When I went to the manager, the manager said I was lying!\nWOW they they supported their server and not someone who's buying dinner in this new restaurant!!\nI will never go here again!! Neither should anyone else!! GROSS!!!!!
