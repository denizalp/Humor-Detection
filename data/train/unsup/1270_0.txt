The owner is very nice and the staff are simply workers....not much personality. The food is pretty good and is comparable to most Vietnamese restaurants...all westernized and made for our Canadian taste buds. \n\nThis place is hit or miss. When they are on their game and not too busy, it's a great experience. However, when they are not, it's not a pleasant visit...just eat and go...little service and no chit chat.  \n\nMore personality from staff would go a long way with repeat business. And appetizers are way over priced for the quality you receive.
