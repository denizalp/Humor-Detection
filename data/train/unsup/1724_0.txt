I almost don't want to review this place, because it's been our \"little secret\" for so long! Yes, the location is not ideal, the outside is a little sketch, and the decor is not winning any awards....BUT, the food is fantastic!!! It's pub grub style (burgers, wings, pasta etc.), and everything we've had is delicious. Even the coleslaw that comes with the fish and chips is good! Really! 1 cent ribs, $1 burger night and the best $6 steak sandwich I've ever had....If you're in the 'hood, make sure you check it out!
