I really wish insurances would stop using this company. Drivers either call and hang up on me, or don't show up at all. I was late to an important doctor appointment yesterday because the driver hung up on me and took off. I then got a text saying the trip was cancelled at my request. I did not cancel. I had to wait over 20 minutes for another driver to show up which made me late. It shouldn't have taken and hour to get to an appointment 3 miles away.
