My mother was put in the mausoleum early May of 2014.  I came in a month later and ordered her plaque and paid $500 for a brass vase.  As of this date April 20, 2015 they have not put anything up for her.  No one returns calls.  I have stopped in several times with them promising me that it was coming in by a certain date.  Nothing yet!  I am hurt and devastated.....
