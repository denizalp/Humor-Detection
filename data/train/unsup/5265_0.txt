I love Thai food and I eat it a lot. I love Nittaya's. Service is friendly, food is absolutely amazing, and ambiance is nice and secluded. I would have never expected this place to be located in a Starbucks parking lot. Honestly addicted to their spicy garlic edamame! Love it here! By far my favorite Thai spot.
