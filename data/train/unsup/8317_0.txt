CenPho's latest is a BEAUTIFUL FULL-ON ALE HOUSE!\n\nJust stopped by to check the place out and was flagged down by the nicest husband and wife team who invited me in! \n\nThe place is spectacular! A large spacey room and a huge outdoor patio with an incredible view of Downtown.\n\nI'm from Milwaukee and this place sends me back to \"the way things are supposed to be\" ... it's beer, it's people ... it's HOME!\n\nI can't wait to go back for more!\n\nOh yeah ... of course they have got a huge looooooooong wall of a gazillion beers on-tap!\n\nFantastic!!!
