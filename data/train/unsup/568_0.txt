The steak was actually really good and cooked right to order...but the sides you get with it are kind of a joke for the price you pay. The cream of broccoli soup is puree and cheap. The dessert was okay. The pasta is virtually inedible. The salad was plain. Not sure where your money goes at this restaurant.\nThe server was really great and really nice...deserved to be working somewhere less pretentious. Overall the experience was good, but the price was psychotic for the quality of food that you receive.
