This was my first time trying Thai rolled ice cream and I really enjoyed it! \n\nWe got there just before the line began to form (luckily). The service is a bit slow given they must make everything from scratch. I ordered the Love at First Bite and was very pleased with my order. The only downside is the store can get very crowded with a long line, and there is only one bench at the back to sit. I would recommend this place for first timers, it is a must try food!
