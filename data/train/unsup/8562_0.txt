Worse location ever! Do not come here if you like to order your wings crispy. We waiting 50 minutes for some soggy ass wings.\n\nServer told us it would take 30 minutes which we were perfectly okay with. And honestly, I wouldn't have complained if my wings came out crispy but they weren't. We spoke to the manager and decided to leave. She was no help besides giving us a BS excuse and told us crispy wings only take 12 minutes which made us even more confused. \n\nNever coming back here again.
