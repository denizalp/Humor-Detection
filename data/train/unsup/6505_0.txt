Dear Secret Pizza,\n\nWhat do you put in your pizza?! Thinking about that slice of pepperoni pizza makes me all warm and gooey on the inside, just like your pizza. How do I describe this little piece of heaven?? I didn't know it was even possible to have pizza melt in your mouth. Now I know. and I don't think I can ever eat another pizza again without sneering at it when I've experienced FAR better at Secret Pizza. Thank you for this pleasurable experience. \n\nSincerely,\n\nMe\n\n\np.s. why does your line move so slow? =\/
