I worked with a trainer for about 2-3 months, then they tried switching my trainer, then after I cancelled and paid my last month to them they called a month later asking for more money, and stating that I couldn't be cancelled until I paid AGAIN.... no thank you. I will not be returning. This company is a scam. Read what you are signing word for word. Even if you are verbally told something, I guess you can't trust what is coming out of their mouth. This company is a huge scam!
