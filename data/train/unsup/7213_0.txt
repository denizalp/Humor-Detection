Needed a place to fill up my stomach before the Arizona Strong Beer Festival and came across Poke2U along Mill Ave! What a hidden gem! I ordered the seaweed wrap with tuna and spicy tuna blend which included all the usual fresh poke ingredients. The meal came with a free bowl of delicious miso soup as well. The staff was super friendly. For those into craft beer, they have a few local brews on draft. If you're on Mill and have a craving for poke, this is your stop!
