The cutest cafe I've ever been to!! Super clean and very cute and chic. I love the decor there! The employees were really friendly, it takes a while for your order to come out but it's probably because it's made with love :) The froze was really good, the tea is okay they could make the flavor of the tea stronger, but other than that, I'm in love!!!
