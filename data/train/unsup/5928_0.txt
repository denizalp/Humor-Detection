Greek salad and wings were amazing. The greek salad dressing is my husband's favorite. The wings were crispy and juicy- Loved the garlic  parm and barbalo. Cooked and sauced perfectly.  The food is always fresh and they use top quality ingredients and everything is homemade. Awesome  pizza ( best crust) too. You can't go wrong here!
