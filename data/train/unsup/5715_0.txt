Grateful that we still have an all classical radio station in Pittsburgh, especially after so many cities have lost theirs. \n\nWQED FM provides lots of local programming by interviewing musical artists and recording performances for playing on air. \n\nTheir cultural calendar is an indispensable resource. \n\nHosts Jim Cunningham and Anna Singer are enormously talented and devoted to supporting the regional arts scene. \n\nBravissimo, WQED, for everything you do for our Community!
