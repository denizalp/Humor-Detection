Popeyes Acai smoothie\n\nRecommend by one of the girls working there. \nAcai, banana, spinach, homemade cashew milk, agave nectar \n\nDelicious drink. You taste more of the cashew and banana. Regular size, wish it was $4.xx instead of $5.xx\n\nGood variety of juices and smoothies. Will definitely go back.
