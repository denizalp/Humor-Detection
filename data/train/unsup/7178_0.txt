Buffets can be scary; I'm not talking about the eating-too-much type of scary, but rather that six-or-twelve-hours-after-the-fact scary. Sushi? Yea, you know the drill. At the Red Wok, there is no need to worry. Everything seemed fresh and tasty, even the coconut cookies. \n\nThe sushi was good, but the Korean noodles were really good. There are a lot of choices to please everyone (it is a big buffet). Only disappointment was the Chinese doughnut. Skip that and have another plateful of something else. Or just have a few more coconut cookies.
