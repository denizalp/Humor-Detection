NOT IMPRESSED \n\nHosting our nephew so we thought we would take him for a nice haircut.  Upon entering , both husband and nephew are seated immediately .  First flag. Clippers come out and 12.5 minutes later both haircuts are complete . With different prices to boot!\nHusband says this is the norm I think it very unprofessional . Average haircuts at best!\nSorry boys we will not be back.
