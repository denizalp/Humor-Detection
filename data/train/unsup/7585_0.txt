Great coffee and amazing avocado toast!  There was tons of seating and free wifi, which is always a plus!  I really appreciated their unique coffee menu but just went with my typical iced coffee with a shot of espresso.  They also have almond milk available upon request.\n\nFood options were limited but the avocado toast was some of the best I've ever had.   Solid coffee spot to check out if you're in the toronto area.
