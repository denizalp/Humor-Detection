I have a Simplicity vacuum and took it Vac & Sew to get an estimate.  Mark greeted me and I explained I needed a tune up and he said a full estimate was free.  We agreed on a do not exceed price and it was completely refurbished for slightly more.  An excellent job for a fair and reasonable price.  I highly recommend this place for all vacuums.
