i have been going to Ericka's for years and I am extremely happy with the service I receive there.  Ericka is extremely knowledgeable about hair and skin care.  She always goes the extra mile to make sure I am completely happy with my cut.  When I started getting my hair colored, she took extra time to pick out a color that would work well for me.  She has helped me with make-up and skin care also.  The other hair stylists are all very friendly and competent also.  I recommend Ericka's to all of my friends and family.
