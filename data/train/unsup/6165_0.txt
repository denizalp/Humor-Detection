The food is mediocre, but could be forgiven if the service was better.\n\nThe fries were so over salted I only ate about 2 or 3 before they were discarded. \n\nThe employees just don't seem to care! \n\nThe guy at the table next to us opened his burger to find everything but the beef! His burger was literally missing the beef patty!\nSerious lack of attention to detail here.
