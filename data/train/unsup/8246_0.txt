Really don't understand the 4.5 star review avg for this place.  The food was not great.  The pizza was burned making the crust too hard\/crunchy.  Shrimp and grits was way too saucy completely overpowering the grits and the garlic kale tasted gritty which tells me I was eating dirt along w my kale.
