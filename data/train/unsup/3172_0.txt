This store is labeled as the \"World's Largest Skechers Factory Outlet Store\" and they are not kidding. This store has tons of shoes for men, women and kids in so many styles. I have never seen a Skechers outlet store with so many shoes in different styles. \n\nThis store usually offers the buy one and get 50% off the second pair deal so you always tend to walk out with 2 or more pairs of shoes.
