To add to Steven N.'s review (yes, I was the friend that ordered the shrimp fettuccine), my dish was \"off tasting\" in the sense that it had a raw-shrimp flavour to it. I usually try to finish my plate but I had to pass on this one. \nThe chocolate torte was decadent - it was a cross between fudge and mousse chocolate. The blueberry garnish on it was a nice touch to balance the sweetness.
