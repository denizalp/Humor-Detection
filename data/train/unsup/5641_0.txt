Consistently messes up orders, fails to acknowledge presence at drive thru window and the employees just have a very unpleasant attitude. It's almost as if they rather have you dead than to serve you. Needless to say that the next time that I want food from White Castle\/Church's Chicken, I'm driving over to the west side.
