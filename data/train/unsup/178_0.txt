Early flights call for a drink & Mando is the man!  Talking to him brightens the morning & even tho I've never had time to eat there, I always look forward to when he's working.  Always remembers my drink & my name.  Nothing like customer service at a airport like that.  Keep up the good work cause it's appreciated.  Located at B gates for if your travel SWA.
