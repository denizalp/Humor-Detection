Ordered two Friday night fish fries to go for $20.99 before tip. \n\nIt comes with your choice of potato (potato salad or fries), two hush puppies, slaw,  and three pieces of cube shaped cod. \n\nThey are generous with their fries.  The fish has the perfect amount of beer batter and is fork-flaky tender. Very good!  \n\nThe Staff is very attentive and friendly,  even for just s take-out order. \n\nI saw they have a basket of chocolate chip cookies by the cash register that patrons helped themselves to!  Very cool and quirky place :-)
