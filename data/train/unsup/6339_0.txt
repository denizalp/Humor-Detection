After eating at the Kogi truck in LA, I was stoked when I saw this truck set up in Lee's parking lot. How incredibly disappointing it was. This will set back Korean food for generations. And don't try to eat there during the summer. There is no shade, no misters, nothing. Just horrible food in a horrible spot.
