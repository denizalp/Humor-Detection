Sure, CMU, I suppose I could give you some stars for the cool education your faculty is giving me. A couple more stars for sending me away at the end of 2 years with a masters degree. A couple more stars for the lifelong friends you gave me too. How about the graduate\/faculty only lunchtime at Schatz Dining Room? Stars for you too, I suppose.
