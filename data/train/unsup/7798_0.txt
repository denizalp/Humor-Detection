I really can't say enough about Verve Church!  I'm so grateful to have found it.  I've been going there for a little over two years and it truly is the highlight of my week!  It's fun, it's casual, absolutely anyone is welcome.  You'll never feel condemned or criticized or judged...Verve is a safe place to experience God.  The service is very entertaining and the music is crazy good but the truth is there for sure!  I am grateful that Verve church is MY church!  I truly am!  Come visit!  I think you'll be really glad that you did!
