FRESHEST ORANGE JUICE EVER.\n\nHow many places have you been to where someone writes about the toast? Even the big fatty piece of toast we got was incredible.\n\nOnly had to wait about 15 minutes on a really busy Tuesday (yes, really busy Tuesday) morning. \n\nWeird quick tip to add: if you are seated on the stools, you kind of slide off if you don't sit back far enough.
