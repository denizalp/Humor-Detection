A-MOH-ZING!\n\nSo, Im on this healthy kick. Trying to not sacrifice taste but not feel like I go into a coma after I eat. And this... just hits the spot.\n\nI got a make your own salad. It was great, tastey. The spice on the falafels were on point. \nThe hummus was average, but since I got a salad bowl I wont doc points for that. The price was great. Yes yes yes....  go here!!! Great Lunch Spot!
