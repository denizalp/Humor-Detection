I came to the buffet for salad. They had spinach and good dressings.  I was pleased with my salad. Anything else on the buffet looked like it was 20 years old. Dry gross and gross.  However, the crowd didn't seem to be starving -- at all.  So no one missed a calorie and I guess all is well that ends well.
