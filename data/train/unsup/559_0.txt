it's kind of a neat experience! i've had much, much better ice cream but i've never had the option to fully custom make it fresh right in from of my face in a matter of seconds! \n\noverall, the experience gets more stars than the actual dessert. i would go back to take my nieces because they would think it was fun and cool, but i wouldn't go back for ice cream for myself...if that makes sense.
