Take a seat at this super long circular bar that anchors the front entrance area off The Strip and drink for free while playing some video poker. Flat screens all around with the night's ball games always on. Good spot to people watch. Really nice bartenders here.\n\nKick back and watch the working girls make frequent sweeps of the area to hit up on their next venereal disease victims! \n\nNo glove, no love! Put a helmet on it soldier! Or pay the price!
