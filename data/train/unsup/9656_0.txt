It's almost comical. Tried Thrive again. Got the Strawberry Passion. In the menu description it says that it's topped with granola, pineapple, honey and strawberries (plural). \n\nI'll attach a picture of what I got. It has to be less than one strawberry. I'm just constantly disappointed. Cmon...you're right next to Sprouts. Surely you can hook up some kind of deal!
