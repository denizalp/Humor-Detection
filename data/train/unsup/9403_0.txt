My favourite pho spot in Toronto, food never disappoints and fast service. Surprised they haven't franchised this place yet but glad the prices are reasonable.\n\nNote: parking is easier to find\/access through the back street and drive through the side of the building vs dealing with traffic at Wilson\n\nNote II: Pay by cash only, go up to the front to pay at the cashier
