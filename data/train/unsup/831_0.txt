This place is racist. My best friend was getting married and we were here for her bachelorette. We kept cheering for her and all the guys ignored her. We just wanted her to have a good time because it was her bachelorette. This place is racist for sure, you should only come here if youre FULL white (my friend is half white and she still was discriminated against).
