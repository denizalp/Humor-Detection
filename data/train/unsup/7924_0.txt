WOW! This place is so good! Went in today and the staff was very friendly! They could tell we were new customers so they let us try the sauce we wanted. The cook even came up and gave us a sample wing while we waited. The wings are a good size and they put just enough sauce. Don't forget to try the honey biscuits they are to die for! Can't wait to go back!
