I have been waiting to try out Rehab Burger! Food and service was fantastic. I came with some friends for happy hour before a spring training game and we had a fabulous time. Drinks were awesome!! And apps were great also. We split the fries, chips and salsa, as well as quesadilla. Can't wait to come back and try more!!
