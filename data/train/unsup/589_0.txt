SECRET MENU ITEM: VEGGIE BURGER! awesome alternative to the standard burger. I always come back to this location because they do such a great job of accuracy with dietary restrictions. \n\nVeggie burger can be made with no cheese, no spread for full vegan selection. Onion grilled or raw can be added along with pepperchini! If you ask nicely ;)\n\nKuddos to the manager of this location! Your staff is always pleasant and happy to help their customers. The cleanliness of this location is phenomenal and reflects great management.
