Highly recommend Phillips Law Group!! My family & I were hit by a drunk driver last May & they settled our case with over 120k!!! They also treat you like family. I recommend working with Montana & Kris. Montana guided us through every step & piece of paperwork then Kris personally met me at the bank & spent about 5 hours setting up our kids with their settlement money into CD accounts. It means so much to us & we really appreciate their time & dedication.
