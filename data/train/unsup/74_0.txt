This restaurant is very nicely decorated. It was even nicer when you get in than it looks when you peek in from the casino. Our server, Lindsey, was great and made us feel very welcome. We had the lebaneh with feta and laffa to start followed by a greek salad. Both were delish. For my main, I had the grilled octopus. It was so tender and tasty! I demolished it!!! My friend had the garlic shrimp and was equally pleased with her meal. All in all a very enjoyable meal. Skip Northside and come here!
