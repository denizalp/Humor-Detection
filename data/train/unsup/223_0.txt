Great park with clean restroom facilities and water fountain under the pavilion. \n\nThere's one basketball court with two hoops, a handful of tennis courts,  plenty of playground equipment with soft shredded rubber instead of wood chips. \n\nLots of mature trees line the entire park so pull up a blanket or have a picnic in many of the picnic tables sprinkled throughout and enjoy the outdoors.
