This is a small restaurant with nice decor if you are looking for more upscale restaurant options in the Venetian. We came here with a dinner reservation for 20 and were seated immediately. I had the mushroom ravioli, which was good but pricey - for $18, I only got about 5 pieces of ravioli. However, I was able to pick off of other dishes and was plenty stuffed. I particularly liked the gnocchi alla sorentina. \n\nService was quick and courteous. I would definitely come back here if I stayed at the Venetian again.
