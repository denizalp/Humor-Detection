I have been going to Top Gun's morning Boot Camp for the last 4 months. I love the small group workouts that have a ton of variety and is very challenging. Both Scott and Tom are great trainers and are motivating and supportive..... And funny too!  The other people that attend are so nice and supportive, it's fun to work out!!\n\nIf you're looking for a great place to either start your workout experience or to be really challenged, this is a great place!
