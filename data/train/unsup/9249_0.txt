BarChef is a modern and unique experience with a retro, almost Victorian or Steampunk flair.   It's impossible when you enter to miss the fact that this place is special. \n\nThe staff is incredibly friendly and interested in explaining their craft. From their in-house infused bitters, to cocktails bottled and aged.   You may find your cocktail experience includes edible components or aromatic enhancement.  It's molecular gastronomy meets mixology. \n\nThis is a must visit locale in Toronto and is well worth the trip.
