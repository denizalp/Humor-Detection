This review is about new lot. Whoever designed this lot did not take into account not everyone drives a compact. Small spaces, tight turns ( actually saw a bus go up on island to turn down lane, tight to back up. Seriously get a better designer for the next one. I do like the shade area and benches are a nice touch
