Went today for my Veterans free dessert, as advertised online. Manager said that I had to buy an entree to get the deal. I showed him online that it showed \"no purchase necessary and no restriction\". He told me that he could not and refused to honor it. Is this how Longhorn treats its veterans? Any good manager would have just honored the deal... in honor of our service. Terrible customer service!
