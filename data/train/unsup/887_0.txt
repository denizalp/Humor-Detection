This restaurant is located within the South Point Hotel & Casino Resort.\nEh, not bad, but I do have to say that nothing in this hotel should be this expensive. \nThere's not a whole lot of seating. Just a few tables, and the rest is counter seating. And for some reason, when I went, several people asked about to-go orders and it turns out they do not.\nFood is nothing spectacular at all. Definitely doesn't justify the price. But I guess if you want to have something different and you're inside this resort, give it a try.
