I just paid $29 plus tip for one of the worst burgers I've ever had.  (Cost includes a cocktail) The burger  meat was dry and tasteless, the seasoned fries were not seasoned and they were cold.  The service was awful too.  I would have babe better off at Burger King!  Don't waste your time or money!
