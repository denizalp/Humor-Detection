Lmao Dunkin' Donuts is a mess. Straight up everything here tastes awful from the coffee to the non-donut foods and especially, especially the donuts. I think my hatred of donuts arose in part because of Dunkin' (and Krispy Kreme). Donuts in general are nasty but Dunkin' goes above and beyond on this one. Too bad it's their flagship product.
