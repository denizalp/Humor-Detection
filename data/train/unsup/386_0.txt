I am not sure how albertsons stays in business. It is the closest grocery store to my house but i will drive further to go somewhere else. I have 2 reasons for this:\n\n1. The overall prices are not competitive with frys. On occasions when i don't feel like driving & i shop albertsons my bill is always higher.\n\n2. In the 10 years i have lived in the area & have stopped in albertson because i just had to pick up a few things- the wait to check out is consistently long. It seems like they need more cashiers.
