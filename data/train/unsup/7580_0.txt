The MOST DELICIOUS AHI TUNA SANDWICH everrrr the food was soo delicious and I couldnt stop saying\/thinking it the entire time I was eating. SOoo delicious. Make sure to try the onions ring as well..it seemed as though they fried it in a batter filled with garlic which made it a million times crunchier. yummm i want it nowww...Also..i feel like ordering the sandwich and just eating the fish would be well worth it as well...the mixture between the fish and the wasabi mayo..omy..to die for!
