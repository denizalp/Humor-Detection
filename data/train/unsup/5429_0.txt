Is it 1970?  This place is in need of a serious overhaul - aesthetically.  The carpeted indoor \"track\" is the pits.  One would need to run 75 times around it just to get a mile in.   There was one guy working the desk that drove me crazy.  When I would arrive, he would always say things like, \"Alright girl, let's go for it!!!\"  or, \"Let's get you wet, gotta get yo workout on!\"  Seriously???  Idiot.  Please shut up.  Please don't ever talk to me again.
