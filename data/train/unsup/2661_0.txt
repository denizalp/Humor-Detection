So happy with my decision to hire Christopher Moving. They did our move about two weeks ago. Super professional from beginning to end and pricing is very reasonable. The three guys that did our move were professional, knowledgeable, and worked efficiently. I shopped around for a couple weeks before going with this company - glad I hired them.
