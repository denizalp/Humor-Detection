Horrible customer service.  I went in and met with one of the reps about getting some rims for my BMW.  We looked at several different options and I made my decision.  I was told I would her back from him in a few days time.  After a week I called and left 3 messages.  I never heard from them and ended up buying my rims elsewhere.  They didn't even give me a chance to spend my money.  After reading the other review.. I would have to consider myself lucky.
