It's pretty in here, but the name makes it seem much more majestic than it actually is. Right now, it's pretty mall-tastic, which I suppose is appropriate. The signage that tells people not to throw coins in to the Koi ponds needs to be much bigger, because I can still see coins in the pond. \n\nStop it! You are killing the fishies! :'(
