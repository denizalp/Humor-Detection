Reasonable prices and very good food!\nWe had the 1\/4 chicken (Nr.4) that comes with fries. and salad, we also had a chicken sandwich with salad (Nr.5). We paid 17$ and very stuffed afterwards.\nThe salad had a very decent and delicious dressing. The chicken already has a smoky taste and can be ordered with a slightly spicy sauce. \nAfterwards be ordered a Pastel de Nata and we can say that it tastes exactly like in Portugal.\nNice place!
