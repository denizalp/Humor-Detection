Amazing Vietnamese food! A real find here in Glendale! My husband love the brisket Pho and the #14 prawns is absolute perfection, both are Vietnamese soups at their finest. We've come back several times and tried several new items and they never disappoint! The only critique I have is that the service can be a little slow, but they are always polite.
