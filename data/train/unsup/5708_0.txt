Fat guys is a great local joint! The food is awesome! The pizza is dynamite! We often get it carryout!  While I don't recommend it for children we've gone for a quick early bite. My sons love the chicken wings sweet n tangy to be exact!  The owner is friendly & staff is Nice! As for parking those who think its a challenge or poor have never gone to the flats or Lakewood.. It a working class bar with awesome food!
