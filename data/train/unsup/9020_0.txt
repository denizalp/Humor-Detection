I've eaten at buffets, but this was the place to hang. Next time i'll just get a room to stay in the dining area as i would never leave. All the food was great, but i just want to talk about this mac and cheese station- (gift from god).\nThis mac and cheese station is made to order so you can add whatever it is you want. I piled mine up with bacon, tomatoes, feta, cheddar, bacon,etc... best news is that you can always go back for more!\np.s. desserts were tasty!
