The room was okay. Nothing was gross or anything. Everything in the room seemed like it was from the 70-80s.. no renovated anything. \n\nThe hotel seemed to be full of crackheads and gangsters. If you have little kids this is probably not the best place to say. My friends and I got woken up at 6:00am by the loud thumping of a cars stereo system. It lasted at least and hour. I think it took so long to have someone tell them to turn it down out of fear of getting shot or something.
