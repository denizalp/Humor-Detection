The best thing about the Swizzle Inn is that it's really two bars in one. If you go there between five and seven o'clock in the evening it's a very quiet friendly local bar it's not crowded at all. But after 9 o'clock watch out. The last time I was at the swizzz after midnight I woke up not in my own bed not in my own home with a very vague memory how I got there... It was a great night.\n\nAlso friendly staff great prices
