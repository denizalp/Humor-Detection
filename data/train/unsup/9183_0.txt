June 24, 2016 - the day I fell in love with this ramen bar.\n\nWe have visitors from NC and they were craving ramen after watching Mariah at Ceasar's... but wait... it's past 12 am!!! No problem! This place takes order until 2:45AM! \n\nAppetizers: Jinya Bun, Gyoza, Takoyaki, and Crispy Shrimp Ball\nRamen: Jinya Tonkotsu Black; Cha Cha Cha; and Tonkotsu Assari\n\nLoved the Tonkotsu Black ramen! Order this if you're a fan of thin noodles! Broth is soooo good! \n\nJinya Bun - so flavorful! get it!\n\nI highly recommend this place for ramen lovers!
