Walked in and the guy asked if I had an appointment. I said no, he said it shouldn't be too long. An hour later with no communication whatsoever I just walked out.  \n\nPeople who came in after me went before me, no one indicated any kind of status for how close I was to getting a cut. No good. Communicate with your customers.
