Our experience at the drive through:\n\n\"I'd like the 6 pack of buttermilk chicken tenders.\"\n\nMcD: \"We're out of tenders.\"\n\n\"OK I'll have the 10 pack of chicken nuggets then with Szechuan sauce and a shamrock shake.\"\n\nWe pull up to the window to pay.\n\nMcD: \"So you ordered a Big Mac and fries with Coke right?\"\n\n\"Uh, no...\"\n\nWe also saw someone in front of us walking to the window maybe trying to place an order? This location is currently getting a remodel and is drive through only right now.\n\nEven though ordering seemed disorganized, at least we eventually got the right food we paid for!
