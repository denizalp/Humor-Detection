Great meat and value and ice-cold beer. Make sure you get its prime beef set, and add a pork toro (if you are afraid of unusual cuts, try pork belly). At 5-6PM it is totally not crowded, so also great for a early dinner. We spent $82 for 4 people, but the food quantity and quality is similar to $30\/person Japanese BBQ in California.
