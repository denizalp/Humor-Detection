The only reason why I would give this place 4 stars out of the 5 was because of the wait. The food was absolutely incredible and the environment was so romantic. I love it! BUT it was my birthday dinner so I made a reservation there, of course. 60 minutes past my reservation I got my table and finally ordered food almost another hour past that. Our server was wonderful and the food was beyond incredible though.
