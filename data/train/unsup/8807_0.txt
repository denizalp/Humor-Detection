Just finished eating dinner here and threw up after I ate their yakisoba. I don't recommend, and I won't be back. They didn't do anything to help either, other than offering me hot water. I basically paid to eat their food to throw it up. The servers did not seem concerned that a customer threw up after eating the restaurant's food, which was honestly upsetting to see. \n\nUpdate: My boyfriend, who also ate the yakisoba felt like throwing up after we left the restaurant.
