I came into here with high expectations. The chicken fingers were good as was the bread. The sauce for the chicken fingers was different, and that's about it. I can make better sauce at home. The fries and coleslaw were nothing special either, I was annoyed at this place by the unsupervised children, one little group of kids kept \"squeezing\" by me over and over between me and a support beam I was sitting by. That day the clientele was ghetto as fuck. I would not return, just to be annoyed by misbehaving children alone.
