Always on the lookout for new food options I was thrilled to find this spot. It's kind of hard to get to if you don't work in the area and have a regular 9-5 like me but luckily I was off one day and made the trek for lunch. \n\nTasty empanadas that come in many varieties, I stocked up on one of each so I could take some home and enjoy them later as well. \n\nFriendly service and homemade Argentinian treats, what's not to like.
