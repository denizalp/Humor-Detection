This is the dirtiest Carrabba's I've ever seen! Absolutely unacceptable...garbage on the floor, hand prints all\nover the glass...I walked in and felt like I was as Denny's on the wrong side of the tracks! Needless to say we left immediately! Shame on this location for bringing down the quality of such a fantastic restaurant!
