I can not go anywhere without people stopping me and asking who my dentist is.  Four people came up to me at the salon this morning to tell me how beautiful my teeth are and and wanted to know who my dentist is.  Love my teeth so worth it.   Thanks to Dr Bruce Schwartz \"Pima Dental and Mike from the Lab.    Can not stop smiling.
