Our friend and neighbor took us to Gelatology for a class in Sweet vs. Savory 101. A nice shop full of sweets beckoning even the most diehard dieter.\nMacaroons looked fresh and colorful.\n\n\nHere are some flavors I sampled. All were delicious.\n\nSalt and caramel\nBirthday cake\nDulce de leche\nPear and Gorgonzola\nChocolate and Coconut\n\nI had the chocolate and coconut and was satisfied.  I'm not so adventerous but on my next visit I will try more savory flavors\n\n.
