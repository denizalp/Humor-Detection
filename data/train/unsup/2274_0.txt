Super friendly staff! This place is so easy to get to from the strip. The entry room is clean and professional.\n\nWe did the cursed cabin and I won't give any hints, but this place is so much fun. It was perfectly challenging, got stuck a couple times but they gave us good hints so that we could get through it.\n\nWe are going to come back and try the other two rooms when we have more time!
