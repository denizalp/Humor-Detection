I just opened up the $13 tights for my 4yr old. I noticed a snag on the left thigh. I called the store to see if I could come in and exchange or return them. They said that tights are considered \"final sale\" and they can not be exchanged or returned. Beware of purchasing from stores like this. I will not be shopping here and don't recommend others unless you open up and examine your entire purchase before you go home.
