Today I took my wife's Lexus to this shop based on Yelp reviews. Now it is important to know that I was responding to my wife's over-reaction to another shop's idea that she needed some work done. Bottom line it that Dolar was great and our car did not need any work and they did not even charge us. Take your car there and make your wife happy and stay sane.
