If you want par poutine that's open late and has all the standards plus some not so standard combinations of gravy, cheese, and fries, then this is your place. Since I had limited meals in the city, I needed to take care of both my smoked meat and poutine fixes in one fell swoop;\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/smokes-poutinerie-toronto-2?select=rz0cbuc06rMbTryAwUOMow#6CslC6Hn4SHDjZwNDv9D6A\n\nTasty yes, hot yes, cheese melty under the hot gravy yes. I'm happy.
