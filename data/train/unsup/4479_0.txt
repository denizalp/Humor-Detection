We went here for their pumpkin patch festivites. The child had a great time and obviously did not want to leave. They charge admission to get in and then pretty much any activity that your kiddo will want to do costs a bit extra. Its not crazy pricing and most of them have squares to accept card payment. Petting zoo with lots and lots of heavenly goats. Even babies!
