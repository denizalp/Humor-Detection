Ended up here with the kiddies after realizing that we did *not* want to wait in line for the buffet at Paris.  We ordered a whole pizza, half cheese, half pepperoni (if you have kids you'll get it).  It was decent, although I like the pizza at my local joint better; plus it was a bit pricey ($40+ for a pizza and four drinks, although this *is* Vegas).  Older son thought the crust was too chewy, but I didn't mind. An okay choice if you need some grub in a pinch.
