I am a very happy customer.  I went with my daughter and she had the kids waffle and loved it.  I ordered the ribeye steak and eggs over medium and everything was perfect.  There were many large parties with lots of adults and kids and still the service was good.  I love the French press LaVazz coffee too.  The quality of the steak was good and had an excellent flavor.  Cute and clean place! We will be back soon!
