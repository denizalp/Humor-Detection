Glad I stumbled upon this place. It's amazing. I had the saltado pollo w a side of fried plantains...delicious and freshly cooked straight off the pan. Amazing sizzling flavors, different with every bite, but also very clean. Not greasy or heavy at all. I then had the fried donuts for desert w a cup of hot water w lemon. The donuts I thought were gonna be real heavy but they were light and crisp and you dip them in a light syrup which was amazing. \n\nService was on point 100% very nice and attentive\n\nLove love love this place
