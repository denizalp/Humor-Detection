Ordered lunch special at $7.95. Foods not that good, I had No.7 with Beans and meat. It seem to be missing something in flavoring. Maybe MSG or something. The meat tasted precooked but the beans was ok. The spring roll needs more fillings and more flavors. The service was ok but waitress didn't come by to ask for refill. The best part was the rice and the clear soup with strips of wonton.
