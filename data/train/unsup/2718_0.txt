I ecko much of the consensus of other Yelp poorly reviewed feedback with regards to NASM. The customer service is poor (at least with me personally). No replies to my email messages or phone call. They seem to be on point at the time to take my money. Yet, not around for support since then. It's disappointing given their status as a front runner within the industry.  I've been well taken care of by their competition. I will say that I've enjoyed the quality of the specialization courses.
