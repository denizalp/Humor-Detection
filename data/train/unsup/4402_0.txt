The food was excellent. One of the best meals we have ever eaten. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the service was not that good. The owner was the only person waiting tables for about an hour and a half. Couldn't order mixed drinks because the bartender wasn't there. Help finally arrived but still no one took our drink order. \n\nWe will definitely go back because the choice of food is very good and the food is excellent.
