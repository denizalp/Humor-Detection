Being from Hawaii, I tend to crave Hawaiian food! I ordered the Laulau special at Island Flavor... They never disappoint!! The Laulau plate came with 1 huge and tasty Laulau, Lomi Salmon, Haupia (Hawaiian dessert), Mac Salad, and rice. I requested brown rice with my plate.  The brown rice was the sticky brown rice, it was perfect!  I also ordered a cup of coffee.  They used Kona Coffee, which is one of my favorite coffees.  The restaurant was busy, the wait staff was friendly and attentive. All in all Island Flavor deserved the 5 stars!!
