I went to Char's for the first time last night.  The place has a good atmosphere and was pretty packed.  The music was OK.  For a place that has been voted the best Blue's Bar in Phoenix pretty much every year, I was expecting a little better.  It was also really hot inside.  I ended up spending a lot of time on the very small covered patio.  \n\nOverall, Char's is a nice place to hang out, enjoy some live music and relax with friends after work.
