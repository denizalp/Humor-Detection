Went here for all you can eat kbbq. Meat quality is really good, good cuts of beef and nicely marinated. Side dishes were nice but nothing special (had the toppoki and kimchi soup). Overall very happy with the food.\n\nOur server was really nice and accommodating, wait time was really reasonable and we were brought everything we asked.\n\nTl;dr: really good food and service, spend a bit more and come here instead of going to chain kbbq's.
