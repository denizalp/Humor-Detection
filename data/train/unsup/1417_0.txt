My go to for my hair, been going to her for over three years! My hair is naturally very very dark and I wanted to go blonde of course! I'm so happy with how my hair turned out, I send everyone I know to her! You know once you find a good hair gal you stick with her!!!! She won't disappoint! I enjoy someone doing my hair that I can have small chit chat with which is nice! Highly recommend!
