Five years ago I reserved two tires at Dukes gave them the exact sizes that I required told him I would be there in 15 minutes to pick up the tires I rolled up with a couple friends of mine from Baltimore who are part of the LGBT community the yinzers at Dukes took one look and told me that the tires were sold they had no more tires.
