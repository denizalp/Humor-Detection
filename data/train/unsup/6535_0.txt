Great find in Etobicoke but get the Apache burger rather than their regular burgers (which are subpar). The only thing I'm not a fan of is the buns are placed directly on the counter without any paper underneath -- I mean, how do I know if the counter is clean?! \n\nThe burgers are good and juicy but I wouldn't say the were the best burgers I've ever had. They are incredibly messy to eat and the place doesn't look the cleanest. I had to admit that the fries are pretty tasty though! :)
