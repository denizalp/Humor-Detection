Love Justin! I have dealt with him multiple times including setting up High School checking accounts for my teens. He is always upbeat, genuine and expeditious. He does a great job instructing the teens on banking issues. No doubt there is too much paperwork involved in opening accounts anywhere, but Justin makes it as painless as possible. Remember to call ahead to make an appt. I've been using this branch for many years without any issues.
