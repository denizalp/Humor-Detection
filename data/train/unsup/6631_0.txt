I went here with my girl who wanted Italian. The ambience was good until the meal came. We both ordered fish dishes. Hers was the Sea Bass was ok until a few bites in and it was raw. Then loud rock music blaring from the kitchen. I like this music but not when I wanted a nice romantic dinner. I was then over charged by almost 100.00 with no corrected receipt just a name and a promise. I hope my money has been returned. We will never go back to this sketchy so called Italian restaurant.!!
