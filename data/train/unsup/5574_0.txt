Just started getting hot and what do you know my AC broke. I called a few places who were booked for two days  so I looked on Angie's list and found All Around Heating and Cooling. They said they had an opening that evening guy showed up he replaced the outside part of my AC. Quick easy no bs. Quick (like an hour and a half total after he picked up compressor\/comdenser thing?)painless fair price IMOP and with a warranty. No wait and I can sleep again. Highly recommended!
