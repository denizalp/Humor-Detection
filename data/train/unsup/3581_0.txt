New location! And with that comes new employees working together to find that smooth rhythm workflow. It was a little slow and not as smooth but they got the order right and food was great! \nThis location was a little smaller indoors than the other chipotles I've been to, but the outdoor seating offers ample room. All in all nothing really to complain about. :)
