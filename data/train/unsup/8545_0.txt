It is what it is.  I like the patio at this location.  We go every so often when we don't know what we want because the menu is huge & has something for everyone.  The waitstaff is fine.  Some are stars, some not so much.  I never leave saying wow that was great, but it fills the void in my stomach in a manufactured, corporate kind of way...
