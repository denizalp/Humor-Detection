One of THE worst run clinics in the city. This is mainly due to the incompetent and uncaring front staff. Try calling them.... you'll hear someone pick up and put you on hold. God forbid someone said \"hello\" or \"please hold\". I came in there sick and they told me to come back the next day for an appointment. Really??  If you plan on doing walk in, plan to die while you wait. There is a MUCH friendlier and competent walk in down the road at Markham\/Kingston.... Family Practice. I suggest you go straight there. Be treated with dignity.
