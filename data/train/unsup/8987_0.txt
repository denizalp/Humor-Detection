Still my favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. Praicash is friendly, personable, and provides a relaxed atmosphere. The staff are kind and don't seem to mind at all when we bring our rambunctious 2 year old with us. They are also reasonably priced; don't charge extra for rice or any silliness like that. \nAnd the Taj Mahal goes great with a spicy dish. \nAlso, lots of vegetarian dishes to choose from!
