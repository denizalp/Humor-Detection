My friend a new car, accidentally left 2 pairs of very expensive rain boots, a rain coat and three tennis racquets in the trunk of the old one. Not only did no one tell us, when we realized it was almost impossible to get a hold of someone, we had to lie and say that we were interested in buying a car to actually speak with someone - they informed us that they threw it all away, around $900 worth . This was only a couple days after buying the new car.
