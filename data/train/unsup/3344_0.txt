Returned to this Freddys in Henderson and again very friendly experience with great tasting food.  The young guys behind the counter were super friendly and a pleasure to speak with.  I even got a free sundae to try as they had an extra one made!  It really looked liked they enjoyed working there and it showed in the awesome service!\nThanks guys great food with a smile!
