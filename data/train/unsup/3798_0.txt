Desyree was extremely friendly from the moment we walked through the door. She went through all of her special flavors for the day and some specialty savory flavors. The gelato is absolutely delicious! I personally love the pear and Gorgonzola! The coffee is freshly made to order and she even makes her own soda! It's amazing. Her store is family owned and run and she even informed me to keep up with her on Instagram to see the new flavors she makes EVERY DAY! How insane is that?! I highly suggest this gelato shop!
