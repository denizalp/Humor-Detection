I've stayed in the bella suites a few times now and I've never had a bad experience.  The rooms are completely spacious and clean which was great for the bachelorette parties that I threw.  Also, the beds were totally comfy.  Plenty of bathroom space and mirrors for us ladies to get ready in front of.  Highly recommended for bachelorette parties!
