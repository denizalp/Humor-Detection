Brighter, cleaner and more organized than the one in City of Industry, this one has a little cafe on site. The employees seem to be more friendly, happy and helpful. I love the huge black and white pictures of old Las Vegas giving us customers especially visitors a blast into the historical past. \n\nLove it! Wish I had more time to walk around in leisure to check out their stuff. Only thing is I couldn't snag a picture as it wasn't allowed in there.
