Heard the great reviews so had to check out for myself. Interesting neon lights, stripper club theme my fav! No but in all seriousness, this place has amazing burgers and fries. My husband ordered sliders and curly fries. We shared some apps (caprese and shrimp cocktail). The cheese on the caprese is not great quality, would skip if I were you. The shrimp cocktail was good. Service was somewhat confusing, 3 different servers.. other than that a cool spot to get some diner food. I would come back.
