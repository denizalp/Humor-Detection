It's not worth the money. Everything do taste same like curry. We tried all vegetarian dishes. Service was good but not great. The food wasn't flavourful. Everything was just cold. Nothing piping hot. The dipping sauces were too watery. The dishes were too sweet like channa masala, raita,saag. Tasteless food. Gulab jamun in buffet are generally served soft and warm but here it was hard and cold. We personally didn't find anything exciting to eat. The deserts tasted like powdered. I wouldn't recommend if you are really looking for Authentic Indian taste and flavours.
