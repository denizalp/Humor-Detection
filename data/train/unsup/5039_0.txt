This place was absolutely horrible. The burgers are absolutely disgusting.. The patty was extremely dry.. the onions tasted old, like a sweaty gym sock, the cheese was flavorless. Wolfs can chili tastes better than their chili.. The worst burgers in the world. McDonald's makes better burgers than this place. \nStill can't get that nasty taste out of my mouth.. Normally I'm not picky but this restaurant here.. Is Just damn right disgusting. I'd rather run into oncoming traffic before returning to this POS restaurant.
