Wow surprised at the poor ratings of one of my favorite cities.  Scottsdale has great restaurants, art, shops, and almost anything I can think of.  When I think of high end food I think Scottsdale. Usually the prices are not that bad since competition is more fierce here.  Restaurants come and go and only the best survive.  \n\nIf you are looking for great food, night life, shopping, nice cars, people, take a look at Scottsdale.  It reminds me of Southern California for the most part.  If you want to do something go to Scottsdale.
