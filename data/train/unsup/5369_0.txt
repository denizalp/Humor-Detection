I would only give this place one star. Horrible Front Door service. I got married in vegas and this was one of the places we wanted to go to. They wouldn't let my brother-in-law in because they said he had \"athletic shorts\" on. He was wearing cargo shorts like everyone else there. So screw them. They've lost our business and we would have returned if it was any good. What right do they have to single someone out like that and use a fake excuse. \n\nOther than that the bartenders were ok and drinks adequate enough.
