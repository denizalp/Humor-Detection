Here's a tip for you Bowlerama:\n\nWhen a customer calls to ask:\n\"Do I need to make a reservation for 7pm tonight?\" \nAnd you answer:\n \"No, it should be okay.\"\nWhen they come in at 6:50pm, you shouldn't say:\n\"Sorry, we're all booked. You should have made a reservation.\"\n\nSorry, your customer service is one the same level as your 'nachos'.
