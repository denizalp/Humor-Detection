An awesome, down to earth yoga studio with really high quality instruction.  I've been to yoga classes with a number of different teachers, and to a special workshop.  It's a gorgeous space with plenty of natural light.  Also, there's a parking lot--  a necessity for a studio in Little Italy.\n\nThe pricing is cheaper than any other place I've looked at in the area: $10\/class for 75 min classes, with occasional buy 5 get 1 free deals, and classes don't expire.  They provide mats and other equipment free of charge.
