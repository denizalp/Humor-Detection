I visit this Whataburger often since it's the closest fast food burger place to my job. The burgers are always great but it never fails that when I go through the drive through they get my order wrong. Also, they charge for ranch which I think ridiculous but I don't mind paying for it but it's happened multiple times where I purchase the ranch and they forget to give it to me. It seems that they are unorganized and all over the place.
