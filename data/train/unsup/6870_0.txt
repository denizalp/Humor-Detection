Great vegan food on the go. We tried almost all of their sandwiches, only one we didn't fall in love with was the BBQ Tofu (too much pickles and not enough veggies). The sandwiches are prefect food on the go, enough to fill you and for a good price. Probably the reason why we can't stop eating them and haven't tried the other meals! One day my friends.
