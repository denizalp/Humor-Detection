Impressive outdoor dining area greets you as you walk in.  But the magic stops there.  The coffee was acceptable but not much better than gas station quality brew.  \n\nOur drink order was completely messed up and nobody seemed to care.\n\nAll egg dishes are cooked with a microwave.  Completely unacceptable unless you've got the Golden Arches out front.\n\nThe worm in our side bowl of fruit was the icing on the cake. \n\nBased on the owners's response, I will try this place again.  Maybe it was a fluke.  I will report back shortly.
