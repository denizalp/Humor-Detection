This place needs to get over itself. They are pretentious and overpriced. I paid $15 for Mac and cheese aka a block of salt just because it was farm to table? No thanks. \n\nThat's cool that their staff is hip and hungover and unappreciative of their clientele. Oh wait, no it's not. \n\nGet over yourself Lucky's just because you have a tiny little garden thing next door and your servers have stupid trendy leg tattoos doesn't mean that you can overcharge for bad food in Cleveland. Woof.
