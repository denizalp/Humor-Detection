We've been renting a home managed my Keller n' Jadd for a couple months now. Upon moving in, it seemed like every time we turned around, there was something else that wasn't working as it was supposed to. Sarah has been on top of ensuring that all our needs have been met and she has been on top of making sure that all of our appliances have been working properly. Not only that, she has made sure that all work orders have been expedited quickly. Thank you for taking such good care of us.
