I'm jumping on the bandwagon -- a bandwagon that's been full since this place opened. Excellent selection of gelato and sorbetto made daily in house. Check out Instagram, Twitter, FB to see what their daily special flavors are. The water-based sorbetto is light and smooth with the pina colada flavor yielding bits of coconut and prominent pineapple and rum flavors just like the drink. The rocky road and cookies and cream gelato were much sweeter and creamier, perfect for warm Vegas days.
