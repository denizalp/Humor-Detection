Great taste of dim sum. I don't mind paying a bit more for a nicer and quieter dim sum place with family & friends than queuing up outside the door for half an hour and rush in & out in some other dim sum places. \nI like the choices of congee, Chang fenï¼Œsignature black steam buns with salted egg yolk and custard filling, abalone pastries were really good. It's our new place for dim sum!
