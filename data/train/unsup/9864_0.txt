For the last 12 years we brought our fleet of service and delivery vehicles to Compu-Tech.  Whether it was a gas or diesel engine it really did not matter.  Sam Reynolds is the owner and has a great staff of technicians.  One of the few shops in town that really does care about the outcome with the services they provide.  They always get the trucks back on the road as quickly as possible, they know we rely on our trucks to make our living.  Thanks to Sam and his staff for the expert care and knowledge.
