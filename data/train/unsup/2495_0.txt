Went down to get my fathers cluster looked at. We were there for 30 minutes and the job was done perfectly. They even took the time to install the instrument cluster back into the truck when they were finished. I look forward to taking my own truck when the time comes to get mine looked at. I highly recommend Speedo tach to anyone. Thank you.
