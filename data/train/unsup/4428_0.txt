You have to try the spicy garlic sauce. Omg it really was awesome. Great service. Great food. And at a good price. I have to say that this is one of the best places I have eaten at in a long while. Everything was fresh and you could taste the love put into every single bite. The pita bread was soft and delicious. The hummus was on point. The shawarma chicken sandwich was really the best.
