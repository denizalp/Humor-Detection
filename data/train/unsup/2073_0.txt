I stopped by Tasty Crepes to get a yummy pick me up. If I were only to review the milkshake I had then I would definitely give 4 stars. My milkshake was huge, yummy, and sweet. Just what I was seeking out.\n\nUnfortunately the crepe left a lot to be desired. The actual crepe was quite thick and the filling options were boring. The onions on my crepe were still raw after it was cooked. \n\nIf I come back it would be for the milkshakes or icecream. Maybe I would try the sweet crepes instead of the savory.
