I just gave these guys a call to see how much it would cost for my car to be done and ask a few questions about the process and the products. I was given the response \"come in and we will talk\" to answer every question i had. EXTREMELY frustrating and i will now not bring my car to them because of their inability to simply answer a few questions over the phone.
