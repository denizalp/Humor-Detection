Can't believe I've never reviewed the Rivoli!\n\nI've been coming here for years. What's great about Rivoli is it is one of the only venues I can think of that has such versatility! Large spacious pool hall in the top floor, live music and comedy in the back room, decent bar area on the main floor, small patio at the front and the food here is definitely good for pub food.\n\nGreat \"Jack of all Trades\" bar. You can't go wrong if you're wandering on Queen and need a place to go.
