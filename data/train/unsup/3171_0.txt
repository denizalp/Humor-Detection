Dr. Ngo has been my primary dentist. He does an amazing job and my teeth have never been better. He's very upfront about the entire procedure and keeps you abreast of the entire process every step of the way. The staff is super friendly and work with your scheduke. I will be going back in few months for my regular check up. I would highly recommend him.
