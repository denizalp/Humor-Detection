When I went in it was very short staffed and the lady told me it would only be a 10 minute wait. No one tended to me for about 45 minutes. The shellac mani was good but not a great selection of colour. \nThe pedicure I received was the most disappointing part as the lady was rushing to finish and didn't pay attention much to doing the pedicure \nI was definitely expecting great things for this place due to the reviews but was seriously disappointment.
