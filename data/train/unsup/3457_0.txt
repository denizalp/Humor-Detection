Service is attentive as it should be in first few days of a restaurant. \nPork skewers oh my... Wonderful. Beef meatballs  skewers include tendons so one of us didn't like the consistency. Great spice here. \nHave ordered chicken street style dry spicy noodles,  and garlic chicken rice. Menu is limited,  but very good. There is a sweetness to all the heat. The street style noodles were excellent. \nThe music is cool jazz and salsa, odd choices. \nWill return to check on consistency and have the pork skewers and street style dry spicy chicken noodles. \nSupport local restaurants.
