Ordered a takeout yesterday and totally disappointed. Stop selling cheap quality expensive food to customers. I was excited when this place opened up walking distance from home, but I'd rather drive down to Fine Taste on bayly and get my money's worth. You guys should call yourself \"Dhoka Legend\"!
