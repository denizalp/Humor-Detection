this place is so good. By accident, I stubmled upon this joint in the corner of the Cosmopolitian two years ago. (so hard to find). It's only worth it to buy the whole pie. (slices are too expensive).\nI order a pepperoni mushroom sausage pie, take it up to the pool. lounge on one of those seats near the 8-tv screen area and watch football. life doesn't get much better than that. its NY style pizza. The cheese is soo gooey, the toppings are plentiful. not much to complain about this joint.
