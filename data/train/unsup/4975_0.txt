Nice night view of the city! It was raining off and on the night we went, but the crew did a great job of boarding everyone in a timely manner so we didn't have to stand in the rain. Drinks were good and the narration was excellent! I definitely learned more about the city. Would recommend this tour to anyone traveling from out of town!\n\nMy only complaint is that smoking is allowed on the decks. Not cool with so many kids and nonsmoking adults on board. The smell is a lot stronger than expected.
