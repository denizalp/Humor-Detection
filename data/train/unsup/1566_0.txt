White Brick Kitchen...I went there today with some friends for Breakfast. Its a decent spot, and rather cheap ($9 for 2 eggs, bacon, potatoes and salad). There's nothing toooo special about it. The food was good, I expected to get more, the portions look kind of small amongst the huge plates. It has great patio and their juice is freshly squeezed!....yeah it was a pleasant place, don't really know what else to say.
