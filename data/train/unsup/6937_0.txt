From the very first time I went to Shanghai I was impressed with the food and the owners. They are very passionate about their food and you know it is cooked fresh every time. In fact, a lot of the time when I come in the owner is sitting cutting up fresh veggies for the food. If you're looking for Chinese in Champaign, I would give Shanghai my highest recommendations!
