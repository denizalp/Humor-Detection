I went with a friend when we found out that there is Ethiopian restaurant in Cleveland. Friendly staff, relaxed ambiance, and the coffee was excellent. We ordered combination platter so that we got to sample various items on the menu. The food was outstanding and delicious. Love the injera and the spices they use. The location was not in a decent area but don't let that stop you from checking it out if you are adventurous eater or like to try something new. The main attraction here was the food and it did not disappointed.
