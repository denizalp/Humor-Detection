We were here on a corporate outing, where we rented the entire venue for ourselves. For what appears to be a huge club - this place is TINY. The staff was a nightmare. If you're not happy wearing a teensy little miniskirt and serving free drinks for tips, then perhaps you should get out of the industry. Rolling your eyes at paying customers with cash to burn probably isn't a great business decision. If you worked for me, you'd be looking for a new job. \n\n...the bathrooms were very clean. There's a plus.
