This place is right next to the Sardella's pizza place that we frequent. This lady has a TON of very unique stuff in her shop, NO junk, just really cool stuff!! We bought an outdoor bench that her husband refurbished. It is so unique and so awesome that we bought it even though we already had one and didn't need a new one!! \n\nHer prices are very fair, I can even use the word cheap!! Love checking out her finds! She also does consignments so you can get rid of stuff too!
