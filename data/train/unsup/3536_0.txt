This is a great place to shoot. The employees are friendly, the place is clean and the customers are nice as well. Rental costs are average, although as with anything you rent, some are better than others. I have had guns that aren't sighted well. \n\nWarning to non-members: members get top priority, even if they arrive after you. Still, on a busy Saturday I only waited 30 minutes for a lane (as a non-member).
