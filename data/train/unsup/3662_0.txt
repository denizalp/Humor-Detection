A nice, cheap place to get your vegetarian\/vegan eat on.  Brunch is always nice and the specialty coffee drinks are fun to look through, if only for the names, meanwhile, you'll be eating off melamine and drinking from odd glasses; but, the food is great for the price and someone has to employ all the hipsters on penn ave.
