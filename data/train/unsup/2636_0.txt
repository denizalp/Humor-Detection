This is the best buffet in Vegas.  Christmas brunch was $30 a person.  The chilean sea bass was excellent.  The crab legs were very good, but not as big nor as good as the ones at Aria.  This has the best desserts.  The sushi was limited to california rolls only.  Service was good and friendly as well.
