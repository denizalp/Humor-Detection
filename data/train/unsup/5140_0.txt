First of all, he was ready to talk to us. He had the agreement in his hands and knew what needs to be revised. He revised the agreement right there in the consultation meeting and gave it to us. He gave us good advises and referrals. Easy going, straight forward and most importantly trustworthy. Definitely worth spending money for what I got.
