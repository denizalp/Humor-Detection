Solid is the word that'd describe this hotel best. The rooms are just spacious enough and come with a kitchenette (with fridge and microwave), a sofa and desk, and two King size beds. Bathroom and toilet are separated.\n\nI missed a few things:\n\n- mini bar\n- bath tub\n- comfortable pillows\n\nOn the other hand, you'll get free wifi, complimentary LA Fitness access, a (small) pool. Parking is $16\/night in the attached garage. Check-out is at noon.
