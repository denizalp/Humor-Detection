This place was so disappointing. I thought it would be a store that perhaps sold their fashion lines (wait, do they have those?) and the sort, probably similar to their Dash stores, but it was more just awful novelty items and fan t-shirts saying \"Khloe is my favorite!\" or their photo on a cardboard stick or their lame books. I'm undecided on whether I'm a Kardashian fan - I don't dislike them, but I don't watch their shows or anything either. This store was just one sickeningly overpriced novelty Kardashian explosion.
