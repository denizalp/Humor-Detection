What I like about this location is you can escape the Vegas weather! The stores are a bit smaller and I don't find as many sales here as the North outlet. But the parking is much easier and the environment has less traffic. \nThey have lots of food and unique vendors. My favorite places in the mall is Toys'R'Us when I need to shop for my nephew's!
