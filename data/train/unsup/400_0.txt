We came her this morning, for a return.  We were second in line and there was one till open.  We stood there for 15 minutes while the line behind us got to 10 people deep.  All the while staff were walking around, pretending to be busy.  Totally disorganised, the manager needs to be sacked.  This was a snowy weekday so it wasn't even that busy.  The fitting room should've been closed because you couldn't pay for purchases anyway.  \n\nThe clothes here are way overpriced compared to Europe.  In the UK,  Zara is not a high end brand.
