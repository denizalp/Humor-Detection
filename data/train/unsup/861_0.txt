This place is the worst steak and shake ever! Took like 20mins to be seated and then another 20 mins to take our order. The hilarious thing, there were at least 5 employees not giving a f*ck. They all stare at you with this stupid look like what are you doing here? HELLO! I want a freaking burger. Apparently there arent any pens at this place either because our waiter went looking for one for like 10mins.
