I love their breakfast, their pizza, the shopping, the wine selection, the music... basically everything.  \n\nWhy not 5 stars?  It's a bit too California.  Scottsdale moms roll up in their Benz with full make-up, diamonds, everything... from the neck up, they look like they're going clubbing.  But then they ALL wear work out clothes like they've just jogged there.  They are going for the LOOK like they just hiked Camelback.  Does this bother anyone else or is it just me?
