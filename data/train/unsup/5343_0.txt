I read all of these raving reviews and because good fish is so hard to find I figured the steep prices would be worthy of the product.  I am kicking myself for paying $14.00 for 2 very average sized crab cakes that tasted like they came off the Highliner frozen food line.  I am too embarrassed to say what I got suckered into for the fish.  Superstore has a better fish product than what I saw recently and for a much better price.  Sorry Orca but I was really disappointed.
