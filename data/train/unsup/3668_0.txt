Stopped by for lunch.  Service was fast and good. The Manager stopped by to talk and see how everything was.  Nice atmosphere.  Basically one large room with a bar off to the side.  Had the Ricotta Gnocchi that has short rib and calabrian chili.  Very tasty with some spice.  Really a good stop for lunch.
