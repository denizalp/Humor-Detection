I was super excited to check this store out during their grand opening weekend and when I went out I was grounded out, lasted the about 1.5 min and bolted. Taxidermy..... not my thing. I'm an animal lover,  so not wanting to be in a store filled with dead ones that were unnecessarily killed to be put on display....dead. no,  I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but this store almost turned me.\nEw.
