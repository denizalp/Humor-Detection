Not a good night for this place. \nGreek salad side - brown wilting lettuce, soggy salad mess overall\nFalafel - terrible. overspiced, grainy tasting and bad mouth feel\nFalafel sandwich - poorly constructed with watery tzatki sauce, brown lettuce.\n\nPlus, in most of their chicken gyro's, they use mixed dark and white meat. Better to ask. Way better places out there. Since my last visit, something happened. Not good.
