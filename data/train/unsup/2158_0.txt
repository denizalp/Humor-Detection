The club is great...IF you get in. The bouncer here is a effing asshole. Unless you're a girl, tall, thin, and look like a slut, you most probably won't get in. It's filled with guido juice heads or underaged kids that look 30. But I guess that's the only thing the guido bouncer can relate to. And he's rude. And has a small dick complex. Maybe he didn't get into Police Tech and is stuck being 40 and a bouncer?
