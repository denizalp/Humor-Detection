We couldn't be happier with Barry's job! He repaired a small tear in the roof of my convertible. He worked deligently until he matched the color perfectly.  You can tell he is very experienced. Besides, he's quite a character-he would be perfect to host his own reality show!! We are very satified with Barry and the overall experience
