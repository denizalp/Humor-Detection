This place is amazing! I've been accused of being a fanboy for Butt Out but Matt has always gone out of his way to earn every bit of appreciation and Mill is no different! The style, vibe,  and character of this shop are top notch and I have been in hundreds of shops across the nation. Not only is the customer service the best but so is the juice. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up for another spectacular iteration of Butt Out.
