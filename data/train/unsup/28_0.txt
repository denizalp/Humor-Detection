Normally wouldn't have thought about going to such a place but we're invited by a friend to meet some of her friends who actually got married at Bar Vinedo. \n\nWe were completely impressed! Well designed, great ambiance. Absolutely love the center piece of this place!! A beautiful life-like tree right in the middle. Gorgeous.\n\nWe only had drinks and appetizers and everything was tasty. Fried pickles are a must have.\n\nStaff was very friendly and attentive without being bothersome.\n\nWe'll be back.
