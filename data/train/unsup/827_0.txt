Enjoyed  Cellar's WEDDING ROOM for several civic events, they do a wonderful job both as to price and quality, the room accommodates 50-80 people and is a treasurer for us busy people who need an off-street, ample-parking, quality place to share a meal and visit and hear from our town's many fantastic speakers.  Can't wait for the next event.
