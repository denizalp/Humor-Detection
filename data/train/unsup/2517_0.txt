I enjoy the selection of beers. Their happy hour is pretty good. Can't go wrong with BBQ cauliflowers which are surpingly filling. Brown paper bag fries with their.ketchup siracha is bomb. Charcuterie board is.on point as well. Overall , everything is great only thing is the service is kinda slow. But. Food and beverages makes.up for it .
