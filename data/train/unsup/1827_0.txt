I have been eating here for 16 years and it is fabulous!!!  The Jerk chicken is my favorite and then the Machaca is next.  The best part is that you can 'have it your way'.  Be sure to ask for 'tryouts' on your first visit so that you can taste a lot of what they have.  As a bonus you get a huge cookies with every meal...yum!
