Great games to play. There are many vintage games with a great selection of pinball. However it is dirty and the staff are rude to children if they have too much fun with giggling and jumping while playing. The old guy with the ponytail needs to relax and stop yelling at children. Saw him yell at 2 different sets of children while I was there for 30 min.  The staff argued and said its a museum and they do not want children there. I will never go back.
