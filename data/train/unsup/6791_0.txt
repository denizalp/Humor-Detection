I was pleased with Country Boy's Restaurant. I come from the country and wanted some good old homecooked meal type of food and that's what you get here. The food as well as the service are of good quality and the prices are great. The d√©cor is undergoing some aesthetic changes and because I could see both parts, the old and new, I'd say it will be a nicer looking place when done so don't judge a book by an outdated cover. All in all, nothing overly special, but good prices and good food.
