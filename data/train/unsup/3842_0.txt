This is an amazing place to go if you need to pick up pretty much everything. Too lazy to cook? Try something at a stall. Want to cook? Pick up some fresh fruits, veggies, and meats to prepare yourself. It's basically a mosh posh of a place and you kind of need to walk around to find everything since nothing's in a particular kind of order, but that just seems like half the fun if you're not in a rush. \n\nIf I lived here, I would be visiting this place more frequently.
