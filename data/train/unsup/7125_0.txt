A great little gas station situated on the corner of Rainbow and Windmill. You can get your oil changed, car washed while you're killing time at the poker machine. Premises are always clean and the staff is friendly. They out of all things have a post office inside, which i must admit is very convenient since it is closer to my house.  Looked around for a barber and a shoeshine, couldn't find one! (jk)\nI have noticed that the gas prices here are lower than across the street. \nA very convenient little corner, highly recommnded.
