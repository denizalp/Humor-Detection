Very clean and organized store. I can always count on someone at this store pointing me in the right direction when I am lost, which can get pretty easy.\n\nThis location was working on some renovations when I was there last. It looks like they are making it easier to find some of their more popular items, which is great for frequent shoppers to find what they need easily.
