It was not busy and the saleswoman seemed bothered that I was asking the size of a belt in inches when it was a M or XL. Is that a crazy question? Shouldn't they know the answer or know how to measure a belt? All the employees I dealt  with there thought measuring a belt was like quantum physics. But they did check me out and gave me a coupon for $25 off in Jan. I will be back, but not to that one...except to exchange the belt.
