I didn't even know I had a membership through National. The guy said, just pick your car and go. And that's what I did.\n\nPicked the car. Went to check out. And off I went. No need for checking the cars for dings, scratches or anything like that.\n\nSo if you don't have a membership at National, get one..it's free anyway.
