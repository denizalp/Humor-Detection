For a Michellin place, I expected better. Service was god awful. The service staff brought gumbo without a spoon, the waitress stopped by to see how things were and noticed it and got a spoon right away, no asking for another cup of joe, no water for sometime. ah, the failings of a restaurant in its service. food was alright, nothing to rave about.
