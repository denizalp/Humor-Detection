We had takeout order today biryani and palak paneer. Since we are vegeterian. Biryani lacked salt but was ok but real horror was having chicken chunks in palak paneer. So be cautious anyone being vegan avoid this place. My husband did call them regarding this and they said we dont know what cook adds in food \"meaning chicken in palak paneer\" then who is to take responsilibity. Totally disgusting....who knows what else may land up in food. AVOID AVOID AVOID
