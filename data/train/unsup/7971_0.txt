We stayed at the Luxor and they gave a coupons to eat at restaurants within the resort. So we tried this place on a Tuesday night and ordered\n1. Beef Chow fun - 18\n2. Orange chicken with Jasmine Rice - 23\nfor $14.89 (Used $20 dining credit for the coupon book and a $10 voucher for staying the night)\n\n- I can sum up the taste in 2 words: Pei Wei. \n- Exquisite dining and service. Very courteous and talkative. \n- Come with a coupon and experience fine dining with fast food flavor!
