I'm a huge fan of old school ice cream parlors, and so naturally I went in to try this Family Circus institution called Sugar Bowl (along with apparently all the members of AARP), and I got the following:\n\n* Really bad (extremely indifferent) service from some surly kid while seated at the counter.\n* Mint chip ice cream with a Windex undertone. I know ice cream isn't good for you, but being downright toxic brings it to a whole new level.\n\nAll in all, pretty disappointing. Won't be back anytime soon.
