As with all Teeters in the Charlotte area, this one is tidy, clean and organized as well as being staffed with folks who understand service and friendliness. One such person noticed me wandering about looking for something and asked if I needed assistance.\n\n\"Yes, please. Where's the pharmacy?\"\n\n\"Oh, we don't have one in this store.\"\n\n\"That would explain why I couldn't find it.\"\n\nOtherwise, the rest of the store was clean, bright and well stocked. Prices are higher than you'll find at the nearby Wally World. There is not a SuperTarget in the vicinity either.
