Went there twice.  First time solo.  Sat at the bar, friendly bartenders, good margaritas, food decent and delivered quick.  \n\nSecond time with family.  Sat at a table.  Extremely poor service.  Inattentive and \"dont give a sh*t \" attitude.  Food took forever and was cold upon arrival.  Waitress shrugged her shoulders and took off.  We left.  No tip, not going back.  Vegas is hurting for business...you can do much better at a place that would appreciate your business.\n\nAppears from other reviews that the wait staff is a big problem.....maybe Jimmy doesn't pay well.
