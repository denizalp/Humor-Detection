The-best-place in Montreal for breakfast and brunch. Oh wow, I still remember the taste of their numerous and beautiful pastries I tried with my boyfriend. Flaky, buttery, fruity deliciousness in buns, croissants, danishes and donuts. Everything was delicious and I wish I tried everything else. Place was super busy when we got there so we grabbed food to go instead. Get there early if you want to sit down or be prepare to wait.
