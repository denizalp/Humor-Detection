I've always been good at following directions, so here's my review for Egg Works. We were very impressed with our server, Nancy, for providing 5-star prompt and friendly service! My favorite dish here is the chile relleno omelet. It's enough food for an entire week and a guaranteed hangover cure. I usually drink 10 cups of really good black coffee while dining here. The food and karma is infinitely better than the Cracked Egg and Nancy is a great server. :)
