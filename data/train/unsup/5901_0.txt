Always go to this theatre! They have lots of movie times. Their lines are just always long, so you have to arrive early for your movie, otherwise you will miss part of it. The theatre is always cleaning and they make sure to have enough cashiers all the time. So they try for sure! Good movie spot in townsquare will always go back!
