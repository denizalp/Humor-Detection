Food is great but service is horrible! This place has no organization. Front cashier girl is horrible and very unprofessional. We were told 45 minute wait and waited almost an hour and a half! No courtesy to walk out and let us know there will be a longer wait nor an apology for such a long wait. Cashier gets her manager and I see her laugh at the fact that we were complaining about the wait. And then she gives my family and I dirty looks. Definitely won't be coming back here again.
