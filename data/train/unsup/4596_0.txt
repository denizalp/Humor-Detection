Ah Kams, a unique form of campustown blight that eclipses all other bars in its propensity for stench and spewing of both human and non-human scum. Please don't support this establishment...it gets enough support from the Greek hegemony, despite the fact it imposes a variety of ills on the nearby sidewalk and air. I still don't know how people manage to navigate the miasma with enough strength left to even open the door. I suspect it is facilitated by a uniquely potent protective layer of bright sienna self-tanner, tube tops, and Abercrombie polos.
