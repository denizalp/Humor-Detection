Best fast food in this area of T-bird and 59th Ave.  I don't know why Del-Taco even bothers to be there on the same corner.  \n\nChipotle is relaibly good quality food, especially the bean or veggie burritos.  However I don't like that they upcharge for the chips\/salsa so much, because I'm spending nearly $8 for a simple burrito, coke, chips\/salsa lunch.  \n\nThis location could do a better job at keeping the dining area clean.
