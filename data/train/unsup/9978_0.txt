What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. Not much I'm guessing.\n\nThe meats are flavorful and have a great char. The bread is fresh and toasted. My favorite part are the grilled veggies. I would come here just for them. The sauces are flavorful. My favorite is the chimmi. I look forward to trying the empanadas and grilled corn next time. Yes the space is small but they are working on an expansion. If in the area this is a MUST try.
