High ticket prices, seats don't recline, tiny theater and dirty bathrooms. \n\nThat sums this place up. If it hadn't been for a time crunch and a convenient show time i doubt I would have come here and after this won't be coming back. Charging $10 a ticket for a screen the same size as I have seen in houses with crapier surround sound to boot.
