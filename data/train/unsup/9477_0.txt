The crown fell off one of my teeth over the weekend and I couldn't get to the dentist until Monday morning, so I popped into this Rite Aid, found the tooth glue stuff and was on my way in minutes. Easy.\n\nI've been to a few Rite Aids and this one is just perfectly fine. Not terrific, not awful. A classic execution of the Rite Aid formula.\n\nConvenient parking and it's right close to the East\/West Blvd Lynx station.
