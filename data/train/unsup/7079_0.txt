So my tooth had attached to the bone. After 90 minutes at my dentist yesterday, he sent me to the oral surgeon this morning. I am in utter disbelief because he had it removed in 3:31. (3 Min 31 seconds from start to finish) Done before one song - Wow! \nIf you ever need an oral surgeon, go here! Dr Kikuchi and staff were so friendly and warm, my experience was phenomenal. Beautiful office and waiting area. What an amazing professional. Fast, friendly and knowledgeable. What an absolute blessing!
