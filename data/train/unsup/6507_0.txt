Great show! Fun, captivating, and filled with good music performed by spectacular performers. If you haven't been benumbed by dozens of Broadways and\/or are a fan of Franki Valli & The Four Seasons' music, you'll definitely have a blast! \n\nIt doesn't fall into my top 10 Broadways, but it's still one of the boy's top 3 all-time favorites!
