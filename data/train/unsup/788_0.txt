I went in to this restaurant hoping to grab an iced coffee to go, which as it turns out is something they don't offer! The staff was super friendly though and offered to try to make one for me anyway and it turned out awesome. I don't live in Phoenix so this was my first trip but my sister goes here all the time and says its great. Two thumbs up thanks main ingredient :)
