Dr. Winer and his staff were very rude from the moment I stepped in.  He is abrasive regarding any conventional medical treatment and I think this is extremely dangerous in some cases.  He told me the medical industry is driven by money while in the next sentence pushing his overpriced \"proprietary\" supplements.  I went in with an open mind but eventually all I saw was someone who cared more about getting my money than helping me.
