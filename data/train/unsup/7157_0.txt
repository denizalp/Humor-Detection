Solid, quality food in a fast casual environment. Friendly service. Had the craftburger (garlic mayo, sauteed mushrooms) which had the just the right ratio of meat to bun.  Meat was well-done but that's the way I like it. Also had poutine, made with hand cut fries, a beef flavored dark gravy, and chopped(?) cheese curds.  As a novice poutine eater, I thought it was pretty good.
