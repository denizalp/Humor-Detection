Anytime we're in vegas, we're at PH. The service is great, the staff is friendly. It's in a prime location on the strip and there's a shopping mall attached (with an urban outfitters!). the buffet is excellent, the rooms are a great value! extremely nice for what you pay (which isn't really all that much).
