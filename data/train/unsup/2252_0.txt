We came here with a party of 14, and I don't think any of us were disappointed.  \n\nAlmost everyone had the fish tacos and they were a big hit.  The fish tacos are apparently the best in Toronto. Even though it was my first time having them, I must agree.\n\nThe service was surprisingly attentive for having a packed house. My water was filled up frequently and the food was brought out within an hour, totally reasonable since we showed up with 14 people during dinner time.\n\nI will definitely come back when I have a craving for fish tacos.
