This place serves some of the tastiest street tacos I've had in all my years here in Arizona. Glad I found another fine gem of a taqueria, with the best, juiciest tacos de lengua (among other things) I've ever had. Not surprisingly, it is extremely popular even if it is not exactly in the best of neighborhoods.
