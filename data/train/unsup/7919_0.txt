First visit....7:48pm on a Saturday night. I'm sitting next to a couple with two kids under 10. The place is so brightly lit, it's like being at cafeteria with really nice chairs. The staff members are warm and friendly which is refreshing. The menus are laminated ()\nAparrently you can wear gym clothes to dinner here, there is no dress code. \nThe Green Monster and Dirty Old Men rolls were great.\nNot sure if I will go back on a Saturday night. There was no vibe...
