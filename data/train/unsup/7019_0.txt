I would never recommend this place...I have a European background....and accustomed to eating cabbage rolls, goulash, paprikash. The food is expensive with cheap cuts of meat....I has a dish served with while slop with no paprika in it over 2 chicken legs...I refused to eat it.... Went there once with my father, never again....There are better options...And no I do not eat at McDonalds..
