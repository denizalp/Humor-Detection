We celebrated a cousin's birthday party here recently and the service was great.  There were approximately 10 of us, and we were never wanting.  The food was delicious, the drinks were great, the service was great, and if we're ever in the area again, we'll be back.\n\nThe pizza was excellent.  I wish I could order this stuff from home.  Do try!  I also had salmon for dinner, which was also very good.  Loved it!\n\nCan't wait to try the other menu items!
