Dan Sherbondy (Dan the Loan Man) is the go-to guy if you want a house! He always kept us updated with the status of our house during the home buying process. Very personable and just a great guy to work with. I would say at the end of this process, not only did we gain a great house, but a great friend. Highly recommended. If anyone can get the deal done, it's Dan the Loan Man! A++++++
