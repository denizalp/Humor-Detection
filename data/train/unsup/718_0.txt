We like to try new places and enjoy Indian food. After seeing Marigold Madison mentioned in a \"best\" NewTimes article decided to try it out last night. It's also close to home. We were greeted warmly by the host, we like to sit at the bar and were served well by bartender. Both were knowledgeable about the menu on which all of the items looked good. We tried the traditional chicken curry, some naan on the side. Everything was excellent. We'll be back often I'm sure. Take out and delivery as well.
