416 751 5555 was the very first number I memorized upon moving to Toronto in 2003. It's been a decade, and I'm still calling my pals at Beck on the regular. \n\nThey're never thrilled to take debit, they usually never say a word, but they're prompt and have the most cabs in Toronto. Pepper props all around, but we've all had that one horrible cab story, so they're not getting five stars.\n\n\"Can I have a cab to blah blah for Evelyn that takes debit?\" \n\"Five to ten minutes.\" \nThe End.
