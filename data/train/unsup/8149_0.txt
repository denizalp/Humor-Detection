if this is Swim Clean pool service in Vegas then I suggest you avoid this company. i have an upscale rental home with salt pool that this pool cleaner did not maintain as a salt pool but rather threw chlorine tabs in. All without my knowledge. charged for filter cleaning and they rotted and fell apart in my hand when I went out to check them. Terrible billing records as well.
