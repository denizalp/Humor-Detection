After receiving poor service at Jamba Juice a few doors down, I really wanted to try this place. I went in on a whim one afternoon and LOVED it. The atmosphere was so inviting and on theme. The employees were very friendly, service was quick, line was organized, and my smoothie was delicious. If I weren't a college student, I would so come here more often and try everything (lack of funds). I'll be back soon!
