A quick review. Came here a month ago after dinner. Were recommended drinks from the Modernist Cocktails list. We had the Sailor's Mojito and the Oceanic. We really enjoyed the Sailor's Mojito but the Oceanic fell short. The Modernist Cocktails are $25-45, while the taste of these drinks are hit and miss, the presentation of them are typically impressive. Albeit a bit loud, the ambiance there was excellent for a date.
