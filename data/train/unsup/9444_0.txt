First time here and I am happy I was invited to Rock and Sol-All-Stars-Jam! The music was amazing. From Blues to Jazz to Soul a little disco and some Rock and Roll. The band was incredible as well as all the singers who performed. \nGot there around 930pm and it was not too busy until around 11pm, and than the house started filling up. Lots of drinking and dancing going on, everyone was very nice and easy to be around.\nDefinitely will stop in again!
