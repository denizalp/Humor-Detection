I'm not sure what everyone is raving about but this place wasn't all that great. The food took a long time to get and there were only 4 other tables of people. My friend got a beef dish and the meat was really fatty. If you like that, great, but if you dont..it was gross. \nI got the AYCE and the  nagiri sushi pieces were very small.  \nBonus round...I got sick all night. \nVery disappointed.
