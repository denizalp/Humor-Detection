Hands down one of the best Italian places I've had in Vegas. I loved everything about this place; environment and food. I definitely want to come here more often. Even had a conversation with the owner, Joe, before we headed out! He was very kind and knowledgeable about the menu and the background of the restaurant. Easily a five star restaurant to me.
