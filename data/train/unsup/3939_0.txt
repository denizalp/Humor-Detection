I have been a customer for over 20 years. The service that they provide is awesome. I actually only have cars that they service because I never want to give them up.  Most mechanics try to bilk you for everything they can. Wallys will prioritize the repairs realizing you may not be made of money. The prices are fair and they are very easy to deal with.   I would recommend them to anyone that has hondas or toyotas in a heartbeat.
