I've been coming here ever since the place opened in the mid 90's.  I use to live a few blocks away.  Since I moved a couple of years ago, I've only been here once or twice a year.  Since I was in the area, I decided to stop by for lunch today.\n\nI ordered the #1 Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni & Provolone Cheese) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips.  The Sandwich was made fresh and tasted delicious!\n\nSolid experience, just like I remember.\n\nWill I return?  When I'm in the area, sure!
