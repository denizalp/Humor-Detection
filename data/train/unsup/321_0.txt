Took my family of eight there for dinner, great old school Mexican food. Nice atmosphere. \nThe server failed to tell me that she added a 18% gratuity. I tipped another 20%. \nI made three (3) calls to the restaurant everyone apologized but no call backs and no credits. \nMaybe the owner needs to get involved ?
