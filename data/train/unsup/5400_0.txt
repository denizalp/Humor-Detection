ok, so, i am not into FALSE ADVERTISING... but No way can you tell me Cream on the SIDE when the menu Clearly has the CREAM on the dessert. \nWell, Fresh Crap in a bowl is more the Taste of this place. Service was Crazy! I feel completely mortified to fight with these people about the way the food comes out completely different... than displayed on a Menu that you sanction as part of your establishment... Seriously calm down about your cream and you should really make sure you deliver what you put on a menu.
