I love that the teachers give me a personal update on my children after each class. They tell me what they are doing well and what they can work on. The staff all seem to be so dedicated to the kids and seem so happy while doing their job. Everyone from swim teachers to front desk staff are so nice. Goldfish does so much to accommodate swim times as your child moves up through the different levels. My girls absolutely love coming to swim class each week!
