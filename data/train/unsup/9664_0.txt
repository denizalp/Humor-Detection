I remember when the line to get in the place was wrapped around the casino, now you can hear the crickets chirp. \n\nThe food is nothing like it used to be, it's either bland or over salted ,there is no in between.  The service is okay but nothing to rave about.\n\nSave your money and go somewhere else.
