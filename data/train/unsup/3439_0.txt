First, I have to say I don't tend to write a review unless I like the place, but this place was just bad. It is waaaaay overpriced, even for sushi! The service was not so great, the waitresses seemed way too cool to be taking care of us. The sushi I would say was good, but not great. I had one roll the was really good, the rest were middle of the road. I would not recommend.
