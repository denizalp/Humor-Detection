This restaurant may be very good but the way they treat potential customers is not. I walked in and was told to wait a few minutes. After being ignored for over 10 more minutes while about 8 open seats were in front of me I decided to walk out and will kit be back. If they were fully reserved they could have said so rather than waste my time on this frigid night. Also, it's not very impressive looking inside, rather tiny, and whomever called the decor modern doesn't understand the concept.
