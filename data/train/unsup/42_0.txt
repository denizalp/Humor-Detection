To start off, the theater is dated. But I like coming here the 2-3 times a year I see a movie because it's not very crowded and the seats are fairly comfortable compared to most theaters. They also have decent matinee prices. An added bonus, they serve beer and wine - but I haven't checked out their offerings yet.
