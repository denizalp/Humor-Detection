My favorite bar in Las Vegas!!\n\nI once read that this bar would be the place Ayn Rand would hang out.  i concur.  It is dark, strange and even a little off-putting...in an inviting way...if that makes sense.    \n\nGreat bartenders, good clientele and damn good music.  Sit back, relax and embrace your inner freak...you will thank me.
