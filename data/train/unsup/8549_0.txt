Really nice setting and great vibes, we loved the atmosphere! We were there on a Saturday night and the restaurant was super quiet (only 2 other tables seated). Despite other reviews saying service was slow, we were served very quickly, our waitress was attentive and super nice.\n\nMenu:\n\n- Really good cocktails\n- Ridiculously small ceviche for $15\n- Very limited choices (only 3 desserts)\n- Not really Cuban\n\nPlease get a more inspired chef and add a few choices to your menu, don't change anything else!
