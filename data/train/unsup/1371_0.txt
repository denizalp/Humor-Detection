My friend and I REALLY enjoyed horse back riding with you guys!!! When we purchased through Groupon we that that's all we had to pay. But there are $9 worth of hidden fees. I know we are already getting an amazing discount with Groupon but you guys should put the fees in the fine front or something. \n\nBut I would definitely go back and visit. Thank you charley for being such a great guide!!!
