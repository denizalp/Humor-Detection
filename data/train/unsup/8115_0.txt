Curiosity was killing us so we had to see what John Taffer did to BSB.\nNot much.\nIt's brighter inside, not so dark and gloomy, but really the same exact place.\nA few new tables, same bar layout.\nDidn't try any food, but the beer out of the tap was warm. I love goose island beer, and when I took that first sip, ehhhh.......ruins it.
