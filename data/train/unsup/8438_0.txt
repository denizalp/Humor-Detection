No lines!!\nNo lines!!\nThank goodness we rented our car here!!!\nU get shuttled to the rental car place when you get to Las Vegas. One shuttle ride is enough. Fox is another taxi ride on top of the main shuttle bus. \nEvery other rental place had a line. \nAt Alamo. No line!! I just walked right up the kiosk, even had an assist from a very nice associate. Walked up chose our car!!(love choosing a car and making sure it smells good)
