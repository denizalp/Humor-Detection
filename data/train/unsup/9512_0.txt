Excellent Chinese food run by Chinese nationals from mainland China.  Excellent sliced potato with vinegar and ong choy with garlic.  My wife is chinese is a chinese national and we came here two days in a row.  We live in Los Angeles and this restaurant is as good as any for authentic Chinese food.
