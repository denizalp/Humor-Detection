What a horrible place I live in!! The HOA here is the worst. I was charged $318 to get my vehicle out of impound because it was towed for no plates. The tow report LISTS the plate number on it! So why was my vehicle towed...?????\n\nThe security is threatened to be fired if they don't give out violations, so you get violations for the slightest thing (like a vehicle \"dripping\" no, that was a beverage I poured out you nit wits!!)\n\nAbsolutely the worst. I can't wait to leave this shady establishment!
