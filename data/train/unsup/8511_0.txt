Super location!  Close to everything either by walking or the Victoria Square Metro.  Nice place with all the amenities.  Super friendly and polite staff. Very helpful when needed.  Bartender was a lot of fun. Nice little park across the street for people watching. About 4 blocks to the music fests. Shopping restaurants anything you want to do is easy to get to. Recommended?  I would stay there again so YES!
