Very disappointed!!! I decided to visit the local Buffalo Wild Wings while here in North Las Vegas visiting my daughter. The wings were less than desirable. A portion were missing their sauce\/flavor that I requested and the others were just too hard to eat. When I called to speak with a manager a man came on the phone, questioned me ask if I was lying and then said hold on let me pull up your order but never came back on the phone.
