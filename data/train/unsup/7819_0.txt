Desert Driving ...not what I thought it would be, I really wanted to actually learn Desert Driving and drive dune buggies over sand dunes.\n\nWell I wish driving schools actually taught real lessons on how slower traffic needs to KEEP RIGHT, so as to not to bottleneck the freeways, or how Motorcycles need separate rules, tail-gating, merging into a four lane road... I can go on for hours
