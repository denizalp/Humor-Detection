We used the online app to set up a reservation and were seated almost immediately.  The menu's were so sticky and gross.  Come on, clean your menu's and give us clean menu!\nWhile we were waiting we were surrounded by little moth like bugs.  Not sure what the deal is but not good.  My steak was a little tough and a tad overcooked but OK.  My baked potato came in some foil and was OK but overly steamed from being in the foil to long.
