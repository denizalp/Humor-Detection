This location has some positives and some negatives.  The positives are the coffee and doughnuts are consistently good each time.  The staff is friendly and the service is mostly attentive when they are available (read below).  \n\nThe negatives are the dining area is not kept consistently clean throughout the day, and I've visited on more than one occasion when the staff is nowhere to be found in the afternoon.  I've gone inside during afternoon hours, said hello, and waited at the counter for someone to acknowledge me, only to walk out several minutes later when they don't.
