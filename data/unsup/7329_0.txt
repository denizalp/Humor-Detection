I was looking for a Montreal bakery to deliver a bunch of tasty goodies to my mom for her birthday, and stumbled across Sweet Lee's on the interwebs.  I wasn't sure what to order and let them select their \"best of\".  Not only did they hand deliver the goodies (early on a Sunday morning as requested), but both the quantity and quality exceeded expectations.  My mom loved all of it and spent the better part of 30 minutes on the phone describing in mouth watering detail all the different sweet and savory experiences.  Will be ordering more stuff again!
