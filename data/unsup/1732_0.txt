Food is great. Meat is a good quality. And the side dishes varied. And the grill that you cook the food on is really good and nonstick. Overall I really like what they serve...\n\n... That's if they serve you.\n\nThe ladies that work here, while there are some that are great, they're always not present. \n\nThe food is great, the restaurant atmosphere is your standard fare for Korean BBQ. \nService is something to be desired.
