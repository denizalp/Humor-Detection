My wife and I came here for some beverages and also because of their free wifi. We popped in and got medium mango smoothie and large mango milk tea. Came to just a little under $14. The staff was cutting mango so most definitely this place makes drinks with real fruit. None of that powdery stuff. \n\nDrinks are not bad here. Will be back if I'm in the area.
