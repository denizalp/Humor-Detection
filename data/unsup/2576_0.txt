Staff at front desk are very nice and efficient but there is only one outlet in the room and its in the bathroom. In this day and age outlets are so important. Also no fridge. Nice lookimg room. Just shocked about outlet situation. Also noticed that hallways and elevators are not air conditioned. It must be very miserable working in housekeeping here. But front desk staff very good and the restaurant was good!
