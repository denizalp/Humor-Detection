Prices can't be beat.  I was researching workout recovery formula on amazon, low and behold the most inexpensive one was this business right in Scottsdale off of Shea and Scottsdale Rd.  The owner was very knowledgeable and friendly, helped to answer all of my questions and made a few recommendations.  Ultimately I left happy and with what I needed.  Will definitely be back.
