Was back in Scottsdale last night and had to return to Amy's. \n\nFood was absolutely amazing! I had the humus again which is out if this world and also enjoyed the Fig and Prosciutto pizza. \nHad to have desert, so I tried the cheesecake. I'm from NY originally so I know cheesecake. Amy's was one of the best I ever had!!\n\nSamy and Amy thank you for an enjoyable evening. I hope to return soon. All the best!!!\n\nBob\nThe Pilot
