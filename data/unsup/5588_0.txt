Do not buy meat here. Again, DO NOT purchase meat at this Shop n Save. They do not have an in house meat department. Therefore, meat is EXTREMELY old. I bought pork chops yesterday that smelled like sh** when I opened the package. They looked perfectly fine because of added color I would guess but smelled so bad I had to toss them out. In fact, every time I have tried to buy any type of meat here it has been way below satisfactory. Do yourself a favor and visit the butcher on butler street a few blocks away.
