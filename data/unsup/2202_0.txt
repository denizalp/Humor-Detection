Looks nice and the owner Virgil is friendly but we refused to pay the $15 cover each tonight. Maybe I'll come back another night when there's no \"special event\".  Heard it was empty on Thursday night and it was damn near empty tonight at midnight so I'm not sure why cover is so high. btw,  shisha is $15!!  Really??  Should have stayed at Fusion Lounge where the DJ was poppin and cheaper shisha. Virgil,  I'll give Ur place a try next time and update review.
