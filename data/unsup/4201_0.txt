Had the backyard bbq burger (pineapple bbq, onion ring, cheese) which was amazing. It is served with a choice of side and I chose Jamaican sweet corn also delicious. Also had Philly cheeseburger the best Philly cheese steak in AZ. Cannot wait to come back and try other burgers and bring the rest of the family and friends. Nice island vibe. Should play ialoharadio.com even better.
