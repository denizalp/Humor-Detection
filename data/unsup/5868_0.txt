Buffalo wild wangs is absolutely awesome!  the last time I ate at this place was during labor day weekend 2005 but the taste remains fresh in my mind.  I hear that they don't make the captain morgan sauce anymore but man, the wings here are just to die for.  Yes patrick, I wish they had this chain in the bay area too.  Let's write them a letter!
