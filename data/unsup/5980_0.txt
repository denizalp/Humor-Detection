This is my second visit and I am very impressed with the variety and selection here. I tried the southwest wrap and it was spicy, but extremely good. My godson ordered the pecan praline cheesecake and unfortunately didn't leave me any. Cool atmosphere, friendly staff, nice art. Definitely coming back here again.
