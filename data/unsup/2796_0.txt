I snuck into Taco's Chiwas before Guy's legions of fans invaded (Thank GOD). I read they had the bestest barbacoa tacos & salsas. I found everything to be tasty, clean & some updated bathrooms. I really liked that they had a variety of veg &  salsas at the salsa bar. The evening we went in it wasn't crowded at all & didn't have to wait in line. The Pastor was juicy, fresh with the perfect sweet spicy you expect from a good Pastor. Definitely going to return & try the rest of the menu.
