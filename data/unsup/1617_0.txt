I had the #1 which is a Lamb Gyro. The lamb was seasoned so deliciously! Seriously, it was really good. Most Greek places I've been to are a disappointment, so I never really consider them as a choice for dining out. However, I was in the area and decided to stop in. This place has probably the best Gyros I've ever had. Only 4 stars since I've only tried one thing on the menu. Ill be back since I live just next door though!
