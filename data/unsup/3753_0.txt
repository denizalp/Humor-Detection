You know those super convenient color coordinated rings that you can put on your keys in order to really quickly figure out which key goes to what? Well, I have been looking for them for about 3 years now (I'm actually not kidding). I walk into Chagrin Hardware today and what do I see? A huge bin of them.\n\n\nSo because of that reason alone they deserve 5\/5 stars in my book.
