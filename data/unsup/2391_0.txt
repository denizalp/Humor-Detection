One of my favorite places for fish tacos. Everything was prepared fresh when i ordered and they had it ready for me in just minutes. In addition to their super friendly staff, the atmosphere was positive, the service was top-notch and most importantly, the food was AMAZING. Will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu. When I'm craving for Mexican food, gourmet gringos will always be the first place I think of!
