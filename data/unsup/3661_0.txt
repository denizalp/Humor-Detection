Food was exceptionally good - that's the reason for 2 stars instead of 1 star.\n\nHowever.  Big however here folks...\n\nJamie, the manager, who was our waiter, was off the charts ridiculous. He was dropping f-bombs and swearing like a sailor assuming we would be warm to that?!?!?  \n\nHe made us feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, I would go as far to say that given the dilation of his pupils - he was either on coke or crank. \n\nThe last straw was when he insulted my wife and I as he was giving us our check. Wtf ?!?!\n\nWon't be back.
