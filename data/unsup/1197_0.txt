WORST SERVICE EVER!\nDIRTY tables with used plates, cups, utinsils, napkin, etc...\nAsked for them to clean up 4 times with no avail!!  Instead, they give you attitude and neglect your requests!  Not worth the wait and by the time you get the food after waiting in line for 40 minutes, you're so turned off by the service that the food is no longer good. \nEXTREMELY bad service.
