Simply amazing grand cathedral in the city's Vieux-Montr√©al neighborhood.  It has to be one of the most amazing cathedrals in North America.  The outside isn't the most spectacular but once you step inside, it's a whole other story.  The altar, stained glass, artwork and organ are all beautiful.  Don't forget to step inside the chapel.  Admission is only $5 making this a must see.
