Tommy's, you have saved me time and time again from the morning after headache, and now is my chance to thank you. \n\nThe omelettes are amazing. Try the one made with falafel! Actually, try anything with falafel.  \n\nWould highly recommend this place for families or picky eaters. I feel like they have something for everyone. \n\nThe ambiance is casual and inviting. Old school diner meets vegetarian-friendly Mediterranean hipster.\n\nAh and always ALWAYS get the chocolate shake (even at breakfast)
