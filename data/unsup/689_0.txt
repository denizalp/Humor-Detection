This place is legit. If you like tacos of any kind you should check this out. The rajas Gordita is my favorite, but everything on the menu fantastic. The staff are also very friendly. Surprisingly it's pretty cheap for quality of food. If you real deal tacos or you like green chiles or if just want the best Phoenix has to offer this is the place.
