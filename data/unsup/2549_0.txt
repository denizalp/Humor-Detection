Had a three egg Omelet, with onions, smoked sausage and cheddar cheese. Lots of onions, very little sausage and hardly any cheese. Very disappointing! The grits were like soup, also disappointing. A $10.00 breakfast and you only get one slice of toast??? I don't believe the Omelet was made with fresh eggs. The coffee was good!
