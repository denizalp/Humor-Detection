Tryon House Restaurant is a family restaurant focused on Southern Diner food.  My manager and I went for breakfast.  I ordered the \"Breakfast Special\".  I requested for Sunny Side Up Eggs, Sausage, Grits, and Biscuit.  YUM!\n\nLooking around at the crowd, it looks like a lot of \"seniors\" that are regular customers.  That means the food must be pretty darn good!
