Delish! The small plates here are fantastic. We ordered some dishes to share:\n\n-Ahi tuna tacos (really good, we ordered another round)\n-field salad\n-rock shrimp (comes with rice noodles, delicious)\n-chicken wings\n-sliders\n\nAll the food was delicious. The sangria is excellent as well. My only complaint is that their small plates really are not enough for a meal with multiple people. It's perfect for a snack and cocktails.
