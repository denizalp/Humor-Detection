They stuck us under the stairs - what?  Was it something I said?\n\nWe ate at the 'r bar cafe' part of the restaurant which is evidently more low key and casual.  While I enjoyed my meal (crab gumbo and a shared mac-n-cheese appetizer) and the by-the-glass wine list was decent, I don't think I walked away feeling like I had received my money's worth.  I completely understand that this is a very common feeling on the Strip, but that doesn't mean I'm letting them hose me again.\n\nAnd yes, the key lime pie is vastly overrated.
