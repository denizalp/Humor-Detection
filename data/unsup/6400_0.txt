Very good diner.  Corn beef hash was not the best I have had but was solid.  I did not have one of their famous bread rolls but they looked good.  Coffee was plentiful and strong which is essential for any breakfast place in my book.  I live in SW Vegas but will return next time I am around Charlston and Rainbow.
