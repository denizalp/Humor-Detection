Slow if you're in a rush... But they have some pretty mean fajitas.\n\nThey've spent a bunch of dough turning the space into something very visually appealing. The salsa bar is great (especially the pineapple) and they are licensed, as well.\n\nIf you decide you want to order more (say an extra taco), you've got to line up again and get a new number (which means you may have several numbers on your table) which seems a bit silly instead of just being able to either add to your current order (or heaven forbid...order from the table!)
