During my stay at The Wynn, I had an amazing meal the Bartolotta. The Mediterranean  style seafood was amazing. The flavor, the seasonings, and the temperature of my food upon arrival was amazing. Thank you for hot food...you'd be surprised how often food comes to me warm. The food is obviously flown in daily from multiple places because the freshness is absolutely recognizable. \n\nOutside seating is a must for me. That is my only complaint. Its absolutely worth your time to make this a priority stop on your next trip to Vegas.
