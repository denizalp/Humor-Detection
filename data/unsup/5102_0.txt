The management of the restaurant is bad, me and my friend came for a dinner at 4:30 pm and they said they won't serve food for 40-50 minutes because of the change in service, this is not professional at all , so we left. We didn't try any food , but for me it was enough to base my review on that . I might give it a try , but for now it is just 1 out of 5 for management and organization.
