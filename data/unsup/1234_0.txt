Boring boring boring. OMG this place is boring. We come here with every trip to Vegas. It's so boring can count every 8 visit from the old location to this new one.\n\nMy husband loves this place. Now my son loves it. He can find all his childhood pinball machines. \n\nEvery worker has been real nice and helpful. Machines are kept well. You should totally come here they do good deeds and the prices are reasonable. \n\nPinball hall of fame, you boring place, we will visit you again on our next visit. I love my husband that much.
