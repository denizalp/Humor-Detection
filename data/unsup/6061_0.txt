I really really think they don't deserved any business, the owner wich is a woman is a very nasty person as well as the employees she has, everytime l go in l received horrible customer service!\nThe only reason l have used this location is because is the closest one to my home.\n\nI will try this place from now on, Clemco Postal on 8414 W. Farm Rd ( suite 180) just about the other side of 95 and Durango.\nGOODBYE going postal!!!
