On Sunday August 14, Lyft driver Joseph picked me up to take me to my moms for a birthday party. I asked him to stop at Frys so I could pick up a cake. When I came out he was gone along with my suitcase full of clothes. It was over 2 hrs before the driver could be contacted. It's now Wednesday night and I still don't have my stuff. I have filed a police report as my stuff has not been returned.
