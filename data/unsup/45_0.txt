This is probably my least favorite location in town- and the smallest, and consequently there is less selection\/stock, yet the prices seemed a bit higher here. Majority of merchandise here seems to be stuffed animals, pillows, and the like. Snack selection and Hello Kitty merchandise was limited (no green tea Kit Kats, couldn't find a basic gift). Music was blasting, the lone employee present was rearranging shelving and did little to interact with customers.
