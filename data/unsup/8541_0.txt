I found here after my last place was doing a horrible job.  There was no wait for a mani pedi and it was better than I've had in a long time.  The foot massage was also amazing. \n\nI was surprised how quickly they were done with both services and the quality is excellent. \n\nThe shop was clean and comfortable.  I always worry about cleanliness and this was great. \n\nMy only complaint is the extra cost for the Rockstar gel line but it's worth it.
