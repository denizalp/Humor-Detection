If you are interested in being treated unkindly then go to National Stone and work with Theresa and her nephew Mo.  Both were very nasty, rude people to work with.  The only redeeming individuals there are Mose and a gentleman that I talked to named Jim they were both very nice!  My wife and I would of liked to do business with them, but Theresa made it impossible!
