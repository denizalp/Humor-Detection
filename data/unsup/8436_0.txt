I'm so glad I called High 5! I made last minute plans to go to California and my usual pet sitter was going with us. Marc came and met my dogs and parrot on very short notice and started the next day! I loved seeing daily picks of my \"babies\". And, when a fire closed I-15 on our return, Marc fit in an extra, unscheduled stop to make sure everything was fine, giving me peace of mind while stuck in traffic!
