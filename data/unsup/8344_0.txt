I did not know these stores were still in business (thanks to Amazon, etc.). No offense to Books-a-million. They even have their own groovy little \"starbuckseque\" coffee shop. I'm sure they love all the comparisons, so here's one more. Remember B Dalton Bookstores in the mall? That's the feeling I got when I went inside, but times five. Decent selection of books and magazines. Tons of great kitsch for stocking stuffers. Marvel, Star Wars and Walking Dead figures\/memorabilia. The prices did seem a bit inflated. Browsing did make me smile - prices made me frown.
