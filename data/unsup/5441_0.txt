I came here after reading through the yelp reviews hoping to have some great sushi....\nUnfortunately this was not the case. As I sit here at 9pm after eating at pure sushi I feel disappointed and dissatisfied. Rice was way too sticky. Fish was stale. Service was ok. Would not return. Would not recommend.
