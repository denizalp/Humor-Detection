Sushi was good, but the reason why I gave it a 2 was the appetizer was awful.  We ordered the calamari and it was a cheap version of a microwaved dish.  Overly breaded and the calamari was very rubber.\n\nWe had 4 other sushi rolls for our main course and they were a lot better.\n\nWe came just in time for happy hour and the Moscow mule was awesome the second time around.
