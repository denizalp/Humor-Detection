Reading these reviews is confusing for me, either this place is reading their reviews and fixing the issues or people have no idea what Mexican food should taste like. I have traveled to 17 states in Mexico and rarely have I had food  this fresh and well seasoned. Margaritas, Queso fundido and Palo de le√±a al fuego were all delicious. I will be back next week when I return from Mexico.
