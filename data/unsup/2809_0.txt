They put some effort into making some dishes look good! Items like quesadillas, on the other hand, are plain, and made with just the essentials. Carne asada is a good judge of what's hot and what's not in these places, and theirs was too chewy, and in tiny pieces...but, it was well-seasoned.\n\nThat being said, this is the kind of place you'll only go if you're stuck in the neighborhood a while...you can't find better for miles in any direction.
