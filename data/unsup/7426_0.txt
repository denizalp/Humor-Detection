Tried another float here, and it relieved a lot more tension than last time!  It was like my body was more accustomed to the weightless feeling so it was easier to relax.  My back and neck felt a lot better, but it took some time for me to get the right position to rest my arms so that my shoulders would get some tension relief, so my shoulders were still a little sore.\n\nP.S.  Really bad idea to itch your nose or eyes while floating!  Stings like a b!^*#!
