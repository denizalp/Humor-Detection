The rudest people I've ever encountered. I asked for no onions or pickles and the rude assistant manager told me I should've bought the food back in although my husband and daughters picked up the food and were long gone by the time I realized my order was incorrect. So instead of going back I asked if my burger could be replaced and she snatched my receipt and replaced it but had the worst attitude ever!!!!! She shouldn't be in customer service at all.
