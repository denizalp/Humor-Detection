I'm not a fan of the parking lot layout, they try to be fancy and separate the lots instead of just having rows and rows of parking spaces causing traffic to come at you from every direction.\n\nThey have more samples and better items to sample than say, Sam's Club. I just like the lighting of Costco more than Sam's.\n\nI found a lot of great items here that I normally can't find at other big box stores such as, Chia seeds, longneck craft beers, and the large selection of wine.
