More of a hole-in-the-wall atmosphere, but well worth it.  Place seems like they are still settling in (been there 3 months, but still had paper towels, soda machine was not functional (but they have canned and I think free refills\/cans)) but the food was awesome.  Loved every bite, portions are huge, and the left overs were just as good.  I WILL BE BACK.
