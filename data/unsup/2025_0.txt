I really really wanted to love this! I went there to try the chorizo burrito only to be told they didn't have the chorizo made yet. Fair enough so I decided to go with the steak burrito as a second choice. It was good the pico was good cilantro was fresh. Steak however was tough and grisely and I found it not to be seasoned at all. Bummer. I will probably try again since everybody should get another chance. I hope next time they have the chorizo. Till then I can say it's just ok.
