Finally a decent Korean place on Mont Royal! Sure it was not crowded but it was a Tuesday night and it's newly open. The deco is chic which I didn't expect. Service was very good too. Tteobokki were ok, dolsot bibimbap was really good. I would come back again even though the ambiance was a bit stiff. I guess it just needs more time to get known.
