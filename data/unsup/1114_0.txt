I always wondered what \"Te Koop\" meant and when I was in Amsterdam I saw the sign EVERYWHERE - so it turns out it IS Dutch and it means \"for rent.\"\n\nThis store has a really great selection of bags, purses and weekenders in every size imaginable. They have an exceptionally good selection of Matt & Nat bags in every style but if you're bargain hunting you won't find the best prices here, unfortunately.\n\nTe Koop is also a good choice for winterwear - sleek hats, gloves and the like.
