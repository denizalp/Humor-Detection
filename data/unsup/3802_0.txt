They have Lagunitas IPA on tap.\nSo  yeah, there's your 4 stars right there. \nOn top of that they are on my bike route home from school... so convenient.\nSuper plus, my bartender kept my drink full and get this, didn't ignore me.  She was funny, and friendly, and really made my day.\nSo yeah, I'll be back.
