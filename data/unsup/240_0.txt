My first time to the Alchemy, I asked for a burger without bacon or pork - the waitress informed me they don't have beef burgers without pork because they mix the two meats together. While some enjoy this flavor, this recipe piece isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu, or the website, so eat at your own risk. The fries and service were amazing though! :-)
