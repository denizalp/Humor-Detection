It's definitely a fun idea but beware it is also verrrryyy messy! I got a large cone dipped in dark chocolate with pistachios on top and the total came to around $7.50 with tax. They only serve vanilla iced cream but there are a plethora of of dips and toppings to choose from. Those of you who are thinking of trying it I would recommend a medium come or smaller because by the end of that late night dessert, I was pretty drunk on ice cream.
