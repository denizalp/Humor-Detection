Is it weird that I'm reviewing the Go Bus Terminal...just so I can review the patties they sell at the newstand?\n\nThey're phenom. They're unlike the standard ones, these have a thicker crust and they usually warm em up till you burn your mouth.\n\nAsides from Jamaican stores that do the for real real stuff, it's my fav patty in the city.
