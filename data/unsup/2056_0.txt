The pizza here is normally ok to good but a great value so we tried the Gyro sandwich and that was a mistake.  They put 4 very thin slices of meat. Everything on the sandwich over played the minuscule amount of meat. Very disappointing now i can't trust anything on their menu to be a normal serving size. So long you lost us
