Please dont eat or order here.  we ordered online 1 hour ahead.  i came there and they told me that my order was given to another customer.  They told me that it will be another 30 minutes wait.  I was PISSED.  I told them to make sure that they cancelled the order.  It has been paid online.  Then the head chef came out confronted me.  REALLY?!!!  Big Mistake!!!  I told the crew to tell him to go out so we can fight outside.
