Really cool atmosphere with a beer wall on tap, activated by a wrist band. The line has clear plexiglass to allow you to see prep and food quality. Incredible vegan options for cheese and vegan meat. Staff is happy to acomidate any requests for additional portions. Food is prepared quickly in a brick oven. The only thing that would make this better for a vegan patron is other vegan cheese options than Diaya cheese. Overall really cool place!
