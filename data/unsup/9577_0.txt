Goodness Gracious!!!! let me tell you what! This place is de frickin licious! I had the bbq mahi mahi and the tuna the Tavarue one with the honey wasabi sauce that I'm pretty sure could make a shit sandwich taste good! I can't wait to go back! The service was excellent as well! Sunday at 11 with no wait and food within 10 minutes! Make a bulldog break his chain bo!
