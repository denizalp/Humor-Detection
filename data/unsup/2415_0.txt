When it came to dim sum, this place was alright but nothing spectacular (compared to other dim sum places in the city). There were basics and some of the dishes had a bit of a modern twist, but nothing over-the-top. I liked the selection of vegetable dishes (crisp, fresh vegetables) which is sometimes lacking in most dim sum restaurants.
