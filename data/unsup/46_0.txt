Don provided a sense of security and comfort with his many chairs, fresh pots, and extensive periodical selection. He was friendly and informative during our quick and easy oil change. Located next to Octopus Car Wash the locale is prime paralleled only by Don's friendly banter, soft eyes, warm aura, etc. Don has become my spiritual guru as I travel across this fair land. All roads bring me back to Don. I'd take a bullet for Don.
