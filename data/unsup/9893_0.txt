Heart Attack Grill is the epitome of oxymoron. Nurses triaging and medicating you with high calorie, heart clogging treats. How fun?! Our drinks were served by prescription from the nurses and every detail of the restaurant was well thought out. Most importantly the place was clean and the menu was very reasonably priced. Can't wait to visit on future trips!
