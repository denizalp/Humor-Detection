I'm adding one more update to my review. As I've mentioned before, the Mediterranean Chicken Salad is my favorite salad on the menu but while dining with my Mom I learned a helpful tip that makes the salad even better. Yes it is possible to make it better! Instead of having the salad with the cold chicken, ask them to substitute it with the hot grilled chicken sliced on top. It changes the salad completely and makes it an even better meal!
