Went here the other night with a group of friends. The staff was extremely accommodating for our crowd. The server was just awesome. And then there's the food. SO DELICIOUS! I had the chicken fried goodness and it was to die for. The gravy alone should be bottled and sold. If you are in the mood for some Texas sized portions and delicious Texas sized flavor....make this restaurant a stop for you!
