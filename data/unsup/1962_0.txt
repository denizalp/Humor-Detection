I've been eating at the Blackfoot truck stop since I was a little kid and its still good, its very sad that the previous owner Edna passed away due to heart problem (may her soul rest in peace) but its still so yummy besides the fact! The food here reminds me of my Grandmothers good old home cooked meals. It's also cute how they have a train that goes around the stop of the diner. Very laid back, happy and calm atmosphere. :)
