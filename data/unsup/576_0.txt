They did such an awesome job fixing my completely shattered iPhone 5C screen it looked almost and functions almost better than new.  Super clean store, super courteous staff. AND DONE SUPER FAST TOO!  Omg I could not believe my phone was ready no problem after 45 minutes!!! And the prices are super reasonable too!!
