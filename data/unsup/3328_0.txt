Really good food. The place is hidden in a strip mall and it's pretty small inside but the menus and decor are really cute. Excellent service.  My friend inhaled his pad thai which he said was really good. I got something similar to drunken noodles and it was so good and the beef was super tender. My hubby got noodles too and asked for them thai extra hot and boy did he regret that! It lit him on fire. I'll have to try the curry next time.
