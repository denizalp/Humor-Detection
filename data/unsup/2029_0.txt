I had to update since I've had a few issues with pricing. The systems are t always updated so I've had to go back, get on line again and get a refund for the over charge. I get this happening once in a blue moon, but it seems to happen every time I go, which is a bummer. Buyer beware. Otherwise the selection is great at this location, it's well organized and clean. I get good service too, I just rather not have to watch the checkout like a hawk if possible.
