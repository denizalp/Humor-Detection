Located in Terminal B of McCarran.  I greatly prefer Chipotle for fast casual Mexican food, but 360 looked like it had some interesting flavor combos.  You can jazz up your selections with Thai, Cajun, and Teriyaki styles among others.\n\nI got a burrito bowl with Chicken, Mushroom, and Artichokes.  Portions a bit on the smaller side for $10, but the flavors were decent and the food was piping hot.  Artichokes were good sized and were pickled, which gave some nice acidity.
