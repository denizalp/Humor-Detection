I'm just being nice with the two stars. Called to cancel my services because I am moving and I don't feel like paying $90 for internet anymore. I'd rather switch to something cheaper like century link. The guy on the phone asked me why I was canceling and I WAS TRYING TO BE NICE and I just told him I'm moving and I don't really want to have internet in my new place. HE CALLED ME CRAZY. It's def 2018. Like what if I just want to hotspot off my UNLIMITED DATA on my phone. He was an idiot.
