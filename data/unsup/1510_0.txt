Pretty good. It is pricey for a reason. Good line and great service.  Such a great variety of food.  Seafood and steak of course.  Go to Vegas and eat here.  One of the best buffets I always tell my friends to go to.  Very pack and be prepare to wait. The wait is worth it.  Long line for a reason. Its pretty damn good.
