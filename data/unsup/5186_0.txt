Had a great experience here and the doctor was very nice and knowledgeable. The staff was very nice too.  My dog had to be put under for an ear infection so they could clean it out, they also did a teeth cleaning and neutered him all in the same surgery.  My dog is much better than when he went in.  I didn't give 5 stars because of the billing procedure.  Long story.
