I ordered the Best Friend waffle and it was decent, crispy and soft in a good way. However, they undoubtedly put spoiled milk in my thai tea with boba! Unfortunately I got my food through Postmates so I couldn't do much complaining with out calling but I was extremely disgusted and will not be returning. Who knows what else is out of date in their store.
