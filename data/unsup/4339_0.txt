Writing this after I had to switch to 3 different spots because they would not respond to me pressing the red button and I know for a fact it's not because it was out of order as the card before me just placed an order. \n\nAll I ordered was a small slush but I waited 15+ minutes just to get it. I guess they still had to go out and pick the fruit. \n\nUsually love sonic slushes which is why I'm giving it two stars but honestly service is everything.
