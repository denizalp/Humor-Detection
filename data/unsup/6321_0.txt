I told my coworkers I  would pick up lunch for them at Bacchus today, so nobody brought their lunch. Got there at noon and they have a little sign stuck on the door that says they will be opening at 3. I called before I went and it said they would open at noon. They could have at least changed their voicemail. Now none of us have lunch. Not impressed
