Off the strip this is still a great place for families.\nConnected to Bass Pro and with a great free aquarium we stopped here to visit rather than stay the night.\nPlenty of easy parking and not busy, this is ideal if you want to have it a bit more quiet than on the strip.\ngreat service, very clean and well maintained.
