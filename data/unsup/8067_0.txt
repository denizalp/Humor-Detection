Hugely hyped ice cream parlour takes soft serve to a new level. I got a medium salted caramel and pistachio in the baked cone. I think the cone ruined it a bit because it's warm, so the ice cream melts immediately. It doesn't add to the flavour. I'd go back and try a cup with chocolate and sprinkles. Go at noon to avoid the huge lineup. Also, eat fast! As proven by the gooey ice cream stains on the sidewalk, melting is a hazard.
