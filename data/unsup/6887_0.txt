Simply amazing. This has to be some of the best Italian food that I've had in my life. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs which were fantastic! Their \"Sunday sauce\" is so delicious and pairs exceptionally well with their fresh made garlic bread. Perhaps the best part of Parma is the staff. Everyone is so warm and inviting. If you're a fan of delicious, well priced Italian food you should stop by Parma. You will not regret it.
