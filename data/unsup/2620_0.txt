Ok, so this is a super cute, instaworthy spot in the Arcadia area. Do the offerings and service live up to the picture worthy place? Yes! I've enjoyed quite a few green tea lattes here and really enjoy their special called the Leya which is green tea, vanilla, and rose flavor with some pretty petals for your Insta. I've enjoyed some decadent macarons with my tea on occasion and they're oh so delicious and also pretty. They're going to expand their food menu which will entice me to frequent this place more.
