Awesome food selected from either seasonal menu or daily options. The meatloaf, which is currently standard, was delicious and the green bean and sweet potato tempura starter was light and very tasty. The dessert - the Girl Scout trio consisting of their take on Samoas, Tagalongs, and Thin Mints - was, well, orgasmic. The waitress, Roxanne, whom I told did NOT have to put on her red dress, was sweet and not overly attentive. Oh, and it's BYOB! I will definitely be back!
