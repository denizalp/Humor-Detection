Amazing place to live in Las Vegas. I've been here for over five years. I originally rented but a unit after renting for two years. \n\nCentral to all of Las Vegas \nLas Vegas Blvd address \nConvenient location when you have visitors in the strip \nWalking distance to the convention center, sls, Wynn, fashion show etc \nSwimming pool area with lots of chairs and cabanas \nGas powered grills that are always clean\nMany more amenities. \n\nThe building is super safe.  And once you learn to navigate the HOA rules things become much simpler.
