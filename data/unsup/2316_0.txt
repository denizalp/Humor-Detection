~ 2.5 stars ~\n\nCame here for the team building event for work we tried their Driving range and Mini Golf both were fun to do. The areas were clean and well maintained.\n\nAlthough the booking service was not good. The person was very helpful in helping us with booking this corporate event and very rude.
