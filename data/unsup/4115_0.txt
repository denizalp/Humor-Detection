Koto is a fancier japanese sushi restaurant.  I ordered salmon sashimi, creamy scallops sushi, shared 1\/2 rolls of Philadelphia roll and Spider crab roll - overall pretty good sashimi and sushi.  It is on the pricey side but the sushi was fresh and tasty.  The salmon sashimi came in huge thick cuts!  \n\nEven my protege liked what I ordered for him!  I've converted him to a sushi eater!
