Looking for place to watch the game with a lot of tv's, has cold beer and really good wings? Here ya go, Hurricane Grill is it. This place is nothing special with decor or anything, but the selection of wing sauce is outstanding, and the size of the bone-in wings is excellent. The waitress gave us a recommendation on 2 sauces that was spot on. We will be back again and again. Comfortable neighborhood spot.
