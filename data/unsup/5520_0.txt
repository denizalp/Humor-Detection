Popped in this morning looking for some snacks for my kid and her friend. Lots of delicious looking things, but bakeries are dicey when working with an egg allergy. I gave up finding them something.\n\nI did get a zeppole to try for myself. Note if you don't like getting your hands messy while eating then sit down and eat this with a knife and fork. I took mine to go. It was a sticky, oozy mess. Tasty, but I only ate about a third of it - that was rich and messy enough for me.
