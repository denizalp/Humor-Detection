To my chagrin I went here for my wedding dinner. \n\nThis is cafeteria food. Way overpriced cafeteria food. I wouldn't be so critical but the price warrants any and all criticism.\n\nThe free wine is garbage... Though some folks (the folks drinking to get drunk) may not mind. If you buy your vino in a box disregard that last statement.\n\nThey had a hack accordian player wandering the room for tips.
