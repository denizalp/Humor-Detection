We ate at Lamesa for my partner's birthday. We had the 11-course chef's tasting menu, and it was delicious!  We enjoyed every course. My favourite was a sort of congee-like dish made with spinach and fried garlic, but it's hard to choose. So much variety and creativity on display with this menu. Calamansi juice features in many of the dishes, giving a tart and sour punch which was really unique. Everything was beautifully plated and the service was attentive.  Highly recommended!
