Wonderful idea and location. Terrible staff. 20 people waiting and the 2nd half of the sushi bar isn't open. I would rather have bad service and be eating than sitting at a table and have nothing. Please think about how you chose to run your restaurant. I would think you would want the sushi made to be sold than to be on the conveyer belt for 20 minutes. And now it's a waiting game. Ugh
