Booked our limo weeks in advance directly on the Omni website, received an email confirmation, but when we arrived at the airport there was no driver waiting for us. When we called their office we were told there was no record of our confirmation and that the driver would be \"5 or 10 minutes\" picking us up. No apologies or explanations. After 30 minutes of waiting outside, the driver finally arrived. He was fairly pleasant, but charged us $20 more than the price that was quoted on the confirmation. Won't be using Omni again in the future.
