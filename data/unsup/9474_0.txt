Super happy with Shimogamo. We were a party of 8 that came without a reservation at 5 pm. They sat us at their big table in the back right away and it was great. We felt like we had our own private room before the place filled up. \n\nService was good. Sushi was great. Not giving it 5 starts because it wasn't the best sushi I ever had, but for being so close to my house, I was extremely pleased.\n\nHappy to support a local Mom and Pop restaurant. Will definitely be back.
