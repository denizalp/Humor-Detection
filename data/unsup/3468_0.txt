A family of 5 went Friday evening.  Our waiter set the tone while he ran thru \nthe salad dressing rapidly.  When two of my guest had to ask twice of the choice's he was in a big hurry!  Told us he talks in his sleep about the options.  We were trying to catch it on the first try we felt rushed.  Our food was taste with a beautiful presentation.  When you celebrate birthday dinner once a year we wanted it a little less rushed.
