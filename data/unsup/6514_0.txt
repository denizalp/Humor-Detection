This is a decent pho place.  The soup base tastes great.  If you compare Pho Metro to others in Markham, it does give you the value.  I ordered a large and the portion would be similar to a medium from other places.  the fried spring rolls were pitiful, there was almost no filling and extremely small and thin - again the taste was there.  In this area there isn't a lot of Pho choices but a small drive away will yield better value.
