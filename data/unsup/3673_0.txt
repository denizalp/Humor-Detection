About as close as you'll get to a real Montreal style bagel. Actually, I'm not even sure there's a difference, other than the romance. Lines here never seem too long. Staff is fast and efficient. Great to buy a dozen poppy seed bagels, grab a bench, bunch down 2 or 3, and then go get your drug test.
