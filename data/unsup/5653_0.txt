Ordered the carne asada nachos, we were maybe only the 2nd customer in the place. It took forever to receive our food and when we did they forgot our beans inside the nachos (who does that?) and got the order wrong. I looked forward to these cause it's all I've ordered in the past, it was nothing like before. Very disappointed.
