I'm embarrassed by how much I love Taco Bell. I think I have a taste for crappy food. I can't explain any other way why I love chicken nuggets (breaded pieces of who knows what) and Taco Bell burritos (tortilla around some brown??). But when it's a late night and there's nothing open but your stomach is still grumbling, I just need something salty and satisfying. Yum! But make sure you don't eat too much, it might become a problem for you and your loved ones later on.
