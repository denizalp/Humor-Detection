Make sure to double check your receipt , I was over charge and when I told the cashier she was very rude and told me  I  needed to get and line if I wanted a refund , then I talk to the assistant manager Thomas and he was even more rude and told me he was busy that  if I didn't hear tell cashier when she told me to get in line , I always go to his store because is close to me house they are never very friendly , but this was the worst experience ever
