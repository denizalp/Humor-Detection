On multiple occasions, I have had my sammich in my hands before I'm even finished paying.  \n\nThis JJ is ultra fast... and  it may or may not have to do with it being overstaffed.  There's someone to yell a greeting to you as you walk in, someone to take your order, a few heads on the sammich line, a cashier, and I'm pretty sure we got a farewell holler too.\n\nHow about they donate someone to the bake-Tricia-some-of-that-awesome-wheat-bread-on-a-daily-basis cause?
