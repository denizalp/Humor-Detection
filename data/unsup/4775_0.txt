I must have gone and dined at the restaurant twice with the food being off. Tonight, I ordered takeout: Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken. This time it delivered on my expectations. Fresh, hot food, with tasty albeit Americanized flavors. Nothing's wrong with Americanized Chinese food, so long as it's tasty and fresh. Sweet, salty, tangy - a little cornstarchy, but not too much. Solid takeout Chinese food place and I will say much better than Panda Express. I recant my previous review.
