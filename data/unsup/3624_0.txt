My husband and I happened to drive by and decided to stop and have lunch. The food was fresh  and delicious! I ordered the chicken shawarma while my husband went with a lamb gyro. For both dishes the meat was tender and flavorful. The fries were also great (not greasy like many other places).   Without a doubt, Shawarma House has become our spot for tasty Mediterranean food!
