Been driving by this place since it opened 5 years ago.   Finally went in today.   Recommendation, don't arrive right at the opening.   Half of Tempe was in line to get in.  \n\nWell worth the wait.   Crepe and Latte were outstandingly delicious.    Nice people everywhere to take care of you.   \n\nLet's just say, I picked a bad day to start my diet!!\n\nVery unassuming from the outside.   Don't pass this place by.
