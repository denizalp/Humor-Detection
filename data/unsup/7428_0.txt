REVIEW FOR SHAVED ICE ONLY!\n\nIf you're looking for shaved ice on the strip, this is the place. It's a hidden gem in the Hawaiian Marketplace, inside Kapit Bahay. Prices are extremely reasonable, a small is $3 and a regular is $4. \n\nWith your order you can add 3 toppings! \n\nThe quality of the ice and the flavors are spot on, and the owner doesn't gip you with the quantity of ice, it's definitely more than enough
