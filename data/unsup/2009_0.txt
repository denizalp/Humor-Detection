I have had my corporate company party here for the last two holidays. First year was about 22 accommodations and this year we had 40 accommodations with Buffett. It was very reasonable in pricing for each person. We had our own 9  bays and tons of food for everyone. We always have raffles and prizes to give away and top golf employees always met my needs. I recommend taking your friends for a night out or throw a party and have the top golf team do all the work.
