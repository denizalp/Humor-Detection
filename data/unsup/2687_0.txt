We paid $28 for dinner during Thanksgiving Weekend. I think that was a little overpriced for what we got. Definitely don't make a trip to TI just for the Buffet, we ate there b\/c we were staying there. The crab legs were tiny, everything else so-so. I agree with the rest of the reviewers, there are MUCH better places to eat. The dessert area is awesome though!!
