Great place to go to for cheap food. All food on the menu costs 6 dollars, and is portioned very well for it's price. Atmosphere and workers are very nice. \nThe only reason why I rated it three stars is because people often smoke near the open window and its smells awful if you get a window seat. Waiters only serve a certain area so we weren't able  to switch tables.
