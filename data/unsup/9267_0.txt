Pretty Good\n\nWe were looking for a spot for a light lunch and Green Mix fit the bill. My sister and I both enjoyed our salads. The ingredients are fresh, plentiful, and the selection is large enough for everyone to find something they would enjoy. Green Mix also serves panini and rice bowls.  I will have to give those a try on my next visit.\n\nThe staff are  friendly and engaging. The restaurant is clean and inviting. If you ever find yourself in the mood for a deliciously light lunch you have to try this place you won't be disappointed.
