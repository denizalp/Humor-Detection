At the age of 27 I realized it might be the time I decided to attend my FIRST Vegas pool party. Since it was Labor Day weekend and it was scorching outside I opt for a night swim to avoid the heat.\nGorgeous venue but the crowd was a little young for me. It felt like a college party lol. But I know it's my old age telling me this. All in all it was a great time!
