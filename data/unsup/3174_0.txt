This is a late review. Never really tried the food, it was raining about a year ago. The people had the place so secured to keep in the heat. We were seated in the side room. I started to feel the effects of carbon dioxide poisoning. I alerted the staff and they did nothing, had to stand outside for 20 minutes to feel better. But only 5 minutes for the symptoms to come back. \n\nPaid the according guy $10 for the table. He pushed the accordion together once and spoke the first two lines that's amore.
