Cane's Sauce, chicken strips, texas toast, fries, and sweet tea..That's basically all you really need right there! Every thing is so delicious and satisfying that it'll make you want to crave for more!! I usually like to get the Caniac box so that i have left over's for later and it's just like having two 3 finger combo's in one.\n\nI really can't express how good their food is all through words so I suggest you take my word for it and try it! It will definitely not disappoint! \n\nGosh, I wish I had some right now... LOL
