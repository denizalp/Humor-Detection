This is a sweet new location. They moved from the 19th Ave & Indian School to camelback. The really cool thing is it's right next to the light rail.\n\nThe store is an old CVS store, so it's super bright inside with all the cool signs and a massive vinyl section.   I dont think ive ever seen a larger vinyl area in a local store (unless you're vinyl only)\n\nCool people and super awesome staff. Highly recommend!
