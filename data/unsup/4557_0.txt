Yummy yummy. Only $28 ($24 with military discount!) for all this! Feeds 2 & we're full! Staff is ok. Very slow to respond with getting the bill and taking it.  Yellow tail was delicious and the tuna tasted fresh! The other fish did too but my husband favored it more.  Came from surprise (now live in litchfield park)where we have uni sushi and this place knocks it out of the park in price and quality wise!
