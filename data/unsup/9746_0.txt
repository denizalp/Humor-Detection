All Outback Steakhouses are the same.  That's what they're designed to be.  But this one defies that -- all the waiters seem to smell like Nair.\n\nYes, Nair, the signature-smelling anti-hair product.\n\nI am not entirely sure why our male waiter smelled like this, but it's the only product that remotely smells like Nair does.  And it was confusing and lead only to wild speculation.  Mostly it lead to not being hungry.  \n\nYou're an outlier one, Outback Steakhouse #12324.  Stop smelling like Nair.
