Just found my new favorite Japanese restaurant thanks to you Yelpers.  We had a pork chashu bowl, assorted sashimi bowl, yellowtail jalape√±o carpaccio; wagyu beef skewers, grilled clams and scallops; hamachi and big fin tuna sashimi; seared garlic tuna tataki; whole grilled squid; otsumami appetizer (raw, seasoned baby octopus, cooked spinach, and enoki mushrooms); chicken steak; miso soup (with tofu, chicken, corn). \n\nThe bill was cheap and everything was fantastic. They have a great selection of sake. Definitely get the chashu pork bowl and the chicken steak. It's worth it.
