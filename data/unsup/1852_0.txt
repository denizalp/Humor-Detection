We tried this place a few weeks ago and it was good. The portions are absolutely massive! And the chips and salsa are amazing. I got the chicken posole soup, and it was okay. My disappointment was in the guacamole bar! We came because we heard they may guac at the table, but they weren't doing it the night we came. It looks like they might only offer it on weekends? Not sure, but definitely want to go back to try. Come hungry and you'll enjoy this place!
