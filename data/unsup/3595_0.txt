Average experience. Food is okay. I had the vegetarian \"burger\" and it was fine- nothing to write home about but not horrible.  The service could be improved but again, not too bad but nothing stellar. \n\nThe one outstanding part was the strawberry cookies and cream milkshake - strawberry base with golden Oreos mixed in- I would visit again just for this.
