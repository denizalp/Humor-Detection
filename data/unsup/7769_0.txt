I was a guest at a business lunch at Notable today. I did not know the price of the meal but I have no doubt, it was pricey. Over all, the food was delicious. My potatoes were slightly under cooked and could have used some more butter or sauce to moisten them. I had two salads and they were both spot-on - delicious! We were not offered coffee or tea or given a chance to request it for dessert. So the ambience, service and the over all experience was good and I would consider going again.
