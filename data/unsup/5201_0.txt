I got the Yodeling Devil dessert. It was a Devil's food cake swirled in with a chocolate and vanilla soft serve ice cream. This concoction was really good. I couldn't believe it was vegan. The only thing that could be improved upon was customer service. The guy who rang us up was like a college stoner guy (nothing wrong with that! Just do it on your own time. Not at work).
