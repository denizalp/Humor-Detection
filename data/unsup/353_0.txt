Pros:\n\nThe duck was good.\n\nThe service was better than most Chinese restaurants.\n\nThe decor and atmosphere. \n\nCons:\n\nEvery other dish we ordered.\n\nNot enough sauce and condiments and charges extra $ for sauce and other condiments.\n\nExpensive.\n\nIn Beijing, QJD is usually reserved for tourists. It's good to try but certainly not a place I would go on a regular basis.
