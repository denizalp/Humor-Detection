Ordered take-out from Zeerah last weekend and was happy with the food. It was spicier than expected but I'm okay with that. I had the butter chicken with rice and palak paneer, and a piece of garlic naan. The paneer was okay, but was not like classic Indian style palak paneer. Butter chicken and naan were great. I would go back if I'm ever craving Indian food in a hurry!
