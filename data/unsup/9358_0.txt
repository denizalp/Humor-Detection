This is my second time here. This is a Korean run sushi store. Today I orders red dragon roll with half 2 butterfish\nI paid $9 for it tax included and if u didn't know I ordered it at a \"Giotto\" Chinese food court, u will have no clue because it taste better than supermarket sushi dish that would had been a few dollar more. \n\nRice: good. Not too much and the right consistency\nFish: fresh\n Service: good. I waited around 5 min \nOverall: 9\/10 for such cheap yummy sushi!
