Now a friend of mine had said when you go to vegas - donty miss the fountain show! so whilst walking through the Bellagio and seeing a little fountain show with a talking wizard, I thought mmmm, not for me but each to their own..\n\n\n .....and then that night, I saw that she actually meant the fountain show at night! WOW! Amazing. They play music (about the troops etc) and the fountains dance. On the last note they rocket sky high!!\n\n\n Apparently they are on every 15 or so minutes from 3pm onwards\n\n\n Not to be missed!!
