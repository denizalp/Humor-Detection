Cramerton Village has had positive experience.  Their property manager is quite responsive to our needs.  After reading some of these reviews, what some of you may not know is that Wm. Douglas acts on behalf of your elected HOA.  You most certainly have control.  They don't \"own\" properties.    \nI have no affiliation with this company or their employees except to be pleased that their rep works diligently with our Board to keep our fees as low as possible.  No raise in fees since current manager appointed.
