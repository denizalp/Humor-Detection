Neil our server was really attentive and friendly. I'm only giving 3 stars because the food was just ok. I felt like every dished lacked something. It was alright. Nothing special. Met up with a friend. we got two cocktails, the fries, meatballs, and apple salad off happy hour. I ordered the tuna tartare off happy hour. It was good, but like I said nothing special.
