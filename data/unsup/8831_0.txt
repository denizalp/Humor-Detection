I was in Vegas, I love a good burger and had read all the hype on this place.\nThe backstory sounded like a lot of fun...the nurses, hospital gowns, etc.\n\nThe reality is, it's a dive with overpriced sub-par burgers and fries. In a town where there are hundreds (maybe thousands) of choices, this was the bad one.
