Honestly, this place the some of the best crab puffs. This is my go to Thai place. Close to work and have great lunch specials along with refreshing Thai Tea. \n\nI usually get the Yellow Curry or Pad Thai and because I am a weenie I opt for 0 spice. Both these options are more on the 'sweet side' when it has 0 spice. \n\nBut seriously, if you are a lover of crab puffs - I highly recommend Thai Elephant's crab puffs!!
