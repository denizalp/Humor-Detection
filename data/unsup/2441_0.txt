After my last review,  Chef Michael begged me to get the last star stating their location is hidden to keep the long lines to a minimum.   Too funny!  OK, Mike . . . you got your 5th star.  I reward local businesses who are passionate and involved in day 2 day operations.  Clearly, this is the case here.  5 stars!!
