Hate this place. I am pissed off every time i leave the building. Their trains are always needing repair and are never running so you can imagine how disappointed my 4 year old was on his to his first dental appointment was when he didn't get to see then trains. One time I went in a man behind the desk was very rude to me. They market themselves as kid friendly but they don't offer sedation nor do they even have a diaper changing station in the building.
