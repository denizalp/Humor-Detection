My expectations aren't too high for a juice kiosk at the airport, but I liked the smoothie here better than the one I got at Rachel's Kitchen (further down the terminal, with a higher overall rating).\n\nAs others have said, the unfortunate older Asian woman who runs this joint has absolutely no service skills. That said, the smoothies are made to order, a good price for the size, and have various add-ins available at a reasonable cost: superfood and kale each $1. Menu has quite a bit of variety, too.
