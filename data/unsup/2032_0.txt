best dim sum spot in vegas!  the wait can be long during weekends lunch or dinner and you have to walk through the cloud of smoke to get to the restaurant.  but their food is excellent.  my fav. is their bbq pork bun (served only after 5pm) and they ALWAYS sell out of it fast!  i call in the order a day ahead to ensure i get my fix for those buns =)
