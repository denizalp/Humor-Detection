Love the creative and fun approach to the menu. The concept of the restaurant involves blending the flavors of American, Filipino, Peruvian and Korean cuisine. The outcome is mostly surprising and gastronomically satisfying. The cinnamon crispy flat bread with a serving of blended Nutella and banana was a creative substitute to the traditional bread. The tacos come with a serving of rice and white beans which was tasty. I would visit this restaurant to try their food!
