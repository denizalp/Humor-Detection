I'm a regular customer at this Dunkin Donuts and they were having technology problems today but that doesn't excuse not getting the coffee the way that I ordered... smashed donuts.. no napkins and 15 minutes in the drive thru. Aaarrrggghhh.. Seriously annoyed that you made me late for an appointment... I wasted five bucks on stuff I can't eat or drink and I don't have time to stop for coffee now.  Won't be back:-(
