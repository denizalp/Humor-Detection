THESE GUYS ARE CROOKS!!!!   The service department deliberately caused a leak in the gas tank just so I'd have to come back and have it repaired again, which I confirmed with another mechanic who normally services my car.  When the mechanic and I pointed out that it was their mistake and that the repair was under warranty, they got rude and nasty.  Probably going to report them to a consumer protection agency.  Take your beloved VW somewhere else.
