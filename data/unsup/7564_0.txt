Unbelievable - I have been a loyal customer here for several years and finally get caught in the rip off web. Got an outrageous quote for a brake job and when I told them to forget it they wanted to negotiate. I was told that corporate requires them to quote  an inflated price first and then negotiate- what a way to treat a steady loyal customer. After all these years I didn't believe the other negative reviews - sad but true
