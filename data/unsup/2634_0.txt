Nice little store similar to Time Bomb in Shadyside. \n\nLot's of New Balance, Nike, Huf, Clae, Undefeated, Stussy, Kid Robot etc. Lots of clothing that you can't get anywhere else. Nice little chill spot. \n\nThe clothing really isn't my style bit I really like the shoes they carry. Good spot for Sneaker Heads.\n\nCheck out their website: http:\/\/shopfouronetwo.blogspot.com\/
