We came here for my cousin's bachelor party.\n\nIt was everything you'd expect to from a Vegas Nightclub on strip. Loud and fun music, girls in skimpy outfits.  GoGo girlies, Mini stages for drunk and trashy girls to go dance on.\n\nNot really sure what else to say... We had fun... We spent a lot of money, at 4am, I drunkenly decided that I wanted brunch from a place that wasn't open and got thrown out by hotel security... But we had fun...
