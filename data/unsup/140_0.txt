This place is entirely too la-de-dah for me.  Of course the steak is good! At upwards of $45 a pop, it had BETTER be!  Then throw in the fact that you have to shell out $9 for a chunk of iceberg lettuce, or anything else you might want on your plate besides meat--not to mention beverages--and the bill really packs wallop.  At prices like this, the meal should blow my hair back and give me a back rub.  Not a fan.
