Nice, clean store with ample parking.  Very helpful cashiers that are extremely pleasant.  Great selection of meat.  But what makes this place worth the trip is the deli.  Best fried chicken you will ever have.  They literally sell out some days.  I asked the manager there how much they sell in a week and he said they go through about 1800 pounds of chicken A WEEK!\nNo wonder.  Crisp, juicy, and not greasy.  They usually have sides like mac and cheese and scalloped potatoes there too.  There is a bank and atm there too, as well as a small bakery.
