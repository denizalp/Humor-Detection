The mini-golf is my favorite, and does not get any better than Vitense. I've never been to a more fun mini course. I would, however, avoid the indoor mini courses on weekends, especially in the winter, due to the huge amounts of screaming children. I also use the driving range and can find a corner where no one is going to see me and my very novice swing. Although one of the pros did think I was pathetic enough to stop and give me some free pointers for about 10 minutes. Very nice of him.
