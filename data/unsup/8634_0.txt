-Organized inside. Smaller than other Goodwill stores.\n\n-Filthy, dirty parking lot...small too. Rugged with pot holes. YIKES!\n\n-Good prices. Friendly employees.\n\n-It's hit or miss on what treasure you might find at this location.\n\n-Park on the north or south side of the building - the entrance faces west. Handicap parking is on the north.\n\n-I have been in this Goodwill many times and have NEVER found anything.
