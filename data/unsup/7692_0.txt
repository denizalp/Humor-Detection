Probably the best pizza in town.\n\nMe and 4 of my employees order their $5 personal pizzas from here almost every Wednesday for our Pizza Wednesday.\n\nThe $5 for the personal pizza is a steal. It's 8 small slices that are just enough. The pizza is REALLY good.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place.
