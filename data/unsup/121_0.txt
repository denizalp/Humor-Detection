I went with 3 of my 5 bridesmaids in order to find bridesmaid dresses. I had no idea I had to make an appointment, because many of the other stores I had spoken to said they didn't require an appointment. Luckily, they were extremely accommodating and fit us in between a couple of other sessions. \nWe wound up finding a dress that flattered all of the girls, and the prices were very reasonable. \nThey have a tailor on-site which is very convenient. I look forward to working with them moving forward for these dresses for my wedding.
