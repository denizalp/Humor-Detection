Banana Republic is great!\nbut the outlet store isn't!\nIt's always a big mess here, and can't really find much  as everything is all over the place.\nthey seem to always be short-staffed with only two ppl on the floor trying to clean up and two on cash...on a busy day!\nalso, prices are not that cheap for an outlet store, maybe 10%-15% off the original price, so with that in mind, you might as well shop at a regular Banana Republic, pay the little $$ extra but get a much better selection and experience at the end!
