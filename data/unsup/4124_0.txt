I really like this place.  It is large, clean, easy to navigate, and has a wide variety of styles.  If you are a fan of glass art they have an eneormous display that apparently all came from one woman's house.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is due to a couple areas that have some really cheesy \"shabby chic\" furniture and random sayings on metal farmhouse kind of junk.  Definitely takes up valuable consignment furniture space.   Prices were very reasonable.  I plan on making this a regular stop on my furniture rounds.
