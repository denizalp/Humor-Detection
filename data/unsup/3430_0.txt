Maybe it's a little pricey.. but it's definitely worth it! THE room was spacious and cozy. I love how well lit and classy looking the rooms are! With six girls to the suite, it was definitely affordable and we actually had enough mirrors! The room service was very yummy too!! Would definitely be back!
