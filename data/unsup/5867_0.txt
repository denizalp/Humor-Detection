I was so pleasantly surprised that Paul himself checked my car out and was honest and informative in diagnosing what was wrong - I dont know anything about cars! I needed a brake light fixed too and he did in right then and there (2 min). No pressure tactics or adding random charges. Seems like a great place, gets work done fast, and takes the time to explain things.
