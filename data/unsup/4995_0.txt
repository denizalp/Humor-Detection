This was years ago. They already had one restaurant on Decarie and had opened a second one in LaSalle and were planning on a third in Verdun before expansion was halted and they closed their second place.\n\nTasty sushi at prices most other restaurants can't beat. Try their All You Can Eat option, a platter called the Titanic, because with 40 pieces of sushi you can sample their entire menu and eat to your heart's and stomach's content. Carry away container available upon request.\n\nJust be prepared to wait a bit if it's a busy night.
