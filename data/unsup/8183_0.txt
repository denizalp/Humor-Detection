If I could give zero stars then I would!!! Dealing with these clowns is an absolute nightmare!! The people in the office are so rude and unprofessional, only had one good experience customer service wise and that's with an office guy named Dan. \nFor the amount of money they charge, the customer service should DEFINITELY be more on point...instead just frustration and a huge bill at the end...going to be using five star limos from now on!\nDon't use these people!!!
