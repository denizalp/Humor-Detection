Nick at Genius Bar needs a raise, a free up grade, or an anything extra....I was convinced I was gonna leave pissy and just go to t mobile, Verizon or sprint and have them buy out my AT&T contract and get a non apple phone. This guy was my hero and even set up my music and iPad while I waited on my iPhone repair.....Killer service!!!!  I'm honestly blown away!!!!! Bobby was a super cool and patient guy too!!!
