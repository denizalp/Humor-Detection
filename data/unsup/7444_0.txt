I love the Carne Asada burrito and tacos. Taco Tuesday they have a special on Pastor tacos. Quaint little place with indoor and patio seating. Beer, margaritas and true Mexican coke an sprite (made with cane sugar). They also have a happy hour specials every day from 2 to 6. \n\nI first visited the original taco shop on 7th street, and this one (their second) is just as good. \n\nFast friendly service
