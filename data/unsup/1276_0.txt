The lobby is a crowded mess before shows, the bathrooms are piss (get it!?) poor, and entering a show can be pretty annoying. All that said, I love watching shows here. The audio is good, the place has panache, and you can feel the history sitting there. They generally seem to attract good acts. Free and easy parking is a cherry on top.
