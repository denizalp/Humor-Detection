This Neimans is a mess when it comes to customer service. Get off your high horse people! \n\nDon't act you are going to throw up on me Mr. I-Don't-Know-My-Kiehls-Or-Laura-Mercier-Very-Well-But-I-Am-Really-Good-At-Peering-Down-My-Nose-At-You-Cosmetic-Counter-Guy when my boyfriend hands you his Mastercard because he doesn't ever go there and doesn't know any better!!! \n\nThe salespeople here were so snotty! Designer labels do not require this much attitude. \n\nI took my money to Nordstrom - other end of the Square if you need directions...
