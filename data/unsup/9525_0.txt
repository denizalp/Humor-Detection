The Shoo Mercy pancakes are ridiculously good. I consider myself a food snob and the pancakes at Tupelo were on point for flavor, fluffy, and moist. Tupelo is a delicious spot for any occasion with indoor\/outdoor space and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cute spot for brunch\/lunch\/dinner. It truly is a Charlotte gem.
