Very cool spot off the strip for a great brunch, lunch or dinner. The cold tapas plates were my favorite, especially the chorizo meats and the shrimp ceviche. Great selection of beers on tap and a full bar. Added bonus was the band, complete with kettle drum, playing on the patio on Sunday afternoon. Definitely a must-visit!
