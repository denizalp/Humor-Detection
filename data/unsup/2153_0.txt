Food is amazing. My wife and I were craving some Thai food one night and found this place. She ordered the yellow curry and I ordered the pineapple fried rice. Decent portions and amazing taste. We like trying different places but this one will definitely be a Thai food restaurant we will go back to! Thanks Lucki Thai!
