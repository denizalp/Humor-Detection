This place is across from the college, and I'm sure gets a lot of student business, but I've never seen more than three people in it.\n Those three people are usually homeless. The last time I went in for a quick 2 Tacos for $1 I was asked for\nMoney five times in twenty min. That's about typical here.\n They are almost always out of cherries gor the shakes, or they just don't want to add them, who knows.\n When I left I felt vaguely sticky, and drove  with the windows down for a while. Seemed to help.
