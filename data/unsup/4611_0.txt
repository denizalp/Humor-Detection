I really enjoyed my ice cream from Ed's Real Soup! The staff was very friendly and offered samples of the ice cream. You can select two flavours for any sized cone\/cup which is great. I had the waffle cone- so tasty! I still prefer bang bang as the best ice cream in Toronto but Ed's Real Soup was very good!
