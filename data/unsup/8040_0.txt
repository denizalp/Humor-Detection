This used to be my favorite bar.  Had scheduled to have my bachelorette party there.  Even send out Evites to all my friends.  All I did was smile and show my \"bride to be\" sash to the doorman.  He rudely deemed my unfit to enter, even though 3 other where more than happy to help me and my party celebrate my special night.
