Excellent steamed hotdogs all dressed and poutine.\n\nThe owner of this joint knows his customer service and was outstanding. Welcoming and friendly. I will absolutely be back to try something else on their menu. The breakfast offerings looked delicious which I noticed a write up from a local newspaper described the breakfast as the best in the City.\n\nHighly recommended.
