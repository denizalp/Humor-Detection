This is the worst Hotel I have ever used. I paid a lot of money for a 4 day stay and i got a Motel 6 service and Room that is horrible. No Free WiFi, we are in 2013 and no WiFi. Phone reception is bad. Towels feel like Sand paper, Soap is cheap, carpet is at least 10-12 years old, over all this is bad place.\n\nDon't stay even if it was free.
