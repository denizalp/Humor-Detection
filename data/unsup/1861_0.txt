Place is great.  If ya go at off times there is never a line.  Roll up on a Friday because ya want to look baller at the wine bar valet, your ass gonna wait.  Today dude spent 5 minutes alone with the power washer getting the crap off the Shaggin Wagon before he even sent me into the wash itself.  Very nice guy.  Make sure you tip his ass...
