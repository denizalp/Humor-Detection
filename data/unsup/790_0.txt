We met these guys last weekend at the Downtown Phoenix market and they were delightful to talk to.  The cookies are super cute and we found out so yummy.  Everyone in our gang of friends bought one.  I give rave reviews for the overachiever!  Baked locally and even use Wei chocolate which is local and organic.  So head down to Central and Filmore area Saturday and check these guys out!
