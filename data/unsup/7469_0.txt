The pastries here are excellent, and the food is pretty good, too. (Though it's not quite the same level of amazingness.)\n\nMy favorite is the pain au chocolate, while the Mr. enjoys the unique pepperoni roll (Picture a cinnamon roll, but replace the cinnamon with pepperoni).\n\nSalads and breakfast items are good, too. I usually go for the Eggs Florentine. (shh, here's a secret: I ask for it on one of their house-made croissants instead of the English Muffin)
