Mrs. Peregrine's home for Peculiar Children, two hours and seven minutes.  Fun, interesting movie and I didn't fall asleep.  I always feel that movies that are over an hour and a half can be edited and I fall asleep.  I thought this was great with the characters, roles of peculiarities, also I love 'Penny Dreadful' and she's Mrs. Peregrine!  Even though, I figured pieces out early, I still liked it.  No spoiler alert, it's mysterious.  I wish one of the kids got to use his peculiarity more than once, but that my only complaint.
