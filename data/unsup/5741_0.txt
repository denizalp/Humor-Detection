Not good!!! I mean really NOT good!!!\nMy husband asked the woman behind the counter... are the burger patties fresh ground beef or frozen? She said \"fresh, of course\"...... got the burger and it was absolutely not fresh.... I know a frozen patty when I see one and my husband said it is the worst burger he ever had. The french fries were sooooo bad!\nI had a 10\" cheese pizza... it was okay...... not good enough to go back! \nThe iced tea was horrible, tasted like tap water.\nWill not be returning here!
