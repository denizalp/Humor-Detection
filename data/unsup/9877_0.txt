As someone who embraces their Italian background, I come to places like Mazzulo's (as well as Alesci's, Sirna's, and Gallucci's) to get local authentic Italian products.  However, I was quite disappointed after my last visit to purchase some marscapone and lady fingers (preferably Savoiardi) for a Tiramisu recipe only to discover they had neither. . .\n\nI walked out and simply headed over to Heinen's who had a selection of both. \n\nAlthough Mazzulo's is fantastic for most other Italian specialty products, I guess you can't win 'em all.
