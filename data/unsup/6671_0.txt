Called today looking for a corned beef brisket. The man who answered the phone clarified that it was NOT lunchmeat I was looking for, but a brisket to cook. He said they have several and to come on down. I did. Waited 45 min in line. When I asked for a corned beef brisket the guy behind the counter looked at me like I was crazy. I explained that I called... And he told me... Yeah... Not. These geniuses couldn't find their pork butt with both hands. Won't be wasting my time going back.
