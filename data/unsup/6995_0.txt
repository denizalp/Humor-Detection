Was told by by employee that they had high chairs and opened at 5:00 pm at about 4:45. So my wife, 14 month old daughter and myself stood in the sun for almost 20 minutes to be told by a guy in a suit that reservations were needed and there were no high chairs available with a smirk on his face. Extremely unprofessional. I won't be back.
