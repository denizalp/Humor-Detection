My recent experience here was great. Many of the recent reviews mention unreasonable wait times but I did not have an issue with that, so perhaps things have improved. Made an appointment online, was seen within ten minutes of the time, and was out within half an hour. Staff who helped me were professional yet warm. Location is clean and safe, large parking lot and comfortable waiting room with tons of magazines.
