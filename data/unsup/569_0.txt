UPDATE: It's been a month now, the estimate we are getting from West Elm is that the little baggie of bolts and wrenches needed to assemble the sectional will not ship until June 23rd. From overseas. So we're looking at July at the earliest to get the couch assembled when it was delivered the first week of April. \n\nUnacceptable. Just plain unacceptable.
