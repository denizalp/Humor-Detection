Our usual gas station was being upgraded so we decided to stop at this QT. The first thing we noticed was that it was a Safe Place. This means that if you are a teenager and need a place for safe harbor, this QT is a place where they will provide safety and shelter until help comes. \n\nMy daughter and I enjoyed our breakfast pizza with bacon, eggs and cheese ($3). I enjoyed my white tea with peach all through the day for ($1.09). It was a great way to start the day.
