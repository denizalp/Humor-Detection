Worse RV park ever. They said they had lots of spots available and we could just come in and take a spot when we got there were hardly any spots.  The woman inside said they only took RVs 92 or newer (we had a 2002) we said that's fine. When we got inside the park it didn't look like any of the RVs were newer then 92. They also charged $3 for our pet but did not provide any kind of a pet area not even a sand area. Horrible RV park. So not stop here!
