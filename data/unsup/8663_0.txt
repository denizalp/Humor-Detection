Took my daughter there for emergency treatment - needed a simple filling... I walked out paying over $500!  Really!  She gave my daughter medically UNNESSARY treatment such as a flouride treatment, prophy, and multiple bitwings.  I questioned her about it and she gave me a bunch of BULL!  Coming from the dental insurance industry, patients needs to avoid dentist like her.
