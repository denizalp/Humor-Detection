Halal meat is served here. Went here for dinner with party of 9. the service was a little slow (waited awhile to get our mango juices) but the food was very good. Had the t-bone steak plate with rice. Also tried some of the beef stew which was very good. The spaghetti was good as well. The chicken steak i tried had a bit of a fishy taste to it, but other people in my party did not have that issue. Overall it was a nice experience. Will have to come again next time I am in Toronto.
