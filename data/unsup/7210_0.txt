On the drive back to Vegas from Scottsdale, this is the gas station where I fill up the car.  It's on the way to Carefree Highway and has nice wide lanes and an easy in\/out to Scottsdale Rd.  The convenience store also has a nice selection of snacks to load up on before the long trip.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
