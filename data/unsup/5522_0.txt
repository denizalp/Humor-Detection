This is probably my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in the valley. The food is always fresh and they use the right amount of spices. If anyone know about Mediterranean food in Arizona, a lot of place over cook their meat and it tends to be dried out. But not here at pita house! It came out fresh and juicy everytime! MUST TRY!
