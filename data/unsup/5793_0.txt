A MUST DO! AN AUTHENTIC NEW YORK SLICE OF PIZZA  IN VEGAS!  It is located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. There is no sign. Just look for the line or you can ask someone who works there. They'll direct you. My favorite pizza here is a slice of white. Delicious. There's a few counter stools in the place or eat out in the lobby where there are couches and tables.
