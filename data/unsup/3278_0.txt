The one star is for the paintings on the wall, the other is for the poor women that work here. This place sucks. The \"cheese\" on the burger is processed American cheese. The burger is a small step up from McDonalds. Want some water, nothing is free here, you have to buy a bottle. 3 Wifi networks, can I use one of them? Nope. Keep walking tourists, nothing to see here.
