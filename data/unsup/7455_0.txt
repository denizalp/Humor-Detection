SCAMMERS!!! I wish I would've listened to the reviews on here. STILL WAITING FOR MY REFUND!!! \nWe prepaid for them to do work and they would schedule appointments then never show up. We took days off work to get this handled and the owners response was \"there time is important too.\" We called another company out and it was fixed same day for less than $200 when they wanted to replace everything for $1200. Such LIARS!! \nI hope they get shut down.
