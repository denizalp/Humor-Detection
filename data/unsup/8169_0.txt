I went here specifically for the poke, but unfortunately, the fish was bland. Not like the so fresh you don't need any seasoning bland, but more like it's okay quality, which is why there's not much flavor. I added more soy sauce and spicy mayo than I would've liked to give it more punch. People are nice here, so I guess if you're ever super craving poke, this spot is okay.
