Wow.  They love to over bill you and hold onto your money.  Don't count on them to step up and admit they owe you money, watch your insurance companies EOB's.  Practices seem shady.  Loved being talked down to by the billing staff member, I guess they just wanted me to pay without asking.\n\nI came in for part two for my kid and the info changed and suddenly more work needed to be done, surprise!\nGlad I went through this before I committed to the ortho my youngest needs.
