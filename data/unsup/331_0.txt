Honestly, i hate to give Nick's a one star review.  I like the interior, and I like everything that it stands for.  It's one of the last unpretentious places left on State St. to get something to eat.\n\nThat being said, the food is overpriced and terrible.  $11 for a greek salad that looked like it came from a high school cafeteria?  Sorry, no thanks.  I'll go O.D. on ironic velvet paintings somewhere else.
