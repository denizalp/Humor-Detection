Nothing inspires foodie passion quite like pizza, one of the world's most popular yet varied dishes.It tastes like no other pizza I've ever had but it was delicious and perfectly combined.pizzeria Bianca is the first restaurant I have been with my husband since I moved from India. So this restaurant holds special place in my heart. Great wine ,great pizza and great location.
