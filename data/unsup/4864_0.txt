La pantry is my downfall....you see I was on the virtuous path of sans gluten sans dairy until someone introduced me to the croissant and pain au chocolat from la pantry. Now all I can think about when I wake up on a Saturday morning is: that delicious buttery but light and so ever satisfying mouth watering pain au chocolat...it's the little pleasure in life that makes it all worth it so...head to la pantry and indulge! \nThat's all you need to know!
