Stopped by during a Canada trip because we saw they had poutine. The decor inside was had a hipster vibe and they had some games for people to play while they waited for food (Cards Against Humanity, Connect Four, Jenga, Battleship...) The food was nothing special. They had smaller portions than expected. (Maybe compared to American standards? lol) One of the waitresses was rude and tried to rush our order as soon as we sat down because she was about to take a 11-person table.
