I thought we had freedom of speech in america. When I wrote the last review, I didn't say anything that wasn't true. At that time. So why would I be threatened with physical violence from the bartender? Reviews are meant just that a review thats all I did and now you want to threaten me for freedom of speech it just makes your bar look bad sorry you have to go through that Javier
