This place was very nice, we had several drinks before going to other places this evening...\nIt is small and cozy, they have a decent bar!!\nThe bar tender could be friendlier... Was trying to ask for the drink I wanted and even though my group was the only one in the place and no one was waiting, he gave me a face when I started asking for different bottles, if this would not have happened, I would have given the perfect score...\nAnyways, you can stop by for a drink...\nEnjoy
