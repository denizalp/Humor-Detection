Really loved the animals but have to give 1 star because of the extremely rude employees...if it was just one or two I could overlook but it was all ...very very sad...from the rude train driver that made a joke about my mentally lacking brother to the kid that was running the overhead tram...to the two employees in two different cafes to the rude girls in the touching exhibits...I love Dr. Gray and all he's done but unfortunately his employees don't share his passion.
