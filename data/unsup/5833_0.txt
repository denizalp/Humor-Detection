What a charming restaurant! After receiving horrible customer service from Pita Jungle next door, our group decided to try Il Capo and we were not disappointed! \n\nTheir staff was so accommodating and the food was delicious. Prices are reasonable and our orders were accurate and prompt.  We are already making plans to return
