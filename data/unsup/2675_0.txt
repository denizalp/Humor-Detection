My wife and I dined here for her 40th birthday. The entire staff provided excellent customer service and attention to detail. We had the 5 course meal and the food was absolutely amazing. I've eaten lots of sushi and I've dined in gourmet restaurants in Paris and Vienna but Shinbay may have topped all of them on quality, presentation, service, etc. if you haven't tried shinbay yet, you're missing out!
