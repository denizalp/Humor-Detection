Went here on a Thursday around dinner time. Was not impressed. It was $40 a head and the food was mediocre.\n\nThe food looked and tasted like it had been out for hours. Meats were dried up, noodles in soups were expanded and soaked up the broth, vegetables were wilted. \n\nService was good but I much rather have went to Bachannal!
