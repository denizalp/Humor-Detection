I currently rent through metropolitan and have been a tenant for six months. I love the home they found for me! They took into account everything I needed in a house...location, budget, a yard, etc... I have run into the occasional issue that is to be expected whenever you rent (plumbing, routine repairs) and I can tell you that the office is always helpful, polite and quick to send maintenance to fix whatever I need. My lease is up soon and I will definitely continue my relationship with this company. 5 stars all the way!
