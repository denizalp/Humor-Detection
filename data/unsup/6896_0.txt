Terrific company and customer service! I brought in my Toyota Corrolla to have the windows tinted and they were very quick and efficient with the job. I also ended up bringing my car back so they could redo the back window since the tint was too dark for me. They fixed it in a timely matter and refused to charge me for it (even though I kept insisting to pay them). Thank you Stuart for all you did!
