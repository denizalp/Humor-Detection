Tracks In Wax has been a landmark here in Phoenix, and it was just today that I found out of Dennis' passing.\n\nI spent many a day hanging out in this store when I was went to high school down the road. Admittedly, most of the time I chose hanging out at Tracks instead of making my mid morning English class.\n\nI learned a majority of my early music knowledge thanks to those many days at Tracks.\n\nStopped in today, filled with nostalgia and didn't leave empty handed.\n\nRIP Dennis.
