Friendly!  I've been to this location several times and everytime I've gotten speedy service with a smile. Donuts are cake-like yummy and full of flavor.\n\nLocated adjacent to Subway, you can coffee and donut and take some to-go like I did.  They have these cute mini donuts they I take to my kids class as a treat.\n\nToday they had 12 mini donuts for $2.99.\n\nYum!
