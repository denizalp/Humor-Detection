This place is HORRIBLE - bad food, bad service, they have no control over wait times.  I've been here twice - the first time I waited for two hours and the second time waited for 1 1\/2.  I got sick off the food (mushroom pizza) the first time.  The parking is horrible as well- this is a poorly planned concept and they opened way too early without much testing.  They should have done a soft launch to figure out all their issues.  Would NOT recommend at all - go to Spoonwood instead.
