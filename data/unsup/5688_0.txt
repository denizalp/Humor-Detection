Any plans I had to stay in shape while in Montreal were thrown into the furnace when I discovered this place was around the corner from our apartment.\nThis place is pretty much as good as it gets if you are looking for authentic french bread. The point of difference with this place is that it hasn't got that rustic look most artisan french bakeries have.  This place is super stylin', a bit hipster even? The bakers here are a young lot, but they take their bread seriously.
