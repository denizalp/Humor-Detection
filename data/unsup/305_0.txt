I LOVE JESSICA!  She made my hair look AMAZING for the Billboard Music Awards on May 20.   She was so awesome. I brought her a picture of what I wanted and she matched the half updo perfectly.  It was beautiful.  They even put me on TV cause my hair looked so great. I'll try to post a pic.  Thank you, SO much hair4u. I am so happy. See you next year for the Billboards 2013!
