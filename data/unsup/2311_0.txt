Excellent place to grab a bite!  I got an omelet which looked to have about 10 eggs worth in it (see my pic).  A huge side of hash browns, and toast.  Yeah, so it's a little expensive (mine was about $12) - but the portions are HUGE.  You get both quality and quantity.  And with all the neon lights and cool vibe, you'll feel like you should be in a Tarantino movie.
