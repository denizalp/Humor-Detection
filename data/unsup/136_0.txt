These guys were dispatched by my home warranty company after a different plumbing company was unable to diagnose a problem with my electric water heater over three separate visits.  They showed up on time, replaced the lower heating element and thermostat, and were on their way.  They fixed in 45 minutes what the other company couldn't get figured out in three tries.
