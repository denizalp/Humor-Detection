OMG! I miss Tibet kitchen already!!! The owner is so funny and friendly. The environment is so lively and the atmosphere was just so uplifting. I loved all of the dishes especially gyuma because since I live in Chicago, we don't have any Tibetan restaurant here. I am hoping to visit again during winter. STRONGLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO GO TO THIS RESTAURANT! You won't be disappointed!
