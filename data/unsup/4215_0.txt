I don't remember the food being spectacular, but they had many unique rolls with fresh fish.  The selection of sake is also excellent.  Despite the *blling bling* price and the mediocre sushi, the decor is fabulous and the service was impeccable.  The wait staff was very attentive, making sure your sake cup was full and you had enough soy sauce in your dish.  They even place the napkin on your lap for you (a sure sign of a classy place).  \n\nI would come here for the fabulous vibe and good sake but not really for their food.
