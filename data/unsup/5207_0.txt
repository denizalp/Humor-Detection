Top 99.897% worst look I've ever had from a hostess in my entire life. I can't think of a better word other than the most SMUG look from a human being I've ever received. If I am honestly inconveniencing you that much just tell me and I'll happily remove myself from this establishment. I was made to feel as if I needed to apologize for something. \nHowever \nThe restaurant looks awesome and can't wait to eat and the waitress is great!
