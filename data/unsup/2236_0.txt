Simple friendly, and fast. You can't beat there time and price. Never had a bad experience at this place. \n\nThe ladies are always fast, and friendly. Last time I was looking like a reject muppet, since I have not had a haircut for a few months. I was in and out with a cool fade in 10 minutes and I was not the only person wanting in line. Awesome in and out like the burger
