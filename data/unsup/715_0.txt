This is the worst place to be when it comes to customer service and experience. First off almost everyone in here is so rude with some sense of entitlement. I waited an hour after my oil change was said to be finished because they said it was in the wash. So my car pulls up and it wasn't even washed!!!! BTW Tyler was my service adviser. Don't ever buy a BMW literally the shittiest cars with the shittiest sales people and employees. Fuck this place. Going back to Mercedes!
