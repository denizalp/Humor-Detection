Had to leave my barber due to a job transfer to a new location. I was very committed to my former barber, and HATE looking for a new barber. But Ricky Hoover's yelp reviews sounded very good, and he was able to schedule me in within just a few days. \n\nFirst haircut went very well. Ricky is friendly, offers lots of information about the cut as he works. Second haircut was even better, and I've received a few compliments on my cut at home and the office.\n\nLooking forward to future visits. Thanks, Ricky!
