By far my favorite buffet on the strip. The prices have gone up since the first time I went but I'm not surprised. I Love the food and the individual servings. The dessert section is Amazing, but they give tiny scoops of gelato now. :-\/ Still the other pastries are delish!!! \nHighly recommend this buffet
