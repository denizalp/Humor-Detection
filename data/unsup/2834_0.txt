My favorite brunch spot in town and amazing prices for being on the strip. $10 bottomless mimosa's or bloody Mary's and they have like 10 choices of juices for the mimosa's! $35 unlimited breakfast tapas which are insanely good and if you come with a big group instead of bringing out small plates, they do family style. Truly one of my favorite spots in town for just a fun brunch or to celebrate an occasion!
