I went to a few Rubio's and I was surprised... as in how clean and well kept this Rubio was. I almost didn't recognize that it was a Rubio's. The staff cleaned the tables pretty fast and the food came out pretty fast too. Since Rubio's is more known for seafood Mexican food, I had the shrimp and bacon burrito and it tasted pretty good! It was my first time trying it. There were plenty of shrimp and the flavor was appetizing. If you have to go to a Rubio's, I suggest going to this one.
