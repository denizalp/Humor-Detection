Decent spot to grab a drink - their barrel aged negroni is my poison of choice. If you didn't get it from the name, the space has a very western-themed vibe. It's been a while since I've had a meal here, usually opting for drinks instead, so I'll refrain from saying anything about the food. Saturday nights here are madness, usually packed to the brim with the King West crowd. If that's your scene then you'll love it here.
