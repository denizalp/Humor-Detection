Ok so aside from the atrocious parking situation (drunk people can't park+not enough parking=me walking 6 blocks in the POURING rain to pick up take out) The food here is everything you could ever want from artery clogging bar food. It is greasy, but also flavorful. I hate to say it, but I really really like this place, and that makes me sad because none of their food can be healthy and they are oh so close to our house :(
