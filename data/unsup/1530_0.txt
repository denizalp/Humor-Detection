This place sets the standard for excellence. Wow this food is great. \n\nI ordered the Kiss Taco, Flip Taco, Papa Taco, and a Burrito. The tacos are small but mighty - simple, yet filled with flavor. The tortillas are cooked to perfection. Topped off with the onion\/cilantro mix and red salsa makes these tacos perfect. Be careful of the red salsa though - it definitely has a kick.\n\nThe burrito is filled to the brim with deliciousness. Swaddle me up like a burrito and put me in a food coma after this meal! 5\/5 would recommend.
