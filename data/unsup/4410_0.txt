Very simple place.  I like that when i want Indian food i can just come in order and it would be ready with in minutes The price is fantastic and the flavors are very tasty.  It is also close to my house so thats a plus.  It is very clean on the inside and the employees are very nice.  I will be back to enjoy this great food.
