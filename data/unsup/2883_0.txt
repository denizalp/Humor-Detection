Great salon, great prices. Staff was friendly, attentive and listens to all your requests. The salon is spacious and clean, lots of gel colors to choose from, walk ins welcome and they weren't busy when we came, was in and out within 45 mins for 2 mani\/pedis! We couldn't believe it!\n\nIt's tucked away in a small shopping center but this hidden gem certainly proves worthy of it's fab name, will definitely be coming back! Thanks for the great service and awesome nails! :)
