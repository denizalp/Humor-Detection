Stopped in here to pick up some wine and fish for a dinner party. This location had a really good selection of wine. Seemed about twice the selection of the wine available at the Chandler - Galleria location. My experience though is that Costco is Costco. The cashier was super friendly and my experience was fine. I'm bumping it up a Star just for the better wine selection.\nNormal Costco. Better gas prices than Chandler location. Twice the wine selection. Super nice cashier. 4 Stars.
