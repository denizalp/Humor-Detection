120 degrees. Sunday evening.  Fathers Day.  You guessed it, the a\/c at my rental property is making funny noises.  Can the timing possibly get any worse? \n\nI called Dukes around 500 pm and the issue was fixed by 815 pm.  I am happy, the tenant is happy. Win win for everyone.  I was kept abreast of the repairs and received a thorough report from John, who was professional and friendly.  \n\nI would highly recommend Arizona Dukes of Air.
