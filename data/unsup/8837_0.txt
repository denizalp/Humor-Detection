Came here for a Bachelorette Party...\n\nROOMS:\nThe rooms are what you get for the price... and not bad.\nThey are clean and there are connector rooms. The suites are spacious.\n\nCASINO:\nTypical... smoke is worse tho.\n\nFOOD:\nBuffet... mmmmm... seafood.\n\nOVERALL:\nGood for the value off the strip.\n\nWill review again after the Star Trek Convention.
