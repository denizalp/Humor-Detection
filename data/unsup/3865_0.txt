THE HERB BOX Honestly, incredible food, beautifully decorated and great location!  And they had a big selection of gluten free items that were some of the best we've ever had- my daughter was a happy girl! The Kale Corn and Sweet Onion Pakora and Korean Fried Cauliflower was delicious! We also ordered the short rib tacos, chicken avocado salad and the chicken blt.  All amazing! Will be back for sure!
