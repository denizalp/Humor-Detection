Super L Ranch Market is located in the Phoenix Chinese Cultural Center -- which is near Loop 202 and on 44th Street. This grocery store has everything you would expect from an asian market -- including an array of animals. You will also come across foods that you would think is uneatable (ex. pig's feet, fish heads, all types of intestines, etc.). The prices are reasonable as well.
