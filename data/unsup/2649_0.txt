I didn't hesitate in giving this restaurant a five star as they deserve it. \n\nFast is their middle name, and tasty is their surname. I always love coming here for the most delicious and humongous wonton. Literally less than a minute wait for your order, if there are less than twenty people. \n\nYou really don't need to go anywhere else if you want wonton soup in Richmond Hill, ON.
