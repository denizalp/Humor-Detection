I thought the food was good, BUT.....  The place is too small and cramped.  I like to read the menu. I don't want to have to ask the waitress.  I wanna read what is in all the rolls before I decide.  All they have is the names of sushi rolls and nothing else.  I gotta be a sushi psychic\/guru to make an educated choice.  And FINALLY, for the first time ever at a sushi restaurant,  I WALKED AWAY HUNGRY.  Too expensive for the small portions.  Waitress was nice.  Won't be going back.
