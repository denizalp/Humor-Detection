We had two smoked meat combos.  The sandwiches were huge and delicious.  The smoked meat was moist and full of flavour, the bread was fresh, and the mustard was a lovely addition.  The combo came with fries.  The home fries were great and came with vinegar - which made me nostalgic for Montreal.  The coleslaw was good and added freshness to the dish,  and the combo came with a deli pickle.  \n\nThe staff is helpful and friendly,  the location is on transit and has lots of parking.
