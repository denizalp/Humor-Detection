RM Seafood was good. Not amazing, but definitely good, perhaps even very good. Great oyster bar (I think the best in Vegas, but I'm not 100% sure). The fish and everything else we ordered was cooked and presented perfectly. I wish my Hawaiian Walu had a little more flavor, but it was still good. It was great fun to try out the Moon Doggies as seen in Top Chef Masters. Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for good seafood.
