Use to come here all the time and it was good. Came back downtown this week to get dinner here and it was not a very good experience. Service was poor, the waiter delivered our food with a backpack on. Food has changed as well. My noddle bowl was lacking the usual veggies and was only about a forth of the way full. Not coming back.
