I wasn't a huge fan of the pizza here. I was expecting a lot more considering their tag line is \"fresh fire roasted.\" If the pizza is fire roasted, I couldn't tell. We ordered the sweet sauce pizza, wishfully thinking it might be a nice alternative to my favorite pie from Fiori's. Unfortunately, the City Oven's pizza reminded me of something you'd find in the freezer aisle of the grocery store.  Although I didn't like the pizza, I would be willing to give this place another chance and try their other menu items.
