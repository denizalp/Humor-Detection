I'm a yogurtology maven.  I've already filled up two loyalty cards and am digging their new automated card program.  With how frequently I was going, it makes good sense to switch to a more environmentally friendly system. \n\nYogurtology is head and shoulders above the nearby mojo.  It has easier parking, more froyo, more toppings, and friendly staff.  The flavors change often (my fave has been the elusive butterfinger) but you can always count on some classics like oatmeal cookie and cake batter.  And, I kid you not, one of the toppings is frosting in a can!!  Unbelievable.
