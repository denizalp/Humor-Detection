They have free WiFi throughout the entire thing and it is completely reliable.  Add in the unique hat shop, huge Flamingos, hilarious tourist watching of green-clad folks stumbling out of O'Shea's, plus Brooklyn Bowl and soon to come \"High Roller\" and I could see this being the next \"must visit\" place for friends coming to town.  Not quite sure about the restaurant selections at this point, but I'm sure time will tell the tale - as long as they have free WiFi and plenty of room to wander I know I'll be back.
