Nothing much to say about them except it is Starbucks, crowded all the time and more people pouring in every minute.\nAnd I presume they keep a very limited stock in spite of this as almost everything we wanted was out of stock .. it was just 3 pm ..\nBanana bread, tomato mozzarella sandwich, even almost croissant.\n\nThe only good thing is that you could sit outside holding a coffee and enjoy the street experience sitting down.
