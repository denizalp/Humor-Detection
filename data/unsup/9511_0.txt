I reserve the word \"swell\" for truly important matters. This is a \"swell\" dining establishment.\n\nAfter a terrible day at work, I decided to try a take-out pizza from this location given its positive reviews on Yelp. I made a good choice indeed. Upon entering, the friendly and charming owner immediately treated me like family (and I was only picking up a medium pizza to go!)\n\nThe intimate and charming atmosphere inside is in striking contrast to the archetypal Phoenix \"crudscape\" outside. I definitely plan on returning to \"dine in\" and enjoy some of the restaurant's pasta specialties.
