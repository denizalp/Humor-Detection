I love this convenient little nail place!  They took an appointment at the last minute, and the lovely woman who did my manicure gels and pedicure was so nice, and did a thorough job.  I was so happy that I made another appointment.  Incredibly reasonable prices for north Scottsdale - and very fast attention.  One of the things I noticed was the amount of care of cleanliness and care about sanitary  practices including conclaving every single nail clip\/cuticle clipper and putting a plastic \"shower cap\" in the pedi bowl - so assuring!!!  Thank you, Ovation!
