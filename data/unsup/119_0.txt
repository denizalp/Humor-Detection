Took my wife and two boys to check out the shop. Friendly staff but unfortunately after about 25 minutes they notified us that they would be closing for filming. Nice choppers and cars in the collection for viewing. No charge to enter. Roli stepped-in for a second and was nice enough to take a picture with my boys. Will come back when i'm in LV again to spend time in the gift shop. Thanks Count's Kustom!
