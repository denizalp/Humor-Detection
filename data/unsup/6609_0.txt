This neighborhood needed some new, good, quick lunch spots.  All sandwiches on the menu are $5, and can be upgraded to a meal for an extra $2.50 (includes a side\/chips, and a drink).  Each sandwich is made fresh to order, with whatever toppings you choose.  They are big enough to last me through two lunches!\n\nThis place is turning in to a mini-convenience store!  There's a little of everything in there.  Each time I go, there's a little more decor and personality.  I'm looking forward to  seeing how they do when they get more established!
