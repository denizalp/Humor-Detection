The only good thing I can say is that the guy that cut my hair was friendly. \nOther than that... It took 1 hour and 25 minutes for a simple haircut!! This is 3 times what it usually is... The worst is that my hair looks so bad that I need to buzz it off!\nAnd to top it off it was not really cheaper ($34) than many other salon were you get a hair cut by someone with experience and not a student! \nPiece of advice... Don't go there!
