I read something about this being one of the best pizza places in the U.S., representing the state of Nevada. That was surprising! I passed by it a couple of times in a shady shopping area and decided to try it out in my own. The pizza was good, but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's the best in Nevada. The people there are pretty nice. I went back a second time and it was just OK. The bottom was soggy, and I don't like that in a pizza!
