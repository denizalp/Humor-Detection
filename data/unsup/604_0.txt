The team at Desert Inn Smiles is awesome. They provide awesome customer service. I received text messages for reminders for my appointment. The facility is very clean and organized. I went in for teeth cleaning and greeted as soon as I walked in. Dr. RJ and his staff did a very thorough cleaning. I would recommend this office to anyone looking for a reliable and patient first dental office.
