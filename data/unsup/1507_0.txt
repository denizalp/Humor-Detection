I ordered the special of the day... Spicy mango roll and it was delicious. I am from the Pacific Northwest so I enjoy my sushi. If you are looking for a quick bite, that is relatively cheap I'd recommend Chef Ben's. The one downfall was the miso soup which should be called miso broth. The flavor was right on just no green onions or tofu. If we were passing through again we'd stop for some sushi. Also, the service was friendly and my order was ready within five minutes.
