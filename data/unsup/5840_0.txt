I'm a fan of the Godzilla's Egg. I found this a novel presentation and delicious at that! \n\nSkip the oden. The broth is a tad too salty with very little soup. Though, there was a lot of stuff to go with it. I asked for hot water to dilute it to my preferred taste.\n\nOur server, Cheri, was awesome. She was friendly and enthusiastic about the menu. We enjoyed her recommendations very much! Ask for the Daily Specials menu.
