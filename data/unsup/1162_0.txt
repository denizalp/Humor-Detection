The caviar here is just to DIE for.  What did you expect me to say?  It's Subway.  They're in every small town from Bay Roberts, NL to Fernie, BC.\n\nThis one was fast, clean and efficient.  That's all I ask for.  Staff was reasonably friendly and my sangie was tasty.  I have no idea how the pricing works at Subway though.  All you hear on TV are those god damn FIVE DOLLAR FOOTLONG commercials yet I just paid 6 something for a 6\" turkey with bacon.  WTF?  I don't know. I'll be back.  Weeee
