Absolutely the worst pedicure I have ever had. I totally have wasted my money. My husband could do a better job. No wonder the place had no other customers. I should have just left. The equipment is old and outdated. The nail tech didn't seem to know what she was doing. If I could give it no stars I would. Never coming back. I should have looked at the dates of posts. This was a total waste of money.
