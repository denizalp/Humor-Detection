This is a place for local rednecks! I didn't think I'd find em in this neighborhood, but they are there. The bartender was slow and only paid attention to her regulars. The food was OK, and the beer was not cold enough. There was a very awkward moment when the regulars were howling about music other than country music, and they weren't being shy about it. A lot of the other patrons look uncomfortable. I don't recommend this place unless you like to fly a Confederate flag from your F150 pickup truck.
