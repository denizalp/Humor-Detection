Holy shit!  They have a live lobster machine!  I thought my gf was joking about this existing, but it's real.  Now I don't know how much you would trust a lobster coming from a crane game, but it's an odd and funny touch.\nYay for the cheap beers.  Something about this place seemed a little off though.  I'm not a big fan of huge sparsely decorated sports bar.  There seemed to be something missing. And I know it was a Wednesday, and that's not a normal drinking age, but I expected there to be a few more people.
