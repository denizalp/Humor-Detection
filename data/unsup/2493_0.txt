Very nice clean salon. Upscale equipment. All chairs are comfortable. \nI was greeted within seconds of walking in. \nPrices are average and they apply up to date techniques. \nThey use disposable tub liners and clean each tub and blower after use. \nOnly one slight complaint. I could do without the children running around.
