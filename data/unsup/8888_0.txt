Me and my husband stayed here for his bday. There was a few positives. Nice staff, clean big rooms and several things to do in hotel. The rooms are really old. No new decor. The only thing that was modern was the bed. I suggest getting a newer room, but if your on a budget and don't spend time in your room, then this could work for you. When we go to Vegas the room is very important to me since that's where I spend most of my time.
