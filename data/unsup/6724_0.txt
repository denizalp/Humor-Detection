Best food we have had in Vegas.   Lovely location.   We sat street side and Jonathan Tara took care of us.   We had awesome hot truffle fries,  therapy salads,  charred brusdle sprouts and they custom did a chicken strips fries and mac and cheese for our son.   Really good food,  fun views of passer By.
