So the ambience is stripmall salon. It appears clean and maintained, but isnt lux by any means. The staff seemed polite. It is however, outrageously expensive! I've been to much nicer salons for less than half the price. I have simple straight hair and they wanted to charge $350.00 for highlights and cut. My hair isn't messed up or anything crazy that needed correcting. The staff was polite. I recommend 9037 or tonic salon if you're looking in this area, I decided to wait until I could get an appointment at one of these.
