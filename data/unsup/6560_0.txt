I purchased a Groupon for a pedicure at Diamond Nails. It was a great deal so I thought I would try it out. What a great experience. The salon is peaceful, nice decor. The massage chairs were excellent. Great customer service. They even provided bottled water. The pedicure was excellent. I will definitely be back.
