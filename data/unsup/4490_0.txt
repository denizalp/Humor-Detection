This is a great place! The staff was so welcoming and friendly. They didn't rush me while I was picking out my color (they offer a ton of OPI and Gellish colors) but did get me in and out in about 30 minutes. My manicure was impeccably done by Steve. Very reasonably priced too...only $30. What a treat!
