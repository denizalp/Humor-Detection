I will say that their wine selection is second to none and their beer selection is vast.  But when it comes down to service and expertise, Total Wine falls down.  If I am looking for a good wine suggestion, I much prefer and trust the folks at Steve's.  If I am looking for a large selection of spirits and with zero service\/support, Woodman's fits the bill.  Total Wine tries to straddle this line and just doesn't quite get there for me.
