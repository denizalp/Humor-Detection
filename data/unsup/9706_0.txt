I happened to be in the area on business and my associates picked this place.  It was my first experience with Middle Eastern food and I have to say I'm now hooked!  I had the Kafta pita and it was bursting with flavor.  Just the right amount of spices and very fresh.  If I'm in the area again on business I wouldn't hesitate to stop by.
