i can't believe i haven't written a review of this yet, considering i've been here a thousand times. this was however the first time i've gone and there hasn't been some sort of event going on. it's actually quite peaceful!\n\nwe went to rent SUP for an hour. the park is just great i think. there's a water play area for kids and it's located right off the fun strip of Mill. tempe beach park hosts numerous festivals and events throughout the year. \n\nfun, fun, fun.
