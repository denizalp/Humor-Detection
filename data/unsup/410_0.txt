What a neat little restaurant tucked in an old Chandler residential neighborhood. The owners turned an old house into a cute little cafe with excellent food and amazing service!\n\nI had the Morning Monti which was fantastic! It is a sandwich made with French toast, eggs, turkey, and cheese. I added some maple syrup to it to make it extra sweet. What really made the sandwich was their signature French toast made from Hawaiian bread. Next time I'm probably just gonna order that because it was so darn good.   \n\nDefinitely will be coming back :)
