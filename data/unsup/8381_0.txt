I didn't even want to go on the tour of the apartment because the office lady was beyond rude to me. She didn't even get up to shake my hand or even make any eye contact to meet a potential customer. Not even an introduction or ask what I was looking for!!!! No way I would live in a community like that I can't even imagine how bad the management is there.
