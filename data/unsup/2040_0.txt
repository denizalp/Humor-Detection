If you can't wait in line, you probably don't deserve this barbecue.  That's it.\n\nI'm not totally stoked about their sides, but there's a huge upside!  MORE ROOM FOR BBQ!\n\nThursday, they have pastrami and it is amazing!!!!\n\nAre you in line yet?  No?  That's ok, they are probably already out of meat.  It's that freakin' good!
