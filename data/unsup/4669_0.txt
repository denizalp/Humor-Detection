Went here during lunch hour. Myself and one other ordered the Pita RLT and BLT (roast beef\/bacon, lettuce and tomato) in pita bread. Great tasting and under $10 per each. \n\nAlso, ordered the vanilla milkshake.. it's great and be careful you might want to stir it before you pour more. Lol\n\nGreat tasting, swift service and great customer service!
