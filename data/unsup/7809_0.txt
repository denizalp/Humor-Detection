Pizza was to die for. Sourdough crust was perfect, and pizza was made relatively quick for what it was. Got an Italian soda, not sure it was worth almost $4, but it kind of went with the gourmet territory. The little store was cute, the merchandise was expensive, but like I said, goes with the territory. Had a brownie that was very rich and delicious. Looking forward to going back.
