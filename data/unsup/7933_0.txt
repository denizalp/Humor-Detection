The good: service is extremely good. Marissa, Mike, Natalie, Rose, Emily, Theresa & Sara all provide excellent service and are very friendly. Thur\/Fri\/Sat night sometimes there are cute girls, which for this area is a positive. I also like the couch\/chair area for people watching.\n\nThe bad: This bar can often get busy, and during games sometimes there is limited to no seating near the bar, and there is no pizza. Limited craft brew selection, but they usually at least have something from Stone.
