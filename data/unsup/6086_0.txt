MEAT! MEAT! MEAT!\n\nPastrami on Rye ($7.50) was so good!\n\nMade in house! Soft, tender, juicy and  flavoured with the perfect spices!\n\nMoe Pancer's has this old world charm without the hustle. I found the restaurant clean and the wait staff friendly!\n\nI'll be back for more MEAT! Corn Beef anyone?!
