We always go to McDonald's for a go to snack and the happy meal for kids. But this store is the worst. Dirty dining area. Filthy prep area. Serving old fries and burgers. They fry the fries and let it sit by their warmer. Same with the burgers. I work in a food business also so I can tell if the food is freshly made. Crew are just sitting at the back area while the store looks so dirty.
