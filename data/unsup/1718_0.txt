Ok they came out and cleaned up the oven cleaner stains in the oven left from the original cleaner leaving it in the oven without wiping it out.\n\nThey was quick and efficient and also gave me a $25 refund on my cleaning bill. \n\nGlad they had such a fast response time to my complaint. Thanks for addressing the prob.
