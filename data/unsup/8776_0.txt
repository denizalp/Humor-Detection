I had eyelash envy while browsing Instagram so I decided to do it.  Being a natural girl I was worried about the ingredients in the glue and I knew that I didn't want formeldahyde in my eyes so I choose Humble Bee Lash.  Dulcinea was so sweet and very good at what she does.  My eyelashes turned out amazing and I have received so many compliments.
