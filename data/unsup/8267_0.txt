Purchased a groupon for two steaks and a bottle of wine. We also ordered buffalo wings which were great and creme Brule which was just good, but cold. The steaks were good quality which is important to me, but they weren't very flavorful at all. Sides were sub par and cold. It was and okay experience overall.
