George and his crew from Reflections Painting are amazing! He came out to do the estimate for us last minute, agreed to work around the flooring crew and got the job done before we expected. The flooring came out a day before and caught up to them in a couple hours. He also works around your schedule and is very prompt when they arrive. He uses high quality paint that looks great! Their work is very professional and they work very fast at a reasonable price. I HIGHLY recommend them for your interior painting needs!
