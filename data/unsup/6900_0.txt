I've been wanting to try this place for a while. I mean, even if it's fast food... it's a place that specializes in chicken fingers. That's pretty much all they do. So they have to have the most amazing, flavourful chicken fingers ever, right? \n\nNope. I mean, they weren't the most awful chicken fingers I've ever eaten - there was some moisture there - but they were bland. So disappointingly bland. The dipping sauce (thousand island dressing?) helped a little, but I won't be hopping back in my car to buy more. Popeyes is further away, but much tastier.
