First timer here, on a Saturday night, mini high school reunion.\nBeen here for over 20 years, apparently we came after the Bar Rescue remodel.\nCool little place, good beer selection and a heavy pour on the shots.\nWe only had a couple appetizers for food and they were ok. \nI have nothing bad to say, except for the small tiny bathrooms that has one urinal and one toilet with no door and a 2 foot partial wall. Hope you don't have to poop.\nGeorge and Dragon gets a solid C from me.
