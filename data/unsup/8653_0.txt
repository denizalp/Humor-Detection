With great reviews from my Yelp friends and insistent recommendations to try this place when I'm in town, I decided to finally try it. Sure, why not? \n\nUh the hassle of ordering does NOT outweigh the product. There's friendly service then there's the forceful \"let me upsell you with everything you could possibly not want on your ice cream\" service. \n\nI'm not even sure if I wanna give them a two stars for the product I received.\n\nPS. If you like \"natural laxatives with your ice cream, this is the place to be ;)
