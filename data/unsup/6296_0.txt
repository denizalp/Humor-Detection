I love the Asheville location, so was excited when we accidentally drove past this place while visiting Charlotte. The giant pecan pancake and biscuits were just as a I remembered them, and I was able to pick up some biscuit mix and tupelo honey to bring back home. Service was a bit slow, but overall pretty good.
