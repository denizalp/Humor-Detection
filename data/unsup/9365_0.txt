Someone mentioned that AAA gives out free guide books to its members, so I popped in here last week to see what I could get for my upcoming trips to Peru and Japan.  They told me they had no guidebooks for anywhere outside the US, and they came back with a fold up world map.  Umm yeah, thanks a lot, that's really helpful.
