I like to come to this theatre when I'm in the area or if there is a movie I want to see that's playing before noon. It's a Saturday afternoon, and theatre #15 is disgusting. Food on the floor seats and trash everywhere. Paying $10 to sit in filth. I'm going to sanitize everything I had to touch. Turn the lights on management and clean this place. Will not be back. I'll pay $10 and go to galaxy theatres for clean leather seats
