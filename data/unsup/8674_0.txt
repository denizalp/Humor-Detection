Delish!!! If you want a burger fix, this is the place!!!\nI ordered the Bad Ass Burger since it was hi lighted on the menus, and certainly you can't go wrong with a name like that! Even though I ordered the smaller burger I couldn't make it half way through! But every bite was good.\nThe sweet potato fries were perfect! Cooked fresh, crisp on the outside, sweet and tender on the outside! Topped of with fresh squeezed strawberry lemonade, sweet and tart at the same time! Yummmmy!!! \nI'll be back!!!
