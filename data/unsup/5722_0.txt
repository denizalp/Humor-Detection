Went to the Great Wok for lunch the other day and it was well worth the money. I ordered orange chicken off their lunch special menu. It was very good. It wasn't your typical sweet orange chicken. It had a little spice to it and you could actually see the red chili flakes in the sauce. The lunch special also included soup and a side of fried rice. The service was fast and the waitress was nice. She was also quick to refill our drinks which is a plus!
