Decided to try this place after reading the Yelp reviews.  \n\nLocation is the dumpy, divey, sketchy Twain Avenue at Palos Verdes St.  I've never witnessed anything violent there, but there are plenty of derelict-looking people standing and shuffling around on the street, so you may feel uneasy.  I wouldn't let it deter you from visiting, however; they seem harmless.\n\nPizza quality was pretty good; definitely better than the Palermo's location located across the street.  It was also ready in the 15 minutes it was promised.
