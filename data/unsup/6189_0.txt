Food is great  I took away two stars for the service. \n\nI order from here regularly since I work in the area.. this most recent pick order I did; I received poor service. I was \"blamed\" for my order not being received and told me that I called the wrong location. Wrong, I called \"The Original Lindo Michoacan\" on D.I. So I called the same number back that I called in for the order I made originally and asked her which location I am calling and she told me D.I.\n\nMoral of my story is I CALLED THE CORRECT LOCATION.
