I like purchasing haircare and makeup products here. Mostly b\/c I get coupons and points when you buy stuff. Plus they have a  really good selection of expensive and not-so-expensive products.\nI did get my hair cut here once. ONCE. Never again. I ended up spending $50 and it was a horrible experience. Go down the street to Paul Mitchell The School. $15 for a cut and dry.
