There is only one true 'Cronut' and it isn't found in Toronto. It would be best if people quit using the word to describe the imposters found here. It does such a dis-service to the real thing. \n\nCronut is a croissant-doughnut pastry invented by Chef Dominique Ansel and trademarked by his bakery in New York City. If you want a real one, go there! I did in May and it was so exquisite. I should have had 5.\n\nThe ones here are wannabes with fillings of lies!
