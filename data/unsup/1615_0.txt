NOM NOM NOM! \n\nHow did it take me so long to find my favorite lunch place in Charlotte? I am so sad that I didn't eat here earlier. I love that their menu allows for vegetarian and turkey hot dog substitutions (for a non-red meat\/pork eater). Their onion rings and tater tots are delicious and they have a great beer selection.\n\nSure, I may have to add an extra hour of workouts a week, but this place is well worth it!
