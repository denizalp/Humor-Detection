Did not enjoy my lobster roll at all. I got it New England style and the meat was tasteless and had a texture like it came out of a can. This was a total waste of $24 and space in my stomach. The bread was fresh, but had no butter on it nor was it toasted or put on a grill. Tasted like someone opened a bag of bread and just placed a handful of canned lobster meat in it with a sprinkle of chives. Blah!
