Great bar!!! Awesome beer selection and a spot on bar staff, Justin may be one of the best bartenders in this city!! One of the only places in the south valley that you can get great food late night. The chicken sandwich is awesome as a wrap, and you can't leave without having the cheesy tots. Enjoy!
