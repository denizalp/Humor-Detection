Plank Road Tavern in one of my favorite Lakewood hangouts. I especially love their large array of craft beer selections. The Columbus Bodhi is one of my favorites. I really like taco Wednesdays! The Margaritas are mixed well and for 3$ what else can you ask for! The tacos aren't the usual ground beef choice but a flavorful selection of vegetarian, chicken or steak. Service is always friendly :-) thanks Plank Road for providing a fun place to hang out with great beer!
