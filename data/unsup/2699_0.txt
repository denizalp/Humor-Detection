Pleasantly surprised. I was a bit skeptical about the area at first but security is not an issue. Employees are very welcoming and helpful. If I could change one thing, it would be noise level from other people. The beds are comfy and the rooftop access is nice as well. The walls are relatively thin and the stairs are creaky but overall it was a pleasant stay.
