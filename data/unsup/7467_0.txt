So grateful to find this spot.  I've been so turned off by the common go to's around town that everyone swears by.   Came the first time and was satisfied.  Months and months later I am sick thought I'd give it another try.  Extremely satisfied.  The ingredients are great, good selection, really something for everyone.  I'm sure I would enjoy other things on the menu.  Tonkatsu white, thick noodles never disappoints!  Did I mention the customer service is insanely awesome! If you ever feel down these guys will somehow always put a smile on your face.
