Where to start... \n\nEverything is fresh. Staff is friendly. Food is delicious. \n\nYour first time, either try the Tony's, the Super Marco or the secret menu Charlie's. When they ask if you want Mayo and Hotsauce, just nod yes. It's made in house and I swear you'd think there's nicotine in it. \n\nCalmly but firmly dip your panini into the Mayo Hotsauce and repeat. \n\nI try to go 2-3 times a week to keep my blood to mayo\/Hotsauce ratio healthy.
