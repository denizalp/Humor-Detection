This is really a ZERO STARS review. $55 from McCarran to Harrah's really??  Well it's no wonder since he took the tunnel, went south past Mandalay Bay, then the Freeway way up north past the Fashion Show Mall.  He didn't say a word the whole trip even after calling him out on his scam.  \n\nThis is the first and last time I will ever take a taxi in Las Vegas, what a Scam.
