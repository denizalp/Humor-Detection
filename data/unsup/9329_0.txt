I didn't believe the yelp reviews about the white pizza, but they proved me wrong!  \n\nThin crust pizza, large slices, love this cheap and easy food in Vegas! \nFind the pool tables on the third level of the Cosmopolitan, find this hidden gem down a hallway of records. \n\nI love a simple pepperoni pizza, but why is this white pizza so addicting?! \nDon't let me hype it up... gotta try it for yourself!  Come here for just an appetizer before a fun night ahead!  Can't wait to come back and purchase a whole pie!
