We had a picnic here with a group from church and we had an absolute blast. The owners were very kind to us and extremely accommodating. It was a super rainy day and the lifeguards had left but when our kids expressed interest in swimming the owner sat out in the rain to lifeguard until one of the lifeguards returned. We are so thankful for their kindness and because of them being so accommodating to us we were able to have a blast even though the weather was crummy.
