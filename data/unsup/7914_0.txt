Love this place for satisfying both my seafood and dimsum cravings! The space is beautiful and the reason I do not give it the full 5 stars is the service is not at par with food and atmosphere. We have tried the lobster and crab combos, and everything is always cooked very well. Dimsum is great but a bit on tue pricey side. Also love that they have a seafood market for live seafood, sushi, sashimi, and frozen dimsum. They also have private rooms with automated lazy Susans
