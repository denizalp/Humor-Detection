Pricey but oh-so worth it. If you like your booze you must come here at least once. The infused cocktails are spectacles and the taste is incredible. I had the vanilla hickory old fashioned and the flavour still comes to mind when I think of it. An amazing, boozy marshmallow that will transport you to the campground of your dreams while you sit in a spiffy Queen West bar. I will most definitely be back for a special occasion or date night.
