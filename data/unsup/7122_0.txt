Rolled into the immeasurable giant of java for a quick caffeinated beverage before heading on the 215 while bouncing home.  No inside service on this particular day as I stayed inside the comfort of my vehicle and pushed through the drive-thru.  The service was friendly enough, and my drink was just as SB pretty always does.  A solid A-OK experience when needing a sip of life's blood before whatever it is you have going on.
