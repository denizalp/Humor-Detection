I have not gone to the Bellagio Buffet in over 5 years and the last time I went it was rather blah...\n\nWell this time around I used my Vegas winnings for a nice free meal and boy was I happy!\n\nTwo items I went to town on ... Beef Wellington and Crab Legs!  So yummy and good.\n\nIt would be a 5 star buffet but the desserts were not very good.
