Absolute most amazing hidden jewel of a restaurant.  I dine out often and would highly recommend this restaurant.  Not anything ordinary here.  The desserts are unmatched and the owners are absolutely the most sincere hard working, passionate, wonderful people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting!  Amy makes all of her creations from scratch, by hand and it shows in the presentation and flavors of everything she masters.  Seriously, this place is not to be mistaken for the average...not by a long shot!!!  Treat yourself...save room for dessert...thank me later!!!
