Guys, guuuuuys, guys!!!! I can't tell you how happy I was that this place opened up. Every morning I secretly hope I miss my streetcar so I can go in for a latte and every time I go in there's a new awesome thing on the shelves (Jane Hats! Buttons! All the comics ever!). And everyone is awesome! EVERYTHING IS AWESOME! This place is awesome. May I miss many streetcars.
