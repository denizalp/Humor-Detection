I went here to get my tragus and a cartilage piercing done.  Sam did my tragus and Amber did my cartilage.  Both were professional, kept me at ease, and most importantly gave me awesome looking piercings.  I recently went somewhere else for a piercing... huge mistake.  Should have stuck with No Regrets!
