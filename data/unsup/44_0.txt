Had my first meal at Texas Roadhouse Tempe, AZ.\nThe atmosphere was nice, wait staff from the greeter to the waitress were very accommodating. \nWe all order the Ribeye Steak, cooked to order. I am a medium rare steak eater and my husband is a well done steak eater.  Our steaks as well as our sides were cooked to our liking.  The soft bread they serve when you walk in is delicious! \nWe will definitely be eating there again!
