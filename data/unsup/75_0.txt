Would have given negative star but have to give one to post review. With all the hype and reviews from friends who have been to other Hurts was expecting good things.\n\nSadly disappointed spent $7.00 for one sweet roll and one doughnut.  Both were STALE nasty taste with only one bite.\n\nSorry to say will not be recommending or coming back.\n\nTo any ask how I can say they were stale when they have trays of fresh doughnuts. Ask yourself how long have they been sitting there. Fresh is made every 30minutes to every hour.\nDoubtful that they make them that often.
