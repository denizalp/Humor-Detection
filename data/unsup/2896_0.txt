Found Randy's Window Tinting on Yelp, gave them a call 10\/19\/16 to get an estimate on stripping the dealer tint and re-doing it darker and made appointments for the following week. They gave me a discount as I am having two cars done.\n\nHad the first car done today and it turned out fantastic!  I have no doubt the next car tomorrow will look just as good.  Highly recommend!
