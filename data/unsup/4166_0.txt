We love Mimi's! Never thought about writing a review. I am a creature of habit and for breakfast I always get the Santa Fe Omelet. Truly my favorite breakfast dish. Well yesterday the restaurant was out of avocado's so I decided to choose another dish. I ordered the chicken and waffles. Truly surprised that it was so good. It wasn't like frozen chicken. The waitress told us that it is hand breaded and I could tell. Super yummy loved it
