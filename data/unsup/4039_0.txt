Absolutely the best I've ever been to. I was nervous about wisdom teeth extraction but everything was so smooth sailing. I was so nervous that I forgot my money lol but no problem, quick fix and everything went as planned. I love this office. Jeimi helped me get in before my insurance ended. Dr Kikuchi and his assistance did the surgery very quickly and I also had a good time laughing with them. Definitely recommend this office to anyone in Vegas!!! Thanks again everyone!
