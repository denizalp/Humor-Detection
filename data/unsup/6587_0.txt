I love the atmosphere of Oreganos. There is usually a good crowd and a wait time to get a table. I've been to Oreganos three times now, and have had good experiences each time, except for the BBQ chicken pizza - not enuf sauce, and they throw in some cheddar cheese which tastes awkward. But overall, my experience there with the waiters and staff, and the food is always good. Portions are big, Price is small, Food and staff is great.
