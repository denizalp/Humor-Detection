This apple store was pretty nice when I was there with my girlfriend at the time. A decent size for an open air mall. Seemed to have a very small crowd considering the time of day and amount of people shopping in the area. A pretty good experience over all. Bonus points for location on,.. yet still far enough out of Casino Land. Plenty of parking not far away too.
