Typical college area bar. Very casual atmosphere with lots of TV screens and loud music; don't expect to be able to have a conversation here without shouting. Service is friendly, parking is good, the drinks are OK. I ordered beef tacos, vegetarian tacos, and nachos with steak -- all were loaded with grease, and the tacos were borderline palatable. My suggestion: come here for enjoying company and having drinks, but if you are hungry, eat before coming here.
