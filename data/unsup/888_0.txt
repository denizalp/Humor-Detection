OMG... Seriously. The cook went and took the two carpets from the inside, and shook off the dirt upwind from the diners in the patio area. Then, he went back to cutting up chicken without washing his hands. \n\nI've been a regular here, but no more. Their food isn't amazing, but tolerable at the price point, but this disgusting act did it for me. \n\nI'll go elsewhere where I think (hope) their employees wash their hands after doing cleaning work. Be warned, dine there at your own peril. (I'd give this place negative stars if possible.)
