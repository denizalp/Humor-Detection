Absolutely terrible experience this week at Bar Louie. On Thursday my friend and I went to dinner and sat on the patio. It took at least 10-15 minutes for our drinks to be served after we placed our order. We then ordered our salads, my salad came out incorrect. I had it remade, to only have it made incorrect for the second time. We saw our waitress cross the street to grab Starbucks during our meal - while I was sitting there waiting. My friend completed her whole meal while I was still waiting to have mine remade.
