Wow!  Really great!\nWent for restaurant week to try it out.  Had 3 course meal for $ 40.  They did not cut corners on anything.  Everything was first class.  Chicken & sausage crepes with peach sauce for  appetizer.  Different combination but excellent.  Main course, 2 filet mignon medallions.  Cooked perfectly.  Desert, cheese cake cannoli-  what can I say- perfection again!!\nWill return.
