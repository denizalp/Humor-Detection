Good quality used appliances, and they do delivery.\n\nRecently bought a stove from these guys. Their prices are very reasonable and they do deliver within a few days. I had called around to several places and this place definitely had the best price. They also had good brands. \n\nThe delivery process was very smooth. So far the stove is working just fine.
