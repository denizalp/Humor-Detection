One of the founders for the downtown experience.  A must see and a must do.  The drinks are normal with a bit extra booze on most days. \n\nThe Decor is slightly dungeon and slight 1400 scotland castle.  I love it here when it is slow but when it gets busy (band nights) it is set up to enjoy as well.\n\nIf you are strolling the downtown and see one of the places that started before the renovation and is still standing then go and enjoy.  \n\nI do!
