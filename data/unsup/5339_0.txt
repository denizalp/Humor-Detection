Don't pay via credit card...  Server stole our card number and started purchasing face cream from Nerium International after we ate at this restaurant.  Having to cancel our credit card kind of ruined the meal. The day before Mother's Day, no less!  Somebody's Mom did a really bad job of raising a decent human being.
