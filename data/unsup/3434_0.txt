Stripper poles, swimming pools, hot waitresses & beautiful people. XS has everything a good Las Vegas nightclub should have... and more. We rented a booth and our server, Amber treated us like superstars. Aside from looking like a much hotter version of Katie Perry, she had brains too and kept us in our place all night. Lol!\n\n;-P\n\nMusic was good. Clientele were well behaved. We didn't have much trouble waiting in line but I guess thats why you pay top bank for bottle service. \n\nBest night I've had in Vegas. Period.
