Second location just opened.   They seem to be a little stumbling but I'm sure they will get thier rhythm down just like at the NW location. \n\nIt certainly is the same place as the NW delicious and fresh.   I could eat this shawarma all day.   Now that it's closer to home I'm sure I'll be a repeat offender.\n\nThank you Jerusalem Shawarma for expanding your delicious flavors upon the rest of Calgary.
