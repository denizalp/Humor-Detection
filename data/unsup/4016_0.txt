Amazing. My Mom is allergic to canola and eggs and I'm allergic to gluten. The chef came out suggested dishes and worked with us to come up with yummy food. And did you catch that? YUMMY!!! The best Vietnamese food I have ever had!! And four of us were stuffed full for under $40. Go eat awesome food there!
