I absolutely love this restaurant- it's one of my favs! The kid serving icecream in the grocery area is a total jerk though. Had I not been to olive & ivy before, and enjoyed my experience every single time previously, he would have truly put a damper on my experience. I let him know how rude he was & he suddenly told me that English was hard for him, since he was from Switzerland- when he had been speaking crystal clear (and perfectly rude) English up until then. Regardless, management should be aware of his Unprofessionalism and attitude.
