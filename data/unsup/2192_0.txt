It was Friday during Lent.  So that meant a cheese pizza.  I hadn't furnished my kitchen yet and I was hungry.  I decided to try a local spot close-by.  What a mistake.  The cook looked like Hyacinth's brother in Keeping up Appearances - complete with the sweat-stained A-shirt clinging to his immense rolls of fat.  But, hey, maybe the food is good?  I got my pizza.  I ate a few slices.  I never experienced anything like it before - sort of like a cracker topped with pizza sauce and cheese.  Me no like.
