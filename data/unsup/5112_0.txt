Torsion spring snapped in half Friday night and we were stuck. Called Cory Saturday morning after reading Yelp reviews and he came out in two hours and fixed it. He installed double torsion spring to prevent us from getting stuck when it happens again. No up-sell, on-time, follow-through on our questions, and courteous. What else can you ask from a contractor? Thanks Cory and thank you Yelp!
