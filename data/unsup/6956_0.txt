Have been to the blind pig a few times from its opening and I will say in the beginning the food was fresher and seemed more homemade and had better ingredients . Lately the food is just bland and seems prepackaged or frozen . I will not be returning . Also 50% of the time my food comes out different than ordered. Oh well many more places to get regular bar fare from in this town .
