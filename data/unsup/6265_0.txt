This is the best way to get around Vegas if your not in a rush, Wearing heels or don't want to feel raped by Taxi fees. \n\nSuper cheap $8 for a 24hr pass, You can purchase them at the bus stop or if paying cash you can buy them on the Deuce. \n\nIt has A\/C \n\nOperates 24 Hours\n\nNo Food or Drinks but I snuck my alkie on board, no biggie. \n\nI thought it was a great experience and would do the Deuce again next time I'm in Sin City.\n\nRANDOM FACT:\nThe Deuce buses went into service on October 27, 2005.
