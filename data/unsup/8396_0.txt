Naakiti floral did an amazing job with decorations for our August 6, 2016 wedding at Canyon Gate CC.  The room looked exactly as I had dreamed it would thanks to Rosilyn and her creativity and talent.  I had a vision of a bling themed room and she delivered!  From the bling towers to the linens and flowers, everything looked amazing.  The bling plate chargers were a nice bonus to capture the look.  My guests are still talking about how beautiful it was.  Thank you so much.  Truly amazing and forever grateful.
