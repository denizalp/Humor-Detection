Traffic was terrible and it was the middle of the week.  There were crowds of intoxicated people everywhere.  It was hard to get around and casinos seemed to be separated from each other by streets lacking safe ways to cross them.  I gues I am just not turned on by large mobs of people.  Also everything was exspensive so that explains the number of people at anything \"free\".  Except a lot of the freebies were closed.  I doubt I will ever go back.
