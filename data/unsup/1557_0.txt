Came here for New Years Eve and had the most delicious Chilean sea bass ever from their special menu. I'm not sure if they serve it regularly as well but the fish just melts in your mouth and is cooked to perfection. My friend got several sushi rolls and seemed to enjoy it as well. Overall, the service was also superb and attentive. Great experience!
