i had the glazed cinnamon roll for breakfast 2x during my business trip.  and it was divine!\n\nit's fluffy, not dense, and not overly sweet.  yes, it was $4.25 for the cinnamon roll but it was still good!  wished they had offered to warm it up but it was not bad.\n\nthe perq is just like a starbucks...  lots of grab and go food options and plenty of beverages.  i like the communal table seating, but never did spend time lingering around because i was on the go!
