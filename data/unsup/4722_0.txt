The guy that owns Sticks and Shakes alone being super friendly and polite gets my vote for a great place. But the concept of different fruit sorbet and frozen fruits dipped in varieties of chocolate and toppings of your design, is pretty awesome. \n\nMy daughter picked a mango sorbet Popsicle and said it was very good, my friend got a frozen banana in dark chocolate, delicious!! \n\nLocated in busy Fashion Show Mall by Saks Fifth Avenue, it's a great people watching spot and a good place to grab a snack after heavy shopping.
