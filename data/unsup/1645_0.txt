I see Shasta every three weeks. She is AWESOME and she's the reason I keep coming back. This location is very clean and the front desk staff is great. They get a clean stick every time they dip, and Shasta always lets me look over my waxing with a mirror and make sure it's nice and clean before she lets me go. Love this place and I would highly recommend it if you're looking for a wax!
