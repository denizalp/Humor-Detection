Pretty standard fare. Burgers, sandwiches, etc\n\nWe ordered a couple breakfast sandwiches and coffees. The coffee is a great deal! $1.75 for 16oz! The breakfast sandwiches looked kind of ugly but tasted of excellent greasiness...\n\nIt did it's job of holding us over. We wanted to avoid purchasing snacks on the boat feeling that there would be a considerable upcharge there.\n\nThis is the official cafe for the clipper. You can purchase boat tickets here too. And after the boat ride, you'll get a BOGO coupon for a 16oz coffee\/iced tea.
