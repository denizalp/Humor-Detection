Omg. \"My tongue went through a sea adventure.\"\nSea Umami game so strong. Next level sashimi~ \nWe tried the Omakase experience. The uni (sea urchin) and Toro (fatty tuna) are like sea umami bomb waiting to explode in your mouth haha. \nThe waitress clearly explained each dishes and it really enhance the dining experience. \nAmazing night~ \nDefinitely a place to go again. \nBring your dem sexy date there. \nThat's dat.
