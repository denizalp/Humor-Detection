My favorite natural health food store in Toronto. Spacious, clean, and affordable. The staff is incredibly friendly - always smiling, always greeting customers. \n\nYou will find that many items (certain brands) are priced lower here than at other health food stores. Herbs & Nutrition has everything from organic produce and local cheeses to vitamins\/supplements and skin care. \n\nThey will carry practically every \"natural\" brand that you can think of. Love it!
