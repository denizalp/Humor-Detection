We did the wine pairing with the four courses.  It's a tour through the world via wine. Our server was Sam, he was professional and knowledgeable. The service was well choreographed. My filet was perfectly prepared and my wife loved her salmon. The desert was on point. I would put their rum cake against the butter cake at City Hall. Great date place. Love it.
