Inside the Luxor- small, no cover charge, second floor, two pool tables that take up the dance floor (rear of club) - Stupid DJ (wife put in a request- DJ says maybe)  what a dork, who does he think he is?  Pauly D??  At least Pauly D will play any request.  Overall on ok club (free) - except for the music,  I think I knew about 3-4 songs....\n\n\"Lean back, lean back\" , \"Smack that Ass\", & \"Get out da way, get out da way, move BItch!\"  \n \n\nyeah
