Sooooo glad Firehouse is back in Gastonia!   Meatball sub is the BEST in town and they have made it even better with a sweet & spicy version.  Wife sticks with roast beef but loves it every time.  Steamer makes their sandwiches the best!  They have some interesting new choices too, so looking forward to trying those as well!
