Just had a great experience at this Office Max thanks to Wayne and Daniel. I was looking for a particular item and when i couldn't find exactly what i was looking for, they helped me by thinking outside the box and finding me an even better solution! They both were extremely friendly and accommodating and made what could've been a stressful office errand very quick and easy. I even signed up for the rewards program because i was so impressed by their service. Will be back to this location for sure!
