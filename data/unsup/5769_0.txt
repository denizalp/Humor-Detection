These are the best cookies I have ever tasted!  Can't believe I walked by this place several times before going in...missed out for months!  Who knew cookies could have so many layers of flavor? Every variety is great, but the salted caramel minis and the oatmeal peanut butter dark chocolate cashew cookies are my absolute faves.  The owner and atmosphere are delighful as well- you absolutely must stop in!
