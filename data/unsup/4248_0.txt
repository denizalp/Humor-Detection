I've been to this new restaurant 4 times - BEST FISH n CHIPS ever - I had the beet salad and it was GREAT!!!   No charge for sparkling water (nice)... now, I don't drink beer but my partner does, and enjoyed it.  I have only been in mid-day so it wasn't overly crazy-busy but service was fine - nice staff.  Love the decor.  Had a manager check in on us to make sure we were all good - no complaints here - and we will definately go back.
