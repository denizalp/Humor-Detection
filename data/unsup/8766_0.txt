Steak and Shake, the In & Out Burger of the Midwest.\n\nOnly Con about this S&S, its too new, its crazy how hi-tech this place is and its funny how everyone working looks like they should be in a Steak & Shake Barbie Commerical. \n\nSelling Burgers not MAC products.\n\nOther than that, you should see me here at least once a month.
