I love the Rocky River location close to where I live and now I can order Danny Boys catering now that the Broadview Heights location opened by my work! Score! \nLast week  I called just after 11 when they opened and they were able to delivery in about an hour lunch for 6 at my business meeting. Friendly service, fair price (we have a per head price we can't go over and they can meet it), good food, reliable delivery- perfect!  Thank you Danny Boys, pizza makes work meetings MUCH more fun.
