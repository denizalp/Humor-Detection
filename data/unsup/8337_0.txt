This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. I understand McDonald's and other fast food places aren't going to have top quality food to begin with but honestly my experiences have resulted in inedible products. I went once and it was awful and my chicken was rubbery... I thought it was just a one-time mishap and tried again a few weeks later. Same issue.\nEverywhere I've gone with a McDonald's has had the same typical McDonald's-tasting French fries too and yet those don't even taste normal at this particular location. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
