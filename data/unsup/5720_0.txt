I love their ocean water drink on a hot day. My tots were fresh. I basically stopped for snacks. The wait time was very long just for a drink and a small tot. We waited at the drive through window for about 10 minutes. The tots were not extremely hot as if they pulled them fresh out of the fryer so I have no idea what took so long. Their prices are reasonable and the cashier was very polite.
