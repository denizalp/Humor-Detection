I was quoted 7am my vehicle would be ready. Very rude tech looked at my truck said I wasn't here yesterday and that it isn't ready and we don't open until 7::30. I have an appointment that I can't be late for. They had my truck for 5 hours +overnight and I spent $600 to have it detailed. Not acceptable\nFollow up after my review I am impressed how hard management is working to make this right. Randy is making every effort to make up for the mistake.
