We see Dr. Bernick for a rare genetic and terminal disease. The facility is immaculate. The care is state of the art. Our family member is treated with respect and care. He is currently in a gap of non insurance and the charitable foundation has seen to it that he receives care during this gap. For those who fund raise, donate time or money, we are grateful.
