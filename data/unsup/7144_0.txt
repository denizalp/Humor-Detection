The dumplings are delicious. It is a small restaurant. Prices are very reasonable and the food is cooked fresh. It is worth the Uber ride. For those looking for a fancy place, this is not the place but it is still worth the visit to eat good food! The staff is polite and lots of locals frequent the location. They are open 7 days.
