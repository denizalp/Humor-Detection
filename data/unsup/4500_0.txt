This is the BEST restaurant  I've had the pleasure of experiencing in Arizona, hands down. This is always my choice for my Birthday dinner. Outstanding service, steaks, and dirty martini's! Pricy , but worth every penny. The only reason Maestro's gets only 5 stars from me, is because I don't have the option to give a perfect 10. Thank you for reading :)
