Leshii  I was feeling all fly looking like peshii \nWanting something to eat that was freshii \nIt was good and so so tast-shii \nInside was gush-ii but outside was leaf-ii \nIt had beans, cheese, rice and shit-akiis \nI had to get it down my deep throat like my name was lex-ii \nOne pump two pump three pump and it got mess-ii \nSo juice-ii that it stained my kha-khiis \nI was satisfied the long thick wrap was in my bell-ii
