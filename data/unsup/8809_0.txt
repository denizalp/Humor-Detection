2.5 stars.\nIm pretty picky with my sushi, so here it goes.\nHad the sushi deluxe lunch special for 25 bux.  comes with 12 nigiri, shrimp tempura maki, miso soup, salad.  Of course its chefs selection, of course no Toro.  The sushi varied in freshness, the sushi rice was not warm, but slightly cold.  Wasabi was not freshly grated.  It was by all no means bad, but also no where near perfection, which would achieve 5 stars.  Pretty good value however.  Free hot green tea.
