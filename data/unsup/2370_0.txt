23$ for a Whole Kouign Amann and 21$ if you order it in advance! \nSo i ordered one friday to start my week on the right track - speaking of desert of course - and Kouign Amann is crack cocain: IT'S ADDICTIVE!\n\nIt's so good, I Wish I could plug it directly to my vein! ;)\n\nYou need to try that, It's awesome on a terrasse (patio) to have a piece while drinking a good beer.
