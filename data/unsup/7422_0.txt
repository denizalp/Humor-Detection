bought 2 tickets for this adventure and only  came to realize that the place has closed when we arrived (my bf and i walked from the strip -_-). The zipline is closed  from Dec 21-26. I bought two tickets on December 22 through vegas.com and never was notified that they had closed off the Zipline. It is unprofessional to be selling ticket on days they knew the Zipline were closed. I would rather drive to Mexico to Zipline than try this attraction again. I would not recommend this place.
