This BBQ house is located inside FMP food court. There's a reason why they always have long line ups. This place is a true example of \"cheap, looks good AND taste good\" food joint. Ordered the duck chicken rice combo which includes a soup. After tax is $6.75. They filled up the box with rice. Totally worth the wait and price! Highly recommend this place if you're craving for Chinese BBQ!
