Tried this place for the first time this past Sunday! My co workers and I had a ladies brunch here. Service was exceptional! And the food.... My god! So good! I got the apple French toast. We love trying new places and this was a good one! And of course we had cocktails with our brunch. We had a great time. Our server was awesome. Super friendly and fast! We will for sure be back!
