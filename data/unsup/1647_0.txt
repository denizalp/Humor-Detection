If you are looking for a place to store your items in the west valley this is the place!!! We moved cross country in the middle of the AZ summer with our entire house. You can't beat the indoor climate control and cleanliness of these units. The pricing was great as well. Jeff was very helpful before we arrived as well as during our 5 months there!! Security is top notch as well.
