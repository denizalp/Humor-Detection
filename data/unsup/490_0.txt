THIS. PLACE. IS. HORRIBLE!\n\nPaying $38 from groupon is not worth it all!I will never recommend this place and will never come back.\n\nI wasn't satified at all so I only gave $5 tip. But, when I handed the $5 the guy told me the minimum is $10 which mean good service. I was so surprised cause everything's wasn't good at all and asking me to give $10 for good service is unacceptable.
