On a business trip & Hotel Palomar was closest to the office\n\nLoved the funky, fun atmosphere - modern & eclectic \n\nRooms were quiet; bed was comfy; water pressure was awesome; fridge included\n\nFree Wifi\n\nFree morning coffee downstairs\n\nThe valets were fantastic w\/ directions of nearby coffee shops, lots of closeby restaurants which was perfect for bringing back takeout\n\nThis would be my #1 choice of hotel when coming back to the area, for sure
