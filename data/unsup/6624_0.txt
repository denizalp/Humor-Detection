One of the two places I would trust my car with in Champaign\/Urbana. Honest, reasonable, and skilled. Peter and his team always get things done in a timely manner, and without adding additional unneeded services to your bill. In a town full of shady garages, it is a wonderful change to have Peter B's around whom you can trust.
