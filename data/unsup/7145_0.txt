love LOVE Ghost Bar. \n\njust recently discovered this bar and i'll probably be back everytime i venture out to sin city. \n\nroof top bar with a killer view of the strip. good music to dance to. dj is spinning mostly hip hop. from the 80's, 90's and now. drinks are poured heavy and priced very well. i paid $8 for my captain and diet. good deal! especially for trendy vegas nightlife. \n\nneed some fresh air?  just step outside and get blown away! and one time, i really almost did!
