A winner in Old Town Scottsdale.  Sure it is a burger place, how good can it be? Well, I am telling you it is pretty darn good.  \n\nThe vibe is a laid back kind of beachy shack, not huge with half of the seats outside. We had a great waiter who was helpful, friendly and checked on us often.  \n\nGood happy hour. Decent beer selection and the burgers are legit!  I had the hatch burger on the pretzel bun (beyond yum) and fries.  I loved it completely!  \n\nReally fun, laid back place.  I would come back!
