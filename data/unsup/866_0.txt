Okay.  Not the best.  Not the worst haircut.  They totally screwed up on my hair coloring job.  \n\nI can often get much better haircuts for much cheaper.  Was worth a shot based on all the glorious reviews.  Seems most reviews are so hyped up.\n\nThe staff here seem a little racist if you are not white.  They give you dirty looks.
