Amy and Sammy were about as good as it gets. Amy was a magician in the kitchen, her food was the equal of sex. Sorry to see them go. I wish the best for them, I know they wished the best for there customers. Good luck on your next endeavors. We hope to meet you and savor your great food once again!
