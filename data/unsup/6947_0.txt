I recently worked with Maryam of Maryam's Cakery for a 40th birthday party and I was blown away. She understood the vision I had for the end product and had great recommendations to make it unique. The cake was just as we had discussed, if not more impressive, and was really delicious. I also got to try out some of her french macaroons.... OMG. So airy and delicious. I will recommend Maryam without any hesitation and I will also be quick to use her services again when the occasion presents itself.
