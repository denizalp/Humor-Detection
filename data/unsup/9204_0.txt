I'm beginning to think that Undefeated is more show than substance.  They have some cute brands and some decent retros, but you can tell that their inventory is very limited.\n\nThe store has a boutique feel so don't expect racks and racks of gear.  Don't expect to find strapped Blazer Lows either.\n\nYou'll find whatever retro AJ's came out that year, but you won't find hard to find pieces.\n\nIf you're serious about AJ's, then the only place to shop is Flight Club.\n\nProve me wrong...
