Been curios about all  your reviews here on yelp, so We decided to try and see it for ourselves. Yup! @ midnight craved for a sisig. So disappointed w\/ the sisig's taste. You're right! it was a \"mr mushy\" drowned in a cooking oil. I know u own an oriental store but GEEZ slow down w\/ cooking oil, even if It's on sale. Stop using the Filipino name when ur not even Filipino. Just sayin-
