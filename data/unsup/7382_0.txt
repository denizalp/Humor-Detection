Please tell me what I need to do to have you guys STOP calling me. I didn't buy my Camry from you guys. I had an oil change one time and had to wait almost 3 hours and that's with an appointment! Anyway I don't care for your service. I've been getting numerous telemarketing calls and each time I requested that I be place on the DO NO CALL list. The calls are originating from out of the States....they don't have a clue of what to do....they don't even speak proper English!
