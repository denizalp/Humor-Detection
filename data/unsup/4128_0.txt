Had the best dinner here last night. I can't believe there are bad reviews on this place. Service was wonderful prices were great and food was excellent. We had salt and pepper squid for an appetizer and their spicy noodle and Pagang curry duck. The food was spicy and flavorful. The iced tea was delicious and all that came to $33. I want to drive out of my way to eat at this place more often.
