Pizza hut! Oh how I love your online ordering system when I refuse to drunk dial for food :)\n\nI can't complain. My pizza is always good and delivered on time. You all know what Pizza Hut tastes like, so I won't go into the gooy greasy goodness factor.\n\nI refuse to eat Papa Johns, Little Caesars, or Dominoes (gag me with a wooden spoon). Utilize Pizza Hut's online or even texting system. The estimated time for delivery is normally longer than you really have to wait. 30 minutes and pizza is served!
