I came here for lunch today with two friends and one small dog. Love that they allow dogs on the outside seating. I had an absolutely awesome burger, friend one had a Cobb salad, and friend to the shrimp tacos. Everything was really really good. One of the best burgers I've ever had. Only reason I didn't get this five stars is that the hummus appetizer was really awful!
