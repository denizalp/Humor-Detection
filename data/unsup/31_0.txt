Not worth going there anymore!!!!!! First of all, their senior stylist Lynne is no longer with the company, and none of the other stylists are up to her level. Second of all, it's so expensive and you have nothing to show for it. Why is it $100 for a simple wash and wear? Thirdly, the products are not only greasy as hell but they are expensive! Save your money and don't waste your time going there! If you are trying to track her down feel free to send me a message!!!
