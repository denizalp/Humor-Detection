Love the food. Hate the service.  The delivery is terrible (takes forever to get to your house) if there is even a driver working. If you go in the restaurant, you have to wait about 20 minutes to get your food and there is only two tables.  \n\nThis guy took over Columbo's on Danforth before it shut down. He increased the prices a lot at this new place and gives worse service. Doesn't make sense.
