Hollly YUMMM.. Thumbs up all around.. We ordered the pork bone soup (because everyone raves about it! And was not disappointed the bf LOVED it), spicy pork on rice and a veg soybean stew (note: they were super nice and modified this dish for me since I was a vegan! It was very delicious and hit the spot). I am definitely coming back here the next time we are in the east end!
