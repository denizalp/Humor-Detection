I am definitely a fan.  Very good thai food that is reasonably priced.  Not way overpriced like Basil Thai is.  Do not get me wrong, basil thai is very good but very overpriced.\n\nSome menu items here are better than others.  In general I like all of the curries (green, red, jungle curry).  Also, the chicken cococnut soup is very good.
