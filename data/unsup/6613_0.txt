The show was everything and more than the girls and I hoped for. Granted, I went in thinking it was a showed filled with lots of hip thrusting. But there was dancing!And hip thrusting! And music! And role playing! And more hip thrusting! And audience participation! It was cheesy at times, but I do enjoy cheesy. I would recommend you go if you have not seen it and don't forget to invite me!
