It was our good fortune this past Saturday to have Bridget as our waitress.  While all the servers are friendly and efficient, she was exceptional!  We've always had decent meals here and this visit was no exception. What was extra nice was the fact that they completely redid the interior seating area and the exterior fa√ßades.  It definitely looks more homey!  My only complaint is that they added TVs.  There is no need in a family restaurant for TVs.
