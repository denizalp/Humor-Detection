I'm very disappointed on their burrito portion. For over $11, I'd expect more. Hell with that price at Chipotle I'd get way more than Fat Bastard. With that name Fat Bastard Burrito is more like Little Bastard Burrito.\n\nI ordered the Huge Specialty Roasted Steak. Found out that the roasted steak is shredded and to be quite honest there's no taste, unseasoned, and blend. Yuk!  The one and only thing I like about here is that they don't charge guacamole whereas Chipotle do. \n\nI've been having good meals for three weeks but this place has to ruin it.
