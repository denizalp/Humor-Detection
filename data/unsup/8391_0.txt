Solid four stars.  Really fresh bread, low prices, delicious grilled pork and excellent staff.\n\nThe place is a little off turning to the eyes, very neon and gaudy, but the sandwiches are right on the money.  Not the best Grilled Pork Sam I've had, but up there and definitely worth the drive and the $2.50 is costs.\n\nIt is one of my American dreams for Lee's Sandwiches to replace every McDonalds in America.  Now to replace Olive Garden with Oreganos...
