Think itialian fast food.......not amazing, not expensive, not bad. The one \"must have\" thing this place has is the bread sticks! Wow those are tasty little guys. Good spot to grab a quick meal of pasta or lasagna. (they have a drive through too) If you are short on time, and like my self, cant bring yourself to eat Mc Donalds or Burger king this is a great alternative but probably still not the most nutritious place in the world.
