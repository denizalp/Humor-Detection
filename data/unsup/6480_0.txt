Shelley with Crazy4paws is an incredibly reliable pet sitter. She's great with her visits as she communicates, follows instructions, and of course always stays the duration of expected visits. She builds personal relationships with her 4 paw'd clients as well as their owners. My 2 dogs whom can be a handful consider Shelley as an extension of the fam.
