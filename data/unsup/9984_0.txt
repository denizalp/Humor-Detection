Came here on a whim because I had the intense urge to look at fuzzy animals.\n\nI was completely amazed and pleasantly surprised by the vast variety of different animals they had available!\n\nWe saw the following:\n\nBaby Bunnies\nGuinea Pigs\nFerrets\nA Puppy\nKittens\nHamsters\nRats\nMice\nBirds\nSnakes\nLizards\nHedge Hogs\nChipmunks\nTarantulas\nScorpions\nAnd a Monkey!!\n\nThey really had something for everyone. It felt very family friendly and I liked that in order to come in if you are under 16 you had to have a parent with you.\n\nIf you're looking to add a new addition to your family I would 100% recommend this be your first and final stop!
