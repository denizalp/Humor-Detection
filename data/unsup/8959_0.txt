This was the best experience I have had in Vegas . The instructors were great. The course was great. It was really hot like 107 degrees. They provided us water and snacks. They didnt have issues with taking videos and pictures for us. Danny our driver picked us up from our hotel he was very sweet and nice and made us feel welcome. If you are considering this. Just do it. You will not regret it. Was worth every dollar!
