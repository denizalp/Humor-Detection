Classic handbags.  I love that they always retire their designs, so it prevents too many duplicates on strangers.  Always fashion forward, with edgy designs and materials.  The selection of each department are endless.  I absolutely love the sunglasses and costume jewelry.  My other lust are the elegant beauty products-when I whip out my compact, I manage to feel like a million bucks, for just fifty.
