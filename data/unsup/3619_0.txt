Our family has been to Yogurtini many times, just not since I have become a yelper. If your looking for awesome froyo with a ton of toppings, this is your place. Like many froyo locations they have sample cups to try the variety of good flavors. I personally like the basics (vanilla and chocolate). The place is very clean and business here is always pumping. If your looking to beat the heat this is your place.
