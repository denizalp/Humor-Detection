I was looking for a casual place to kill time since I was waiting for an appointment. I'm so glad I chose to come here. I've been wanting to try a poke bowl for a very long time, and they did not disappoint!!! Everything tasted so fresh and the atmosphere is calm and clean. Exactly what I was looking for. Not to mention it's a wonderful price for what you get. Also, thank you for your kind associates who were very helpful! I will definitely be back soon!
