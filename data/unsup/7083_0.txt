Went for a much needed haircut\/hair makeover after a bad haircut I had gotten at another salon. I ended up with the best haircut I have ever received! Bella was my stylist and she listened to everything I wanted (keeping the length, getting some volume at the top), and she did it all! I was extremely impressed with her skills. I also really enjoyed the vibe of the place- very relaxed, good music, and friendly staff. This is my new permament hair salon! Thank you so much! I would highly recommend this place!!
