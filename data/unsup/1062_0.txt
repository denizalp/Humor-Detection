Heinz Field continues to be my favorite NFL stadium.  It creates a great fan experience with awesome shows and giveaways, informative staff, organized entry and exit, no lines longer than 7 minutes for both vending and bathrooms, and the place is clean! Thank you Heinz Field for making game day so much more appealing!!!
