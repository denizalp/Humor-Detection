Da Chicago Dogs & Subs, dey make a freakin' mean Chicago style dog ya know?  I had one der fer lunch and it's still tasting good at 5 o'clock.\n\nNice selection of toppings and a pretty good variety of subs.  I dropped in here in leu of visiting a chain nearby.\n\nI'm not sure about the name, I guess if you imagine a George Wendt ala SNL voice with it...
