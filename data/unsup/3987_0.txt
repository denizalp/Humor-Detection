Buy one pair get one half off.  And two pairs we did buy.  One pair for my Mom and one pair for me.  \n\nThis place was jumping busy.  Lots of sales staff helping find sizes when needed.  I did have difficulty finding my size in stock but was pleasantly surprised when I found my size for a pair of multicolor peep toe heels that screamed my name.\n\nHello shoe addiction and hello new pair of shoes, welcome to my home, treat me well!
