Too bad we sat for 20 minutes before getting a server. This was after going inside after 10 minutes and complaining with the promise of sending someone right out. Finally flagged down someone serving another table (that had arrived 15 minutes after us). How hard is this? Part 2 - person with the little dog and feeding it from the table - what next.
