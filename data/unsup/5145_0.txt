I'm an avid firefly food-lover so I was happy (oh, and my stomach was too) to find out that they didn't close down. They literally just moved down the street! The new place looks great and service was awesome! And, most importantly no change in food quality! \n\nSame great food but new and improved place! Where all the locals go and you can chill with friends over tapas and sangria! What can be better? Definitely a spot to hit up during your stay at Vegas!
