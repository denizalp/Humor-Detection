[in stream-of-consciouness style]\n\n           -----\n\nMiega Korean Barbeque??  now open???  Nice!!\n\n[walking up the stairs, and upon looking inside]\n\nOoohhh... restaurant pretty.\n\n[reading menu]\n\nhuh??  confusing.\n\nwell... all the Korean basics are here... Bulgogi, Galbi, Bibimbap.  they have hot pot too; cool.\n\nthey have Korean Barbeque; it's not the grill-it-yourself kind.\n\nwell, i guess i'll go with the ol' faves-- bulgogi and chap chae.\n\n[panchan arrives]\n\nweak.\n\n[order arrives]\n\nhm... portions are a little smaller that what i thought they'd be.\n\nchap chae is tasty though.\n\nthe bulgogi is just okay.\n\nall-in-all--  it's 'aight.
