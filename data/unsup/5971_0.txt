Super irritated with the lady working the counter. Maybe she didn't hear me when I said hello since her glaring stare pretty much started the 2 min interaction extremely uncomfortable. Or maybe it was the question I had about the blizzard that confused her to state at me yet again in complete dismay but oh my do I never want to see this lady again. Either she was incredibly out of it or she was just THAT rude...whatever the case never want to see her again.\n\nDarn too cuz we love the blizzards.
