The terrace is worth it. This is a nice place to come for some drinks and a light meal, the drinks are good and not too expensive, and the food is acceptable, although more in line for brunch than a full on lunch or dinner, lots of salads, and crepes. My one complaint is about the live music, while I love live jazz, it's often so loud in the enclosed terrace, that it can be hard to speak with table mates.
