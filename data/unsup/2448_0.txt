Having visited this place over the years I've had a chance to sample much of the menu including pasta dishes, salads, sandwiches, and desserts and have had only one dish that I'd rate I'd rate under a 5.  The Philly cheesesteak is made with grilled rib eye and hands down the best cheesesteak I've ever had.  Most menu items can be ordered full or half, if you have a way to store the food for your next meal, for a nominal increase in cost it's two meals for a few dollars more.
