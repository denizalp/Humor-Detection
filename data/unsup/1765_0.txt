My best friend got married here. Everything was great, the ambiance the ceremony and the hall. Plenty of seating, easy to get to, great location, and they got a decent deal also. \nThe only thing we were disappointed about with our experience was the photographer and the number of photographs allotted per package. Keep everything but get a new photographer.
