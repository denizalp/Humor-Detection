I have received a letter from the zoo apologizing (and a refund) for the rude employee. I am not satisfied in that I felt like I wasn't believed that the employee used derogatory remarks in front of my child but I will never return to this Zoo again, will tell everyone the experience I had let people know that if you have children then going to the Phoenix Zoo is not a great idea since you might be called a bad name in front of young ones.
