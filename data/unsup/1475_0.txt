AVOID THIS PLACE!! I was originally going to rate this place 3 stars but after I posted my review of this restaurant on Instagram whoever runs their social media became very very very petty and gross. It's not my fault I hated the spicy chicken, I did state that I loved their beans though. I rated everything fairly in my opinion, but they reacted very very badly to criticism. Never going back there again they're childish as hell. Under this review I linked my original review and my interaction with them along with what they posted on their story.
