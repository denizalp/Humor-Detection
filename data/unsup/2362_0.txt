House Spouse is a wonderful cleaning service that I will continue to use!!!  I initally contacted them because they offer both house cleaning service as well as carpet cleaning.  They did a fabulous job in a timely manner.  I came home to a tidy and fresh smelling home.  I have two dogs and the carpet cleaning was very well done.  Casey is very professional and they can accommodate any of your cleaning needs.  Call them today!
