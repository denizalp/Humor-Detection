Easy Living in Swizzle Inn.  A great dive bar to hang out.  Bring some friends and settle down for a night of drinking and and and... drinking.  The locals seem nice enough and the whole place has a lot to take in, from the funny bumper stickers decorating the inner bar area to the dudes playing pool and I think I saw Golden Tee in there or was it The Claw?? Hard to remember, like I said, settle down for some drinking and more drinking.
