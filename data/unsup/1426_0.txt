PROS: \nMouthwatering sashimi. The squid was zesty, the texture firm and rewarding. Both the California and Alaskan rolls were EXCELLENT. The caviar was divine. Cozy booths in a traditional setting, with the sushi chef in plain view. The price was reasonable - around $5 per item.\n\nCONS:\nThe menu. Why does the menu not stay open? Folding back the pages of this menu is like curling a 10-lb weight. Also, the salmon sashimi was a bit bland.\n\nIf not for the menu, this sushi would have scored a perfect 5\/5 clams. As it were, 4.5\/5 clams. - TV
