Delicious food! Tried the burger before & it was just as great as before as was the Philly ~ but the fries are SPECTACULAR!\nMy favorite kind (hard to find) seasoned perfectly steak fries cooked through so they're crispy & not greasy - yum!!!\nAdorable kid working there is a business owner in training & does a great job. \nKeep up the Good work! With so many choices in the area it is quite competitive so I hope they'll be around for a long time.
