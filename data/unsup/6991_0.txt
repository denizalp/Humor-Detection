This restaurant has the worst service I have ever experienced. First they have the birthday month discount and they wouldnt bother giving our table our discount because we would have to split the checks or so. They also spilt water on my cousin and didnt offer to give us discount for getting her clothes wet and all they did was change the water not even clean the table for us then they stated we dont like the way your behaving please leave
