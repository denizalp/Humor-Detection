Was expecting more for the price that I paid, don't get me wrong my 20oz T-Bone still had flavor although I asked for it to be cooked medium, but unfortunately it was overcooked to just about well done, shouldn't have asked how I wanted my steak if I was going to be served what the chef wanted to serve me. Oh well, won't be back there when I hit the strip again.
