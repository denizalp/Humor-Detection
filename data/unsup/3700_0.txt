I know it sounds crazy to go to Vegas when you are a one trick pony gambler and not a very fancy one at that... Keno is our game. It is low risk if you know how to play and I not too many casinos have it anymore. We were so happy to find the Flamingo had great big leather seats with high backs to kick back and play. \n\nThey do close at 10pm though, which forced us over to Bally's to finish playing, but that was okay, we enjoyed what we could while there.
