Harper's Roofing was one of the easiest and friendliest companies I have ever worked with!  From start to finish Tracye answered all of my questions via email or phone right away!\nWe just had our a shake roof from 1979 removed and a shingle roof put on.  The price was very fair and the work looks beautiful!  All of the work was done on time (the whole process only took 4 days) and the workers did a great job cleaning everything up each day.\nI would highly recommend Harper's Roofing to anyone!
