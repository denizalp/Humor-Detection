4 woman musical show, centered on \"the change\", supposedly enjoyable for men, but not so much for me.  I found several funny moments, but it could have been about half as long and made it's point.  The hot flash jokes got repetitive after a while.  Some of the numbers (mostly adaptions of 80's music) were excellent and well sung, others were just ok.  If you get a discount on the tickets, it's probably worth it to see what they're talking about.
