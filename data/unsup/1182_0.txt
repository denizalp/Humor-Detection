Had wanted to file ch. 7 about a year ago and I made an appointment for 1:30pm.  Well, the girl at the desk couldn't come in to tell me at 1:50, that the God, DeLuca Himself, wasn't back from lunch yet!  Apparently my time isn't worth his time.  Don't see DeLuca and assc.  ALSO: 9\/17\/2015:  This is all my personal opinion.  There is no slander involved in my opinion.  I am editing it b\/c I am being 'sued' for free speech by the law office.  This is fact.  Everything else is my opinion.  Enjoy.
