Don't go.\n\nAfter I went through all the comments below I decided to give it a try, but soon I realized it's probably a fraud. First that place is super hard to find and when you did find that old, broken, dusty, in-the-middle-of-no-where shop, they will told you the price is $100 and you can't use the discount provided on yelp cuz it's already after discount. If you were as stupid as me to go there alone and don't dare to walk out after entering, congratulation you are robbed. They did like nothing and you feel really bad.\n\nDon't go, seriously.
