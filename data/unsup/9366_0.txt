If you are to lazy to go somewhere to get good Chinese food this place will do in a pinch. We only order when we are lounging home to lazy to go out. \n\nHot and sour soup is passable. Egg rolls are too thick and greasy. I'm not a fan of their pot stickers way too much dough. \n\nMost dishes such as fried rice and lo mein are good. Just don't expect high quality beef dishes meat tends to be tough.
