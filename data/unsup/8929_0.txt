Great place to pick up a slice for lunch under $5 for slice salad and soda. I dined in on Saturday afternoon and the first thing I noticed was how nice the staff were. Every person working this day smiled and double checked we had everything we needed. Dining is relaxed with no frills but the staff were constantly keeping busy and cleaning counters. Nice to have Barros in the neighborhood.
