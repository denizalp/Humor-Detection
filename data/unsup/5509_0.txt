Cute little confectionery at the start of State Street we came across while en rout to the university. Stopped in for one chocolate cone and one praline and caramel cone. Very rich flavors. Priced at nearly $5 for one scoop, I was a little alarmed but, what are you gonna do? Shrug*. They also sell chocolates, fudge and caramel apples. Samples are available to try.
