This place is the most authentic Vietnamese food in the Richmond Hill\/Markham area. Service is quick and staff are very friendly. Currently they have a couple of grand opening specials on their menu as well as 10% off. Highly recommended (and this is coming from someone who grew up on Vietnamese food)!
