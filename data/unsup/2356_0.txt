I did enjoy Eggslut. \n\nWe ordered the egg sandwich with bacon. The bun was super soft that you can sink your teeth into, but it was overly buttered. I could do without the slather of the butter on top of the bun because it's literally on every square inch of the bun from inside and out.\n\nSo the sandwich is greasy and delicious at the same time. \n\nA small freshly squeezed orange juice is $5. \n\nI wish they had late night hours, but they close around 7pm I think.\n\nLocation: 2nd floor of Cosmopolitan
