I had this company come quote me and the sales manager came to my home to give me a quote and he was unbelievably rude and had no idea how to treat potential customers. They are very high priced in comparison their competitors. Check out the shade shop, blind man, or louvre shoppe. All are much better options for window coverings. They have no local management which in turn makes it very difficult to deal with them.
