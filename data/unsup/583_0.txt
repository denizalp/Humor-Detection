They no longer have the fish cakes..I must say I was disappointed.  Calamari was good but didn't arrive hot . My husband loved his blackened fish taco and tomato bisque. .not sure if we will be back..im kinda the stick to what I like person, and they took away the fish cakes..horrible move in my opinion!
