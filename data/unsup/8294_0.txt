Eaten here twice, delivery both times.  First time was really good, hence the second time.  Ordered the italian beef, chicago dog, and fries.  It took over an hour and a half to get here - called the restaurant after an hour and the driver had been pulled over.  They supposedly re-made the food and sent it out again, but the dog was cold and the fries were old.  I called and spoke with the manager who basically said too bad.   So, in the end, I guess decent cheap food, but no concern about customer service.
