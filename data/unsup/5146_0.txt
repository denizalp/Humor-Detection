Fantastic experience! I went for a pedicure! Everyone was super welcoming. The guy who did my pedicure was very good. He kept making sure I was ok with everything from the water temp to the pressure of the leg massage. Very affordable. The only thing I needed was a cocktail to make it more relaxing! Very clean and the smell of the lotions and scrubs is wonderful. Not like a normal smelly nail salon. Even the music was relaxing. Highly recommended!!! I will go again  for sure!
