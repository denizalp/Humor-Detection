Huge portions-I was happy to split a meal with my mom. We had a Chicken Club salad-which was more than enough for both of us. Came with a croissant too...just to make sure it wasn't TOO healthy of a pick.\nMy husband had a club sandwich and devoured it-and we had a side of mushrooms-because mushrooms are good. And they were.\nMy dad also got a side of carrots-which the one-year-old was very excited about. Nice place...but there are too many other places out there to go again.
