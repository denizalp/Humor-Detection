I used Super Duper to move my furniture from one house to another 2 weeks back, the team came on time  8 am, worked hard to complete the move within 7 hours estimate although there were pretty heavy stuff like Piano , i recommed them if you are looking for good service with reasonable price , Brandon , Mo and Stan Gave us peace of mind you would expect from movers when you are stressed out from the  move
