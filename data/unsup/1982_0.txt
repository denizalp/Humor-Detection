I haven't eaten at El Hefe, but, judging by the food, I don't think I'd want to. The drinks here are rough....neon green margarita mix.... nothing fresh... mixed by scantily clad girls. If you want to listen to loud music and look at girls, this place is fine... if you want quality cocktails...try elsewhere.
