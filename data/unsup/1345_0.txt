Moved from Sunnyvale California to las vegas NV,\n\nTalked with CC,  got an estimate (they gave me the best price).\nOn the move day the we're on time and did a great job handling my stuff.\nAll my pictures, TV 's and delicate vases etc got to our new house in same way. The service was great, the job was done excellent and the price was great.\nHope I don't move soon but if I do American homeovers will for sure be my choice.\n3 thumbs up !!!!
