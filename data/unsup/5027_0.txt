This place was AMAZING. We had the vegetable cake for dinner and it was simply heaven in our mouths. Every component was delicious. For dessert, we decided on the special of the evening which was a peach torte. I don't even like peaches but I loved every wonderful bite of the tasty treat. We will be back!! Thank you Chef Fox!
