This place is so good and so infuriating. \n\nThe food is just... it's SO good.  Get the panang curry and add crushed peanuts.  The crab rangoon is fantastic, as well.\n\nWHY DON'T THEY DELIVER?!  Don't they know I'm lazy and not wearing pants?!\n\nAND WHEN ARE THEY OPEN?!?!?!  I swear this place is only open from like 4:00 am - 10:00 am on the second Tuesday of every February in the year of the tiger only cause half the time I call them they are closed.\n\nI LOVE YOU SO MUCH, THAI ME UP!  BE EASIER TO ACCESS!
