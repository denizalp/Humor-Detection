The check engine light came on of the BFs car so we came in for them to read the code. It's fairly simple, quick and free to do at Autozone. \n\nThey read the code and then printed us out papers of what it means and items we might need and parts that they  have\/ can order and those that they cannot. \n\nThis was way more painfree than asking your stealership to read your car and get hustled for a handful of things that they tell you the car needs.
