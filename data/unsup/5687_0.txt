Our first stop was in this restaurant for having lunch. Before start eating, I visited their restrooms.... and that was a huge mistake! OMG... was so dirty... no paper towels, the sink was clogging and so dirty almost everywhere.... and keep in mind that the restroom is right next to the tables....i think that i lost my apetite :( \nAbout the meals... all the plates that we tried were below the average. I am sure that Cleveland has better restaurants than this one! They definetely care more about your money than the food that they provide.
