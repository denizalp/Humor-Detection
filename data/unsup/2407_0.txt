Lovely place with attentive servers. Strong drinks with a fun atmosphere. We had a half lobster for an appetizer that was perfectly acceptable and a cheese platter that was delicious, and the bread was a winner as well. The Paella was the winning dish. Large enough for two and delicious. We each had a cocktail so we skipped dessert. Lots of fried chicken and French fries passed our table, so lots of choices for all ages. I would definitely bring out of town guests here.
