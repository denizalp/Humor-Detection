Was out shopping with a friend before going to see a movie. It was 106 degrees outside so we first stopped at Starbucks for some iced drinks. Out drinks both had lids.\nUpon entering Ross we were immediately asked to throw out our drinks or leave.\nWe left.\nIt's 106 outside in Phoenix, AZ. Ross is located in an OUTDOOR strip mall. My drink had a lid on it. I am 30 years old, not some obnoxious child.
