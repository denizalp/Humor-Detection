A fine place to pick up addictive Sonoran staples, or, if you dine in,  hepatitis.  I thought this was supposed to be the \"nice\" location, a step up from the gangland locale, but it's jammed with junkies, disgustingly dirty, with all the ambience of an Okie squatter's camp from \"The Grapes of Wrath\".\n\nThe original on Mohave is cleaner, less crowded and even with bulletholes and security bars over the windows, really quite charming compared to this.
