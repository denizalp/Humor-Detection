Really hit the spot for something sweet after a great dinner and a lot of walking about. We got the Congo dessert crepe with bananas and Nutella. Don't forget to lick the plate. Not bad for $13 bucks. \n\nOnly real negatives are that there's only one crepe batter option and it's pretty doughy\/sugary.
