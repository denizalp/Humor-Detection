I visited this place during lunch special time with my wife.  We ordered $10 lunch special.  My wife ordered beef with hot soup.  I ordered lamb with curry soup.\n\nThe restaurant does not look any fancy and nice.  However, the table top warmer was good and the lunch was incredibly good.  Also we could bring noodle, additional veggies and sauces from the little bar.  The meat was fresh and the soup tasted good.\n\nThe visit surely changed our best Chinese restaurant selection in town.
