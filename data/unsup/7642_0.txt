Recently bought a pool table from Diamondback and had a good experience.  We were helped by Dakota. He was a good guy to deal with; gave us a quick education on tables and didn't waste our time.  The delivery went according to schedule. The guy who did the delivery and set up of the table was great. You could tell he was a master of his craft. The table looks great, is perfectly level and I have no complaints at all.
