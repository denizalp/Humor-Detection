My girlfriend got her phone stolen here tonight and nobody at the club had any idea of how to go about this situation. None of the bouncers have been trained or informed of any protocol. This is one of the most unprofessional clubs I have ever been too. I have read of reviews warning of personal items being stolen and now I am convinced that this place is not somewhere I would like to visit again.
