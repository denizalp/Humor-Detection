They accommodated us even though we didn't buy the groupon and just called if they could honor the rate. Was definitely a good deal and perfect for killing time or a visit after going to Brew Tea Bar. I was so tired in the afternoon that I completely fell asleep during the foot massage portion. You lie in a pretty comfy couch and the last 30 mins you are just soaking in the ion machine. Was definitely worth $18 for the full hour. Will come back next time!
