Great chicken with amazing source! I honestly never tried Portuguese meals before and I will say the chicken really catches my tongue. And my roommate said the egg tarts were amazing as well, I personally am not a big egg tart fan, but you guys can trust my roommate's taste.\n\nI ordered the 1\/4 chicken leg meal as you can see in this picture, some egg tarts, a cream cup and a diet seven cup, everything add up to about $20, and I've already decided to take one whole chicken to go next time.
