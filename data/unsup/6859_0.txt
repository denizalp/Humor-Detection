I've never had a truly good experience at Popeyes. So when this new location opened up near my house, I decided to give it a try. I set the bar low because I wasn't expecting much. Glad I set it so low because it was truly awful.\n\n1. There were flies flying around\n2. They advertised a Ramadan special even though the chicken is not Halal (I'm not Muslim by the way)\n3. They wouldn't honour a promotion\n4. Had to wait 10 minutes for fries\n5. Chicken was incredibly salty - all you could taste was salt\n\nWill not be going again.
