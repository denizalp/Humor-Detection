I am not a fan of corned beef and started to say no, but this was actually a quite good lunch sandwich. I split my lunch as I don't eat that much and it is nice to not see a HUGE sandwich that most of it is just wasted. \n\nIt may be just a very basic sandwich but it was done right and all of the simple things were done correctly.
