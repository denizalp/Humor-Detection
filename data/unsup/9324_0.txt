Two words: FURIKAKE CHICKEN.\n\n\n\nAlso, their poke is by faaaaar the greatest in proportion, taste, and freshness. But definitely order their furikake chicken, and if you're a small gal like me, definitely bring a friend to share it with because they will give you a look if you dare try to box something up. Haha. The only downside I can think of is that it is 25 minutes away from my house and not open late enough! I love this place and I love bringing people here!
