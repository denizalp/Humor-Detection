My favorite thing was the brownies and cookie dough!!! The cookie dough was very creamy and soft!! You can order a cookie dough scoop and add frosting and toppings!!! My favorite frosting on is the amaretto frosting with chocolate chips on top!! You should definitely go to Cinnaholic if you want a sweet treat!!
