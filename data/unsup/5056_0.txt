Store was not able to see me before closing though I had an appointment at 8:30 pm. So I made an appointment for this morning and here I sit beyond my appointment time waiting with lots of people ahead of me. Thanks to them, I can write this review using their wifi. They run this place like it's a doctors office. You should be thankful that we are allowing you (me) to be seen - maybe.
