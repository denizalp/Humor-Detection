Some background: Dentists are my sworn enemies. \nSeriously. They are the Green Goblin to my Spider Man. \nBut. I have decided after visiting this place that we can be neutral. \nI went for my first visit here, after avoiding the dentist for (censored) years and was put at ease from the first phone call. They are great!!!\nEveryone is smiling, friendly as can be. \nGreat office! Highly recommend J&L.
