Another great pizza and italian food restuarant!!!! Thin crust, tasty and smooth sauce. Just how I like my pizza to be. Good New York style. I have to tell them light on the cheese. Also, the baked ziti is great. This place is in the same area as Grimaldi's so it's tough to choose where to go, but we go here the most. Atmosphere is nice with tables and 3 TV's, self service drinks and friendly staff.
