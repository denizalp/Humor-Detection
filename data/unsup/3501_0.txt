Loved our experience here. \nThe industry has really stepped up its game, not a bad seat anywhere. Additionally, so many viewing options other than straightforward seats like skydeck or the various club house type areas throughout  the arena. The food and beverage offerings were top end as expected.  Would DEFINITELY reccomend a catching a Knights game if your here, it was incredible to experience a packed arena going nuts..
