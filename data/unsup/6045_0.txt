We used to love to come to this restaurant and came often, but recently had a terrible experience with the owner, Anita. After a long back and forth with a number of customer service gaffes, Anita told us that her motto is \"the customer is always wrong.\" I'm not sure she knows which industry she's in, and we will not be returning.
