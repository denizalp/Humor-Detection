This place sucks customer service.  I had to get a window replacement and representative was rude from the beginning.  Like I was putting her out by helping me and it wasn't delivered when promised.  And as for the installation, it was a different story, the installation guy was rude and called me a Bitch because I didn't want broken glass in my home.  I was also told that my bill would be adjusted, but never was.  Not happy with this service and  definitely not recommend this place
