I can't believe I'm the first to write a review on this place. This place is tucked away behind a butcher\/grocer called Segal's. I went for lunch and ordered a calzone. My wife ordered some slices. Though the ambience was very plain the food was delectible. Definitely worth going.\n\n***I've noticed that recently they've added sushi to the menu...hmmm.
