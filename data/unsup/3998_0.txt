Great local whiskey selection! \n\nWe went here a couple times as we were staying at the Delta Hotel, where the bar is located. \n\nThere are cocktails, beer and wine as well, aside from all of the whiskeys, something for everyone! Although there are a few appetizers on the menu, I recommend you eat first and come here for the drinks. \n\nIt appears smaller than it is, as there are additional seats past the bar. The bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable.
