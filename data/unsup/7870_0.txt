great atmosphere and coffee selection -- both beans and methods -- and knowledgeable staff.  lots of cool little quirky attractions that make this a real coffeehouse instead of a coffee chain\/shop like vinyl records and an upstairs with little rooms and the kitchen of what actually used to be a house popping out yummies.\n\nthe Ethiopian Y. was exceptional --Â the most fruity\/blueberry aroma i've had so far in tha'burgh. \n\neverything done right.. should get an extra 1\/2 star for going above and beyond the call of duty.
