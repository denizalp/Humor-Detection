Pretty weak for the price compared to Bacchanal just next door.  We went to Bacchanal a few days ago and it is night and day compared to this dump.  Everything from service to food to atmosphere don't compare.  If it was half the price it might be worth it but unless you stay in the hotel and get the buffet for free don't come here.
