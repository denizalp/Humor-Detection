Am I in steak heaven.... but they don't just have amazing steaks their damn calamari is LIFE TO ME!!!!\n\nYes, I know calamari.... here I am thinking it's all about the STEAK..... no people, this is the best calamari ever.  I know I should be telling you about \"What an amazing, juicy steak I had .\" \n\nNope, I had the calamari which was brought to my table with a side of horseradish and a mayo tater sauce that was  devine.  The calamari is lightly fried with jalapeno.  It's so good. \n\nDon't judge me fellow Yelpers!
