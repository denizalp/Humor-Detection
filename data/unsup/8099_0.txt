I dropped off my suite for a cleaning and a press. There was a tie left in the pocket by accident and they decided to charge an additional fee for cleaning and pressing the tie. My phone number was located on the work order. Instead of contacting me, they just added the fee. I do not like to do business with organizations that change the contracted fees once the work has been done. This is a dishonest business.
