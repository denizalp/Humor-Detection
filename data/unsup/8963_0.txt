Great food for a great price! Even the regular shawarma is filling. The large one is all I need to be full for a while! Ive had a chicken shawarma as well as a beef shawarma and  both were great! \n\nIve also tried the Lazeez on the rocks and thats great as well. \n\nOverall the place has great food for a great price.\n\nMy only complaint would be the wait time. After you order you wait a while for food but since the place is so busy i can over look this.
