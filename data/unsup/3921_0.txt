Yup, yup, yup!!  Another great diner!  Meat and two veggies.  Great breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner place.  Always a fine value, but nothing amazing.  Capable and satisfying, but not especially significant.\n\nI would not hesitate to take any friend there, and yet it wouldn't really occur to me as an idea, either.  Does that make sense?\n\nA block behind Woodlawn... on the Bojangle's side.  McKoy's Smokehouse, around the corner on Old Pineville, might be a better choice if you're looking for something more memorable.
