Another hidden gem I wish I could dislodge, and bring it back to Milwaukee with me. \n\nMove over waffles & dinges, wafflelonia is my true liege. \n\nCrispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, with a good balance of sweet and savory. The texture just blows my mind. LOVE IT! \n\nI've been trying to figure out their recipe for a while now, and I think one of the ingredients is sugar.  (keep it on the down-low)
