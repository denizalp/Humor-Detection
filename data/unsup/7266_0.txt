A great new addition to the neighborhood! \n\nWith the opening of Downtown Summerlin I was ecstatic to learn this store was coming! \n\nI don't always get lucky with my finds here but typically I always find something! This trip got me a great pair of black pants, a suit top and an adorable lip necklace. The prices are great and I didn't have any luck with shoes but I'm still a big fan! \n\nThe store was clean and hopefully it stays organized. I look forward to many future trips.
