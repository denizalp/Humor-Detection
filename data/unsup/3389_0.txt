My witchy friend pointed this spot out to me, I must have walked by it a thousand times without noticing this tucked away piece of magic on St.Denis. The variety of quality stones in here is remarkable, tiny stacks on every available surface. There are also white and pink salt and crystal lamps, singing bowls, totem stones and a couple pretty pillows to round out the mix. There's also a lovely collection of turquoise and amber and silver jewelry. The service was warm and kind a no pressure. Happy to have discovered Pierre's D'ailleurs!
