Pleasant stayed and good experience during  our 3 day stay.\nOne of the continental breakfast ladies was super friendly and shared a great positive attitude. \nIt's clean, basic and affordable for the area. \n\nIt has a little gym and a small pool with spa, but they're clean and enjoyable. \n\nI would have given it 5 Stars if I didn't think that the carpeting and floors could use a good upgrade or deep cleaning through the hallways and perhaps the rooms.\n\nOtherwise, it's a thumps up
