I don't know how this place is still open. Although the prices are good and the location is pretty good, its not even worth the effort. The food is decent, nothing spectacular. I love Mexican food and I had a really hard time finding something that sounded appetizing. The worst part about this place is the service. The service is not only slow but I believe all of us got our orders wrong. The waiter was 0 for 5. I would not recommend this place to anyone but if you enjoy wasting money, give it a shot.
