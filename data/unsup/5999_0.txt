Stayed here last May, when I was apartment hunting. \n\nPros\n- Location. Location. Location.: In the heart of downtown Charlotte (or Uptown).\n- Comfortable rooms. \n- About 15 minutes from\/to airport. \n \nCons\n- Checkout at noon. They can extend it until 1pm and after that, there'll be $50 charge. \n- WiFi fee unless you're a member. \n- paper-think walls.\n- Outdated room.\n\nThree and Half Yelp
