Places I DON\"T shop:\n1. Places that make me check out my own groceries (like Fresh and Easy)\n2. Places that make me pay to shop there (Costco, Sam's Club)\n3. Places that make me bag my own groceries (Fresh and Easy and Winco)\nGive me a break. Whatever happened to customer service???\n\nOur family tried Costco for one year and decided that we were nuts to pay to shop here.
