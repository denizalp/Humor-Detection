I haven't eaten at this place in years but when the name came up on my Yelp home page, I just had to put my two cents in.\n\nThis place is food poisoning in every bite.\n\nNot surprised to see another reviewer had the same experience because after weird and wonderful stomach bug # 2, I decided to boycott the joint (despite it being one of my family's favourites). \n\nThe shawarma isn't THAT good.
