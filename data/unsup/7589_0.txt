After watching the show on Wisconsin Foodie, I decided to look for the shop in Black Earth and found it right in Madison. Bought a thick piece of bone-in ribeye steak and the owner told me how to grill it. The meat itself did not need much seasoning at all. The taste was exquisite and we are convinced that from now on I will only get the steaks and other meats from here. Highly recommended.
