Eat the Thai Muscles. Imagine a silky coconut broth with spicy thai chilis and muscles. There is something magical about fishy food and Thai flavors. It was awesome.\n\nI also had the Salmon Tartare and it was decent. It tasted like your standard mixture of raw salmon and capers. You can find better places to eat but the combination of beer and food is excellent.
