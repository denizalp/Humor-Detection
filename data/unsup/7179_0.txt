When we just moved to Scottsdale from Colorado few months ago we couldn't find Soo Bahk Do studio anywhere in Scottsdale area, so my son had to switch to Taekwondo. \n\nWe were kind of worry little bit on the beginning, but after couple weeks our son loved it so he stays.\n\nMaster Kim is a great instructor and he is a bit funny as well, so we often laugh when we watch our son practices. Another great instructors are Matthew and Peter, they have so much patience with the kids.
