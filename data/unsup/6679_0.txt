I've only managed to eat here twice, and after the second time, I was reminded why. \n\nThe decor is good, the service is friendly and the food is very tasty. Unfortunately, I happen to need to use the restroom in a VERY urgent way after eating here. \n\nSo, for me, although it's good - the after effects just aren't worth it for me to continue to eat here regularly.
