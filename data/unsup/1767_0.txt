Yes to all of what Melissa said. Come to Champaign Jamba Juice.\n\nPlus, within the last month, Smoothie King raised their prices. They're nuts! A large Angel Food smoothie is now over $8. A medium is over $6 and a small is a little under $5. \n\nThose are full-meal prices if you ask me. Not blended fruit in a Styrofoam cup. Ahh, more shit for a landfill.  Very healthy, right?
