This was the worst show we have ever seen in Vegas, or possibly anywhere. If you're looking for magic, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for comedy, you will be disappointed - unless perhaps you are an 11-year-old boy... or if you REALLY enjoy gay-bashing. Save your money. DO NOT SEE THIS SHOW. I cannot believe it is still running in Vegas! It was so uncomfortably pathetic, no one in the whole theater was laughing. If you're looking for super-raunchy humor in Vegas, check out Anthony Cools: The Uncensored Hypnotist.
