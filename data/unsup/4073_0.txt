If you are in the Mayo Hospital ya gotta eat here...I don't mean that as a quirky suggestion...it's a fact. You Must eat here, there is nowhere else within walking distance...unless you are a long distance runner.\nbut it's clean.\ngood selection.\nthe staff doesn't speak much (though it IS a cafeteria)\ngood place to eat if you only have one choice.
