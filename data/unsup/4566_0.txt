It's your basic taqueria. It's food isn't the best but it does the trick when you're hungry or hung over. I usually go for their numero once which is 3 rolled tacos, beans and rice. Always a good meal when I'm starving or their carne asada fries which is so huge I can never make it halfway. They really should make a half order of this monster. But its' always delish and by far the best in town. Prices are more than reasonable and workers are friendly.
