I am a BBQ fanatic! I love all the different types across the country. With that being said, this place was the WORST \"barbecue\" restaurant I have ever eaten at. The ribs were dry and chewy, the sauce was horrendous and the fries were soggy, but they were the highlight of my meal. The atmosphere was like a prison cafeteria, my wife and I thought we were going to get shanked and robbed, very sketchy place. To this day when I see this place, I get angry. I'd rather eat out of a dumpster behind a good smokehouse...
