I went at like 10:30 at night so it wasn't too busy. I got the 6 donuts that the employee chooses because there was so many choices! So far I've tried the S'mores one (5 stars!) and the Fruity Pebbles one (4 stars, it's kinda heavy and not as fluffy). The employee working at the counter was very nice as well.
