I came on a Friday morning. In and out in less than an hour. Very pleased with that. \n\nMore importantly, I came for a second opinion on what I believe was a missed diagnosis elsewhere. Although I am here for a requested follow, on a Sunday, I feel we are on the right path to fixing a potentially very serious problem. \n\nStaff, nurses, doctors and medical students were very friendly and very helpful. I cannot complain at all about this service.
