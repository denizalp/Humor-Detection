Decided to take a morning walk\/hike in one of the best parks in Vegas.  This park has a lot to offer right in the heart of the Mountains Edge community.  \n\nThey have a huge field, play area for children plenty of parking and a small mountain with several trails to the top with multiple views of the city. \n\nThis is a great place to bring the family and they also have several events here on the weekends.
