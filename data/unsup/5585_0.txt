Has a very cozy, modern tavern interior which I loved. The service is good and so are the drink selections. Had a nice glass of red wine. We also tried the mac and cheese and it was really great. Came with jalape√±o and mozzarella baked under a very crispy seasoned bread crumb crust. Price range was very reasonable and includes drink options on both higher and lower costs\/quality. Overall quite happy and will return!
