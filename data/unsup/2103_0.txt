Gigi watched my pomeranian puppy for 1 week. She is the best! She sent me pictures and updates  daily and treated him as her own. He was very happy and was playing in her backyard. The house has plenty of space for playtime. I would definitely use her services again and I would recommend her to any of my friends.
