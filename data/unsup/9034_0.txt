I dig this place!  The pizza is a little crunchier than I like and the crusts are inedible, but it is still pretty damn tasty.  And the ambiance is fun!  Stand in line with other drunk people. Scream the lyrics to some 80's hair band song. Eat some pizza, play some pinball.  It's fun!\n\nThey have PBR and Stone IPA on tap.  It can get crowded but they had plenty of pizza to go around when I came.  Check it out!
