I highly recommend Safeway driving school.\nI enrolled my son in the driver's education course and he had three driving lessons with beau. I am so happy with this school and the staff. I feel very confident that my son has gained the skills to be a safe and responsible driver. Thank you Safeway driving school for helping our teens become independent, responsible, and safe drivers on the road.
