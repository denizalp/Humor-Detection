I would of given this a 5 at the old location.  Ever since they moved this store really sucked for me. At the top of a burger shop this places always makes me wanna yell. Its to crowed in this small place. They should get rid of the coffee shop near the front to have more room. Like I've said before the old store had so much room and cool stuff inside. This place is just horrible.
