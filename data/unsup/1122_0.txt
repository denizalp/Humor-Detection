My husband took my daughter to eat there on January 11th and my daughter was burned by their pizza. I called the manager the following day to let him know because I wasn't sure if the waiter notified them, I was told that someone was going to call to make sure that everything was ok and till this day no ones has called or contacted me in any form. Everyone be aware specially if you have young children their temperatures are ridiculous they gave my daughter a 2 degree burn in her hand and no one in management cares.
