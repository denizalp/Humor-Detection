Amazing burgers!!! The place is small and seems hidden. It is not located in a food plaza so not many people know about it. Burgers are fresh and delicious. Service is excellent. I tried the apple butter BBQ burger and it was delicious. It is a must go place if you are looking for halal burgers. I would recommend this more than burger factory or hero burger.
