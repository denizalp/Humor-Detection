Went here for the first time after checking out reviews and pics. Went with an Italian and chopped salad combo. The salad was good. I was so hungry I didn't look at the ingredients as I am not a fan of olives and banana peppers. The true star on my plate was the Italian sandwich. It was sooo good! The bread was very fresh and delicious too. Highly recommend the sandwich! Next time I will try the gobbler
