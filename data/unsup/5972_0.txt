I'm sad to have to write this review! I have many fond memories of Wah Fu's growing up and have eaten here many times. I will still come here but narrow my selections down to a few items. My sister found a wooden bristle in her food, the manager said it was from the brush that they use to clean the wok. My Chicken Sub Gum was not so good, the fried rice was flavorless. I ended up with Egg Fu Young and it was decent. The waitress was great and the staff was friendly.
