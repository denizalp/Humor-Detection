I'd like to be able to say this was a bad dining experience, but we never able to dine!  The waitress saw us sit down, then NEVER came to our table!  We had to ask for a menu and then she proceeded to wait on 3 other tables that arrived after we did!  We were so disgusted we went next store and ate delicious Mexican food with outstanding service.
