This was OUR hotel from the early 2000s.  It used to be fun, lively and sexy with the dancing waitresses.  Now it seem old run down and doesn't have the mojo any more.  too bad because i was comfortable here and knew all the crap dealers and some of the waitresses.  WTH is up taking away parking spaces in the back and reserving for locals.  Not cool.
