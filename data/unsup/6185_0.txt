Wow. Employees who should be working r pumping money into the juke box playing music. When customers who are paying to keep the lights on have to wait 2 hear they're songs. The server just informed me that ill have to wait 8 plus songs to here what I played...I'm a paying customer. Really WFT. Someone  needs 2 fire this bitch. Oh wait her sister is the bar manager. That'll never happen. Hey jimmy and bob wake the fuck up and clean house. Your shit is gonna go down hill.Demographics   have change
