This is a must go place for breakfast and lunch. The detail in the bakery items, the flavors, the selection give you plenty of options including options to take some home and bake them yourself. The croissants and pies are exquisite and so flakey. Order the prosciutto and fig sandwich! They have a wide variety and great option for catering! Love it!
