Finally made it here after living in cave creek for 2 years. We were excited about checking it out. The space is well designed and cozy. Unfortunately that's where it ended!  Upon arrival the bartender was unfriendly and admitted he was \"half in the bag\". When we asked for a specific type of wine type of wine and he suggested \"coors light\". We put the attitude aside and found our own bottle on the rack. Enjoyed the wine and talking with the couple next to us. Other than that, we probably won't return.
