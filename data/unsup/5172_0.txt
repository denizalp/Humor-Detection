This is the only Ted's location outside of NY, so my friend was super excited to try it out. He'd grown up eating it, but it was my first time ever stepping into a Ted's and eating one of their dogs. It was everything my friend told me it would be.\n\nI added mac and cheese to my dog and that made it so delicious. The onion rings were crunchy and flavorful. I would definitely come back here again. The loganberry drink is so good - not too sweet at all.
