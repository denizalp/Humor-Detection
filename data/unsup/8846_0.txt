We found a hair in our food. Our waiter, Ray, was very condescending. I showed the manager the dark black long curly hair in our food. She was mortified. Ray came to our table and said \"it's your lucky day.\" Really?! No. It's a shame the service is so crappy because the food has always been good (when there isn't a hair in it!)
