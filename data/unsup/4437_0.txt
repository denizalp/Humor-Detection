I like and probably prefer a dive bar over high end stuff, but this bar is different...it exudes class.  The view is awesome...you're not too high or too low, just kind of hovering over the strip on the 23rd floor :)\n\nIf you're a girl and I ever ask you to go here I must have a crush on you cuz it takes a 2nd mortgage to hang out here hehe.\n\nGreat for a special occasion, or just drop by to check out the view.
