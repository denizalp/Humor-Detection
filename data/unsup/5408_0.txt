meh.\nThe omelet was kind of boring although the potatoes were tasty. service was good  and the food came out pretty quick. out drinks were kept full. outside seating was a delight! \nThe hubs had a biscuit sandwich and the biscuit was a little flat, he opened it and ate the meat inside. he enjoyed his hash browns.
