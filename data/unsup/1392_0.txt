I hired Nappsack Photo for a family photo shoot and it went great. Mr.wayne Jung was very professional and made me and my family feel so comfortable. He took some amazing photos, and exceeded all my expectations. I have all ways had a problem showing my smile and he cracked a couple of jokes and got one out of me. I plan on hiring Nappsack Photo again, and I have recommended him to all my friends and family.   Thank you Nappsack,  Sincerely Horne family.
