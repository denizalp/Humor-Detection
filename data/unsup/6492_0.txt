Never heard of this place till yesterday. And just found out we have one closer to my house! Anyway, loved the prices for what you get. It includes drink, fries and sandwich or chicken tenders. What a great deal! I was pretty impressed by the chicken, was delicious and the sauce they add one was yummy. I am not a fan of eating chicken at fast food too many food poising but this place was A+ I will be going back again! Oh try their tea!!! I fell I love with their tea.
