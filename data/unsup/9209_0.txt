The pho here is really tasty . The mango salad is amazing as is the pad that ! I love there fried tofu aswell , it's probably one of the best I've tried .\nAtmosphere is nice as the place is clean .\nI've been here a few times and never had any problems with food at all everything is always tasty . The service can be a little slow at times but that's ok asking as your not in a rush !
