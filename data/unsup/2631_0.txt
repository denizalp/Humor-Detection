Yasssssss! Beijing Duck. It is soooo yummy. \n\nA little fatty duck + pancake + hoisin sauce. Heavennnnnn. The drunken fish and Mr. Chow Noodles are phenom and always a must. \n\nYou can bring your own wine but if they have it they will charge you list price. \n\nService is fantastic and the moving art fixture thingy above you is pretty cool. : )
