Awesome place where you can have fun while sharing a meal and drinks and listening to live music.\nThere are two pianos and three or more players... so they alternate and take brakes to keep you entertained.\nThey welcome all song requests and will sing most of them, well probably not most of them since they can get lots of requests... but they will sing lots...\nIt is a very fun place to go and have a great time!
