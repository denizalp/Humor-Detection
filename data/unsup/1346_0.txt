I don't really know why I was stingy with the stars the first time around. \n\nI love the Doughnut Pantry and I'm not afraid to shout it!\nThe people here are very nice, efficient and friendly. They'll get you in and out in a hurry and they'll remember how you take your coffee if you're in there often.\n\nDonuts always fresh, good coffee and good service. Really what more could you want? Nothing. 5 stars.
