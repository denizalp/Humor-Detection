El patron is not a very good choice when you are going for Mexican food,the variety of dishes is poor the staff is worse.Waiters    with no skills and very poor English to rations that are way too small and overpriced food is Mexican enough for the all white clientele that dares to go there pitiful and pathetic half star is more likely.
