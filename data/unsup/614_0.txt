Ah, I feel like Homer writing positive reviews and getting everyone fat. This place is so good. Favourites: chocolate, chocolate with hazelnut, and cookies and cream. The staff is friendly and will let you try many flavours before picking one. Supposedly the owners are very careful to keep their recipes a secret. Love it.
