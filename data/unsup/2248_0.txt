3.5 stars. the bf LOVES this place and kept recommending it \"it's so delicious; best, super authentic beef noodle soup; my friends and i all love it \" but then again - what does he know? \n\nservice is average. food is expensive for chinese, but cheap for vegas. szechwan beef noodle soup is actually surprisingly awesome and i'd give that ONE dish a 5.... but all the rest is maybe a 2.5\/ 3.... tea bags for the tea, sad grayish siu mai... and the kimchi is good, but $$$. \n\nstick to the szechwan beef noodle soup!!\n\n7\/30 yelp challenge
