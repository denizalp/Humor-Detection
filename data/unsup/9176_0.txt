I really enjoy the food at Chick-fil-A but this particular location is always super crowded, with wrap around the building twice lines! \n\nTheir saving grace is that the lines move fast with the help of the outside personnel who take orders, direct traffic and keep things moving smooth! \n\nEven with the chaos and lines they still manage to offer great hot food and service with a smile!
