I loved this restaurant from the cute location in Old Town to the casual and yet with-it decor.  We started with the freshly sliced prosciutto.  We had the tagliatelle bolognese which was tasty like it came directly from Bologna.  My daughter had the grilled salmon which was delicious.  The owner and the waitress were friendly and genuine.  This is a great restaurant.
