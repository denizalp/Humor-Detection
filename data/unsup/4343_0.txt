I went to this show for my bachelorette. It was the BEST. Nearly lost my voice from screaming so much. I had to pick my jaw up off the floor several times. The guys are very \"interactive\" with the audience which is a plus. Nathan and John were my faves. It was classy, not trashy. Major eye candy all the way. Loved it! (Drools)\nP.S.- if your lucky enough like I was to get the aisle seat in the front, you won't regret it and you'll see why :)
