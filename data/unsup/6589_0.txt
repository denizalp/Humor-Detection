Mikey is wonderful, took  a drawing I made for my husband's forearm of his mothers cancer ribbon with cancer colors in it, he tweaked it a bit made it very cool, and we love it. Mikey is an amazing artist, and the shop is exceptional. He has also done a tattoo on my mother in laws chest, it turned out more elaborate and detailed and beautiful than we ever could have imagined. A+ for Mikey, shop, staff, all the way around!
