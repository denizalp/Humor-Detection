Their customer service is not good, but i think they try. Ill give them that much. They are also slow on orders and slow to refill drinks. Their food does have flavor, but I am not sure the prices match up. \n\nBut hey, they are definitely different than your average fast food pizza place. They have unique menu items. Their ice cream\/gelato is good.\n\nThis place has a lot of potential; they need to step it up.
