I've been to this location twice, and both times have received really good service and advice. I am not a professional when it comes to packing and shipping, but they advised me of all options available to me and the type of package being sent with a reasonable price also! \n\nThey have a lot of other items in there too, like candles, MP3 players, PO boxes, packing boxes for moving, and lots of other little miscellaneous items.\n\nI'll definitely refer friends and family and coming back here myself!
