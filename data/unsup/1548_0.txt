Big bar that goes around the Casino. Its ambiance is nothing special but the namesake of the bar gets you to notice the place. Around the bar is lots of space so in that respect it is comfortable in terms of lots of personal space but usually bars are more about being a cozy hole in the wall where you can drink without feeling that you are on display. Don't worry tho, the people glued to the tables and slot machines are not going to judge you or count how many beers you've had.
