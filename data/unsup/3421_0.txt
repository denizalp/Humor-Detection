Rolled into this place at 10:50 tonight - store is listed as closing at 11.\n\nGuess what? All the chairs were packed up and the door was locked. The store closed at LEAST 10 minutes early, since everything was all in a row\/figured out\/etc by the time I got there.\n\nNOT happy. If your store is open, you fucking stay open. End of story.
