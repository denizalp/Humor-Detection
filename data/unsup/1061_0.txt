You guys. Do not sleep on this place. It's kinda tucked away and never has anyone in it, so it looks possibly sketchy but holy CRAP it's good. Where do I even start? The curry was fresh and sharp. The thai poutine (mine was w\/ peanut sauce) was AMAZING. The chicken wings were hearty and seasoned perfectly. \n\nI will be BACK. It's best for take-out, on your way home from work or whatever. There aren't a lot of seats. Folks need to step 10 paces from National and The Ship and try something new. It'll change yer friggin life.
