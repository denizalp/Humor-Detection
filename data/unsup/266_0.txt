It's a Walmart superstore, so there Is nothing new here to explain. Everything from camping gear to goat cheese under one roof.\n\nPretty helpful employees that are willing to help you find stuff.\n\nBut how hard is it to open up some more checkout lanes? No matter what time of day, morning, noon, evening, or middle of the night, ther are no more than 5 registers open, and most of the self check out kiosks are off or not working.  There is always a line, which means you always have to wait, no matter how many items you have.
