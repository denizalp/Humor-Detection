This has become one of our regular after-church places.  Their skillets are great.  This is an old-fashioned, family owned cafe with tasty yummy comfort food that we have enjoyed for years.  Prices are very reasonable for the quality you receive.   Coffee is always hot, service is prompt, and the portions are generous.   I love their two egg skillets.
