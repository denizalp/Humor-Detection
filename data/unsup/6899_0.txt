This bar is pure crap. A friend and I were in there for less than 10 minutes and were harassed twice. They have big ugly thugs watching the doors. Oh so welcoming. Not. All the red (even the pool table felt, ugh!) made us nauseous. Ignore all the spammy 5-star reviews. The only people who'd enjoy this bar are douche canoes. And, as a nearly-native Milwaukeean (does 12 years count?), this bar is NOTHING like Milwaukee, or Chicago. Puhlease.
