I'll have to agree with Huy N. - the pho broth is delicious! Also, this restaurant serves the best banh xeo I've ever had. While the menu list may not be as extensive as those in the venerable establishments like Pho Thanh, there are definitely enough offerings to satisfy any aficionado of Vietnamese cuisine. The restaurant is spacious, the service is friendly and parking is not a problem even if this is located in a small strip mall, in the space formerly occupied by Dong-A.
