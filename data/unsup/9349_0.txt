Awful\n\nSlow. Rude. Noisy\n\nWe could not talk to each other without screaming.\n\nFood was brought out separately so we ate one at a time rather than eat cold food together.\n\nHostess was a smart butt\n\nThe food was good as was the wine but offset by bad service and atmosphere.\n\nAvoid at all cost
