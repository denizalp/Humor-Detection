So we made an Appointment for our kids to get their haircuts today @ 1230... The Barber cuts one of the kids hair, but tells the other one he has to wait because he has to cut a females hair that had an appointment after them, because he came into work late..... That's not our problem that you didn't get to work on time playboy, we made an Appointment with you to provide a service...I think what you've done here is unacceptable and a NASTY way of doing business...
