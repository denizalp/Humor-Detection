Good place to go!! A large and good variety of toppings. The flavors highly depend on your taste. For me there are a few I really like, but many I don't like too much. But you can try them, just ask for it. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Still didn't figure out the price for it, they just weigh it and I pay. But it seems like the usual price. The location is perfect to stroll around with the ice in your hand, either along the street or along the river.
