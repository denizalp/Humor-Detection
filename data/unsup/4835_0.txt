When you first walk in this place looks pretty nice like it belongs Scottsdale but when you start working out you notice this is a very small LA Fitness compared to the others and with a lot less equipment.  I was there on a Friday morning at 10:00 so I didn't have to wait very much at all for equipment but I can imagine during peak times there has to be a lot of waiting going on.  The locker room was also pretty small but was clean.
