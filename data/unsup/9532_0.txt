I was there for 4 hours waiting ... and I was not attended ... when I arrived I was immediately paid for the copay .... in the end I was disgusted, I lost my money and my time nobody attended me ... only there were 3 patients before me ... I arrived before 10 am and I left at 2 ... I'm still sick and they took my money! ... do not go there !!!
