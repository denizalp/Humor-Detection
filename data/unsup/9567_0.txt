Have not been there in years and it seems like this is true for every one else.\nI should have know this was not going to be a good experience when there were only three tables seated during the dinner hour. also overheard the barmaid say to our waiter \"Well at least you'll have more than one customer tonight\"\n\nWife' seafood platter was cold when served, my prime rib was tasteless for other than salt. even the home fries with gravy were to salty to eat.\n\nonly good thing was the homemade Banana Cream Pie.\n\nwon't make this mistake again!.
