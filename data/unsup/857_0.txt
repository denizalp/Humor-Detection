My daughter attended Pre-school through 2cnd Grade at CMA.  We had an excellent experience with this school.  We appreciate all the staff there, especially Mrs. Hood and Mrs. Cecille.  Using the Montessori Method, CMA gave my daughter a strong foundation in all subjects.  The curriculum there supports building character and confidence, teaching critical thinking, and always incorporates faith as the underlying most important current that runs through all of our lives.  I recommend this school to anyone who seeks excellence in education and values conservative family morals.
