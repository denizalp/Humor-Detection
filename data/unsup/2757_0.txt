5 star for the gluten free fried chicken--excellent batter and moistness and better than the signature chicken watermelon and cheddar waffles with bourbon maple, which is good but not better than bouchon's chicken and waffle. ok dessert, Mac and cheese, fries-- 3 star\nfried chicken still enjoyable \nbacon and okra nice and churrasco with eggs pretty good
