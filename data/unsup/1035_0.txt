Took the Parent & Teen Introduction to Pistol class. I was very impressed with the facilities. It is well maintained and organized. Classroom is large, comfortable and well equipped. Range is state-of-the-art. Our instructor, Randy, was excellent both in the classroom and on the range. He made the kids feel very comfortable and at ease on the range.\nWe will definitely be back for classes and range time.
