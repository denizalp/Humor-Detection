This review is for the sick temptation that is unfortunately around the corner from my house.\n\nWhataburger aka \"worldwide conspiracy to grow my ass\".  I never was a burger person before... but you've managed to suck me in.  Bravo, sir.  Bravo.  Thank you for the extra hours I will now have to spend on the treadmill.
