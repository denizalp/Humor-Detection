Feels more like a local bar with a face lift than most of the ASU area bars so I really had a good time. The regulars are super friendly & fun, fun. So if you're looking for a chill place to hang, watch a game, chat up some friends this is your place. The staff are adorable & helpful to boot. Enjoy!
