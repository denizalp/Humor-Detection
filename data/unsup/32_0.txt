Beautiful hotel and rooms, great service. My main complaint is the ride share...not many signs so it took forever to find and there is not coffee maker in the room...its 16 for a pot to be sent up, 7 service charge and 18% gratuity so we ended up going to Bouchon for coffee every morning...much cheaper
