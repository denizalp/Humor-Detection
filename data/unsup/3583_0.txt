have gone there a lot...most recent visit however was less than stellar...had my usual ruben...really have liked that sandwich...but this time..the ingredients were of poor quality...fatty fatty meat and tough...the goodies with it had a different flavor and kind of bland...the service...wow...down the can..rude, rude, rude people taking orders.\nNeed to work on that a bunch.
