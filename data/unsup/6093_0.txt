Oh NAMI!!!   I love you so much!  It's hard to even convey in words how much I love it there.  I'm there for Nami Sunday brunch almost every other week and it never disappoints.  Nami is the best vegan breakfast \/ brunch place in existence and I recommend it highly to not only vegans, but to anyone who loves good food with a nice atmosphere and friendly, hardworking staff!  On a scale from 1-5 stars, Nami is an 11!
