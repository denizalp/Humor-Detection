Just when I thought it was over between us, you pull me back in. When I found out about Dunkin's $0.99 medium coffee deal from 2-5pm (thanks to a fellow Yelper!), I came crawling back shamelessly. Aside from the great deal, the afternoon is prime time to be at Dunkin. The angry mobs are all caffeinated by this point so I'm in and out within a few minutes. Seems like I'm remaining a Dunkin patron for a little while longer. Hey, anything to save a few bucks right?
