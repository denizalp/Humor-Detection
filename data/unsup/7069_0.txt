An experience I'll never forget! The staff was great. I was nervous about it in the beginning, but they answer all of your questions throughly and in the nicest way! It was my first time indoor skydiving but definitely not my last, especially not here! It's great fun for all ages. Don't think you'd be too scared to try it out, the idea of even INDOOR skydiving freaked me out a little bit, but they make you feel so welcomed and safe after learning all the safety precautions. Don't skip out, it's too good to miss out on!
