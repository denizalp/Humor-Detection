Amazing staff and food. Sunday brunch specials are fantastic and always different. Had a cornbread french toast and a pork cheek potato hash that was very rich and savory. The onion jam with noble bread was also very tasty. The balsamic cut through the sweetness. It's also nice to get proteins like their fried chicken that are free of hormones and other junk. It makes the chicken smaller, but it tastes a lot better.
