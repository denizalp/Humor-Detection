Someone told me their patties are the best in town. That person was very mistaken. Not only is this not the best, but the food was subpar compared to many other Caribbean restaurants i've been to. \n\nThe best way to describe this place is hole in the wall with acceptable food in large portions. If you judge quality by the amount you get, then this place is a solid 3.5 stars.
