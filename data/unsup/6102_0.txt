I have rented this home from waypoint for 2 1\/2 years! I have had nothing but problems with both the management and the home! We have had 4 issues with plumbing and more recently our air conditioning went out during a heatwave in October and it took more than eight days for waypoint homes to fix the issue! Absolutely the worst possible corporation to rent from!!!
