Great place and great beer. The tree in the courtyard needs to grow to provide some shade but that's a side issue to the beer which is why one goes to a brewery. Eager to try the brown ale which ran out prior to my arrival at the brewery.  They offer free samples without attitude or cost. Overall a great small brewery with lots to offer.
