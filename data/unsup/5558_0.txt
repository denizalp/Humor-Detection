I love the Tap House! I enjoy every Monday night here. It's very \"Old School Vegas\" and I love it. With a live band every Monday night this place gets unbelievably packed. You have to literally reserve the chairs or your not getting in. The owner Jimmy is such a sweetheart and always takes care of us when we come in. Not to mention the food is great too! Flowing wine, live music and a dance floor you can't go wrong here!
