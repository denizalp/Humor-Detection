I paid $3.50 for the world's smallest macchiato. I do not typically feel a need to add sugar to any caffeinated beverage but THIS, there is not enough sugar in the world to make it not taste like a big ball of dirt. \nTo make the experience even less enjoyable, we just sat and listened to a yoga instructor tell someone her tendons have PTSD. I don't think she knows what that actually means. Possibly one of the most pretentious places ever. Gluten free muffins are delicious though so at least there's that. Get the muffin, leave immediately.
