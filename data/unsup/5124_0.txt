If you've skied big mountains before, you'll probably be disappointed.\n\nIf you've never seen the workings of a ski hill before, you'll be amazed. \n\nPretty much, COP is a hill covered in mostly man made snow. They have Alberta's only superpipe (22' halfpipe), a large terrain park and not too much else terrain.\n\nIt's cool since there's a cool Olympics vibe still happening, plus very tourist friendly.
