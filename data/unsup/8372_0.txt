This place is first rate. Great service, great food, great drinks. Also the prices are very reasonable. A very casual place with fresh ingredients, an open kitchen you can see the cooks doing their magic and a bar where you can see the great coctails being ceeated. Not a large place and we had reservations for an early Saturday evening. Our part had their market burger, 3 meat bolognese and gnocchi. Everything was great .  We'll definately be back.
