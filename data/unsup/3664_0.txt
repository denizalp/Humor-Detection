Wish I had looked at yelp reviews. The second floor terrace looked so enticing but don't let it fool you because unless you get a seat next to the street it's not nearly as cool. Service was slow and food was extremely bleh good think we just got an appetizer. Bruchetta was soggy, mozzarella sticks were what you get frozen at grocery store but the potato chips were not too shabby and they were homemade. Drinks were ok but nothing special nor strong. Two stars just for the upstairs and making the chips homemade but that's about it
