Vegas has some of the coolest Museums in the US. We try to visit one on each trip. This one is a real treasure as it involves the retired neon signs from the famous hotels along the strip and beyond. There are also wedding chapels and other famous and not so famous location signs. The museum has fundraisers and renewals of marriage nuptials, we hear Valentine's Day is a big day for these sorts of things. This place is worth the trip to see these vintage marvels!
