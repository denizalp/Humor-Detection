We went to Scottsdale over the 4th of July weekend and got a chance to eat at Paquime after a round of golf. The place is small but cosy and very clean. You order at the counter and they have several offerings including: sopes, tacos and tortas. I had the torta ahogada and my wife had the sopes; both tasted fantastic and the price point was great. We finished off with the tres leches cake which was equally great. I will definitely return,
