Went to dinner here with my husband and another couple 4\/1\/16 Food was amazing! To start we had Artichoke dip, filet bites and pretzel bites for appetizers... All Delicious! We could have just had that and all been happy. For main entree I had the filet paired with Freakshow wine and both were fantastic! Will definitely be going back again!! SOON!! Very soon!!
