Looking for overpriced underwhelming tacos?  Then this is your spot!  This place has a lot of the hipster lifestyle down.  It's more expensive than you think.  When it's all put together it's kind of a mess.  Most of us would rather look than experience.\n\nThe drinks are weak and the food is bland.  Most of their hot sauces would barely make the Scoville scale and do even less to add flavor.\n\nThe great news is the layout and patio.  This place has some real potential, but not until they redo their recipes and rethink their drink prices.
