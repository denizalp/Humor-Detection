At this point I've had pretty much everything on the menu. I've loved everything I've had. There is one area of needed improvement. There is not sufficient room where the food is picked up in its proximity to the condiment counter and the drink dispensing area. Utter chaos. Still, I'm amazed with the food quality for a franchise\/chain restaurant.
