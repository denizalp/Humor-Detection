Obviously they have a primo location with Duquesne University as well as PPG Arena being right there. However, the food is lacking. Which really sucks.\nIt's just kinda blah and somewhat flavorless. Had chicken tacos and the meat didn't seem to be marinated or seasoned at all. Had to drench in sauces for any kind of flavor.\nStaff is friendly and it's a nice enough bar as far as decor goes. But again, the food is just a nogo for me.
