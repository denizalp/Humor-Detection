I wish I could give no stars for this restaurant. The pupusas were very salty (revueltas). As a salvadoran, this place is a disgrace to be selling such horrible food. The leftovers were thrown in the trash, and the raccoons in the backyard didn't even eat them. Never coming to this location ever again.
