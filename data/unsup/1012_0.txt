First of all its chinese then buffet.\nI was here with my collagues, oh my ...\ni dont know what they are using instead of meat. its was lack of spices than no way to hide the poor quality of the meat. And long line...i really dont understand people. Chinese food needs attention. And should be always prepared as orrder. Not like buffet and waiting on the counter too long. I wont be back and will make my collagues not to come back again neither.
