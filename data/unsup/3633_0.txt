The Diner is quite cute inside. Fairly spacious but quaint. \n\nWhoever hired Mardi, the sassy waitress had a stroke of pure genius as she made everyone laugh and feel welcome. I don't know who she was or where she came from...or...if she even works there?...LOL....Her personality is what made our visit a plus. \n\nIt was a fun visit even if there were a few mistakes with our order but we'll probably revisit soon and try more menu items.
