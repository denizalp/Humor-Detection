The midwest is the land of plenty.  Allow me to introduce you to it's grocery store. About 5x bigger than your biggest Safeway \"Marketplace\". (ha! what a joke.)  For example, where Safeway may have, say, three brands of canned olives, Woodman's will have 10 or 20, and many of them will be local Wisconsin mom-and-pop suppliers.  Really shitty produce is just symptomatic of the midwest, but you can get that 7 lb. beef heart.  Can you pick up one of those at TJ's eh???
