Unfortunately, Center Cut stopped offering their beef caps so I was super disappointed. \n\nMy expectations of steak houses has dwindled since they're all pretty much the same and Center Cut is no exception.\n\nService is always great and P2P is decent but the quality didn't hit the mark.  \n\nIt's just OK just can't say I'm a fan.
