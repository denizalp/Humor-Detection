I just got a smog check for $7.75!!!  Marlene the cashier was very professional and friendly.  I telephoned early in the day to inquire if I needed an appointment and I had no coupon.  Marlene informed me I did not need an appointment and to mention the Yelp ad and I would receive the discount.  Thank you USA Auto Service #2
