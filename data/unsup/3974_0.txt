We ordered 3 dinners for a total of $60.00 and it was not worth it at all. $7 for a order of plantains is ridiculously over priced along with the food not being up to par. I should have known by the name, if you have to put the word \"Authentic\" in the name then it's not authentic. Over priced and subpar authenticity drive by this place to the next Jamaican restaurant, trust me.
