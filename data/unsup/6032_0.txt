Easily the busiest $3 car wash in Tempe & Scottsdale. A decent amount of free vacuums, yet very limited on space. During the weekernd, its common to see 20+ cars attempt to drive in at the same time & at both entry\/exit points when the area feels cramped as it is. Plenty of services that will easily take that $3 wash to $50 and beyond.\n\nEither which way, this place gets the job done.
