Bartender was super rude ... Apparently the guy thought he was behind the hottest bar in vegas.  The Death by Mocha drink was nothing but super sweet chocolate milk.  Again the bartender wanted to do anything but help us.... I mean anything ... Including having a 5 min conversation with the buser about \"like how cool he is.\" He actually sent me to the other restaurant when I asked for a coffee.  The other bar Tanzy was actually much better.  Much much better service and a more relaxed environment.  One bad apple ...
