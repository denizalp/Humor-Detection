Thought it only fair to update: My cousin (without asking me!) went and got upper implants (total top teeth) back in May, she looks fantastic, but admitted it was very pricey (almost 25K!!!) and she will be paying for them until she is 90 yrs old!!! I guess I would rather suffer the pain of dentures and keep my 25K to spoil my grandkids!  You be the judge of how important appearance is!  Have a blessed day!
