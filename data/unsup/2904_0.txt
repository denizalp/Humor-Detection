The buffet is great, yet the downside is the changes over the years. There is only one station to get crab or lobster now. You can wait up to 15 min just for plate AFTER waiting to get seated. Obvious they are trying to reduce cost and make you wait a huge amount of time instead. This needs improvement. It used to be much better and they are seeing if they can get away with no one noticing. -2 stars for this.
