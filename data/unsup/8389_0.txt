Quite possibly the bestest chicken parmesan i have ever had the pleasure of eating. \n\nIt was pricy at 25 bucks, but worth every piece!\n\nServed with delicious garlic bread and a balsamic green salad.\n\nThey took absolutely forever to bring our food, which was very problematic because we had not eaten in a LONG time and we were hungover and cranky after a night of partying.\n\nEveryone else seemed pleased with their food.\nI will definitely return, if only for that delicious chicken parmesan.\n\nWolfgang puck knows hot to please me!
