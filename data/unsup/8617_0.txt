We came out on a Thursday for Latin Night and to watch Mundo Vacio, a band from LA perform. Not only do they play Rock en Espanol, but they also throw in some Depeche Mode and Beastie Boys among others, which is cool and keeps the crowd happy. 4 stars for the band alone...\n\nother than that, everything else aint all that unless you enjoy the meat market\/douchey\/guidoesque vibe.....ALOHA!!!
