Absolutely love everything about this place! I got married here in 2015 and the staff made it the easiest to plan! We had a Chicago Bears themed wedding and I feel like the colors were matched as best as they could be. They had so many colors of linens to choose from. I received 85% of my stuff all inclusive. Linens, centerpieces, cake, dj, photographer\/videographer, food, and servers. The only things we paid for were the florist, the party bus, and a band that we wanted to have. I would recommend them to everyone! Beautiful venue!
