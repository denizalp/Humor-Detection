We went on a weekday, which probably helped minimize the notorious wait time.\n\nWe were seated at a high table, in the front\/private dining room, which also serves as a storage location. There was a lot of traffic in and out, but not to the point of being bothersome, and the view out the front window made it well worth it.\n\nI ordered the special, a Denver scramble, and had cinnamon raisin toast, with homemade strawberry jam.\n\nThe scramble was delicious, but the jam was amazing!\n\nI enjoyed my meal, and my experience, and will likely return.
