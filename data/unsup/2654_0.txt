The shop and the cars and trucks are awesome, most of the items in the gift shop are overpriced. I wound'nt give you two cents for some of the guys that work for the Count. And as far as the Count he is so into himself, just like another car builder in Texas that's not worth a bucket of bullshit. If you really have to get work done on your ride and you have an extra $50,000.00 to throw away stop in and get fucked by the Count.
