I've driven by for so many years. Heard good things, but finally took the plunge a few weeks ago.\n\nI went straight for the wonton soup, just the \"queen\" size as the king looked massive. The soup is a good size for the money you're spending. I wouldn't say it was anything above and beyond wonton soups I've had before. But it hit the spot.
