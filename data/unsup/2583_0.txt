Tried this last night since we were at the mirage already for the Beatles Love. So disappointed with the food. We should have gone to Carnegie Deli instead. Tried the Italian station first and got the pork scallopini and ravioli. Pork was so tough and ravioli is not any better from the store bought kind. Only went downhill from there with the Asian station. The pad Thai didn't taste like pad Thai. The sushi was bland.  Wish mirage would put more effort in creating tasty dishes.  There are better options for dinner at 29 pp.
