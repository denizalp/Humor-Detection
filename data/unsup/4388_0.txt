Still no cavities!!!\n\nI hope I can update my review of my dentist (Dr. Katz) the same way for years to come...\n\nMy teeth feel sparkly and smooth today after my cleaning with Lucie.  I finally gave in and allowed her to take Xrays too... (not fun), but I survived.\n\nAs I said in my original review, the front desk staff is still friendly and organized and a pleasure to work with... if you're looking for a dentist, give Dr. Katz a call!
