Zombie crawl stop number 3. Not my favorite of the night, but not terrible. A little cluttered seating-wise. The beer choices were okay. They still had pumpkin ales available. Music wasn't too loud, so the crew could sit around the table and talk important Yelp business. Actually kind of a respite after the loud and obnoxious Gutter next door. Kind of feels like a Madison ave bar accidentally placed on Detroit. Worth checking out.
