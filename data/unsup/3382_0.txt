Just went for the first time today with a friend, atmosphere is pretty good it's a cute place, mostly went cause I wanted calamari, but they only had it for the dinner menu, which is fine, but our food came out and it was pretty tasteless (cheeseburger and buffalo chicken sandwich), good fries, but they don't have ranch, so if you're a ranch lover like me bring your own! My waitress was really nice though. All in all I might come back and try the pizza sometime
