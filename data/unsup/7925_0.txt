Seva is located inside the Walmart at Christown mall.\n\nInside there are several booths where you can have eyelashes applied,have facial hair removed,and other services are available to choose from.\n\nI walked in and asked to have my eyebrows threaded along with my mustache,and chin, because I can't get down with looking like a poster girl for the Dollar shave club. What's the point in having nice brows if you've got a huge mustache? Ewwwwwwwww\n\nOverall, I am a happy camper and now I look respectable.
