To put things simply, there's much better tasting and more authentic Thai food out there in Toronto. Overpriced for the quality. The pad thai was not authentic tasting. Tastes like something you would get from Thai Express. Not very generous with their dipping sauce for the spring rolls. I'll give it points for being a clean environment and the servers are wonderful. I probably will not come back here.
