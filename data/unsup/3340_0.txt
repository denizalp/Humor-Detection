We've been there a few times - their drinks are great, excellent bloody Mary's and Mojitos- excellent Cobb salad - full of fresh veggies etc. huge salad!  Our only complaint is the fries and onion rings have been consistently cold on every visit.  It's a bummer bc everything else has been pretty good.  Excellent service too.
