This place SUUUUUCCCKKKKED!!! The service was terrible, I thought I was in Anaheim, not Vegas. The food was overpriced and the place was crap. The seats they had us in were fit for infants, midgets, or people who don't value comfort. The waitress was an old seahag who took ten years to get my friends scallops. Eff this place.
