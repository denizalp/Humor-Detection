Great place to stay if you plan on taking your boat out to lake Mead. Ample parking.  They are also one of the only pet friendly hotel\/casino establishments in the Las Vegas metropolitan area,  The rooms are very clean and it has all the amenities you would find on the strip.  It's Vegas without the crowds.
