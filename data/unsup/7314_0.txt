Amazing services! The owner, Vanessa is super sweet and always makes me feel welcomed and comfortable every time I come in for a service. I am now on my second laser hair removal treatment and I have seen such great progress after only having the treatment done once! They have the most update advanced equipment which makes the experience absolutely painless!! I have also had an amazing hydrfacial by Elinir and she is so nice and knows what she is doing. I would highly recommend them to anyone!!
