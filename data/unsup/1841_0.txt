First time there and I had a great experience. The guy at the counter was super nice and had awesome customer service.\n\nThey finished my car in a little under an hour. I was getting an oil change and it seemed somewhat busy. They also saw my tire pressure light was on and got all my tires strait.\n\nI like that fact that he didn't make fun of me for being a woman who admittedly did not know what my car needed and I also appreciate how they're open on Sunday's.\n\nI'd say give them a shot.
