The burgers were ok. The milkshakes were amazing. I had a vanilla bean apple pie and bacon and my niece had a s'more milkshake. The bacon in the shake sounds crazy, but it works. The s'more shake had a hunk of marshmallow on top that was toasted on top that was so good! My buddy has said the brats are better than the burgers, so next trip the update may be 5 stars.
