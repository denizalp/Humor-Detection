The name lured me there, thinking it was an upscale Rainforest Cafe type deal. Monkeys, exotic appetizers, fine wines, more monkeys. Surely a night to remember, because of the monkeys. Alas, it was your standard white linen joint with standard white linen cuisine. Other than the name, monkeys appeared to play no part whatsoever in the theme, menu items, or decor. To say I was crushed is an understatement. Anyway, acceptable mid-town cuisine, but monkey lovers should not be confused by the name.
