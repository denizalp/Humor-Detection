I primarily go to the Olive Garden for the bread sticks, soups, salads, wine and on occasion the never ending pasta bowl when they have it. Everything else they offer is okay and can be gotten in the frozen food aisle in the store with a better taste. The lines are extremely long when we go with a 30 to 45 minute wait and this is even worse when the temperature outside is over 90 degrees. The value for your money is okay, but could be a little better.
