I love this place. They do the best hand wash in town for the bargain price of $13! You can't beat it. Sometimes you have a wait but the end result is worth it! I've been coming to my favorite ghetto wash for years and they almost never disappoint. In and out wash, cash only, and the people are nice and friendly.  I make the extra trip out here cause they do a good job.  Hours are weather permitting 8-6 m-sat and 8-4 on Sunday.
