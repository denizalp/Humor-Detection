The food tastes like barf (coming up, not going down). Yesterday I ordered a dosa that came with a small cup of vegetable soup on the side.  The soup tasted a bit off, and I only had a few bites, but it was enough.  Today I have done nothing but puke.\n\nIn fairness, we ordered three different dishes last night, and nobody else in my family is throwing up today, so if you think that two out of three ain't bad, Tamarind might be just the place for you.
