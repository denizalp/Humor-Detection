What a great, stress free experience. Salesman Gary make the deal and truly took care of us as if we were family. He was knowledgeable and patient. The mangers worked with us to ensure we were given the best deal. I can't express how smooth the whole experience was from start to finish. \n\nWe've recommended multiple family members and friends already. Ask for Gary next time you're looking for a car.
