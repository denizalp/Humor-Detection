I've been going here regularly for about six months. I love the retro theme and how clean it is! \nNo 90's decor or loud obnoxious music. The service is impeccable. I've had gel manicures\/pedicures and regular polish. They have a wide variety of colors and styles. The staff is great and remembers my name and preferences every time! It's got a great beauty shop vibe, perfect for gossiping with the neighbors and nail techs.
