Hate leaving a bad review but I agree. I was SO let down at this place and I don't care who or what famous people came walkin thru this door. You can't serve this kind of food and call it James Beard worthy, I'm sorry. \n\nOver cooked to no end egg noodles swimming in disgusting fat. Big and fat pierogis swimming in more fat. Would it kill you to give out some pickles to cut the fat? I felt like I needed hot sauce, or somethin so I don't puke trying to down all that butter.
