Dear Chipotle, \n\nThank you for stealing my money and giving me mediocre tacos and calling it \"food\". I am highly disappointed and will never again walk through your doors. You are extremely overpriced and have a very measly menu. The only reason why I gave you two stars instead of one? Your guacamole. \n\nP.S. You have bad service.
