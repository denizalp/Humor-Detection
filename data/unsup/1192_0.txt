I love living here! Julie the landlord is so sweet & helpful. She seems to always have time for her tenants. The maintenance guy Doug is awesome. He shows up very quickly is super duper nice & always takes care of my maintenance issues. The property is quiet & pretty well kept. Its nice living here.
