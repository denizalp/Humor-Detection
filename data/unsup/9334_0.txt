Horrible spaghetti and sausage! Marinara sauce was too watery, tasted like water with spices in it...Sausage tasted like cardboard and drank water to get the sausage down my throat...We will never eat here again, a frozen spaghetti dinner would of tasted better than this especially for $16.95 a plate...
