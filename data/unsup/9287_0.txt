Honey walnut shrimp. I was craving some yesterday, so despite the negative reviews on here, I decided to stop by for lunch. Honey walnut shrimp is $11.95 and comes with a generous amount of shrimp and a side of white rice. The food took about 10 minutes so I know they made it fresh. I really enjoyed my food and I have nothing negative to say about this particular visit.
