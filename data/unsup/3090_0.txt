I was a Veyo driver before it was Veyo, back when they were trying to launch an Uber competitor. The system was absolutely atrocious then. After several months, I left and did something else instead. I recently returned to Veyo, and the experience has been MUCH better. I often average $15-$16\/hour. The riders have been mostly quite pleasant. No shows, typically about 1 in 15, 1 in 20. My only real complaint is the time it can sometimes take to get through to dispatch.
