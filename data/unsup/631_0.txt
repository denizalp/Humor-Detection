Beautiful space and excellent staff. \nDanielle is a perfect gem. She's great at waxing, funny and easy to talk to while you're getting your vag hair ripped out.\nI also really appreciate Danielle's passion to bring business and life in Ohio City. We need more businesses\/people like her in the community. \nI really enjoyed every aspect of my visit here. I highly recommend.
