Jenni PHOgREAL!?!  I used to be a daily PHO KIM LONG visitor but they started getting rid of stuff from their menu.  This was my first time at Jenni Pho Grill and I enjoyed it.  The prices are decent.  They have very friendly workers and excellent service.  I only tried their PHO and Thai Tea this time around but the very comfortable welcoming atmosphere is definitely the reason I'll come back!
