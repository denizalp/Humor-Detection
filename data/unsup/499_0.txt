This place is hands-down the best arcade in the Valley!  The games are affordable and the pinball is great!  I'm 16 and pinball was the first game I ever learned how to play in an arcade.  I never knew that the older ones were so much different than the new ones.  I enjoy them even more!  The Pinball Museum is really great and I love it so much.  It is always a lot of fun.
