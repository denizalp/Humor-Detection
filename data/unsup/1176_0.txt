I tried to make an appointment at Chic lash.  The minute the person over the phone realized I had a teambuy voucher she immediately told me she wasn't by a computer and would call me back.\n\nAfter reading the review from Kim.T I highly doubt I will get a phone call back from them.\n\nIt seems like this is a big scam.  Chic lashes participated in the team buy promotion only to steal people's money and never give them an appointment.\n\nAbsolutely disgusting business practice.
