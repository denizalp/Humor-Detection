In for lunch today...new and clean with modern atmosphere and a cold feel. I ordered the Sriracha burger, it was tasty but I must say the bun overwhelmed the beef patty. The fries are thin cut crispy and done the way I like them. I'm giving them 3 stars due to the place was empty and our order took forever, the kitchen personal need to pick it up!\n\nI'll bet this place kicks when it's packed during football season!
