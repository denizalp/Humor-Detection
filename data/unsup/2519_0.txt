Afraid of who might be installing your garage door?  Unsure of the staff selected to enter your home? Don't be with Lodi.  Lodi kicks up the normally blue collar work with an air of professionalism and efficiency unheard of in this line of work.  They practically installed my garage door in between breaths (slight exaggeration) but still really quickly!  I could tell right away as the installer introduced himself there was nothing to worry about.  Integrity is job 1 AT Lodi, and it shows.
