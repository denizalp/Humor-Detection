Went here with my wife this evening based on Yelp reviews.  The reviews were spot on!  The food was great.  My wife got the large pollo plate and I got the combination plate.  It was a lot of food and we took home a bunch to enjoy tomorrow for lunch as well.  The flavors were very good.  I think I enjoy the asada a little more than the chicken but it was pretty close to a tie.  The owner was ther and he is very friendly and and customer service was excellent.  We will be going back.
