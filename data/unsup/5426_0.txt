I'm a touch partial to the CM in South End, even though I know this is the original mamma jamma! \n\nReally, what's not to adore? A myriad of interesting bottled beer and wine, fresh pints off the tap, a great crowd and excellent live music. Plus, if you're feeling snacky, there's a plethora of choices - tasty sandwiches, chips, cupcakes, salads, soups, etc. There's a bite for everyone, regardless of your culinary curiosity. \n\nAnd yes, Common Market offers some of the best people watching around. It's a very delicious utopia, right in the heart of Plaza Midwood.
