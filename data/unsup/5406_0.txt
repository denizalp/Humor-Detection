Had an amazingly simple blue burger at Big Smoke.\n\nBlue cheese and avocado should be part of every burger experience.\n\nThe meat was cooked perfectly- medium well so charred exterior and dark pink interior. Lordie! \n\nThe best part- the bun! Warm and toasted, the way all buns should be. \n\n\nI'll be back. \n\nI RECOMMEND- any of the signature burgers really but you know where I stand \n\nEXTRA TIP- Expect a small to modest sized sandwich at quite a cost (in my case, sandwich plus water? $11. No fries or sides). But money well spent.
