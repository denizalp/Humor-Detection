I cannot understand why this place is rated so high. Portions are small, and the food was insanely bland. I had the breakfast bowl and a side of bacon. And my partner had the breakfast burrito. Neither had any flavor, including the strips of bacon. How do you ruin bacon? I don't get it. The staff is very friendly, and the dining room very well decorated and nice. But the food, omg!
