Holy cow, what a great reason to go to birdtown.\n\nI never expected to find fantastic authentic Colombian food in my hometown, but Barroco delivers. Fantastic fresh food (yay empanadas), great sauces (pineapple sauce and the chimichuri are great), and gratuitous use of cilantro. \n\nAnother five star reason? BYOB! They've got live music and allow you to bring your favorite brew. The owner served us, and was a truly proud owner that was passionate about the food he served. \n\nSo yeah, get here, it's great.
