I've already written a review for the Qing Hua, Lincoln Ave location. This one at Chinatown is like a notch below its Lincoln ave counterpart. Its lags a bit behind in all aspects.... Food, Service.... Maybe not the Ambiance & Price. The dumplings here are a bit cheaper than the other location.  Also the menu here is limited. Think of the Lincoln Ave location as Batman & the Chinatown location as Robin. Even though both are on the same team, Everyone prefers Batman....\n\nFood -  Good\nService -Ok\nAmbiance - Casual \/ Clean\nWorth the money - Yes
