My husband and I love a good diner. Totin's didn't disappoint. The sausage was delicious - good flavor and spice. The Deb's cinnamon swirl French toast was cooked to perfection with a combination of crispy outside and soft center;it was sweet but not too intense. I was excited about the potatoes with peppers and onions but disappointed - they could have used salt (and I rarely salt heavy meals like this) and they were undercooked.
