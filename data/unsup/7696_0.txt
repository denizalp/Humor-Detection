Ok, so the only slight criticism I have with this place is that it is a little on the pricyish side. I would say more like $$$ instead of the $$ listed in the description. \n\nBUT...you truly do get what you pay for here. Every bakery item, all the bread they serve and the sides of pasta and potato salads you get with your sandwich made....in...house\/fresh every day! (and it shows...omg) Not to mention the ingredients in everything are fresher than the prince of bel air! \n\nI can't wait to try their breakfast!
