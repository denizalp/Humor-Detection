Indian buffets are where it's at. Swad is especially amazing. I was immediately overwhelmed by the number of options from which to choose. There's also the limitation of how much I can eat without hating myself too much.\n\nI loved the Chicken Tikka Masala. I was also a fan of the crepe roll up thing... I'm not sure what it's called. The assortment of pakoras was good too. I highly recommend the mango ice cream.\n\nThe servers will bring out fresh naan, which tastes amazing. They're also really good about taking your plate and refilling your water.
