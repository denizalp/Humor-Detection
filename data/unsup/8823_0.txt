I've tried so many times to \"like\" Fuel. It's the canned tomato paste taste I loathe. The decor gets me too, it's old vintage cans and garage chic it's just rusty and dusty and skeevey. Mostly kids working there and that's not a problem but there is always a table with left over scraps that even when not busy they don't \"bus\" it with any sort of interest in cleaning off tables.
