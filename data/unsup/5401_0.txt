This is the second time we have eaten here. It is not cheap but the food is amazing!  Their octopus appetizer is one of the best dishes we have ever eaten. Scallops are excellent! Not usually a duck fan but our son ordered it and it was delicious. Amazing food and the presentation is a work of art.
