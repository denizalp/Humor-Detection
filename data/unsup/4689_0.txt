Good variety of food, the iPad is quite useful.\n\n Wait staff aren't attentive, sashimi and sushi came out super late, and I was advised by a rude waitress that I should \"order ice cream at the end\", after she had to bring me new chopsticks because she cleared my place setting when I wasn't done. I think I can order ice cream and enjoy what I want WHEN I want.
