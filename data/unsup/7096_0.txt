I made an appointment for the \"guaranteed 30 minute oil change.\" I arrived early to find multiple employees standing around. Employee Krista was openly swearing and making derisive comments about other customers in front of me. When I was finally able to get someone to help me they told me it would be an hour and a half and not the 30 minutes that they guaranteed. \n\nI left without the oil change and will never go back with service like that.
