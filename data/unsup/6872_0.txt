Over priced fish -and a rip off . Anybody looking for fish don't go there your gonna pay more than usual , also between tank and cash register the price might change . Owner is a arrogant dick!!!! Something is fishy in this store. The service makes me feel like I am stepping into a diner in 1960s Georgia. (if you know what I mean)
