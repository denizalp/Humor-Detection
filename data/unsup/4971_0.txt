Never, never again!!  First of all... The only reason why I came to this buffet was for convienence I was staying at Bally's and it was just one hotel over.  \n\nThe food, sucks!  I was there on a Saturday for their lunch brunch and the selections sucked!!  There was not one good thing to eat.  The food was disgusting.  \n\nOne positive thing... The dessert's were good.  \n\nDONT COME HERE.  TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!
