We are in from out of town, and despite being extremely crowded with the Spring Training\/Spring Break crowd, the service was excellent and the food was delicious. I don't remember the name of the burger I had, but it was the one with ghostpepper jack cheese, and it had the perfect amount of kick. The onion rings are huge and tasty. Definitely recommend!
