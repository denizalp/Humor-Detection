If cream sauces were wall paint, Bellini would be selling a lot of beige.  After one of their cream sauce inundated meals, the poor quality of the sauce was surpassed only by the thin, pallid Brakebush chicken breast we found buried within.  Seriously, their food is Italian Americanized on steroids.  Try to find spaghetti and meatballs at an Italian restaurant in Italy.  To better these meatballs, go to Fazoli's.  To summarize our experience, come for the promise, leave for the food.  Grazie!
