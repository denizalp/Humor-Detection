This place is perfect for happy hour with friends or date night! The table bread is amazing! The pizza is thin and crispy, made with fresh ingredients right before your eyes. I am eager to go back to try the mushroom pizza and the turtle brownie. Happy hour is 7 days a week 3-6pm. If you are a first timer you will be greeted with a free champagne and apricot liquor cocktail. Staff is very friendly and accommodating.
