Holy freaking big ass plate of food!\n\nHad a 30 minute drive all the was down south, but it was definitely worth it though. \nHad to try their Ahi Poke Furikake style.8\nStandard Teriyaki chicken.8 \nTheir Katsu was overcooked and meat was pretty dry. Im hoping it was just a bad batch because i really love Chicken Katsu.6\nThose Kalbi ribs though.. ugh! (Rick Ross) I thought was going to die eating those. They're the entree size for a baby dinosaur and really really tasty.10\n\nJump on this spot, because you will liike.
