If your idea of winning big in Vegas has less to do with poker chips and  more with unearthing vinyl gems, check out the purple hut called Record City. Sporting some deep bins stocked with quality stuff, the prices here ain't cheap, but they're generally reasonable. Bonus points for the killer prog and metal bins being conveniently located right next to each other, and if sin city has you in the mood to roll the dice on some Euro-metal obscurity priced at $60, here's the place.
