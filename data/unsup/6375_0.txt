The restaurant is located next to Moxie, near the intersection of Chagrin and Richmond.  I enjoyed the house salad, Atlantic salmon and chocolate cake.  The salmon was very well prepared.  The mashed potatoes, mushrooms and green beans were delicious sides.  This is nice venue for special occasions.
