I called Flowers Plus in a pinch to send an arrangement for a celebration of life ceremony.  I do not live in Charlotte so I totally relied on reviews on yelp and boy, was I not disappointed!  Maureen was fantastic and sent me a picture of the arrangement which was exactly how I envisioned it, but better!\nI would definitely use them again; just wish they were in my home town!  Thanks Maureen!
