My go-to, on the way home spot to grab a 40 and some Funyuns from time to time.  Killer craft selection and priced well.  Bunch of neighborhoodrat kids buying White Owls and bags of chips.  Always good people watching.  Crazy eyes behind the counter is a great dude and he can watch you and the malt liquor section at the same time....monocular vision is whats hot on the STREETS!
