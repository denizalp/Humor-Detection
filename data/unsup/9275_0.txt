Unfortunately I don't think the burger is that great (mediocre).\nI'd suggest a steak sandwich over the burger.\nOnion rings are ridiculously awful.\nMagoo's and Burger Priest are BETTER.\nApache has a nice vintage feel, plus it was in the movie THE ROOM...\nunfortunately food has dropped off (quality) over the past decade.
