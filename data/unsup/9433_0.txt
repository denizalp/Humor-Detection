The staff was attentive, friendly & the portions were adequate.  It is pretty noisy, so not a very good choice for a lunch meeting. \n\nBurrata was a hit with everyone. \n\nThe service was good. \n\nWhile it was good... Nothing was so delicious that I can't wait to go back.  This California Pizza Kitchen is is much the same as any other.  \n\nWe are happy to have it in Downtown Summerlin.
