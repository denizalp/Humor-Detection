Friday night. Asked to get a waitress so we could order drinks and food at the table. 3 times we asked and no one came. Got our own drinks from the bar all night. Bartender with the beard is a metrosexual douchebag. Started making fun of me for asking for service. It's been 3 hours jackass. Do your Fu**ing job.
