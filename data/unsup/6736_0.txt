Its all about the wings baby.   Hey the pizza is good but its the wings that make this joint special.  That BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy and messy and thats how good wings should be.  The other night I grabbed 2 of their deal for a medium pie and wings and that rocks my world for a fair price.  When i got home i was in heaven with the hockey game, a  few good friends, and wings and pizza.  So the leafs are not a winning team, but the pizza and wings are.
