The short, white, bearded bouncer here is on some kind of power trip. Completely and unnecessarily rude to me about walking past him with a cup of water. It was a \"No Cups\" area for the underage crowd and I didn't see the sign. He yelled \"CUP!!!\" at me and scolded me like a child. This is a great bar for underage local music fans. Even better if you're an adult who likes being treated like garbage.
