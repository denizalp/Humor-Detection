Really really good, yet good for you too!  I was hesitant when my wife suggested we go here since I wasn't really in the mood for \"healthy food,\" but it was great!  We had the santa fe and southwestern caesar salads as wraps for lunch.  Delicious!  This will definitely be our go-to spot for a quick bite.\n\nThe map location is wrong though.  It's on Williams Field and Higley, not WF and Power.
