The only people who think this is a 'great bakery' are people who completely lack knowledge and culture- people who have never been 100 miles from home. Product is over-rated- really not exceptional.......the employees are RUDE- very rude.  As soon as I hear someone rave about this place......I know they are comparing it to a box of donuts at the supermarket ! Luckily for this place, it doesn't take much to impress most people.......even 'uppity' Oakmonters who really think they themselves are 'something' ! LOL
