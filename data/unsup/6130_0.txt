My friend - who I'll call her the queen of donuts, because it's her thing. Anywhere she goes when she's sees donuts she has to try them - recommended us this place. \n\nIt didn't disappoint! The dough is fluffy but substantial, yet not too big you drown in sweetness. The icing is crispy, with interesting flavors, like bacon for example. \n\nAs the name suggests, they are pro peace and love; a perfect little place to come to unleash your inner hippie and leave the politics outside the door.
