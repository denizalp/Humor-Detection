just wanted to add my 2 cents to already excellent reviews. \n\nI wound up staying here for a few days in april due to my mom being in ICU\/hospice and then her passing.  could not ask for an \"easier\" hotel to stay in.  \n\nhaving the kitchen was wonderful, the slip to order food to stock your kitchen (didn't use, but very nice to have if needed), great room, hot breakfast, place to use the laptop w\/plugs everywhere.  also, the staff was friendly all the way around.\n\njob well done guys...thanks again.
