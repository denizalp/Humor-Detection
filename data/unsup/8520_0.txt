The food is okay, the staff is really great and friendly, and the cold room for the vodka is a really neat touch.\n\nBut that violinist. You can't escape him and his pre-recorded mini-disks of shame. The room is open, so wherever you sit, you will hear him. Loud and clear. The whole thing, from the Violin-Disco in which he's doubt a pioneer, to his gentle weeps as he is reviewing his career choices during a too-loud version of Ochi Chernye.\n\nGet the Russian potato salad. It's very good here.
