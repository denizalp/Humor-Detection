Ordered a Double Baconator with lettuce, tomato, and onions. Burger was made to order. I walked all the way down to the end of the Concourse to eat it. When I opened the burger, it had zero bacon on it. I was to hungry and really did not have a lot of time before my flight to go back and have them remake the burger. The burger itself was hot and tasty - BUT, no bacon = EPIC FAIL!
