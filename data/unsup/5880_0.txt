Great new location (although the parking entrance was hard to find LOL...but I guess that goes with all these new hotels now).  Wicked Spoon Buffett is not listed as a \"buffet\" on their directory so it's kinda hard to find unless you knew it was a buffet to begin with.\n\nPricewise it was very decent.\nService was excellent.\nI love their take on the individual sized portions.\nI liked the variety, from breakfast items, to chicken, salads, asian food and the dessert bar was awesome.\n\nOf the ayce places in vegas...i'd come here again.
