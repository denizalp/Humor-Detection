Great therapist and convenient hours! Less crowded and great Summerlin location! \n\nThis clinic is a bit smaller but clean and not so hectic and busy as the Jones location.\n\nStaff is wonderful and accommodating. They are open on Sat and Sun too! \n\nVery happy with the therapists here. But be prepared to show a doctors note if you call in sick or you'll be charged $10! Policy sucks!\n\nLocated in a strip mall next to Golds Gym.
