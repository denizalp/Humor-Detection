I don't even know where to begin! The food and service was phenomenal!  The surfer roll is probably my favorite roll ever! The sunshine roll was also really good as was the spicy edamame. Honestly, there was nothing but love for every item. My stomach is happy and very full!!! PS:\nAsk about the #secretmenu dessert!!! Yummmmm
