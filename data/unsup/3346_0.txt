I own a soap business in California and i recently placed an order through BA online for over $1400 worth of product we needed. Their product came in great quality and in a timely fashion. I dont know why there are so many bad reviews but i felt I should come on and say how great their stuff is! \n\nShipment was supposed to get here yesterday but sat at the carriers center over night but thats not BA fault.\n\nGreat  product\nGreat price\nWill be stocking our inventory from them again soon!
