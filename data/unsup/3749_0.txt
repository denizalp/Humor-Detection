Thank you Tammy for my awesome 4th of July Nail Art. If you're looking for a relaxing nail salon, this is the place. 2 Tv's, wine and a very clean spacious salon. I've been a customer for the past 5-6 months, had stiletto nails, coffin, and my most favorite, very square and my nails always get compliments from friends and strangers. Everyone that work there is very skilled and take the time to do what the customer wants and not just rush you to get to the next client.
