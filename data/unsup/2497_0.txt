I like the discounts they seem to have all the time and I like all the children's crafts but this place is very dirty.  I went on a Saturday around 11:00AM and the bathroom was disgusting.  There was no toliet paper, garbage overflowing on on the floor and there was no soap.  Normally a place like this you would think they would check the bathroom each other but who knows if they even clean this every day.  I did bring this to their attention when I checked out.
