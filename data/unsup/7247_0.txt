Funky little modern furniture shop.  Don't know if it's really what I would qualify as design.  Or even if it's within reach!  But, if you are into that modern funk, \"Whoomp, there it is,\" right on N. Scottsdale Road.  Great stuff if you are doing an office remodel.  I totally fell in love with the silver Aeron Herman Miller chair.  Yummy yum yum.
