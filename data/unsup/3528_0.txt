We stopped here for a bite to eat after Wine down Wednesday at The Silverton. Traci T raves about it and we caught it before they closed! I got Massaman Curry dinner, no spice. When we got it home Traci T said I got about half the size that portion usually is. Bummer since it was sooo good. I'll try it again but I'll make sure before I leave I got the right portion size.
