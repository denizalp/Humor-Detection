My wife and I had to grab some quick dinner before an evening engagement. Never seen this place before, so we thought we'd stop by and see how it is. Not a horrible place. It's definitely more of a dive bar than a sports bar. The service was slow, cheerful and smiling, but slow. The food was very so-so. My wife liked her reuben, but the steak quesadilla was pretty much just philly cheesesteak in a tortilla. Decent prices. But, I don't foresee us coming back.
