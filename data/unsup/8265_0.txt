I've been craving this pita jungle for while and now I finally got to eat some. I got a typical gyro which is not bad. Healthy and enough for what you're paying for. I would definitely go back for more. There's still lots on menu that I gotta try. Happy hour is 3:30-5:30 for $1-$3 ranges for small portion food. Gotta try that too. Location is pretty good and nice.
