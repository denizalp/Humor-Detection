This is a classic Toronto deli which remains consistently delicious for breakfast and lunch! \n\nNOTE: \n... Yitz's Deli sells the best chocolate chip cookies in the city! They are not cheap, but are worth every single penny. They are soft and chewy and filled with huge, gooey chocolate chips. They are totally addictive ... be warned!
