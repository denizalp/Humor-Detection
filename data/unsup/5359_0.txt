I've been coming here for years and would never go anywhere else. I highly recommend Steve. There's nothing he can't do! A true professional. Only complaint I can say is that if I go in and Steve happens to be out,the other barbers try to pressure me to go to them, but I only trust Steve with my hair. I heard them whispering in Russian about me being a good tipper! (I understand Russian)I went to the blonde lady ONCE and she completely messed up my hair.
