Just got home from eating there...\n\n*****NEVER AGAIN!!*****\n\nService: POOR\n\nTook 20 minutes to get Vegetable Spring Rolls to the table, and 30 seconds later came my Pad Thai.  8 minutes after that, my wife's Vegetable Curry came.\n\nFood: POOR\n\nPad Thai:  Average (at best) flavor.  The shrimp may not have been fresh because they were awfully \"fishy\".\n\nVegetable Curry:  Flavorless (spice level 4 too!) \n\nThey don't even have Thai cooks...they are Mexican!  I don't want Thai people cooking my Mexican food either!
