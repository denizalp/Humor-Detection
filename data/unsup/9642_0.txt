Worst customer service ever. Will NEVER shop at this store again. The owner is extremely curt and arrogant. Not sure how you can run a business and be so rude and not accommodating. There are so many wonderful shop owners in the baby\/kid scene that it's not worth supporting this shop and making it seem acceptable to behave in such a manner.
