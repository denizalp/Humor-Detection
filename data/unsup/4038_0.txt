CMI is unquestionably my favorite airport in the world. I can check in online, leave my girlfriend's campus apartment 45 minutes before my flight, get through security, and relax in front of the gate for 10 minutes before boarding. Fantastic.\n\nWhat's more - the employees there are actually NICE. No, seriously. THEY'RE NICE!!!\n\nThis airport is pretty much perfect. If only it wasn't at the mercy of ORD to keep flights on time.
