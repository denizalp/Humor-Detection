Does every Cora's smell the same?  Everyone I've been to from Montreal to Mississauga to Pickering to Downtown have the same smell.    They need more ventilation as the grease smell is overwhelming once you notice it.\n\nFood is standard breakfast fare.  Menu is overwhelming. If you want a basic breakfast, the Cora's special is the one to get. \n\nBeware if you go with a large group they are very slow.
