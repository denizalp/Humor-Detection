We went here for dinner and the service we recieved was excellent, unfortunatley the food was terrible. I ordered 5 tacos (3 different kinds) with sides of rice and beans. The food was lukewarm, the the tortillas were too thick and very greasy, and combination of food used in each taco just didn't work or taste very good. Too bad.......
