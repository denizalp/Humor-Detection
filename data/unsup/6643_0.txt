Haft leave a new review because I have come more often recently!  All the bartenders are amazing ESPECIALLY BEN!! There is a free check in offer for fireball! They have a jukebox that is a newer version of course!  Prices are really good. They have the option to play pool, shuffle board, and dart boards. They have the option for the better dart boards but FYI bring your own steel tips! Good food and chill atmosphere. The only down side is that it does get kinda smokey! :(
