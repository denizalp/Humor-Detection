I HATE this location. I am ONLY giving it TWO stars because it DOES have A LOT of cardio equipment so there is NO shortage there. I do NOT like this location because no matter WHAT time it is, it it BUSY AS HELL!!! The ATC is full of people and i cannot find ANY of the weights I want to use... I am FORCED to go do cardio. WAAAAAAAAH. No but seriously, this place is TOO packed ALL of the time. Too many meatheads. MY GOD.
