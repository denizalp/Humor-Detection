Sorry..tho Farm Basket used to be one of my favorite places to go eat..forget it now!  Ordered the Chicken Fingers..yukkkk!   The breading was pealing off and greasy disgusting as hell. Didnt take a pic cuz I was so yukked out..the fries didnt taste like chicken as they used to either..I met the owner once at a party and he said his fries were made with a special chicken flavor..not anymore tho..they didnt taste good and were greasy tasting..yukkkkkk..sorry guys get your act together!
