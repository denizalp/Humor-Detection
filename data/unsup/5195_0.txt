The waffles were so yummy! The ice cream flavors were limited, but delicious. You can choose from the menu or customize your own waffle\/ice cream\/topping combo. My waffle had cinnamon ice cream, strawberries, and whipped cream. The whole dish tasted like French toast..YUM. I recommend  4 stars bc I wish it were a bit cheaper, or a bigger fruit quantity for the price.
