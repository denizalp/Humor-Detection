Tried this place after reading the reviews.  What a drive if you're not in the area! Service was quite abrasive, especially being our first time.  What I didn't like at all was the person who handled the raw burgers also handled the buns!!!  I don't need to tell you how I felt later on.  Cross contamination is an absolute NO NO.  My friend enjoyed her burger and thankfully she has a stomach of steel.  Fries were good.
