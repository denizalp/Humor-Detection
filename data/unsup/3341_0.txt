I chose Casey to handle my refinance after a bad experience with an internet company. This was the smoothest transaction I've ever had in closing a loan. From start to finish, Casey was on top of EVERYTHING. We ended up closing ahead of schedule, and she even had me at the title company the day the papers were drawn. I can't say enough about the level of service I received. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her to anyone who is looking to buy a home or refinance their mortgage.
