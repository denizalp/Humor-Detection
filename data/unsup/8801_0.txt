Love the view. Love the wine selection. \n\nThe Lake backdrop is extraordinary for Las Vegas. \n\nSo you get to shop thru the wine store & drink the bottle you buy.  Great concept & lots to choose from.  The owner manager can be quite helpful. \n\nProbably best to arrange a driver who is not drinking. This restaurant is a bit out of the way for us so until Uber gets to town, we have a hard time going there as my sweet guy won't drink a drop and drive.  \n\nService always seems pretty nice here.
