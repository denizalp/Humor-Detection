Ever been to a place that's over-hyped and then you finally get in after being put on a waiting list for an hour and forty-five minutes only to be treated like garbage and not even get to sit at table to eat your overpriced food that doesn't really impress you in taste or presentation? In fact, the boiled flavourless mushrooms and 2 shrimps on a toothpick for $9.50  looked like it was prepared by a 5 year old. Well I have.
