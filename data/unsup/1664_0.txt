Birthday bliss, with fun alcoholic beverages and amazing Mexican fare!  We went on a Sunday afternoon.  The drink special was a ginormous bulldog margarita (margarita with a bottle of corona) for $7!!!  3 of those, and I was a much-too-happy girl.  \n\nAs for the food, it was awesome!  Also, Huge portions.  I don't think I ate all of my dinner. But, I had 3 bulldog margaritas, so who really knows...\n\nThere was singing.  There was a birthday tequila shot.  I think salsa dancing was happening (again, margaritas).  I'm sure I had a great time!
