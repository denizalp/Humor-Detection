In the age of the Internet and all of the information available to all. It's crazy when dealers try to pull a fast one on customers. \n\nI caught them basically lying to me. It's simple arithmetic. Add all the numbers up and if they don't jive. It's easy to catch. They were purposely charging me $2k more than what they were showing me.  Absolutely shady. I would say stay away.
