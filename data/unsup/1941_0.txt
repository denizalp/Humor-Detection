A good, classic hotel to stay in Vegas. We booked their Prima suite and it was huge (1500 sq ft) and nicely decorated.\nPros: \n-clean and spacious suites with comfortable beds\n-room service menu was good \n-good location on the Strip\n-good WiFi in rooms \n-canal shops \n-great dining options \nCons:\n-bathroom was a bit dated \n-check in can have extremely long lines \n-can't call in advance to have your car pulled up, which means a long wait if you valet your vehicle
