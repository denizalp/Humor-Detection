I came here for the Speedo®s ....\n\nHowever, there are no true Speedo® briefs to be found anywhere here ....\n\nWhat gives? \n\nIs this America or what? \n\n(Actually, that rhetorical question does not work in this case being that the majority of U.S. Americans are overweight and lacking the machismo to flaunt it in a Speedo®.)\n\nFuck ....\n\nThis is like a Timberland® store with no boots; a Starbucks® with no coffee; a Barneys New York® not being blatantly racist against African Americans. \n \nSomeone call me when they actually sell Speedo®s here. \n\nRating: Two-stars, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"
