We were excited to eat at Hank's Fine Steaks & Martinis hoping for a good steak dinner.  The interior of the restaurant is sleek and sexy; we went on a weeknight and since the dinning area was not busy, we were seated right way and given menus and water.  But that's when our experience ended.  After sitting for 25 minutes without acknowledgement that someone would come by for our order, we gave up and left.
