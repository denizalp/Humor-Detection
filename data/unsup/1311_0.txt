We stopped at sushisamba one night for a small snack and a couple cocktails.  It turned out to be the top experience we had in Vegas.  Our waitress, Tanice, was amazing.  We weren't very familiar with sushi and were looking for a new experience.  Tanice sat right down with us and immediately made us feel comfortable.  All her suggestions were spot on. We had such a great experience that we went back two more times.  Oh and ya gotta have a cucumber martini while you are there
