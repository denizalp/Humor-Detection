My husband and I came in yesterday to buy a new hiking backpack for me. We had the great fortune of meeting Jeff who not only helped me find the best pack for me but entertained us the whole time. The entire team at REI was fantastic. We even got treated to fresh baked cookies. Billy and Erin provided excellent service up front as well. Next time we're in AZ we'll definitely head to REI for any of our outdoor needs.
