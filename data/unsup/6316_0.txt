Great neighborhood Pub! hard to give a pub 5 stars, but there are no negatives.  Great staff, great food (maybe the best pizza in town) , great beer line up, great TVS and management is all over getting the proper games on, warm atmosphere,  clean, full of locals who are unpretentious and hold your breathe. ... a 20 oz pint of Beer for $6.\n\nNot sure why I am writing this.... I want to keep it a secret!
