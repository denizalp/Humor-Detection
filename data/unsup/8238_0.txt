This is my favorite sushi spot in Vegas... And I have been to a lot!! The sushi chefs here make it an experience And always welcome me and my friends like we are some kind of celebrities. \n\nThe food is delicious, the rolls are unique, the staff is usually attentive, but the chefs are phenomenal. \n\nMy favorite menu items are the tuna karai, something wrong 69, screaming orgasm, lion roll, mistake roll and the choo choo special. \n\nFriday nights are the best, because they always do sake bombs for the bar!! Love this place!!
