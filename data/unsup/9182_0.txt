Am glad that I can eat finest poutine in my neighborhood, actually its one of the best in GTA area.  I personally didn't like butternut squash & sweet peas, nothing wrong with poutine but it just personal preference.  Anyways chili-cheese supreme (vegetarian one) is the best so try that if you are vegetarian like me.  Make sure you mention vegetarian or else you will end up getting beef one.  Enjoy!!
