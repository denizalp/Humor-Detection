Good mexican food w traditional sonara selection,the tortas are by far the best I ever had.they are big and grilled like paninis,they come with lays chips,weird but its a college town,they set up the inside like chipoltle so its easy for them drunk kiddies to get no pico on thee burro,because like filisquirtos they always forget,im sold on this place as of now,stay gold.
