After bed experience in 2012 and avoiding this place for about 2 years, decided to give another shit, was pleasantly surprised with changes, very nice menu with good choices in sushi tools as well as main dishes, after several visits looks like they now take service mostly better than before, waiters has no ledge about dishes and special and more available than in my first experience overload good dinning choice for average bill 50-60  dollars per person
