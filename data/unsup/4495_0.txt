Home to all things cutesy and Japanese, this is the perfect place for all tweens.  This is the Hello Kitty home world, and she brought all her friends.  But it's not all just Hello Kitty, they have some Skelanimal products and even accessories.  They have purses and bags of all shapes and sizes, with the Kitty of course, and matching cell phone covers.  Even though it's not my kind of place, I'll definitely be coming back for my sister's Christmas present.
