We have never had a bad experience at Ajo Al's,  Jessica in the bar was very attentive even though she was kind of busy. My wife and I usually share the chicken\/beef fajitas, we were not disappointed again it has hot and fresh and full of flavor.  they are generous with the chips and salsa, which is all ways nice not to have to beg for more.  keep up the good work we will be back for our date night in the near future.
