Either they thought I was going to buy something or steal something! Haaa.   The sis was in town and she loves all things luxury-so we made the rounds at Crystals (a high end \"mall\" with luxury stores located next to the Aria Hotel).  \n\nWe were followed from case to case and although annoying, all our questions were answered.  No bag in hand after we left just a wish list for the \"in case I win the lottery what's the first thing I'll buy list!\"
