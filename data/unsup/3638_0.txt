Unbelievable. Fantastic service, courteous people, small business feel - the kind of place who makes a terrible day caused by the incompetence of a huge chain worlds better from the moment they answer the phone.  \n\nState inspection scheduled as a same day appointment, where most places would find something (anything) to \"fix\" and upcharge, these guys passed me, changed my tires and I was put in less than an hour.  \n\nI'm telling everyone how great they are.
