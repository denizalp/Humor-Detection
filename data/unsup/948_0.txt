I'm not telling you anything you don't already know, but goddam American Apparel hates overweight females.Overweight men, on the other hand, are OK. \n\nTheir newer line of clothes are unbelievably ugly. The 80s crop tops and pleated, high-waisted trousers are cut in such an unflattering way that only an anorexic 12 year old could look good in them. And even then she would look a bit pudgy.\n\nI only go in there to snag the Vice magazine and scurry out before I offend anyone.
