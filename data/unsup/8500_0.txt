I am from out of town and so when a tooth of mine started acting up I asked my parents (who live locally) for a dentist referral. Never have I met a Dentist with more compassion and understanding for my discomfort.  Dr. Panelli laid out a plan for me that included a few molar crowns (definitely long overdue), natural whitening and front teeth bonding to restore a youthful look to my smile.  I am thrilled with the results.  I couldn't be more enthusiactic about giving this 5 star review! :-)
