Unsatisfied customer! I ordered a get well bouquet , pictured arrangement was $39.99, I wanted a premium arrangement so I ordered the $59.99 bouquet. How disappointing, has a few lillys, 5 roses, rest is carnations a few baby's breath and filler. For $60 plus delivery? Will take my business elsewhere in the future. \nOne star is for same day delivery.
