China Grill has amazing food. It is a fine dining experience. Expect small portions at a steep price. \n\nFeel free to dress up, or dress down. This place is a cozy little hot spot with beautiful decor, and waiters!\n\nThe bathrooms are worth paying general admission to use. TVs and everything!!\n\nI felt like a movie star when I was there. The service is superb and the food top-notch. \n\nRecommendations:\nAppetizer- Lamb spare ribs \nDinner: Drunken chicken
