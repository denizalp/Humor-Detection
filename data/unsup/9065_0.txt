This boutique is amazing. I've been shopping here for years & it never disappoints. I bought a purse from Francesca's 3 years ago and it still looks brand new, talk about quality at its finest! \nThey have pieces for every occasion. From Party Rock attire to chic office wear you will always find what you need. The jewelry selection is also lovely. And it's not cheap looking like most places. \nThey also have amazing art pieces for sale. Inspirational\/funny quotes, photo frames, jewelry holders etc. this is truly a one stop shop.
