So good!! It's the best sushi I have tried so far in the GTA. Food here tastes very fresh and the service was fairly quick. I would recommend the black dragon rolls and the dynamite rolls. However, I would not recommend the \"Inuit\" maki rolls as I found the garlic flavour didn't go well with the rest of the roll- personal preference! The servers are shy but offer attentive service.\n\nI will continue going back here as it is local and delicious!
