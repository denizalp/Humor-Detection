This new spot just open across the street! From its original place on Bermuda and Silverado ranch I'm here at midnight . We can't order chicken taco . I can't use my debit card then try using my cash ($100) they can't even take that! Next time why don't you guys post up what you can and can't do so I don't waste my time coming here !!!
