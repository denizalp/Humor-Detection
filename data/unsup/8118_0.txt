My lease is up this summer so I thought I'd get a head start on checking out the latest and greatest vehicles on the market. I'm not a Ford girl, never have been and didn't think I ever would be but thought while I was driving by, I'd check out the Ford Escape. \nI met with a guy named Tim who let me test drive a couple different Escape's and WOW. I really might have to rethink this anti-Ford thing and sign the paperwork on this car!\n\nIf you're looking for a new or used car, Tim Whitman was fantastic.
