Let me start off by saying this is not one of those gluten free, raw kale, overpriced, taste like cardboard kind of vegan pizza. \n\nI ordered a slice of their \"pig destroyer destroyer\". The mock meats and cheeses are legit here. Filthy taste in a good way but without the animal products. Decent portions and reasonable prices. Friendly service.\n\nOverall great place to grab a slice of vegan pizza. Give it a try the next time you are in the area. Don't get triggered by the V-word! Try it and I am sure you will like it.
