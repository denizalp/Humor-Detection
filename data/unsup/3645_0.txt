From the bad DJ to the weird vibe\/atmosphere. I don't think Perl√© will ever be the bar for me. I don't know whether its the location, the people (Father Time over there dancing with girls young enough to be his great granddaughters...aka...CREEPY ), I don't know. But this bar is tacky plus playing Love and Marriage by Frank Sinatra as a GTFO of the bar song is bad. Sorry I'll take a dirty dive any day.  \n\nIf this is Downtown Pittsburgh version of keepin' it classy. Pfft! I'll pass.
