I went here a few days ago and totally forgot to review it! I ordered the traditional eggs Benedict which comes with potatoes and \"sassy apples.\" The food came out very quickly and was amazing! The hollandaise sauce was extremely zesty and flavorful, the eggs were cooked perfectly, and the ham was thick and delicious. The only bad part was that the potatoes were pretty dry and almost stale. I do love the service here and appreciate that they left the coffee pot on the table so that I could refill it as I pleased.
