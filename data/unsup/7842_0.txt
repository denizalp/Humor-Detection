Love this place. Moved to Arizona 10 years ago and missed coney dogs and Better Made chips ever since. Along comes the Coney Grill with authentic Detroit style food and brands. As long as the doors are open I will be a customer of this establishment. Awesome owners. Customers are unlike any other place as they often start conversations amongst themselves. Guess we are all just proud to be from the great city of Detroit.
