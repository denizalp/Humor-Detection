In our \"hood\" and finally got to try it out.  As other reviewers mentioned, you really need reservations as it is a very popular spot in a somewhat less than popular location.  We were seated at the bar, which was just fine.  They were very busy and the food too a very long time to come, but the bartender did a great job keeping us posted on the status.  Food was good...a little salty, but good.\n\nWill make reservations next time.
