Sad for me, this spot is so popular that arriving at 2pm on a Friday was still too crowded to have a spot for lunch. After having lunch across the street, though, we came back to oggle the pastries and grab an iced coffee. It was definitely the smallest size for the highest price I had seen in the city, but it was also one of the tastiest. \n\nDefinitely worth stopping in, and good luck getting a spot.
