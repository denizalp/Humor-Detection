What's a good way to start Saturday Morning in Las Vegas....Bagels and Starbucks! \n\nThe breakfast bagels came with cream cheese and we probably got about a dozen bagels. The bagels were tasty, definitely a little hard on the outside but still good. \n\nGot the bagels and headed to the Starbucks drive though :)
