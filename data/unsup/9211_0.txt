Came here in weekday lunch, only 2 tables in the dinning room but took it more than 40 mins to get our food. Ask the waitress just replu us they only got 1 chef this afternoon.\n\nThe food is bad, my wife order a shrimp curry bowl, you never feel there is curry taste, actuall no taste at all. will never come back here
