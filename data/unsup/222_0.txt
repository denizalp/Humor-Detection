Went awhile back with a Groupon and just ordered some basics like a cheese pizza, salad, wings, garlic knots.  The pizza and garlic knots tasted like cardboard.  Pretty awful. Chuck E. Cheese's can do a better pizza then them.  Yes, that's an insult.  Salad was ok edible and wings were meh.  There are plenty of better places to spend my money, time and calories.
