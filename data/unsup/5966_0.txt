This place is a hidden gem! Im a huge pizza fanatic and this joint is a must try in Sin City! Its been around longer than Ive been alive and is still consistently pleasing customers. Checked previous reviews and decided to give them a shot. The philly is the best Ive had in my life! The small business family customer service was pleasant and on point. Will definitely be reccomending to my friends...
