Checked in today for brunch since the Buffet @ Wynn is under construction. Got a table out dude the patio with a beautiful view over looking the swimming pool. We ordered the Frittata, Fruit Plate & the Croissant. The fruits, melons and berries were extremely fresh and the croissant was fresh cooked and delightful.\nOur waiter SY gave us excellent service.
