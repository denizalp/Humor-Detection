ARE YOU FUCKING READY FOR THE BEST ICE CREAM IN THE STATE? You bet you are. The only ice cream in the world that competes is Blue Bell, and I can't get that in WI. \n\nThey have limited hours, so plan ahead and get a bucket for your freezer and a cone for now. \n\nI don't like some of their flavors, and some are to sweet, sample widely before buying.
