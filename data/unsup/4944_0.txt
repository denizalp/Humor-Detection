Service was slow; however, the food was good. I'd rate it *definitely* better than the old and somewhat better than diner\/Eat N Park-type food. Also, the prices are pretty inexpensive. It worked great for us because we were there for a reward night for our son - so we were able to play arcade games and grab a decent dinner all in one stop.
