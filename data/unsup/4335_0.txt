One day when I'm really really rich I'm going to buy all of the St. Huberts in the world and shut them down permanently. This place is so awful. Everything about it was so wrong, the food is gross, the waiters suck, the drinks were hard to swallow, and it wasn't even cheap! Never never never ever ever ever again.
