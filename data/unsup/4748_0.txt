Awesome restaurant. Great food here. Plenty of tables to sit around.\n\nTables and floors always clean when I come. Servers are nice and bring my drinks right away. I ordered the loco moco and it came to me in an excellent amount of time.\n\nPortions so huge. Huge bowl of white rice. Thick beef patty and beautiful sunny side eggs on top!\n\nThanks Noah for the great customer service and hospitality
