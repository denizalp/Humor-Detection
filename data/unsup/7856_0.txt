Yelp says they are open til 9:30. I just submitted an order 9:10, and got a call at 9:17 saying they are close. Never. Ever. Try. This. Place. BS.\n\nEdit: what could the fact that this happened on Mother's Day possibly have to do with anything? Employees rushing home at 9pm to celebrate? And if you know it takes a few days for Yelp to adjust to your new hours, then stay open til 930 while the change gets processed.
