Haven't been here in a while. First time here since they moved across the street. New store is definitely nicer and up to date. They have a full bar here, too. Staff is very nice and quick. The food is tasty, omelets and pita sandwiches are great here, salads are average, Philly cheesesteak is my favorite sandwich here, and the pancakes taste pretty good.
