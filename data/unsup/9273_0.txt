The food here was decent. They have a lot of options here. They have pizza, sandwiches, omelets and more. They have grab and go pre-made stuff but also have fresh, made-to-eat food that is fresh and good. I had eggs over easy with turkey and toast. I could have chosen from several other meat options. There was also a healthy slice of musk melon. Not bad for about $10.\n\nI would go back.
