1) service was mediocre. \n2) I did not receive my meal, the owner, not the waiter, had to come and tell me that they didn't have what I ordered after an hour of waiting. \n3) the owner didn't actually make up for anything and said that he was \"sorry\" \n4) I left hungry and the original waiter never came back to the table after the food was brought because he knew that he had screwed our table over.
