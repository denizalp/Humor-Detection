One of my favorite bars of all time. While I agree from a purely board game fan perspective the Tabletop bar in Ohio City may be better since they have a much larger selection of games and more space. But it doesn't have the same vibe and camadarie as Side Quest. There's just something about this place that just feels more personal, warm, and inviting. And now they serve food which is just icing on the cake. \n\nThey are quickly becoming a vital part of Lakewood.
