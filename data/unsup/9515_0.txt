So, I got a bill in the mail saying that my Culinary Insurance wouldn't approve the inserts. Culinary Insurance does not cover inserts at the Good Feet Store starting on Jan, 1st 2013, buyer's beware!!!! Currently fighting the bill due to authorization issues and so forth. Lot's of headaches going through this process. Go see a quality podiatrist instead and get insoles from them. It's the same stuff, plus the Culinary Insurance will accept it.
