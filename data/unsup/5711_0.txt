This place is everything I was told it was. \nGreat vibe and  ambiance when you walk in.\nFrom the door guys to the bartenders, they all rock. I don't want to say our bartender's name, but she was awesome! Just go and try it out! All types of people and music. \n5 stars plus!! Thanks for suggesting the green tea shot.  My new fav :)
