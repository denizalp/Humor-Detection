Bigger IS better.... And bigger is what you get at Carmine's. This restaurant is perfect for a group outting. The meals are HUGE, but the quantity doesn't compromise their quality. \n\nThe appetizers were delicious, and to be honest I was already full after appetizers, but once I saw dinner, my appetite was back. \n\nAppetizers: \n-Spicy Scarpraiello wings\n- fried Zucchini--- a must\n\nDinner \n- Penne Alla vodka \n- Country style Riggatoni \n- Chicken Parmiagiana\n- Porterhouse contadina\n\nDessert \nTITANIC- a must (and they have a gluten free option)\n\nHighly recommend this place for birthday parties, group dinners, or if you're really hungry!!
