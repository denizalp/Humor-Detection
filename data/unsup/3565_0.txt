Love this place. Husband and I come often for their great happy hour appetizer and beer specials and the TVs are great too. Really like the staff here.  We like how they strive to make sure we have a good experience.  We order our wings extra crispy, and I get wings while husband gets drums. Sometimes I ask for extra seasoning. They're accommodating like that. We'll keep coming back for sure.
