I am SOOOOOOOOOO glad that another French bakery has opened in Pittsburgh.  Its competition's same ol' same ol' menu and snooty French attitude are what drove me away from going there.\n\nIf you are looking for unique and authentic French delights, this is the place the check out!  They have the best almond croissant and amazing bread....something Jean - Marc does not have!
