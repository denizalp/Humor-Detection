I just got a great response back from the manager Nectaly! Note to PUBLIC  I spent over 275.00 in this restaurant eating my side dishes while  the chef got 2 steak temperatures wrong twice... You all should read this managers response and her lack of accountability for how bad my dining experience was... She ridiculed  me for my yelp review!! We all know what YELP is here for if it gets too hot or is not cooked well enough stay out of the kitchen or out of this restaurant!!
