I have stay at The Rio two times a year for the last six years. I would have to say that the Rio is lucky that WINN comes here. I'm constantly u satisfied and even infuriated with the service and their \"A\" class service! Wrong- sorry Gary Selesner.... The Rio might as well be the motel 5, oh no wait- motel 5 YOU CAN GET COFFEE IN YOUR ROOM. \n\nAlso- the banquet staff is horrible. No one know anything. Do they not have captains and leads?
