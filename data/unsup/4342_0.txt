I do not like Mexican food so let's say I wasn't dying to go but my friends were raving about this place so I had to oblige. Now, it's definitely one of my favorites in Montreal. I had the tasting menu which was really a great value for the price! My only complaint is that it's hard to get a reservation so reserve early
