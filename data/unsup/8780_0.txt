I found a hair ball in my half bucket of hot wings. Not only is this disgusting and I lost my appetite, but the owner was plain rude. You don't yell at your customers in person or on the phone (even when your busy). It was my sisters idea to go here and the last time either of us will step foot in that place. This place lacks professionalism, customer service, and cleanliness.
