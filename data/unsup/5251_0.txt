Came by here on vacation. First of all, a family of four is $100 this doesn't include the cost of rides either. Second, this place is dirty with litter everywhere. The glass is dirty and it is all dirt paths. Don't wear flip flops or white shoes. I feel like I need a shower to wash the filth off. Third, the rides are old and uneventful. I do not recommend this place. Save your money.
