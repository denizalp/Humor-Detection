Taro with boba = a big ass smile!  Yep, I said ass.  Inappropriate?  Perhaps, but it's so good to taste bubble tea on a hot day that I just don't care right now.  I just love taro.  And boba.  They go together like peanut butter and jelly... or peanut butter and chocolate... or peanut butter and anything!
