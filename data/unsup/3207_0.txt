Love this place!! The service is amazing. We always request Monica for our server. She is the best always smiling and so sweet. The food is amazing also my husband loves the burgers and I always get the Tex salad so good!! But the desserts are to die for!! The butter cake and their homemade banana pudding is a must try.
