Best car buying experience I've ever had.  They don't haggle over price.  They take good care of you, and make things quick and easy.  I saw Terry Repovsch and he was great.  No pressure, and allowed me to ask questions.  They were quick to resolve issues and provided me with the only positive car buying experience I've ever had.  No one likes car shopping, at least no one I've ever met, and this is the most painless option around.  If you are in the area, I'd recommend them whole heartily.
