Great job to all the doctors and staff at this Medical Center.  I appreciate the common courtesy and assistance with my health care.  I do not have insurance at this current time but when I did, I would say the waiting period for medical assistance is typical.  I appreciate the \"free\" health care and I know the doctors and staff do everything they can to make sure the care is top notch.  \n\nThank you for your care and for supporting those of us who are less fortunate and do not have health insurance.
