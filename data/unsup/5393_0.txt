I would give zero stars if I could! Disgusting flat Stella on draft and service was horrible. Waitresses would rather talk to each other in the back room than actually serve us. Someone should call bar rescue.  Oh wait... they already did and it still needs rescuing. If Jon Taffer came in he would be livid! What a waste of space. This bar will not last!!!
