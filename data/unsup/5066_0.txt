Props to Ivan Kane for pairing up exceptionally talented musicians with phenomenally seductive burlesque dancers.  The girls we saw put on a performance that out-classed and out-titillated the upscale strip club without contest.  Pure seduction.\n\nShame on Ivan Kane for being stingy with the performances.  One or two song sets every couple of hours?  That's insanity!\n\nIvan Kane, I have one more suggestion for you.  Tell your door crew to do a better job of managing the line.  The place was unacceptably full before 2:30 am.  People weren't having a good time.
