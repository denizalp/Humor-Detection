Careless, thoughtless, sloppy -- these are NOT the characteristics you want at your time of grief. Setting up a prepaid contract took multiple phone calls to remind them of my deadline, urge them to follow up, insist on their attention. They assured me that they frequently work with mortuaries in other cities, and yet their communication with the Denver funeral director was inept. They got the death date WRONG in the newspaper, and misspelled the last name on the miniscule refund check. They have a virtual monopoly in the Cleveland area, but I do NOT recommend them.
