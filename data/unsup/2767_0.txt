So the main issue I have is with the parking attendant, we had an order to go that was placed early so we went for our appointment to pick up the food. When I got there I parked the the far right corner and I had to take 2 spots because the way they have the parking curb stop was pointing at a 60% to the drive way. The attendant force me to repark and move in all the way and now my front bumper was damaged and he could care less.\n\nPoor service poor attitude.
