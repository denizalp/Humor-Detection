Fresh and Hot food. \n\nNot to mention how wonderful the cashier was. She brought the food to us the serving size was generous plus a women forgot her purse and the wonderful atentive cashier hustled it out to the owners truck just before they took off. \n\nI usually go to the one on 19th Ave but after this night am probably coming here.
