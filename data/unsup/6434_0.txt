We love this restaurant\/bar. If we lived closer we would patronize it more often. This time we had the Pan Roast Combo and Pan Roast Crab. My heat index was 2 which wasn't bad at all. They were pretty generous with all the different types of seafood. My wife loved the Pan Roast Crab. She really enjoyed the flavors.\nWe topped off our meal with Blood Orange Gelato. Well, it's not quite the creamy version of gelato, more like shaved ice. But, it was refreshing.\nThe cook gave my wife a Christmas ornament made from used menus, what a great gift.
