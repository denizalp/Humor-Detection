Came hungry, left hungry. \nVegetarian dishes are forgettable, meat dishes taste disgusting. \nEggplant dish was drenched in some brown sauce, I guess to mask the lack of eggplant?\n\n\nThe cook is the same guy who used to run \"Saffron Tree\" on Bay & Gerrard. He can cook some veg curry, but he cannot cook meat. He should not be a cook, really.\n\nAvoid this place!
