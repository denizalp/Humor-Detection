Stopped in here to get a birthday gift.  Next time i will  buy it on amazon.  They only had 1 person to work the register and he was busy with someone  else off to the side, so  me and the 3 people on line behind me had to wait 10 minutes  to check out. Finally the other person working there came by and i ask him if he could ring us out. But he said it was only his 2nd day so he was not trained.  From now on its amazon.
