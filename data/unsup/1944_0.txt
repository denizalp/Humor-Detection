I loved my last few experiences here, especially with the ultra sound tech, Billie Jean! She was absolutely amazing. She was super personable and friendly, and made me so comfortable throughout some extensive imaging. I can't Imagine going anywhere else for any future ultrasounds. Highly recommend!
