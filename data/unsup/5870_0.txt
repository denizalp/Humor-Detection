Super nice people however the food was so tasteless. Sorry I hate to give a bad review but I should have \"listened \" to the yelpers. It was Saturday, and we literally were the only people there(second red flag). Nice people. Got the food to go. Very disappointed once we started eating. My kid was as well~ and he rarely complains. Thought I'd save the food and \"doctor it up\" the following day with my own seasonings. Nope. Right into the trash. Bummer because I bought a large quantity for the next day.Lesson learned.
