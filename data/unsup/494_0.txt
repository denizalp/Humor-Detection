The evening our family visited Dixie Pig in Tega Cay it was extremely hot.  I don't know if the AC was broken but I do not appreciate eating indoors and sweating while trying to enjoy my meal.  I had the French Dip and it was not as good as the Dixie Pig in Rock Hill.  The meat was tougher, I will visit in Rock Hill but not Tega Cay again.
