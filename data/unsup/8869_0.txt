Stadium seating, good.  Chairs that don't recline, bad.  Having to walk around the building three times to find the entrance, very bad.\n\nThere is nothing special about this movie theater.  The individual theaters are small and there aren't that many of them.  I guess I'm spoiled by megaplexes, this is not one.
