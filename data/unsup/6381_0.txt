Decent price for lunch $21.95 all you can eat sushi. And I think their sushi is very fresh, the pieces are on the smaller side but I think that's just them trying to prevent people from wasting. There are signs stating that they may charge for wasting and no sharing if not everyone at the table is doing AYCE.
