I can't say enough good about this place. Literally crave the seafood burrito all the time. Every bite is heaven. They never mess up my order and service is great. Wishing they had a burrito boyz in Buffalo cuz I would be there daily!! Can't wait till I'm in Toronto next week to devour the best burrito I have ever had anywhere!! Yummmmmm
