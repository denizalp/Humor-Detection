If you want to experience a cattle run, go to Shepherd Eye Center. You'll wait for long periods of time between each \"station\".  I waited a total of over two hours. Now looking for another eye doctor as I won't go back. My time is worth something, too! \nI'm only giving it one star as I had no other choice. I would have given Shepherd Eye Center zero stars.
