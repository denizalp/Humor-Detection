Took my mom, who was visiting, for breakfast. It was the BOMB! I've been to both locations and the food is delicious and, more importantly, CONSISTENT. Portions are hearty, so you may want to share. Sharon, our waitress, was super helpful when we couldn't decide. She steered us in the right direction with that bread cup. It's like a fresh cinnamon roll and they give you a cream cheese cinnamon dip to go with it. It was PERFECTION!\n\nProTip: Get the bread cup. (thanks Sharon) You're welcome!
