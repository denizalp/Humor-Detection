Great location for Summerlin\nA warm welcome greeted me when I entered, inquiring of what kind of haircut I needed\nI needed a smart army style summer cut.\nI was immediately seated with a professional hairstylist and the process started. It was a rather hazel free experience giving other saloons ask so many ???\n\nThe saloon is well equipped, it's got all the latest gadgets. \nWell trained staff n for me they delivered what I asked for a good summer cut.  \n\nI will back here, it will be my local now\nGood place to get your hair done
