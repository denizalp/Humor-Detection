Went to ShadyGrove on Friday night for a quick bite to eat.  The food is just okay.  Well cooked but not really seasoned, so they should probably leave salt and pepper on every table as a standard.  I got the sweet potato tater tots.  The spicy ranch sauce that's served with it is pretty food, but the tots themselves have a weird texture.  Their waffle fries however are a winner.  My best suggestion is to go here for the ambience but not so much the food.
