Went here because of the yelp reviews as it is a little out of the way for us. \nLot's of seating and found the place to be clean. Staff were very friendly and gave some recommendations. The one negative I would say is there is no childrens menu (hint, hint). \nAs for the burgers, we found them to be good and I really enjoyed the fires. Extra point for having malt vinegar.\nOverall we will go back.
