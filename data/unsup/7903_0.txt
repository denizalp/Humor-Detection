I don't understand these rave reviews. My food was inedible. The sweet & sour pork that came with our \"special family dinner\" was rubbery and soggy. Panda Express at least does some quality control and is reliable. Maybe it was because our order was to go during a busy time and they just didn't care? I do not ever want to try to eat this food again. Sorry, Chen & Wok, we were over before we even started.
