Beaudevin is a wine bar \/ tapas \/ sandwich place located within the Charlotte \/ Douglas International Airport.  The place is a little upscale, but cute!  \n\nI ordered the Goat Cheese Baguette and Tomato Soup.  I also tried their Strawberry Peach Bellini.  NOM NOM NOM!  My coworker also got their Artisan Cheese Plate.  Overall a great experience, but a little pricey.\n\nENJOY!!
