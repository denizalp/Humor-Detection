I really love this place. They always do my lashes really full how I like them. There much better then cherry lash lounge because there lashes actually stay on and don't fall off the second week. I have no shedding of lashes from here and that's amazing. The customer service is great they can book sometimes last minute or at your convenience. The lash tech is understanding and nice. They offer cute snacks and they are very clean. The prices are reasonable too. This is my favorite lash place ever and I hope they don't change.
