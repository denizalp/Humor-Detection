Its gotten drastically worse here. Still smells like Raid when you enter. Ill keep my,\"it didnt seem to kill the roaches who work there,\" comment. I cant believe the utter stupidity, rudeness and lack of work erhic, whoever hired these people lacks. So sad. \n\nI called regarding an issue, I knew the answer to, just to verify. Nobody there seemed to know anything aka their job.
