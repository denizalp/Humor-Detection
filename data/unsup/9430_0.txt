The vibe at the Griffin is rad!  It's pretty laid back, dark, and a little bit mysterious.  Ha! The crowd here is not your typical Vegas crowd and for that I am grateful.  The drinks are a little overpriced, but whatever--it's Vegas. \nThe bartenders know what they're doing, which is great.\nThe music is rad.\nIt's a great place to blackout.
