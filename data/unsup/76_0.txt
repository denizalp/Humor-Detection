Got a tongue piercing last night and was super nervous, but Kelly made me feel comfortable by explaining everything he was doing as he did it. Shop was clean and everything he used was sterile and new out of the package. The piercing itself was so fast the pain was minimal. I'm having very minimal pain and swelling for it being the next day! Yay! The price definitely can't be beat! Definitely will be back again! Highly recommend!
