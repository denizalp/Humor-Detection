NEVER buy from this place. tried to tell me I couldn't exchange my swimsuit because \"it is a federal law, and swimsuits are considered intimate apparal.\" Victora's Secret Venus, Zappos and everyone else I have purchased from will let you exchange a swimsuit. Fo God's sake poele, I can't try it on if I am buying online. They REFUSE to help you.\n\nAll in all never trust this company. They're horrible! I hope they go out of business, since they have such unfriendly consumer policies!
