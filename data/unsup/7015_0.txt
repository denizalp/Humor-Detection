Extremely dark., so dark you can't see the outrageous prices properly.\nUnbearable cologne. The smell is so strong, you'll smell faintly like it after you walk out.\nAtrocious service. Most employees have enormous egos and interaction with them is very uncomfortable.\nHalf-Hour waits for the change room during a sale.\n\nThe only thing that can make this location even worse is to have naked models standing in front of the store.
