I am so glad they've expanded! We were exposed to their various pastries at the summer farmers market when we bike down to the Humber Bay Shore Park area. Their croissants are top notch-- flaky, light and delicious! I've tried the danish poppy seed roll and cinnamon snails and both are light and tasty. These pastries are reminiscent of our trip to Denmark, the croissants are also comparable to the pain au chocolat in France.
