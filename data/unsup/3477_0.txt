Saw the \"Wednesday Specials\" sign outside, \"reduced price but not portion\" they said.\n\nWent inside to order 2 special dishes. The waitress with a crappy attitude said \"I don't recommend you ordering more than 1 special dish because the specials are all fried.\"\n\n\"But I don't care about it being fried.\"\n\n\"Yeah but we don't recommend you doing so.\"\n\n\"Are we not aloud to order more than one special or you don't recommend?\"\n\n\"You are not aloud.\"\n\nOrdered 1 special dish with a noodle dish, the dishes were crappier than the service. Avoid at all cost.
