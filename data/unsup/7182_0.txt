DMV is gonna be DMV. Nothing ever improves here. Got parking tickets for a car I sold, because they dont keep the \"ticket people\" updated on car ownership. Had to fill out forms to request papers from Carson City, that I will then have to mail to the \"ticket people\" (because their email doesnt work). This authority failed in performing even one of their most basic things. Why doesnt DMV succeed in doing what actually even the authorities in Europe can manage? Abolish the Government!
