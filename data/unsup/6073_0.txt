I don't shop at Sprouts at often, but each time i visit one, I often find myself wondering why I don't.\n\nThey always have tons of fresh produce set at reasonable prices and plenty of other healthy items that I can't find at other places for such a great deal. \n\nThis particular location is organized and well kept. Clean aisles and well-labeled items. I was impressed.
