We jumped off the lite rail then wore out leather deciding on an eatery. So many great choices downtown & Kincaid's does not disappoint. Staff easily agreed to set us up on the patio and brought out the fine linen tablecloth before our $17 burger arrived. Presentation and taste well worth the splurge; loved the jalapeno stuffed olives and Caesar side salad. Service easily outshown Donovan's and Kincaid's appears to have more pride than to serve an iceberg wedge with not one garnish! You will not confuse this steakhouse with it's competitors.
