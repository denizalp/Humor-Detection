The store and the products are nice even though I am loyal to Android. They have lots of Ipods from Nanos to Touchs. Iphone 4s and Ipads as well. I was really thinking about buying a Ipod Touch however the customer service sucks! I was in the store for at least 20 minutes before someone asked if I needed any help. \n\nAnd to think I was contemplating buying one. \n\nNo thank you! I'll stick to my Evo 4G!
