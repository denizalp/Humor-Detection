Didn't feel like doing anything special for mothers day, so we went here.  I had been here plenty of times before and it was fine.  This time was a little different.  The sign on the front of the door said that there was a mother's day special.  The special was that you got to pay an extra $1 per person for mother's day.  There was no special dish or anything like that.  You just get to pay extra.  I think it's weird to charge extra and not even say happy mother's day.
