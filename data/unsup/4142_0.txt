This place rips off customers! $4 large green tea, yet no refill hot water! Not even I offer to PAY for the hot water! Wanna drink more tea? Sure, buy a new one! I can't believe what I hear... The the so called \"large\" is about the size of medium than other cafe place around, and almost double in price. \nDon't waste your money here!\nPS: their cake is over priced & taste just like sugar...
