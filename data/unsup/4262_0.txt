Good spot with good pizza, particularly the Roasted Corn, but the hype and crowds don't quite justify the hassle.  I go usually when I need to get a gelato fix at Archellinos or my wife has her bi-monthly Tammie Coe Red Velvet cravings.\n\nMemo to LGO ownership:  It's called a parking lot and they were developed to provide ease and convenience to patrons.  I'd recommend looking into getting one.
