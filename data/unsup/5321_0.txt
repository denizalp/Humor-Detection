Pure chaos.  Avoid at all costs until they figure themselves out.  Workers are friendly enough but they really should shut themselves down until they can actually rearrange. Olive oil is on isles 3, 6 and 10.  Rice is conveniently shelved between the breakfast cereal and ground beef.  Log jams of grocery carts everywhere.  Only go to this store if interested in a shopping experience reminiscent of foraging for your next meal in the wilderness.
