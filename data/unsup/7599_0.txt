Trendy and cool atmosphere, but the food is \"just okay\" in my opinion... especially for expensive price. The streak and chicken tacos were good, but the pork was salty as hell, and the salmon was bland. People think since the wait list for a reservation is so long it must be fantastic. It's a trick!
