If you have never been to a CPK what are you waiting for? My fav is the Thai Chicken Pizza and I'm a huge fan of Fettucini Alfredo and Caesar Salads and I never stray from the fav's so one of these items will be on my order.  Nice place to take the kids too especially this location (Inside the Mirage) so you can combine it with the Secret Garden outing. Kids love the Pepperoni and Margherita Pizzas.  The atmosphere is loud but it's Vegas baby!
