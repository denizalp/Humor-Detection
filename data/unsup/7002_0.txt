So glad I used her for a child custody case. Because nothing happened!\nI am glad I used her because my daughter changed her mind and we didn't need the change of custody orders anymore...turns out, Maggie didn't even file anything!\nAnd when I called the court clerk (the court number that, ironically, Maggie had given me,) she mentioned Maggie was known to take money and not process files and cases.  So it all worked out.  Super bummed I paid $150 though...basically, for nothing.
