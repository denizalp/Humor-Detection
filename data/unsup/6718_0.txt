They recently moved to the southwest from UNLV area. The menu looks really good, but the taste is just average. I really liked how quick the service was and some of their decore. However, the taste of their food was disappointing. The lettuce did not look fresh which made the sandwich less appealing. Their pricing is also a bit higher than most sandwich places based on the quality of the items. Overall, a very average place.
