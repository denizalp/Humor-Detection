Great deal for the price. Food was fresh for a cafeteria type setting. For those of you who may shy away from the word cafeteria please don't let that sway your judgement before trying their food. It was worth going there for my first visit and I will try them again in the future.\n\nI enjoyed the hot eggplant dish and cold noodle salad the most.\n\nInexpensive, great food for a fast bite, and very decent portion for the price.
