My husband and I stopped here for the happy hour specials. We ordered the bread, zucchini and mussels. I noticed something strange poking out of the mussel, i pulled it out and OMGGGG SO GROSS it was a CRAB! I showed the waiter and he looked horrified. The manager came to our table and said it was a crab, it's fresh seafood and that happens once in a while. Hmmm I was so grossed out i totally lost my appetite. I don't think I'll eat mussels ever again. I feel the manager could\/should have done more.
