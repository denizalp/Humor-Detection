Kaizen is at a great location. We came because it was very close to our hotel after we got to Las Vegas after midnight, and it was surprisingly amazing! (So I decide to give my first yelp review ever)\n\nThe staff was really nice and friendly, he recommended us the avocado train and a few other rolls which were all great. The fish was pretty fresh and the sauce was delicious! Highly recommend the avocado train if you're a big fan of avocado :)\n\nThey also had happy hour which we could buy one drink and get another free :)
