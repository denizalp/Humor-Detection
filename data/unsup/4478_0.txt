Pretty great hotel! I usually pick Omni or the W, but I like Mountain Shadows a lot. Staff is super helpful and accommodating. Views are great. Rooms are spacious. However, I didn't have hot water. Not to be a stickler, but taking cold showers isn't fun. I'm sure it was just due to the fact the It's brand new, and some things are still under construction. Nonetheless, you have to have hot water when you are paying a premium.\n\nAll in all, I liked it a lot.
