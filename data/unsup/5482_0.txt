Rude! I don't spend my money anywhere I don't feel welcomed. Walked in, there was only one gentleman sitting and a staff of 5 behind the bar not one person greeted me. The girls were just chatting with each other and continued. Another guy came in for a pickup and he too was left to wait while they continued to gossip until he could finally get a word in and ask for his order. Sorry but bad service means no money from me! I walked out. This is Vegas, there are other places to eat.
