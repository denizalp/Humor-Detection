The meat sits in a disgusting amount of grease and the servers behind the line don't even make an effort to drain out the grease before they dump the meat on your plate. \n\nUpon checking out my steak salad, I wasn't even offered a beverage....awesome. \n\nFood quality would've been better if My taco salad didn't have a pool of liquid grease on the bottom...now I can't even eat the tortilla because it's drenching. Such a shame because the tortilla is really good too.\n\nAwesome sauce, pun not intended.
