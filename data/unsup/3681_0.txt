Very nice atmosphere.  The staff wasn't very excited. She looked like she wanted to kill me. \n\nWe got a smart cookie and blended green tea smoothie. Both were alright. \n\nThe green tea smoothie tasted nothing like green tea. It tasted like she poured milk and blended and added a scoop of sugar. \n\nNot my favorite place to go. Went to Starbucks right after...
