Food was ok. Service was very slow despite a non busy time of the day. Our beer glass came broken and it took them forever to replace and they still charged us for it. Also they brought us a different order than we asked and we were charged wrong. However, the waiter just laughed and kept the bill as it was. Needless to say we will never be back.
