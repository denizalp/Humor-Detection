DO NOT EAT HERE! CREDIT CARD FRAUD.\n\nI have been twice and both times by credit card number has been stolen along with everyone I ate with.  I have had to report the fraud to my bank on two separate occasions with 2 different accounts.  3 of my girlfriends have reported fradulent activities on their account as well.  I will be submitting a report to the Federal Trade Commision as well.  The waiter that works there must be stopped - and he is the only one ever working so I know it's him.\n\nIf I could leave 0 stars I would.
