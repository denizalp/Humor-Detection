Been living in Old town since March 1 2015. Being 25 I love to go out for dinner and drinks but in old town it's not easy as the entire city of Phoenix flocks there. \n\nMy recommendation, go to Salty's and see my man Jeramy. This guys attention to his customer base is impeccable. Working the bar like a champ but won't neglect you for a minute. I feel guilty because if he serviced me anymore than he already does I think I'd be cheating on my girlfriends.
