Really?  Did I eat at the same place as my fellow reviewers?  Did I order the wrong items?  Or maybe I just totally disagree with most of the other reviews...yeah, I think that's it.  The place was pretty clean.  The staff was polite.  The food was kind of gross...not nasty disgusting gross but geez..this food tastes like cardboard gross.  I ate here a second time because I figured everyone deserves a second chance, right?  Wrong.
