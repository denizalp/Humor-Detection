Im always worried about sushi joints in Toronto as I have heard plenty of horror stories. This made me skeptical about O Sushi... Boy was I wrong! Probably the BEST and freshest sushi Ive ever had. Great service, the gent that took my take out order was super helpful and totally bent to my \"extra soya sauce and looottss of wasabi\" request while most places must think Im joking about how much I love wasabi. The salmon was super fresh and delish, gyoza amazing and service welcoming. Will deff be back for more!
