I think Ajisen Rame is the BEST I've ever eaten in Toronto.\nI had the BBQ Pork Ramen. The soup was rich and not sailty, and BBQ Pork was sooooo yummy!! It's like a real Japanese Ramen! The food always comes fast, it's about 3~4 min!! Also price and location are good.\n\nIf you want to eat a good ramen, I really recomend Ajisen Ramen.\nI wanna go there again and try another Ramen!
