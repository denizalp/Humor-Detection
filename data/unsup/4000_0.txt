Love this place! It's huge! There are lots of clothes to look at and try on. You really need a couple days to go through this place thoroughly! If I'm being picky.. I really wish they had a snack bar or something because it takes so long to go through this place that it's sad that you have to leave just because you're hungry and thirsty! Hint, hint!
