My grandmother lived here for many years. In the beginning everything was acceptable. As time went by everything went downhill including food, cleaning staff, maintenance and management. Did everything but catch the cleaning staff in the act of stealing from residents rooms. Do your loved ones a favor and look elsewhere!
