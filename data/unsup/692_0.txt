Whoa.  Talk about gluttony.  Wonderful wonderful gluttony!  \n\nHaving missed out on the Vegas buffet experience the last time we made it point this time.  And since we were staying in the Bellagio, and it's supposedly the \"it\" buffet on the strip our decision was easy!  \n\nSushi, and meats, and cheeses, and fish and gorgeous salad bad!  Oh my goodness!  So after 3 plates, and then 3 tiny dessert plates we walked out ashamed to have eaten so much and took a nap like you would on Thanksgiving!  Except, I definitely did not wake up wanted seconds!  Stuffed!
