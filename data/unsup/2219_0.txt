Space City Assembly saved me days worth of work and a million miles of frustration. Amanda was kind, prompt and thorough in her communication. She scheduled me easily, and followed up as necessary. Vincent is a gem. He was kind, on time and efficient in his assembly. I cannot say enough about this company. If you have anything that needs assembly, give them a call.
