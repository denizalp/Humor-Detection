10.14.10 + 10.16.10\n\nThere has been a string of new club openings (and closings) in Vegas since my trip in October.  So, in my limited sense of how the scene is there now, Surrender is my new favorite club.\n\nPoles by the tables?  Check.\nOutdoor and indoor seating?  Check.\nShorter lines than XS and Tryst?  Double check.\nTables to gamble on and free drinks?  Check.\n\nLove.
