The Venetian is the ideal hotel to stay on the strip due to its location, price, rooms, and overall resort. All of its rooms are suites, so you are always guaranteed plenty of space. The check-in process was quick and easy as well. I really appreciated their customer service when we raised concerns about our original room. I highly make sure you get a room in the main Venetian towers as it's closer to the casino, entrance\/exit, and main shops.\n\nSuch a beautiful and classy hotel in Las Vegas along with prime location to all the nearest clubs and restaurants!
