Easily earning five stars from me, the iconic Bellagio Fountains are another must-visit for visitors to Las Vegas.  Even being a resident since 1992, I still enjoy the water show synchronized with tunes that range from Frank Sinatra to Bruno Mars to Celine Dion to the Beatles.  And you can also run into Mickey and Minnie Mouse, a Minion, Chewbacca, and Pokemon on the sidewalks.  People-watching and fountain-gazing all for free in front of the Bellagio.
