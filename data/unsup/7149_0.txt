It's been a while since my last review but I am happy to report that after all these years, Town and Country Dental is still amazing and Dr. Phan is still awesome. \n\nThere is a fairy new dental hygienist and she is gentle during x-rays and cleaning. She even remembered where the area I have sensitivity. \n\nStill open on Saturday which is ultra-convenient to my schedule. \n\nBonus: Suzuya is next door so you can treat yourself to a nice treat after!
