DON'T DO IT!!  Absolutely disgusting! Seeing the other reviews, I gave it a shot..  I ordered a Chicken Basil dish, which tasted nothing like my favorite Thai dish.. Instead, I got a few pieces of sliced chicken, one slice of red pepper,  and loads of onions SWIMMING in a brown greasy, oily tasteless substance that masqueraded as sauce.  They don't deserve a dime for the slop I just ate.  Gruel in a North Korean prison camp could not have been much worse.
