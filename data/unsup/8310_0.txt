Average strip mall bar. I would not go out of my way to go here but if you do you are treated well, good food, good drinks and good service. \n\nThe drinks are on the weaker side no over pouring here. They are a little on the expensive side as well. They are not bad just not amazing. \n\nThe staff is good, a little slow on the bar side, but it works. \n\nThey do some Trivia type stuff that gets fun. Plenty of seats and screens to view sports etc.
