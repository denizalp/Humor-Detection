Really disappointed about this restaurant. I believe the decoration\/service\/portions doesn't match the price family size restaurant they are selling to the customers\nI am giving then 3 stars for the flavor. The food was incredible but it was a little difficult to enjoy with such a bad service. \nWe ordered the octopus, tzatziki, lamb and asparagus. It was all delicious but the presentation was poor.\nAlso in such an \"elegant\" restaurant the server took out of the table the check before we left looking at the tip and giving us a negative attitude.
