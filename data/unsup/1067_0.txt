Needed a cup of coffee, this place was open and in the neighborhood. It was totally acceptable. \n\nThey've got that mismatching furniture, random weird mug, hipster vibe going on, that's become so popular in coffee shops. I didn't have anything to eat, but the ham and cheese croissant is apparently highly recommended. \n\nIt was good, but Cafe Névé is better and more convenient, so we didn't return.
