Yum yum yum!\nMy favourite after work or Saturday afternoon place to go when I'm looking for something meaty and juicy. Their pulled pork always fills me but I can't resist getting a rib or corn bread & baked beans on the side. Fair priced for delicious food, and my favourite part is picking my own BBQ sauce so I can make it as saucy as I want (very!). I've only ever had the pulled pork but my man insists the man-wich is the way to go. Always friendly service and great food.
