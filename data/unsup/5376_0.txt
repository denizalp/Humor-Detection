I love this shop. It's clean, professional and filled with talented artists. I was tattooed by Jill, she is a true artist and I felt completely taken care of. You can tell that they are like family to each other and the shop vibe is so comfortable. I have already recommended this shop to tons of people and I plan on going back again.
