Small, intimate venue for shows\/concerts in the middle of downtown. The bar is located at the end of the ballroom, near the bathrooms. There are three rows of \"stadium\" seating toward the back, facing the stage. Overall, clean, cute atmosphere and cheap drinks - $5 for my usual vodka cranberry. Had a great time seeing Yus, Mas Ysa, and EMA here - and Crescent Ballroom made the event free - which was awesome!
