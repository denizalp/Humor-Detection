I know you get what you pay for\nIncluding ambiance but I went last night and it was pathetic, there were three younger boys there standing and jumping around on the booth, leaning OVER the counter while eating and playing with sauces, spices, and food tickets. They were practically yelling while talking to whoever they knew in the kitchen...then when they were bored of that they decided to ride their penny board and scooters while inside running into tables and stuff. Seriously?
