Dropped in for a quick lunch and was fairly underwhelmed.\n\nThe blue cheese potato chip appetizer was all it's cracked up to be.  Aside from that, I was not impressed.\n\nMy prosciutto panini had great potential, but was not at all warm, which really makes me wonder about its preparation.  The pasta salad it was served with was warmer.\n\nThe wife went light and got a Caesar salad.  Meh.\n\nService was a bit lacking for 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon with a sea of empty tables.  Not a great experience, certainly not one I would want my name associated with.
