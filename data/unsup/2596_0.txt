I wanted a short cut for an interview with decent edging.  My barber there did a great job with my hair, even and sharp throughout.  The price was excellent and the atmosphere was very friendly.  I saw guys of all ages there getting various styles of hair cutting done and didn't hear anyone going away unsatisfied.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a barber shop as the name states, not a salon.\n\n2nd trip back to get a haircut turned out as well as the first.
