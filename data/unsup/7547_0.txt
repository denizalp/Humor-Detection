macarons taste good, but texture is not that chewy, very soft moist., I love rose and coffee flavour. The problem with Laduree is slow service. Takes forever to get a box of macarons because all these employees have to put the macarons carefully since they dont have clear plastic macaron packages like other stores have, so it takes longer time for them to put macarons in a box and put a ribbon.on it.. I've noticed some of girls were having hard time to put macarons with limited space in the box..
