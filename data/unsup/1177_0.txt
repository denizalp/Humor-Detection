This boba place isn't really a stand-out for me.  I want to like it more than I do because the service is super friendly, and the location is convenient.  Tonight I stopped in after dinner to get a Thai Tea.  The Thai Tea was a little bit flat tasting, and when I order Pomegranate Tea, it's a little bit like flavored sugar water.  \n\nFriendly people, but the drinks are a little bit off for me.
