Allo Mon Coco is my favorite breakfast chain, their food is quite good. My favorite dish is called the coco waffles, which consists of eggs, bacon, a mountain of fruit and of course a big waffle. The staff are polite and knowledgeable. The only knock is that I wish they came around more to refill my coffee. Overall, a solid experience.
