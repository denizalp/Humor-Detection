My mind cant comprehend how anyone can give Jerry's less than 5 stars, let alone bash it.\n\nCome on, people. \n\nA gigantic collection of records at insanely cheap prices, isn't good enough for you? You can always go down the street and pay 30 bucks for punk albums.\n\nSidenote: I've found most of my new-wave, 80s hardcore and most of my punk albums FROM Jerrys. They even have a few punk crates of \"good stuff\". Guess you Missed that, Stefan.\n\nJokes.
