This Goodwill isn't terrible, but like all of the Goodwills that I have been to in the Cleveland area so far it is very, very small.\n\nGoodwill is definitely quite different here.  Small, skinny stores with a few racks of clothing, maybe 2 pieces of furniture, and a couple shelves of miscellaneous stuff.  Where I come from, Goodwill's are department store sized with all sorts of interesting stuff.\n\nOther than being tiny, this place is ok.  I wouldn't be expecting to find anything too cool on the clothes racks, but I guess there is always a chance.
