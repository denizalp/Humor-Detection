I was visiting Las Vegas and stumbled upon club tattoo. I had a tattoo in mind that would have kept one busy for hours in probably a few sessions. However the quote I got was absolutely disgusting 5,000 dollars what a joke!!!! Never will I step in or refer anybody to that place. It gets better the friends i was with wanted a 3 letter sentence tattoo and they were quoted 200.00 dollars each!! Really ???? Go else where or get raped!!!!
