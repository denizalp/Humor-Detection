This place is really freakin' cool - it's Asian Market insanity (but in a good way) in here. The place is packed on Saturday but still a lot of fun! The prices are very reasonable (if not cheap).\n \nAmazing selection of hard to get Asian vegetables. Tons of beautiful bok choy and other greens! Fresh seafood! A pound of shrimp was only $5!!! Cooking supplies, a million kinds of tea and snacks! All those are hard to find items are basics here!\n\nI always feel like I'm on some great adventure when I come here!!
