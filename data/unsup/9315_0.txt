What you pay is what you get. \nAlthough staff are great,  this place is not fit to be a fitness club.   Haven't seen any place so filthy like this.  No one know how to clean up after themselves.  There is only one stall in men washroom.  Always dirty.  No water fountain. \nThis place should not be allow to operate when you have a fitness facility with no water fountain and only one stall in the washroom. \nFIT FOR LESS.
