When we lived in Arizona, we came to this bar frequently during football season (as we are Eagles fans and needed to watch them somewhere with a satellite).  The food is pretty standard bar food, but there were lots of TVs, both indoors and outdoors.  They have the waitresses all hooched out, but we always received fantastic service.  Food is not overly memorable, but I did like:\n\nCajun Chicken Salad ($7.25) - Just like it sounds, and I would get the fat-free tomato basil dressing.\n\nThe Big Club ($7.25) - With fries.  Pretty good club.
