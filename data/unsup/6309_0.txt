Was at the main bar after laughing our butts off at the improve. Got a beer right away. Then  all 4 of us became invisible.  3-4 bartenders saw my empty beer glass. And I tried to get their attention,for a half hour. Never got a 2nd beer. And it took another 15 to pay the bill. They weren't busy.  If I was by myself,I would of walked out with out paying.   No tip!
