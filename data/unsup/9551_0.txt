Excellent food. The jerk chicken is juicy and not too spicy. Very tasty. The rice & pea is moist but not mushy; it can be enjoyed without gravy if you please. The ackee & salt fish is the best in GTA. Hands down. The fried dumpling is hot & crisp. I can't tell you where this little giant restaurant came from but their chefs rival some of Toronto's best chefs. Sometimes there's no good reason to fix or change \"tried & true\".
