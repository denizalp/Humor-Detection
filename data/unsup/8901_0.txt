I suck at bowling, but to get to here I wasn't crazy from Angela was so worth the four gutters I got in a row. I got to meet a lot of new and cool people, and some that I had been waiting a while to actually meet! Everyone was so cool and fun- even when it got to 2 am and a pimp starting handing out twenties. Now that I will never forget.
