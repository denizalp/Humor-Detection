Went this past Saturday night, and like everyone's said:\n\n- the outside of the club is worth the just the admission - paid $30 cover\n- drinks are $14-16 - jack and coke was strong, mind eraser was perfect\n- club makeup was about 90% Asian - that was fine with me, I'm EOE.\n- dance floor was packed - a little small in proportion to the entire place\n- got there around 10 - wait was about 10 minutes\n- females were pretty aggressive in all aspects, seemed like most of them listened to 'Took The Night' by Chelley on their drive to Vegas.
