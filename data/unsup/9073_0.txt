Mark's A\/C and Heating put an A\/C on a home I was buying during escrow for the seller. I was having some issues with it after I moved in and asked Mark to come look at it.\n\nIt took a few times calling and scheduling with him before he came but he did eventually come. He and his tech fixed the issue pretty quickly and now everything is good!
