Darn right it's \"Not Just Noodles\". \n\nI was a regular for their lunch special until I had the misfortune of ordering their noodle soup. It wasn't just noodles. It had:\n-broth\n-bbq pork\n-bok choi\n-won tons\n-a big ol'  dead fly. \n\n...you can guess which ingredient led to this review. \n\nI haven't been back since.
