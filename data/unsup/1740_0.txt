One of the best independent bookstores anywhere!!  They do what B&N\nand especially Amazon can't - give awesome personal service.  If you \nknow what you want, chances are they have it or will get it quickly or if you \nwant a suggestion, they do that and quite well.\n\nTheir support of local\/NC writers is the best I've found anywhere. \n\nI hope Indies like PRB are around for years & years to come.  If we lose\nstores like this, we will lose one of the most important part of ourselves.
