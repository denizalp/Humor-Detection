This place has become a favorite weekend lunch spot for my girlfriend and I. Try the Thai Chicken Roll Up and the Sweet Potato fries. The place has friendly service and a great roof top patio for the summer. If you're grabbing food with friends, definitely get the S'mores desert, delicious and fun!\n\nI don't usually write a lot of reviews, but thought this place deserved some love. It's definitely a surprising standout on strip that has a lot of lesser options.\n\nEdit: -1 for poor vegetarian options.
