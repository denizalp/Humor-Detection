Good place for late night food. And they serve above average pizza... not the usual cookie cutter dominos or pizza hut or whatever. I like the premise of this place being secret but when I got in line, and it was a long line... I figured it wasn't so secret. I do like the decorations on the wall! Got my pizza and went outside to eat on the couches.\n\nAnyway, good place inside the cosmo for a quick meal and then back to partying! :)
