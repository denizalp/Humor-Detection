08\/20\/11\n\nStill enjoying the carved woodwork.  Was still full from BBQ lunch, so I only ordered the fried tofu salad, while sisters and BIL split a couple of delicious-looking entrees.  I really enjoyed my salad-- the peanut salad dressing was almost addicting!\n\nPrompt and courteous service, w\/out the snobbery we've encountered in other recent jaunts.  Maybe we'll go back for a proper meal before we leave for home...
