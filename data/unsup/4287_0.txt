I'm so fond of Hubbard Avenue Diner in spite of eating there exclusively with my ex-fiance, who turned out to be a complete tool.  The point is, that's how good this place is.  I can vouch for the breakfasts (spinach omelet as well as whole grain blueberry pancakes) as well as the lunch\/dinner menu and pie.  I had their tuna steak sandwich once, and it was good but not great.  My standby is the veggie burger, which is just right.  There always seems to be a wait, but it's been worth it for this FIB.
