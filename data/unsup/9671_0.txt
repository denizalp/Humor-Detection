I regretfully must inform you that after two times of screwing up my oil changes, I WILL NOT be coming back to this Quick Lane place of business. After confronting them that they did not complete the job this 2nd time, and them saying I can't prove it, besides what my family mechanic showed me (old, low oil just weeks after i had it changed here), the manager, Josh, wouldn't even bother to give me my money back.  Save yourself the headache, try your oil changes somewhere else!
