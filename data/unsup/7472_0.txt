Needed to find someone to bathe our new Scottie that we rescued, I used Yelp and found Wiggles & Wags with all good reviews. Now I can give them another 5 stars. They were friendly and professional and did a great job at a very resonable price and will continue to use them for all of Mr. Barnee's needs.
