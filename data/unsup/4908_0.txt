Beautiful new location on Monkland Ave. Loving the new menu too. The dinner options are as awesome as are the brunch ones. Always creative and always delicious! I had the PEI moules et frites as a main and the fried chocolate chip cookie dough for dessert...Holy sweet explosion of goodness in my mouth. Service was great as usual, very attentive. Have I mentioned how much their cocktails kick ass? Well, they do. I'm a big fan of their wine selection too. You're in for a fun and tasty culinary experience.
