We needed bottled water for Jr. Yelpers who complained because the faucet water (from Hoover Dam) tastes funny.  That's what happens when you're spoiled from SF drinking water from Hetch-Hetchy reservoir.   Additionally, Jr. Yelper and hubby needed to hydrate from their colds that surfaced during our trip.  Jr. Yelper's lips were dry and I needed to pick up a lip balm.  Had no idea other Yelpers come here predominately for the booze until I started to read the reviews. They have stuff here pretty typical of most pharmacies including their own labeled items (lip balm).
