Im a foodie alll day! And I love a great buffet!  Ive been to a few sense my 30 day business stay in vegas and this is by far the best food good selection and worth the price. Brick oven pizza!  Already open crab legs...so you dont starve trying to get to them lol. And hello to the unlimited wine and beer (self serve) hmm what else well wiat tell you see what I had for dessert in the pics...and the biggest selection ive seen at a buffet!
