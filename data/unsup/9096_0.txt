This spot took me back to London-town.\nThe menu is on a chalkboard as you walk in, they also have paper menu's you can select from.\nThe fish was crispy, fresh, and greasy (like it should be).  Served with a whole bundle of fries (they were a tad overdone) and wooden spork.\nI don't think you can go wrong with any of the fish selections, the hake was tasty and made perfectly.\nSit at the bar area as it's great for people-watching.
