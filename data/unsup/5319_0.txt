I usually don't give bad reviews, but my experience last night at this establishment was SO bad, that I had to find my rusty Yelp account to share my horrendous experience at this Texas de Brazil.\n\nTL\/DR: Waited too long to get subpar, inconsistent food. Terrible Service. Wasted 2.5 hours. They can't manage the place when big groups show up. Just hope that there are no big groups when you go in to dine.
