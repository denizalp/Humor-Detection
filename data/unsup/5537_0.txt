Great place to eat and a cool local spot to chill. The staff is super nice and the chef is really cool. The food is amazing. At par or even better than some of the restaurants on the strip doing Japanese fusion. The sea bass was perfect and the sauce went perfectly with it. Jeffrey one of the servers is really nice and helpful with suggesting items. \nI will definitely be back again.
