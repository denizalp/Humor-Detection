Inaugural visit on a groupon. Came at happy hour and sampled fine specialty cocktails, and numerous entrees all at 7 bux. Everything was tasty, service was stellar, and the atmosphere was 4 star and very comfortable. Short ribs, lobster potstickers, wagyu sliders, ebi rolls, udon, crab fried rice,  mai tais and martinis on the happy hour bill. Great way to sample many fares and walk out with some green still in your wallet. Definitely recommended and will be returning!
