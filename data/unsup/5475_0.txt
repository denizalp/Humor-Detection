It's too safe.  Haha.. I know that sounds ridiculous, but it really shouldn't be called a zipline.  I've been zip lining right outside of Vegas in Boulder City.... and that was the real deal, of course it was like 8 times more expensive, but totally worth every cent.  It was a fun experience with our big group.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  Would I do it again?  Probably not.  I needed some James Bond in my life.. and this did not suffice.
