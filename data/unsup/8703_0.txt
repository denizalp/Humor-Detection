Rating has nothing to do with this being a big box store or hatred of Walmart, i actually like shopping there from time to time. \n\nBUT, this location Pharmacy is the worst. Slow employees who dont know how to do their job. Pick up line always has 4 or 5 people in line. Cant remember to even ask for an insurance card at drop off and assume u r paying cash. Then they make u wait over and hr. Worst ever gonna stick with Walgreens that is better but a little more inconvenient.
