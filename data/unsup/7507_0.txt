Outdated, beat up items.  Worse, they are ridiculously overpriced.  Guess they're counting on all the snowbirds\/tourists who perhaps don't know any better!  The \"willing to bargain\" philosophy another poster mentioned?  Non-existent.  If you catch them on the right day, they might offer you a mere 10% off an item that's been lingering for six months! \n\nThe Grotto Cafe?  Cute with a \"music vibe\" decor and a nice patio.  Food is below mediocre and the service haphazard. This entire complex has so much potential....but they're just coasting....
