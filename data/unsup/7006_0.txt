Sicilian sandwich was great!  Potato salad seemed fresh and homemade.  Had to get food to go, was ready in 15 min.  Bar tender was extremely nice, menu unique and big.  Hope it stays in business long enough to try more items!\n\nThe \"t\" reminds me of a creepy cross that a modern mega-church would use.  Luckily there is not any type of cult-church thing going on inside the restaurant!
