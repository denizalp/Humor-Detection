Hmm.... How should I describe this place. \nEPIC!!!! I wish I could end here, but I want to give this place a five star. So, I must continue on and re-stating what other 650 people have already mentioned. Because my review gets added as a tip, not a review.\n\nI love the fresh salsa made from scratch with a hint of Korean flavor. Its like J-Lo marrying Psy!! No, I am just kidding. All of the food I ordered here were fresh and superb and packed with fresh veggies and flavor! Very good price with fast friendly servers!!!
