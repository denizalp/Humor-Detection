How is this place rated so high?  Meatlovers omelet. .does not come with cheese???  What holds it together??  Nothing!!!  Very bland.  Jamms French Toast is cereal coated bread dipped in egg milk and fried..no flavor at all.  Home Fries were potato mush with peppers and onions. Coffee --no flavor.  The Bacon was the only thing that was enjoyable.  Off The List!
