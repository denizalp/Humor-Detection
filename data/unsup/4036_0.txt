Can I please have the huge FAO Schwartz horse that was there, please?\n\nWell, this H&M is a beast. It's huge and my boyfriend went bonanza in the men's section (the largest I've seen yet). Since I came on the opening weekend, there were mega deals and some items were super cheap. I was somewhat overwhelmed by the shear square footage.
