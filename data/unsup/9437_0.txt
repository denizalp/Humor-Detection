Very friendly waitress, excellent bread excellent  choccimisu for dessert. The veal parmigiana for lunch was rather small and thin and could not cut it with a fork, had to use knife and fork for every bite. Did i mention it was thin yes very thin. Side of pasta tasted OK. Grilled warm sliced mushroom salad was fine. I really was hoping for large portions like other reviewers said to take some home for lunch but it was not the case today.
