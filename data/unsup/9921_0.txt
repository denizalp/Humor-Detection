Do yourself a favor and avoid this location it is a disaster. So poorly managed, the manager is ill equipped and clearly doesn't belong managing anywhere. Literally food was not coming up being lost, huh. The owner\/general manager needs to be present and or cooperate needs to step in.  Just discovered I must be losing my mind, ordered my food at 7:35 and as I write this its 8:13 still waiting on my food.
