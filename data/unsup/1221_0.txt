I just picked up my Audi, today, from New Look.  I cannot give them enough stars based on their customer service and workmanship.  Excellent customer service!!!  Special kudos to Erika Lopez, from New Look, and Nick Fabiano, from Geico.  Because of these two, it made a seemingly bad experience, into an almost pleasurable one.  Excellent body work.  \nI am so ready to criticize bad customer service that I have received, that I felt I needed to recognize the companies, and employees that go out of their way to do their jobs well.\nKeep up the good work, New Look.
