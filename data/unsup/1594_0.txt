If you enjoy watching flies that require ground clearance from the FAA prior to taking off buzz around you as you eat your \"authentic\" Mexican food, then you are in for a treat here!\n\nAs for me, I don't particularly enjoy dining in an establishment that clearly has no time for meeting some minimal health & sanitation standards. Disgusting.
