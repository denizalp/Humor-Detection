As a total newbie to the world of (building) electronics, physical computing, Arduinos, etc., Creatron is an absolute treasure.\n\nThe owners are knowledgeable, helpful (as anywhere, a good question will get you a good answer, but they are still generally willing to suffer newbies like me), and have made an earnest effort to merchandise the great array of microcontroller kits\/shields\/components they carry in a way that's accessible to the budding hobbyist\/hacker\/interactive artist.\n\nGo Creatron, go!
