This was my first Cirque show. It was a 2 hour show at the Mirage Hotel. \n\nAt points throughout the show, I did not know where to look because there was so much stuff going on everywhere. It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I did not grow up in The Beatles time period of history so I was just \"eh\" about it, but after this show... I just wanna go home and download all their albums. Everyone should go watch it !
