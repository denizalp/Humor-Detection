The Swizzle Inn, a five star dive.  It's like comfort food, bad for your health but also very comforting.  \n\nIf you find yourself in the position of having a designated driver and really want to tie one on without judgemental eyes holding you back - come to the Swizz!  You could fall off your bar stool and hop right back up without anyone blinking an eye.
