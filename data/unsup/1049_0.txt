The classic Smashburger had good flavor. It was a little messy to eat and layers tended to slide around - like you had to eat the whole thing without putting it down. And it didn't taste quite as good after I looked up the calorie-count.  Fries were very greasy. Likely will eat elsewhere next time through Sky Harbor Airport.
