Thought I would get some barbecue for my flight but the service is so slow I did not get to order any food.  Four people behind the counter only one of them was serving customers. When I told them that I was not going to wait any longer they were surprised and said I didn't even know you were there.  One of the people that was there was the manager. So unless you have a lot of time I would not bother eating there.
