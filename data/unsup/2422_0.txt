Cheap drinks, cool location, okay patio, super cute and sweet server, whats not to love?\n\nI'm pretty sure they made a mistake on our bill..\n\nWe had 2 pitchers of Canadian, a Caesar salad and a plate of pretty much the worst nachos Ive ever had, but I forgive it, for under 40 bucks?\n\nI will defo be back here. Its cute + cheap + convenient. \n\nAlso, why did I have to google how to spell Caesar. What's wrong with me.
