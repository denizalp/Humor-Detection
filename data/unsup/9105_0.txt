I didn't eat here so I feel bad for the three star because the food could be great.  Unfortunately, they don't speak English and we were unable to order because we had know idea what anything was other than \"pork\". The only word they said.  There's about six\nPeople working and they lacked communication.   \nWe love good Cuban and always looking for some great food.  \n\nMy husband speaks Spanish and he still couldnt get the gist of what they were saying.  \nI hope they do well, they'd do better if we knew what we were about to order.
