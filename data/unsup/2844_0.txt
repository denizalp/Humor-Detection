Hands down the best Thai place I have ever been to! The pad we ew was amazing!!! You must try it! The flat noodles were so good. And the Tom yum soup was so yummy too! The place isn't too big so during rush times I would try to go early if you have a big party. The service was great and the atmosphere was nice. We also shared the honey toast and it was so good! Great for sharing!! I can't wait to be back in Vegas to have Thai food here again.
