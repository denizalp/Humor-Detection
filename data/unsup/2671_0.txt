ANOTHER YELP WIN!\n\nawesome vegan brunch. the sis & I split the french toast & bfast burrito.  both were incredible.  tasty soy latte, too.\n\nkids had all kinds of modifications & special requests- not a single eye was rolled.\n\nlove the sleek, modern decor. service was great. went on a Sunday at prime brunch time & there was no problem with the wait.
