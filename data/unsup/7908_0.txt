Staff is rude, they didn't check to see what my insurance covered before sitting me. The guy at the front desk who is the \"insurance guy\" needs to stop gossiping with his staff and actually do his job. I'll never come here or recommend this place to anyone. If I could give this place 0 stars I would.
