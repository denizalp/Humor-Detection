Rolled up with a flat tire. Thought I was in luck, AAA approved shop to repair my tire. Walked up to the front door where a few gentlemen were talking. One man asked, can I help you?  I said yes, I have a flat tire. He immediately said, WE ARE CLOSED before I could even ask for help he said it again!  I said really you can't help me? He said NO!  I am going to tell everybody and post this story until I turn blue in the face. Talk about crappy service!!!
