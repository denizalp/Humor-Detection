After losing a bet at the sports book, I headed over here to drown my sorrows in cheese fries. Unfortunately, I noticed several uncleared tables who didn't finish their fries at all and took that as a bad omen.\nStrawberry milkshake was average- several strawberries, which made for irritating sipping through a straw. Flavor was okay, seemed on the bland side unless you had a bit of strawberry in your mouth but didn't have that artificial taste I dislike.
