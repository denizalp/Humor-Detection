Have stopped in here a few times now and I have not been disappointed, the prime Filets are amazing!!!!!  They have dry aged prime rib but I have yet to try it.  Prices are not cheap but great things rarely are, give them a try if you want 5 star restaurant quality meats!!  If you over cook things or season them badly, that's not the butchers fault, if you're going to spend the money, research and learn how to cook meats properly!!
