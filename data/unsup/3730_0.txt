Every time I step foot in this specific building, I walk out feeling like I got swindled. The non smart phones they offer are terrible. When I had questions to ask the clerk, he kept looking at his damn phone. Terrible customer service and it takes forever for them to process a transaction. I will probably drive a little further for better service and options.
