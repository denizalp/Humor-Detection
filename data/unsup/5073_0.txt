I have been going to relaxing nails for nearly five years now and I wouldn't choose any other salon to get my nails and waxing done! They are always so kind and really care about the customers experience. They make you feel extremely comfortable, always make good conversation, and their work is incredible!!! I'm in love with this place and I'll continue going here!!  I've never left unhappy! ten out of ten for sure!
