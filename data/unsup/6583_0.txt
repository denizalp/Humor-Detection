Please speak english when customers are present! Don't hide behind your language! There should be a sign on the door to come prepared with GOOGLE TRANSLATE ! It's very rude to paying customers to feel uncomfortable! Clearly good customer service isn't priority! I felt rushed after another  customer couldn't wait her turn! Until the pedicure  chairs come equipped with language translating devices..... I won't be back!!!! BTW my experience happened 2 weeks ago! On my way to get my nails done now! I got pissed off just thinking about this business!
