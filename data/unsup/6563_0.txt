This place is filthy! The windows havn't been dusted or cleaned. Bugs flying.  The staff is sweeping the floor at the same time as placing the pizzas in the oven. The floor needs  washing. There doesn't seem to be any management in charge. However,  the food tastes great and the young staff has good customer service skills. Just hope we don't get sick afterwards.
