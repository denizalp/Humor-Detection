The food was AMAZING!  We went there for restaurant week and the experience was very delightful.  You always expect to be rotated out quickly during that week, but we didn't feel that way at all this year.\n\nThey didn't offer a lot in terms of a gluten free menu.  No worries though, you'll still find something (possibly with a substitution).  Something else that stood out to me was the available parking.  There's plenty of it so don't worry.\n\nI definitely recommend this place due to the great food, great service, and location.
