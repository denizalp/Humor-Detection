Fun place to take my children. A lot of great exhibits. Wish they had everything you see in other yelper's photos. \n\nAlso, very sad to see that state of their seahorse tank that was featured on Tanked. The seahorse was run down, dirty, and all beat up. Chunks of the display were missing. The stripes on the poles were stripped off and missing. Does not turn. Every time we see a tank built for a local business, they always look rundown and depressing. \n\nWhy even get a tank, if you're just going to neglect it?
