been to many clubs in vegas and the first time i went here was years ago... dancers tossing cash into the dance floor..i picked up enough for three drinks with leftover cash even after tipping... score!!!\n\nnow XS or Marquee you ask...?\n\nXS is best for drinking and getting drunk while Marquee is best for the \"other stuff\" cause they have all the pretty lights and trippy dancers balacing swords on their heads.... =)
