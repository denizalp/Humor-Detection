Had the spicy scallop roll ($6.99) and spicy tuna roll ($5.99). The rolls were fresh and inside had some spicy sauce with onions, fish eggs, and crunchy bits. And little rice is always a win! They're usually pretty busy during lunch hour, but service and food came fast. Their lunch special bento boxes are a good price around the $10-12 range. Been coming here for awhile and definitely a popular Markham sushi joint.
