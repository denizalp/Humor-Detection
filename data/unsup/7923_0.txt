Well, i wanted to try Pizza M for a long time, and when we finally did, it was a real disappointment.  The pizza slices we got, Sausage and Pepperoni and Mushroom were average AT BEST.  Papa Dels and Jets are FAR superior.  The thing that really set me off was the price, at minimum twice as expensive as it should be.\n\nI will not be going back again, this place is supposed to be one of the best in the state? LOL
