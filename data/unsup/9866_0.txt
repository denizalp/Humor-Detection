What. Da. Heq.\n\n5 dollars for a slice of cheese? Has Yelp gone mad? \n\nAssuming a standard 8 slice pie, that's $40 bucks for  a pie. Is this pizza sprinkled with gold? Does it dispense napkins for your tears? \n\nGive me a break!! NY pizza is all about those dollar slices, not 5 dollars!! \n\nYelpers have gone mad. The pizza is certainly not worth it.
