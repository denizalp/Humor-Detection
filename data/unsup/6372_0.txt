Great vibe and location for we S. Phx folk, but ye gods, beware ordering a \"house Cabernet\" during Happy Hour - $12 a GLASS!  For happy hour house wine?  Are you kidding?  \n\nThe hhr food is a great deal, we'll be ordering beer next time.. phew.  \n\nCaveat emptor.  Bring a high limit credit card.
