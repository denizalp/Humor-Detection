***This Rite Aid seems pretty similar to every other Rite Aid in terms of selection and prices; the store was a decent size and they were well stocked; their selection of bottled water was good, but their earphones seemed a tad pricey; service was fine***\n\nThis Rite Aid has its own free parking lot and it is easy to find an open space; this Rite Aid is next to an occasionally busy street so exiting can be difficult.
