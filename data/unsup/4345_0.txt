Georges was a fantastic experience. John is a straight up no BS guy who has been in the business for almost 40 years. If integrity is what you are looking for, John is the model of it. I received a rip off quote from the Toyota dealership in Pickering of over 2400 dollars. And John was able to look at the problem as it was and offered me a realistic quote of under 1000 dollars. Will recommend to any of my friends and family in need of body work!
