Quite a nice surprise on king st. Nice Selection of Shangai food. I had the Xiao long bao (6 for 7.99), dandan noodles (7.59 ) and a soy and pork soup (4.99). The food was all solid and tasty, service was friendly, and the decor very nice and Chinese. Main dishes are a few dollars more than your regular Chinese restaurant.
