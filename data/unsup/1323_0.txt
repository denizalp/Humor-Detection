Until a few weeks ago this used to be a dark, disorganized and characteristically sketchy Price Chopper that I would only ever visit if I was purchasing something non-perishable (and even then...). Then there were renovations, and now it's Fresh Co., which still carries Our Compliments products and seems to have the same prices. While I don't think it's \"gorgeous, just gorgeous\" like I overheard a fellow patron telling a stock boy who didn't seem to care all that much, it is brighter and more orderly inside, and the produce looks less wilted and picked over. 3 stars, tentatively.
