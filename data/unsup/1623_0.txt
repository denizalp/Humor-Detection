I don't wanna comeback again, old asian lady she seems like owner here she doesn't care about the customer and restaurants was not busy today me and my sisters order 2 beers and oyster and cajun shrimp we waiting for food its almost like 40min, oyster smell was so yuck it wasn't fresh and shrimp was so small and salty... and kids running and yelling in the hall but nobody control them it was so loud! i prefer go to hot n juicy or boiling crab
