Won't get a chance to eat here I guess, the staff are so uppity we've been turned away 2x because they're too cool for school I guess. I don't know if they were tired from a busy day but there was 0 effort to extend any kind of normal courtesies like they looked at us and thought we didn't belong. We live just down the street from here.
