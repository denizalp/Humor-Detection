Love this sushi place. Some of the best sushi value in Charlotte.  \n\nThey have a lunch buffet during the week which is a great deal if your hungry. \n\nMy only complaint is cans of soda. If you drink more than a couple of soda that become costly. \n\nOverall,  I recommend this place for sushi to my Charlotte friends.
