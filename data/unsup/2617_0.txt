Elite cleaners is the best dry cleaner I've ever been to, and I've been to many. There work is fantastic, and they take great care of clothes. They're speedy too. We had a small but expensive accident happen to an article of clothing and they stood by their work and replaced the item and made it right. I've never had such pleasant customer service. They handled a bad situation in the absolute best possible way. Now I'm a customer for life! Thank you for actually caring about your customers.
