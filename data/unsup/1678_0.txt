Eggcelent food lol!! I was surprised with the quick turn around, in and out quick! The food was excellent quality, served piping hot, and with a warm smile from our nice waitress. I highly recommend the chile rellano (spelling?) omelet! \n\nNote: the plates are huge, my girlfriend and I split a plate and were stuffed.
