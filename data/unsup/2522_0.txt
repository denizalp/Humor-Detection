I ordered a pizza with pepperoni, onion and black olives. I thought it was good, the crust was nice and crispy,  pizza was hot, the lady behind the counter was nice. My only issue is almost 2 dollars PER topping. My $12 pizza turned into a 20 dollar pizza and for that price, I'll head to the Nook for better quality ingredients.
