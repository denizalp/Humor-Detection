Mexican romance! \n\nWhere do I begin...the atmosphere, the drinks, the queso or the tacos!?\n\nSuch a great place to stop in after work or on a night out, very casual and just very trendy. The tacos are about 3$ each and customizable to your liking. The guac selection and the queso selection are to die for. I mean you can have queso with chorizo!! \n\nGreat place for the wallet and the belly.
