You can do a lot worse than Massimo's on the Near West Side.  Then again, Massimo's could do a little bit better.\n\nThe food itself is good.  It won't wow you, but it's not bad.  This place looks like something amazing, though, so I was disappointed when I actually ate here after walking by it many times.\n\nI don't know what else to say.  It feels a little cold inside, more spiritually and existentially than literally.
