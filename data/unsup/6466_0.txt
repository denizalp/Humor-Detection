At first, I was a little skeptical when I was told to checkout a used phone store. Last night, Kimbo hooked my up with the new Samsung Note at almost half the cost I would have had to pay had I purchased it at Verizon. Not only did I get a new phone, he also included a screen protector, home and car chargers, ear buds and an otter box case. Couldn't be happier! Great customer service, go check these guys out!
