I've lived here all of my life and had never heard of this place until Mike took me here one day a couple of years ago. What a well kept secret! Cool place to sit and relax and just listen to the falls. I've come here during the day and night and felt pretty safe.  \n\nParking is just a short walk from the falls and it is free to visit!
