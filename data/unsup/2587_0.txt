Went here for a little pit stop on the way Back To Mississauga and it's the cutest place ever! Would love to come back. They have a fresh herb garden, a cute shop with jams and goodies. They even have a wooden verandah with live music and rolling fields for the kids to play in. \n\nThey've got animals like chickens in little coops. \n\nHad a great time popping by for lunch and to pick up some snacks. Got some hot peppers, sugar free jam and some snacks.
