Um yeah this place is hellza good. Especially when you are hungover, need to grab some quick food, are ready to hit the Cosmo pool, & want to look like a hungover beached whale.\n\nTheir presentation is all individual portions made in little crock pots or little saucepans. It's really cute, very unique, and you don't feel like you are eating at a horse troff.\n\nThey have almost anything one could want here! My friend's a veggie and she chowed down here. I'm a carnivore and made it my bi@tch.
