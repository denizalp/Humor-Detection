Damn it..I really liked chilling out at OHC watching what was on the TV, enjoying a DFH beer and sampling whatever tasty cigar was recommended.  I met up with a buddy on a pleasant Saturday afternoon to do just that.  &%*@!, what do I spy...a head shop sort of feel upon entry?!-Narcotics paraphernalia?!  It's hard to chill out like a \"gentleman\" in the presence of meth pipes and the like.  Sadness....
