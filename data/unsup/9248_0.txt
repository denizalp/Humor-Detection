We dropped off a pair of girls boots to have one zipper replaced\/repaired.  We asked for an estimate prior to having the work done.  No estimate was provided and no phone call  to advise us that the work was done.\n\nWe were charged $20 to have one zipper replaced for a shoe that costed $25, we are not very happy with the customer service provided.  We will not go there again for a shoe repair.
