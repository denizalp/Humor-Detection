Hungry around 5 am and luckily secret pizza was still open!! Because they were about to close, we were stuck with what was leftover. \n\nI tried the classic cheese pizza and I'd say it was still delicious! Thin crust (my favorite), and you can tell the cheese they use is higher quality than most pizza shops. \n\nMy friends really enjoyed the pizza, just make sure you come early so you can actually choose what you want!
