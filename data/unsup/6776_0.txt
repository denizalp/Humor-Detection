This is the second Fausto's location we've been to and decided to grab a bite after checking out Castaways Resale Store a few doors down.\n\nThe menu is the same as other locations so I ordered one of my favorites, their  Chile Relleno Burrito and we also tried a bowl of Menudo.\n\nThe burrito was pretty good, but their menudo is much greasier here than their other locations. A-OK for me, but in no such hurry to return. ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  3
