I came here initially seeking Sriracha, but unfortunately, this location did not carry it. The very handsome sales associate (near the computer stuff on 8\/23) with the moist blue eyes and sandy hair was incredibly helpful to my friend and me. He searched other stores for Sriracha and skillfully wrote directions for us. I've never received directions as precise as those he gave us. This sales associate was exceptional and smelled really good. I highly recommend this location for its staff (but don't go here for Sriracha).
