It's not enough to inspire me to change the star rating on my review, but it is worth noting that David, the General Manager of Rice and Company, contacted me to express his concern and regret about the lack of service I received on my visit. That's the kind of attention to customers I would have liked while I was at the restaurant. Maybe there will be some kind of trickle down effect, or whatever the economic term might be, but doubtful I'll volunteer to test that firsthand the next time I'm in town.
