Obviously this place is going to suck, but you don't exactly move into somewhere like this because you want to. Oh and the beezy up front towed my car one night. Another huge con is its location. On the bright side, I don't ever recall seeing any bugs and as a single white girl I never felt scared or unsafe, so I guess there's that.
