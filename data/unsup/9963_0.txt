I am currently staying at the Rio at this moment I just checked into my room and to my surprise I found some dog poop near the bed. It's between the nightstand and the bed. This is disgusting! \n\nI called guest service desk and they have no explanation for it. Didn't offer me anything but just a different room at my inconvenience. I have two little ones and switching rooms was quite challenging. \n\nCome on, how gross is that! Please take a look at my photo. Always inspect your room before you start settling in.
