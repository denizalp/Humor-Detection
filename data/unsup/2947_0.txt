Been coming here for years with family and friends vegans and meat eaters alike-the food is always delicious and they have an outstanding array of choices on their menu! It's a little pricey and I wish the meals came with fries, but you really do get the quality and taste that you pay for. I recommend this place for anyone, not just veg\/vegans!!
