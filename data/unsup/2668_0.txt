Great spot! Awesome location. Love the indoor\/outdoor options. Super urban industrial interior, unique seating and crafted decor. The small plates are great! Check in on Yelp for free Brussels sprouts! MUST try the fried chicken on cornbread pancake-it's to die for!!!! Seriously I don't ever order dishes like that, but I'm so glad I did it was that good. Service was great also. I'll definitely be back
