If your looking for good food don't bother. If your looking for an over priced mediocre burger stop in. The atmosphere is fun and campy, the wait staff wear scrubs and tight nurses uniforms. The burger was OK but nothing special, while the fries were a bit soggy and cool. Staff was very friendly and a fun. As a guest you are to wear a patients gown and patient ID band. Guest over 350 lbs eat free and if you don't finisher your burger you get paddled on the behind.
