I tried the falafel wrap and was wildly disappointed by how tasteless it was. My order also came with fries, which were extremely soggy! \n\nThe service here is kind of awful. It took the server 30 minutes to take our orders, even though the restaurant was practically empty. The server also got my friend's order wrong and never even gave her the rice pudding she ordered. \n\nOverall, very displeased with the experience and will probably not be coming back here again!
