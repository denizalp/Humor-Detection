If the LVRJ had a category for \"Best Korean Restaurant posing as a Japanese one\"...this place would win hands down.  The atmosphere is pretty close to an izakaya, really nice but...most of the employees are Korean....more than 70% of the menu is Korean...sure they have sushi but why pose as a Japanese place??  Their Japanese food was pretty meh.
