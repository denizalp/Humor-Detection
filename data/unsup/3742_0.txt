OMG. \nLook, I'm a big, fat, slob. I didn't get this way by eating salads, 'k? So, when it comes to burgers, fries, and milkshakes, I know what I'm talking about. \n\nAnd this is the best damned burger in the world. Everything was delicious. Sure, the butter on the milkshake was over-the-top, but, hey, that's their gimmick. It's worth taking the time, trouble, and energy to find parking and get there; I loved every bite.
