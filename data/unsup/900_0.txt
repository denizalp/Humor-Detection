Going to Monty's can feel like coming home. The place is warm and welcoming, the booths tall and spacious, staff gracious, coffee poured and refilled to your heart's delight... They're not reinventing the wheel with most of the menu but the breakfast dishes hit the spot, especially if they come with a warm, buttery biscuit. The GLBT (guacamole, lettuce, bacon, tomato) sandwich is the BEST. (Caveat: you might need to drink a gallon of water afterwards.) But really, it's a tremendous place. And you can ogle the pies and cakes on your way in or out.
