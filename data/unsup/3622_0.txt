do not do business with these people.. out side sun shades pulled out of the columns and scratched up the rock on the columns and they didn't want to fix it. a complaint was filed with the roc, and they finally agreed to fix it. we also had then make and install shutters in our master bedroom, they are about 10 feet long, now they have pulled out of the wall. still waiting for them to fix this problem.
