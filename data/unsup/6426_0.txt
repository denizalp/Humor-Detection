Okay, protein house has a pretty solid but the outcome is pretty much a hit or miss. For the prices, you would expect amazing healthy food. Well, it is healthy! But many times the taste would be mediocre. I had several times when my food came out really dry and lacked taste, which is why I barely visit anymore for the food. I now come for their protein shakes and acai bowls! Those are pretty good but because of the prices, I definitely only come in when I'm craving for their items badly
