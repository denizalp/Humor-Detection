I like the location of the hotel and amenities have been good. The air conditioning in my room was not working and it was HOT. I called three times over 2 days and still couldn't get it fixed. After getting no sleep for a second night, I requested assistance in person. It was finally \"fixed\" in that it was tolerable. Unfortunately, as I was finally getting some sleep, the fire alarm went off. It was addressed fairly promptly by staff.
