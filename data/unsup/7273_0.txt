Marc took care of my dog and my daughter's dog for a week while we were on vacation. It was the first time we have left our dogs with a sitter. What a pleasant surprise. I can't say enough good things about Marc. Our dogs loved him! Not only did Marc take care of our dogs, he also helped find the source of the leak from my main water line. What service!  Thanks for such a wonderful experience.  Look forward to using your services again!
