Great event.  Beautiful weather.  Some really good BBQ.  \n\nThe event was well run and there were even some events for the kids.  Compared with other competitions I've been to more of the tents were selling to the public so that was good.  \n\nAnother nice thing about this event is that there is a very large grass park adjacent to it.  You can grab some ribs and go sit under a tree.  \n\nI took a bunch of photos posted them here: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/myq2ql
