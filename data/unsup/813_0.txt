Yeah baby!  I love AJ's.  Hugh fresh fruit and vegetable section.  Large seafood and meat department with a variety of \"raw\" items and a variety of fresh pre-made options like chick cordon bleu that you can take home, heat and eat.  They have a good selection of wine, a sushi bar and a kitchen offering an array of hot items available for immediate consumption.  OH!!!!  I can't forget the bakery and coffee bar!  What are you waiting for?  Go inside!
