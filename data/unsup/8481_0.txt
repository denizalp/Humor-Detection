For the first time in my life, I got food poisoning all because of this place on Jan 30th. I had a pasta dish with chicken and wedding soup. I was horribly sick all weekend and even incurred doctors bills on top of the money I lost on this meal.\n\nBesides the food poisoning, the place is generic Italian with a higher price tag. Definitely many other Italian places downtown that blow this out of the water.\n\nClearly I'll never return. Please stay away from this place for your health!
