Update:\n\nI was booking a party at Scaddabush (Yonge & Gerrard) and told the manager about what happened with Tosto and he thought I was kidding,\"how can a business disregard their customers like that?\" So I made two reservations with Scaddabush to celebrate a promotion and new job, and the manager made sure to be present and took care of my guests and I. The staff went far and beyond to give us an excellent experience. So now, for every promotion, birthday, new job, etc.. my colleagues will come to Scaddabush -- though Tosto is closer.
