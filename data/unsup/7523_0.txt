I came here straight from the hospital to get the wife's prescriptions.  The Pharmacist asked for my insurance info and when I said I have Tricare she quickly said \" Walgreens does not accept Tricare\".    This is the insurance for both active and retired Military.  They don't accept Tricare!  Well that will be the last time I ever go into a Walgreens.  That anti Military attitude is unacceptable and I will spend my money where they appreciate the service of our active duty and retired Military!
