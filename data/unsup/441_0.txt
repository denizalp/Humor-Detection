This place is an absolute joke... Went here with 6 friends, sat at the table, 25 minutes later: no waitress. I ask to speak to the manager who is dressed in jeans and a T-Shirt with a hat on, who says \"ok\".... Just \"ok\". No apology, no \"what can I get for you\", nothing. Get a waitress, 10 minutes later two of us have water, no one else has anything. 15 minutes later she walks up and says \"sorry we are out of cups\".... So we leave. \n\nWorst service in a really long time. Will NEVER go back.
