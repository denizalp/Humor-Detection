Really enjoyed our first time eating here. Stan was great and the food was delicious. Craving Ceasar Chicken Salad this whole Vegas trip, I'm glad to have my first one here. Expected more like potato skins, but got more like potato wedges, still good. Probably won't get them next time. I would love to have had desserts, but opt out, since we were going to have dinner in 3 hours. Not sure if it's 24 hours, but it would be good, since the menu for breakfast looked just as good. I will be back!
