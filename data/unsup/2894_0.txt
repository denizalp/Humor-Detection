Had dinner here with colleagues and everyone enjoyed the food. \nOur party of 6 ordered appetizers, lots of sashimi, several rolls and two rounds of drinks and our bill was under $250. Really reasonable for fresh and tasty sushi. \nA few highlights:\n*Beef Gyoza - Not too oily and really flavorful\n*Sashimi - Ordered tuna, garlic tuna and salmon. All melt in your mouth fresh. Must order. \n*Ryan special roll- So tasty that we ordered a second roll. \nService was great from beginning to end. Totally recommend this restaurant if you're close to Fremont Street!
