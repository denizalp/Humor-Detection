Bought a M&P 9c. They said it's a special order. Called after three, four, and five days still didn't arrive. So after more then a week I decided to go pick it up. They said that they never ordered it even when I have a receipt, fully paid. Great management. Then while I was receiving my money back, a guy is complaining about is riffle, Defective.. Wow... That's bad for business . Oh well there so many gun store in Vegas, never coming back or no referral for this place.
