I ate here once....Figured I passed it all the time on Route 8 and wanted to check it out.    It reminded me of the before in an episode of Restaurant Impossible.   The decor is dated, but not in a timeless divey bar fashion, the food we had was all frozen and nothing was fresh.     There are other places nearby that are much better for the same cost, and menu type.    Do yourself a favor and hit them up.
