We loved this resort!!! We just moved to the area. The staff are so friendly and answered any questions we had. Our chocolate lab loves the water and was very excited after visiting. They do not overcrowd with dogs and you can tell they value their customers. We cannot wait to have him visit the daycare again and I am sure he can't wait either.
