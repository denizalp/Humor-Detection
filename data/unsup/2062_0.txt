Delicious and worth the wait in line. I've been lucky to only stand in line for 20 minutes on one visit (an hour wait on another visit), but the generosity of the staff with samples and water helped stave off hunger ;)\nI love the brisket (fatty is so delicious), and the Jefe with 1\/2 pulled pork, 1\/2 chopped brisket. All the sides are delicious and so is the sauce. They also gave my boyfriend and I some beef bones to take back to our pups!
