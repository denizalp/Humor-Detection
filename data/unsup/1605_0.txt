Sorry to say that I felt really bad hrs after I ate the nova lox bagel this morning. Ended up in the restroom five times. I won't be going back to Einstein For a very long time. I think that the smoked salmon was not handled correctly and bam it got me. I have had this product before and loved it. All of my visits have been in California and this was my first visit at the Arizona location. Sorry to say never again.
