My husband and I recently moved to Las Vegas and my Los Angeles physician wanted me to see an Allergist.  He advised me to check Yelp and Healthgrade before choosing.  I took a leap of faith and chose Dr. Tottori.  OMG....I am so happy I did.  From the moment I walked in the door as a new patient, I was treated with great attention and care.   From my intake nurse to PA Chu to Dr. Tottori.  Such care and concern is something I rarely see.
