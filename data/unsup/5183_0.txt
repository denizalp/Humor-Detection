EMCC is pretty decent, it's smaller and not as overcrowded as GCC. They offer Online classes too. Decent Instructors...some good, some not so great, but that could happen at any school.\n\nThe campus cafe is very tiny, like the size of living room. Bring your own bagged lunch or snacks, plenty of places to sit.\n\nThe campus is located on the NW corner of Dysart & Thomas. Parking has never been a problem here. Classes fill up very quickly each semester, so sign up early.
