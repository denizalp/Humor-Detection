Fancy as all get-out. The kind of fancy that reminds you that you were born in a different social stratum. Went here for Thanksgiving last year. Food was excellent and wine selection was the best I've seen in Cleveland. My friend's parents paid. I highly recommend someone else paying when you go here. Definitely not a first-date spot, unless you just paid down those polo lessons on your American Express card.
