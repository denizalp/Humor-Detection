I absolutely love the staff here, they are so good to my kitties! \n\nI especially like the way they explain what they are doing and what to expect after the treatment, it makes me feel confident that I can catch any problems that may arise post-visit.\n\nI'd say the prices are average compared to other clinics, but what puts this one above the rest is the time and care they take with my cats.
