This review is specifically about their awesome coffee bar. If you appreciate good coffe then you have to stop here. Jonah is the coffee sommelier. He hand picks the beans from free trade, organic suppliers and cooks up the ground beans in beakers - yep just like in high school chemistry. This process preserves the full flavor of the beans giving you a full bodied, low tannin, super flavorful cup. Incredible experience and flavor. You have to try it.
