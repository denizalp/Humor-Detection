So I have a lot of hobbies, and these hobbies involve alot of stuff, that ended up in my garage. After my mom threatened to throw all my stuff out I decided it was time to rent a storage place. I'm very glad I chose this place, not only is it on the way to work, and very close to my house, the customer service girl, San, is amazing! :D I felt like I made a new friend, both girls were very friendly, polite, and helpful.
