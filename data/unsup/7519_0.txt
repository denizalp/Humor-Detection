Coming back from our honeymoon we booked Rio for one night so that we could fly out the next. The line was LONG, it took almost an hour to check in. Upon check in we were upgraded to a pen house suite. It was awesome but we didn't get to enjoy it much since it was at the end of our trip and we were ready to go home. But we appreciated the upgrade anyway.
