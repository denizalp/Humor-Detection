Mullen's is your standard sports bar. Filled with people after Pirates' games but you can still find a seat. The service has been friendly and memorable for me - one of the bartenders comped a beer cause I was waiting long to pay. Plus for the ladies there is an attendant in the bathroom who provides simple fresheners!
