This place is full of knick-knacks in literally every nook and cranny.\nThere are large drawers each labelled with various items like handkerchiefs, gloves, postcards, cards, buttons, etc.\nThe walls are filled with things from various eras.\nI bought a beautiful owl decanter for only 19.99 and had a nice time reminiscing through items I remember seeing in my grandpa's old house.
