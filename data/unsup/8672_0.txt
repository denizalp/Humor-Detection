Great family dinner! We went with a group of 12 for dinner and the belly dancing show. Mijana mixed plate for 1 was enough for 2 people. Chicken was our favorite and the baba gounish appetizer was delicious. Belly dancing show was awesome, entertaining and fun. We finished with the Beruit Nights dessert, which was authentic and tasted great!
