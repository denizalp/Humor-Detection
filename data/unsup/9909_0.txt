Called in a pizza the guy took my order over the phone and said it would be ready in 15 minutes. Walked into the store and the guy that took my order said that it wasn't ready that he couldn't find my order made me wait an extra 20 minutes for my pizza. Horrible service not reliable and didn't feel appreciated or welcomed at all.
