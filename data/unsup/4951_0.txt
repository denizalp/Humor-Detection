This comfort inn was suitable. It's nothing special or flashy, but it got the job done for a two night stay. The hotel is in a very awkward spot, on the side of a hill on a busy one way street. There's nothing within walking distance except an \"Adult Mart\" next door if you're into that....\n\nThe staff was friendly enough. The room was very clean and modern, although small. The breakfast was a typical continental breakfast. Edible but not impressive.\n\nOverall just an average but clean comfort inn.
