I've been to Dr. Glick 2 times.  Once for my 9mo daughter who was covered in a head to toe blistery rash, once to have a mole check & to look into erasing some of the AZ sun spots I've developed.  He offered nothing for the sun spots, citing that unless I avoid the sun alltogether it would be pointless.  Even after pointing out that I use 70spf and wear a hat daily - he refused to do anything.  The mole he removed turned out to be 100% ok - but left a HUGE scar on my thigh....
