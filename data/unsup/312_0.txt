There are few good Chinese restaurants in Mississauga and thankfully Congee Queen opened one up at the Heartland Power Centre. The space is very open with an amazing ceiling feature in the middle of the dining area.\n\nThe food overall delivers and have been going a several times since it opened. The service is quick and the quality of each dish is great. Many of the dishes that would normally be greasy elsewhere is not greasy here. Let's hope the quality of their food remains as good as they are for a long time.
