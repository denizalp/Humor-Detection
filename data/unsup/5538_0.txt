Awesome service! The atmosphere is very welcoming and servers are super friendly! The fish was very fresh, loved the seared salmon. You can order half rolls too, so you're able to try more. Definitely recommend the all you can eat because they have a variety of different rolls that are a must try like the Moon River Roll :)
