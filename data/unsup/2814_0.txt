Friendly staff.  Great casual yet intimate atmosphere. Get there early! It's a small place and fills up fast.  Very accommodating to get you a table as soon as possible.  So great to find a Super T glass of wine.  Love the house made sparkling water.  Meatballs were flavorful and hearty.  Pizza had yummy fresh ingredients and sauce was perfect.  Next time I'm getting dessert!
