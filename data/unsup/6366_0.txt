Heard rave reviews about the \"Lazeez on the Rocks\" \n\nTried it out, definitely delicious -- even the REGULAR is filling\n\nHowever, they charge extra for saucing it up -- BUT, they did not sauce it up like i've seen. Even my friend who lives down the road has been here since day 1 was kind of surprised that we paid extra for sauce and it wasn't sauced up enough. \n\nBut would try it again! -- #CarbLife
