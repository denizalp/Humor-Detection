Well, buyer beware.   We got a good deal here but you have to walk in with knowledge.  I also have a friend who has purchased numerous cars here and gotten good deals.   \nBut here are some things to note.  When we were going to leave they wouldn't let us and cornered us at the door.    They had our license plates off our car before we agreed to anything.   After we signed the papers for what was a good deal they literally threw my new keys into the new car as they were locking up the store.   lol.
