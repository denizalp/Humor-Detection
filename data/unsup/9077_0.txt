More like \"Shi T noodles\".\nTerrible food. Small portions, cheap ingredients. My wife had a seafood noodle dish and it had very little seafood in it. My mix stir fry dish had literally one shrimp in it. The bok choy did not taste fresh. The peanut sauce that came with the rice rolls was highly diluted. Please save yourself the money, and go somewhere else. We tried them after reading some reviews and regretted it.
