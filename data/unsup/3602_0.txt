I love you, Bobbie Sue. \n\nTonight my favourite guy and I took an evening stroll to our friendly neighbourhood mac and cheese stand, and it was everything we'd hoped it would be. No matter how cold an evening, when you're buying your supper from a wooden kitchen stand, you're instantly cozy. \n\nWe got their traditional mac and cheese and their bend on Hamburger Helper. Both were delicious, especially the hamburger one. Hamburger, mushrooms and gruyere mixed together make for one hell of a comfort food cocktail.
