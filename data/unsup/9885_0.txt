The owners are great and very welcoming.  However\nOn Saturday night may 17th we had a large group\nGo to the bar because we heard they had a \nDj.  We requested a few songs and he played them with attitude\nHowever when asked to play a third song he said\nNo because he had not gotten tipped and was very rude. \nWe tip very well and he would have been very happy \nBut because he was so rude he will leave empty handed.  \nI hope the owners find a better dj. We would love to \nCome back
