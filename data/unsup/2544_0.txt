Great service and very thorough. I have a very complicated eyeglass  RX. Clay was very thorough, patient, knowledgeable, and respectful. He listened and understood my situation (eye surgery 4 months ago). He explained adjustments or potential adaptations that may factor in later with getting lenses to work with eye (prism). Bottom line..I got a refund from competitor (measurements were off & attitude re service) and came to Vision Works.
