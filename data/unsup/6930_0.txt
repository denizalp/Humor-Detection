Yes, it sure is hidden.  No sign at all.  Only way I found it, is that it is on Yelp with great reviews.  You do need the physical address.  Look close at the door NEXT to the restaurant, go in.  You will be surprised.  Went for breakfast and bloodies on a Sunday morning.  It was very good.  Not cheap food, but this is a bar type atmosphere.  Not a bad bar, a nice relaxing place.  The portions are large, and the food is on the 4-5 star level.  Service was very good too.
