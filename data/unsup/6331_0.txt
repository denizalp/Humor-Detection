DOUBLE LOVE this place. This review  is long over due. Delicious, healthy, affordable food and above and beyond customer service. After working up an appetite post Christmas shopping, a friend and I stoped in for a bite. While enjoying our excellent food, a delightful employee came over to our table and gave us sample items they were testing to add to the meal plan menu to take home on the house. What an angel! The stuffed cabbage BTW, was the best stuffed cabbage I've ever had!! It's always a treat to pay these guys a visit!
