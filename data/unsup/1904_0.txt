It has good seating, large tables, live music (Fri\/Sat nights, Sun afternoons), free wi-fi and the fundamentals of everything else. I cannot honestly complain.\n\nI haven't tried much of their food but tonight we had a white pizza and it was absolutely DELISH. Seriously.\n\nOh... and they DELIVER! Nothing like have a pizza and latte delivered... with minimum purchase there is no fee for delivery. Knocks the heck out of Pizza Hut\/Dominos...\n\nStaff is super-friendly and the music is hit or miss but if you can, give it a go. Short walk from Central\/McDowell light rail.\n\nBut, no cupcakes. How sad is that?
