Since it's 106 degrees outside and the hubby wanted lasagna, I was not about to turn on the oven. So last night we ordered take-out and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes. We got two salads, one lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs. Half of the lasagna was burnt on the bottom, meatballs tasted horrible-the kids wouldn't even eat them, and the bread was not soft and chewy.  Salads were good. Won't be back:(
