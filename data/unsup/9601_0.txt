Service is terrible. Over priced in everything. I was told that if i wanted to put on aftermarket springs and struts it would be $300 EACH WHEEL. They try to up sell\/scam you in everything. They wont prioritize you for things such as an oil change if you're not spending over $200. Ended up going to the place next door and whats treated well.
