My girlfriend and I (gay women) walk in this bar and in front of the bar sits an older woman (Barbara Bush lookalike, 80 or so..or so she looked-Her jawls and tattooed eyeliner confused me) announces: \"What the hell is that?\" and looks directly at my girlfriend who is tomboyish. Is this a gay establishment or a Trump\/KKK rally? No gay vibe..Sashay away.
