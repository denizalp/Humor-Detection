The food here is amazingly bland and mediocre. The decor makes hospitals seem warm and welcoming. The cleanliness... well, let's just say there are furry residents in the back kitchen. \n\nYears ago it was a dependable place to stop in for a quick bite when in Chinatown. I have obviously not warned enough people because two friends were food poisoned there last year. \n\nI would give this a 0 star if I could.
