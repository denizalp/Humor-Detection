Decided that a warm soft pretzel would be the perfect accompaniment for a hot bowl of soup on a cold day.  So glad I stopped in.  The warm cheddar and jalapeno pretzel was delicious.  Big and more flakey than dense, it was just delicious!  I really liked the flavor of the dough as well.  Really nice, sweet flavoring.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying the almond pretzel it looked divine!
