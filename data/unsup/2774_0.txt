Not great... S-L-O-W service, and very unfriendly on top of it.   We felt as though we were inconveniencing the staff by renting shoes and asking our server for silverware, drink refills, or the dipping sauces that were supposed to come out with our food.   \nTerribly overpriced as well!   2 people bowling 3 games and splitting the appetizer sampler cost over $100.  \nThe only reason this place is getting 2 stars is because the music was so bad that we rushed to get out of there, which probably ended up saving us an extra $100.00...
