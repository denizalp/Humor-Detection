Because this place is close to my humble abode, and it's one of the few non-cookie cutter coffe places (ie. Second Cup, Sbux, Tims), I continue to go. A glutton for punishment I must be. The service, is ALWAYS, without fail, shockingly poor. \n\nIt does not matter what time of day I go, how many or few people are eating, who's serving me - the service is garbage. Slow, inattentive, slow, disinterested, and slow. \n\nSLOW
