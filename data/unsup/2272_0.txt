I love this place so much, and with the delivery to my work, I often eat here. The food is always good, the staff is lovely. The only complaint i have, is that with how often I order from Jimmy Johns, there's no rewards or loyalty program for valued clients. I probably order from here once or twice a week, as it's usually the only place I eat out at. I would love it so much better if there was some kind of consolation for buying so many sandwiches.
