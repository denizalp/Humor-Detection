Trendy and cute! A Arizona twist to Tacos and food. Not your typical bar. More of a modern feel with a cool atmosphere. Had a tasty girls happy hour. We all kind of order different things on the menu. The venue has indoor and outdoor seating. We chose to sit outside and enjoy the cool spring breeze. Our drinks and food were served in a timely manner. Overall we were all pretty happy.
