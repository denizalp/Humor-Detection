Myself and 3 other friends stayed here for 5 nights since we were leading orientation week for our university nearby. I only wish we could have utilized the hotel more! It's a fantastic location - steps away from Queen subway station, NPS and city hall, and eaton centre. The beds are so comfortable, you're guaranteed a good nights sleep. Great for families and groups alike.
