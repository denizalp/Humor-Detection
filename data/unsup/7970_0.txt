Having just arrived in Vegas and meeting up with some business partners, we decided on a centrally located restaurant on the strip to grab a drink and bite.  What better place than the highly visually patio of Margaritaville!   The margaritas didn't disappoint.  They were made by a heavy hand, and we shared a big appetizer plate of nachos.   \n\nFun Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville atmosphere and decor, with the music to-boot.  Not a bad place to enjoy a drink with your friends.
