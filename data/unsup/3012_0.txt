Awesome place for alcoholic frozen delights! So much sugar and so much liquor...but who gives a you know what! It's Vegas baby!!! So many cool flavors, combinations, and sizes! You can even add extra shots in case the oversized alcoholic ice treat was not strong enough! The prices aren't bad either considering how much you get! Refills are a few bucks cheaper if you keep your cup. Cool place that I think is a Vegas must!
