I've dined here over a dozen times since moving to the east valley.  The establishment is on the way home from work and therefore convenient for me.  The service has been highly erratic-ranging from mediocre to absolutely horrid.  Tonight the iced tea tasted like coffee, the club sandwich was missing items, and the server was nearly nonexistent.  I will not be returning to this Denny's location ever again.
