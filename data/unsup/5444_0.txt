I really enjoy coming to this theater, people are always friendly and it's not to crazy. It's very spacious and kept clean. They need to get some reclining chairs though, because then I'd visit more often. They have a great assortment of snacks, drinks, even adult beverages. Plus their Stubs program is very rewarding especially for an avid movie goer like myself.
