The Yangtze Buffet really let me down today (I've eaten there at least 20 times over the years). Buddy and I got there about 11:45 and the buffet was very cold and dim sum selection was markedly poor. I asked buffet attendant about more dim sum and all she could do was giggle and say \"Maybe later.\" This response is offered moments before lunch rush is to begin? Honestly. Prices have also been jacked up a couple buck to $16 since I was last there a few months ago.
