Came here for a quick bite a few Tuesday nights ago. It was pretty cold in Scottsdale, but we sat outside under the heat lamps. \n\nOur server didn't really know up from down and kept having to go 'ask the bar' when we had questions. The food was mediocre. I ordered some 'steak sticks' which were basically rocks on a stick and very bland. The sliders were really good though. \n\nDrinks were mediocre and even our standard margaritas were made wrong. \n\nMy recomendation: not sure what other options are around on a late Tuesday night, but i'd steer clear.
