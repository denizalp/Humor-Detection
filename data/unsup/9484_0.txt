I ordered a cheeseburger (sans cheese) that came with fries, and cost $12.  That's about the same price you would pay in the restaurant, so not a bad deal.  The food was pretty good, I really loved the fries!  However, the meat patty on the burger was soooo thin.  I'm not a large person, but that burger still did not fill me up.\n\nOn the plus side, some of their tables have plugs built in, which is really convenient to charge your devices while you're eating your meal!
