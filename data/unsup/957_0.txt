I stopped in here today to kill some time while waiting for the bus. It's a little gold mine for foodies. I think they have every kind of cheese and and deli meat you could want. The guy working there let me try some cheeses and patiently explained what everything was. Apparently cheese can get so salty thats its almost crunchy. Anyway I ended up getting an assorted pack of these obscure sodas that taste awesome. Coke is good but sometimes you want something different and I got plenty of variety.
