freebie night at the bellagio last night.  roomie had some holiday gift promo using the gaming points accumulated throughout the year  to \"purchase\"   gift items (  some sick gamblers in this town - several people used their points to get free BMW's and Harley motorbikes ! )\n\nanyways, after all of 3 hours sleep awakened early to hit the buffet.  prior to today, never tried the breakfast buffet. $34 for some fried eggs, average king crab legs.  i don't think so.  nothing wow'd me and at $34 i should be wow'd by something !
