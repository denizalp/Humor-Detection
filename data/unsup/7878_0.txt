Burgers are not huge and certainly not juicy. Over priced small burgers and over cooked and quite greasy fries. Still in the 80's with lack of debit machine, but quite willing to get service charge from ATM cuz they don't make enough money on their pre made burgers. Back about 5 years ago, was amazing and highly recommendable, now not so much at all. Disappointing to say the least, only surviving because of past reputation
