Finally found the hair salon I've been looking for! The girls here are great. Great service from everyone and the owner is absolutely amazing. I don't know how they do it but they always remember me when I go! My stylist is Marisa and she gets my hair right every time! You get what you pay for and since having the right style is important, I'll pay the $$.
