This post is from my last trip to Las Vegas. It was supposed to be \"No Meat March,\" but obviously it didn't turn out that way. When I am on vacation it pretty much an all you can eat time. I absolutely enjoy trying new places and cannot resist temptation; therefore, out with \"No Meat March\" and in with Smash Burger! It's utterly necessary that you try this place, especially the sweet potato fries! Pictures on my blog.
