They simply don't care about customer loyalty. The atmosphere is really nice and comfortable, there's free wi-fi which is awesome and their chili and salads are delicious but their coffee is weak (even the dark roast) and one of the servers is really incompetent. \n\nI went there all throughout the summer and spent hundreds on food and coffee... Occasionally I would bring in my own fruits to snack on while I enjoyed a coffee (I BOUGHT) and they told me I couldn't do this. Lost a loyal customer and hundreds if dollars because of it.
