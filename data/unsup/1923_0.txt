This office has the worst customer service I have ever experienced before. I came in for a deep cleaning. I was experiencing pain which is why I called to follow-up with the doctor. He never called me back. The front desk is terrible including the Office manger Evelyn!\n\nThe doctor never calls you back if your experiencing pain. WORST dental practice EVER!!! Never go in and visit them. RUN if you can from this practice
