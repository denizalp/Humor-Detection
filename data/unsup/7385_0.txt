Though a really small gym, there are a good number of climbing and bouldering routes for the space. And the staff is incredibly friendly, as are the patrons. So even though there aren't any auto-belays, meeting people is incredibly easy and fun. Also, the routes are well set with a good variation in challenge and difficulty.
