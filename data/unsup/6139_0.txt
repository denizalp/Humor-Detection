Rating given based on food. Had veal marsala. The pasta was overcooked and the marsala sauce was below average. Funny how an Italian place can't make their pasta right, didn't even expect for al dente but overcooked? My pasta were soggy! It's a shame.  Relatively good ambience-4 stars for ambience.\n\nBye
