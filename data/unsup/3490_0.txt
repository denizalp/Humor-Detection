I was recently in Canada and my family took me here and wow I have probably gone there everyday that I was there. Food is excellent and so yummy, chicken kabob with rice salad and fresh naan ummm so good I wish I was there now and there tandoori chicken, lamb uhhh so so good.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Great service, amazing food, good prices.  Although be careful for weekends this place gets extremely busy  but well worth it.
