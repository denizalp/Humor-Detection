I wanted to send some birthday cupcakes to a friend living in Cleveland, while I live in California. I didn't need them \"shipped\", just delivered. Cleveland Cupcake Company got back to me immediately, was friendly and patient as I was unsure of delivery specifics, and even let me know after they had been dropped off. I recommend them for not only their tasty cupcakes but their awesome customer service :)
