Worst customer service of all time. Would not try. Waited 3 times on the phone to place takeout order for over 5-7 minutes each time asked to speak to a manager and they couldn't even find one to speak with for another 5 minutes. Poorly ran place. For basic food not worth the wait or pain in the butt to deal with that service.
