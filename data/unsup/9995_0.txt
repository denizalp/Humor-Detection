I needed a safe bolted down.\n\nASO came in as one of the lowest bidders but also answered my request really fast. I had some questions and the answers to these did not come as fast - however, we did agree on a date, time, service and a price. \n\nThen it got quiet. I even sent an email confirming the deal. Got no reply. To this very day. I will not deal with these kind of cretinous flimflammers, as there is a plethora of companies that renders the same kind of service - presumably in a better manner.
