Very happy with my movers! I had to move unexpectedly and learned about the moving services Boxed Inn offers when I went to purchase some boxes from them. The owner really knows his stuff and helped me out enormously! He also recommended a storage place close by. The movers were friendly and efficient. I will definitely use this company again.
