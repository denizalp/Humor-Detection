Service is only marginally better here at the Nook Express grab-and-go counter rather than their counter-service restaurant further down the hall. Staff is friendly, but disorganized and slow. The pastries and premade salads and sandwiches are on par with Starbucks, but the one great thing I've found here is their cold brew. Get the large- it's only slightly over $5 and 32oz, good flavor and a crazy caffeine rush.
