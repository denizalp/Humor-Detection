I love coming here and seeing the Shiny door that is very well polished and makes me smile.\nThe pride of that door quickly melts away as I order the food.  The sad excuse of a Burger arrives and I decide to Google the food.  Your heart will drop as this food is torn apart and realize that the nutrition is that of sawdust...\nWell I will still come back for the Icecream.\nAvoid snacking here at all costs.
