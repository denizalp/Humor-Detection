This is a self serve restaurant canteen style. Arrived around 2pm and a couple of small tables opened up. Got lucky.  Fascinating as it was a snowstorm day yet they were full house on a Sunday afternoon. We ordered the eggs Benny with salmon dish and a buttermilk pancake dish. Both were very delicious. The eggs benny's yolk gushed out as the knife went thru, very appealing to watch. The buttermilk was perfect when adding a little touch of condensed milk.  All in all a very yummy lunch.
