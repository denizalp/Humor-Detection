I used this company twice. Once for helping me move furniture upstairs. The guys were great, on time and the cost was way below other movers around here. Metropolitan Moving LLC did not mind it to be a small job.\nThe second time I used them for a complete move to a different home. Again on time, great workers. \nIf I need movers again I call them in a heart beat. Wonderful experience.
