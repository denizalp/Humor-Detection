A decent starbucks. I like that they do breakfast here for me and my suburban homes. Its essential. This place is located right next to the Huntington bank.\n\nI went at about 7am and the line was filed right back to the entrance, so you may see some sort of a delay. They also have free wi-fi again, its about damn time. I don't think anyone in there right min should have to pay for that perk in a commercial outlet. It's like not offering bathrooms!
