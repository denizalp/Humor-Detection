My wife and I feel much better now that we are connected and protected by Clear home security. The wireless installation was quick and looks sharp. The system is super easy to use for anyone  and we are very satisfied with the service we've received. Clear is a great local business managed by a team of seasoned security professionals that I would recommend to friends and family. If you're looking to get your loved ones and your belongings protected, look no further.
