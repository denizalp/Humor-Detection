Horrible service and such a run-around. Every one you need to talk to to resolve an issue is either not in today, no longer works there, or  there's no need in contacting cause they are an independent store. A battery purchase is kept in their computers but a warranty isn't? Give me a break! In all my years of buying and owning computers, I've never heard or experienced such malarkey. So long customer service!
