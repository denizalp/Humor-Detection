Here's how they run this business:\n\nMe: \"I need this service. Take my money\"\nMechanic: \"You don't need it, come back when you need it.\"\n\nConclusion: Honman is a business with integrity and great service. I've been going there exclusively for my Honda Civic, and if you have a Honda, you definitely should go there too.
