Wow! Tried the tots, truffle fries, cauliflower wings, potato skins, and the au poivre burger and ALL of it was great! The burger was perfectly cooked and the flavour was phenomenal. The cauliflower was just the right amount of spicy and the ketchups were a great addition to the different potato styles. We will certainly be back! Yum!
