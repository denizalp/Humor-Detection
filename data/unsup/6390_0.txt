WHOOP WHOOP !! My new go to spot for extensions!\n\nLots of variety...in both types of extensions and wigs as well. Decent price for the quality of the product. \n\nLooking for a new spot to add new styles to your collection or just looking to maybe switch up your look a lil bit and have fun with the different colors ..check this place out!\n\np.s it was my first time buying extensions and the girl was very helpful in making sure i got the perfect match for me.
