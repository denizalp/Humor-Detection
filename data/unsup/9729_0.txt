I've been here twice to hike the Gateway Loop trail with my dog. Parking has been easy both times. We enjoyed the hike even though it was a bit crowded. \n\nThe only con about this place is that to get to the trails you have to walk over a bridge made of metal slats which my dog HATES. She refuses to walk over it which means I have to carry her and she's not a little dog so it's no easy feat.
