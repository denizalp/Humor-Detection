UPDATE:  Went in a few days ago for a coffee table and end tables.  Our salesman was Frank.  He was perfect!  Just the best.  Kept an eye on us without making us feel like we were being stalked, was always there when we had a question, he even moved one of the end tables from one side of the store to the other side so we could compare the two we liked best!  We had a great experience.  Thanks Frank!
