Love this Marriott. This is my 4th visit to the Courtyard Marriott Salt River. The hotel itself has a modern vibe and is located in a quiet area of Scottsdale off of Pima road. The staff is friendly an always greets you upon arrival. The beds are comfy and the rooms are spacious. \nI am only a Gold member so no free breakfast here but the do have a deli type restaurant which offers some nice menu items. The oatmeal is a big hit with me.\nTry this place out, you will enjoy.
