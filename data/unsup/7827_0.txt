I ordered my first carry out GF meal from Jim 'N' Nick's today. The cashier was new to food allergies, and didn't know many answers to my questions. However, she was eager to learn, asked the chefs, and the manager to be sure she answered all of my GF questions. She found the food allergy listing and walked me through the items available. She went above and beyond to learn about and respect my allergy. There are many GF options available in the meats. Many sides as well. I will eat there again!
