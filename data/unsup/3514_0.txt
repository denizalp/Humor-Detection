I'm always doubtful when trying a new pizza place - so many factors - dough, grease, sauce, seasonings, toppings, done-ness.\n\nRay's was surprising and tasty - not too doughy, cooked through, with a bit of crispiness! We got the meatlovers-type pizza, and the meat had good seasoning, plenty of cheese, not too much grease, and a sauce with a bite. \n\nAlso, the wings were good and the fried mozzarella - excellent appetizers. What are the odds the closest pizza joint to you is that good at my three pizza-place staples! Not the best pizza ever, but a nice option
