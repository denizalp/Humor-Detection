It is very easy to do some solid damage here with their all-you-can-eat sushi. It's very good quality, they have a very good selection of rolls including cooked and not-cooked, plus there are options on the AYCE menu for the people who aren't huge sushi fans. That's what I'm talking about!\n\nDespite it being the height of the lunch rush on a sunny Friday, the service was great and the delay for my orders was brief. I'll be back!
