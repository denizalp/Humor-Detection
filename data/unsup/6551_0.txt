I went here for the first time today and loved it! I did both the driving range and the mini golf course and they were so much fun. My fiance grew up in South Park and has gone here since he was a child, so it was really cool hearing all the things that had changed over the years.\n\nThe mini golf course if a combination of new and old golf obstacles. All of them have their own unique elements.\n\nJust a heads up this is a cash only place. :)
