Even a Yelp App cannot help us locate Cherry Cola... we walked up North and then we looked around..Nothing looks or resemble a lounge?!!! and where is this \"Rock N' Rolla Carbaret Lounge\"?!!\n\nThen we heard some faint music coming out from a door... and we asked if this is Cherry Cola...... walked in to this red velvet sexy space.... then our eyes set on those loungers at the back and we know that's our space for the night!!!
