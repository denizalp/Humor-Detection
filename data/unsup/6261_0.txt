Walked into a Wine Tasting, Margarita & 'Bubble Bath' cocktail tasting.  Love it!  \n\nFast & friendly people & cutesy gift ideas or Fourth of July, holiday party items.  $20 Wine & Food Sampling, call for July dates.  I was picking up a bottle of wine & should have went back to grab the cashiers recommendation, 'Fire Brand Chardonnay.'  She was very nice to recommend it & said that since I like KJ Chardonnay, I'd like it...ahh!  Next time, cause now I'm craving it lol.  Cheers.
