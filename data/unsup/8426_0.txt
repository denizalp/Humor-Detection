Came by for a 1 hour foot massage the other night. Called ahead and was able to request a female masseuse. Picked the \"A\" package where it included a 10 minute back massage along with a head, scalp, shoulder, arm, and hand massage for $22!\n\nThe interior was clean and had a few semi private rooms.\n\nThe masseuse was excellent with a strong pressure along with hitting numerous pressure points!\n\nDuring payment, it became apparent that they prefer cash.\n\n...they do have a sign where they say that a $5 or less tip means that the service was poor?!?
