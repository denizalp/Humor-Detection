The service was great... A smile will always go a long way... The tacos were very different from all we've had in vegas for 20+years...because no one here uses yellow tortillas which were amazing! The tripa is really crispy-not chewy like most places here and their salsas were flavorful with plenty of selection- from mild green to habanero \nWill most definitely come back!!
