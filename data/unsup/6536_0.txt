Really good Middle Eastern food! My new go-to place when I crave lamb - they know how to grill it right! I also enjoyed their dolma, which surprised me because before this I have not been a fan of stuffed grape leaves. The prices are so easy on the budget (http:\/\/s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/mw7jP7__P7sFk6OjDr8pog\/l.jpg), which makes this place even more enticing (thumbs my nose at Haji-Baba in Tempe). It's definitely not fast food, but the wait is definitely worth it.
