I used to be a regular here all the time when ARtie and Gina were married. It was affordable though more expensive than it had been to pay for all the renovations after the fire. The portions were huge and food homecooked. After they divorced, it went to hell. I paid $18 for a dozen chicken wings and stopped going. The food was garbage, service worse, attitudes bad. I see why they closed.
