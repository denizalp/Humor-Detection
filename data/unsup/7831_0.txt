Horrible experience. Made the reservation on open table, the Asian guy that's a host or a manager is a real jerk and blamed open table and me for not having a table. Then, to add insult to injury, after I explained it's a birthday party, he said \"that's not my problem\" and I even showed him the verification email! Anyway, good is average at best and the management is worthless. Horrible experience and I won't be going back.
