I'm not a huge chipotle fan so, I hoping Fresco wasn't anything like it. It's not, it's even better! \n\nI got a burrito with ground beef, queso, jalape√±o, & rice. The burrito was toasted which I really liked. The burrito was delicious! It was flavorful & you can the ingredients were fresh. For $6.99, you get a big burrito, chips, & unlimited salsa at the salsa bar. \n\nThe employees were super helpful & friendly. They kept checking up to make sure everyone was okay & see how we liked the food.
