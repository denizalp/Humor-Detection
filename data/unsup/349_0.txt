The shrimp is raw tonight. Omg\nThis is the worst Red Lobster\nWe arrived at 8pm and now its 9:50 we have had to wait for refills 15-20mins. The manager has been here to argue with us. We told him how much more efficient other red lobster are compare to this one. \nSave yourself the stress and hassle don't come to this location. Its run by a gang of incompetent monkeys!!!
