Drove by stopped to eat. The bartender named Mailman, thought that was funny was awesome. He was very friendly and recommend the fish tacos which were amazing. I also am a gambler and enjoyed the great views on top of this hill. The service was great. It was also very noticeable how the rest of the people at his bar loved this Mailman. I am a Royal player at PTs and will definitely start coming here more.
