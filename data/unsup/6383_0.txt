So, the food here was pretty decent with one small problem-- our food was so unbelievably spicy that neither of us could stomach it! I am not usually one to shy away from spicy food, but... let me put it this way: thai food leftovers never make it more than 24 hours in my house, and I threw out two almost full boxes after several days. Being from Washington, I am pretty critical of my thai food; and this was just not the best around.
