Samy was extremely polite and attentive as our host and waiter. Might come back for a coffee and dessert. nice atmosphere. Beautiful restaurant decor. We had seen kitchen nightmares and was curious about the hype so we decided to try it. Food was average and a little unusual. I never ate pear in a sandwich and never have since. Overall we were expecting a spectacle but it seemed business as usual and uneventful.
