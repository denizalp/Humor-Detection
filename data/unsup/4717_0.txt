I stopped in there to test drive a new sling shot.\nThey took me for a ride in it and they wouldn't let me drive it even though I have my motorcycle license. Needless to say I would never make a purchase of almost 30 grand without test driving the vehicle. So I went to another dealer that allowed me to drive the sling shot and now it's sitting in my garage. Ha ha you lose.
