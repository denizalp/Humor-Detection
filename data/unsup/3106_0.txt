Simply a nice burger. I experienced the Tamago. Awesome flavor jucy, that broiled smoky taste. The fried egg sets it off. Sorta like feeling a nice breezy cross winds across my taste buds. Service was excellent. Made the cut and Fuku made my burger team. I only sign the best Burgers. The Tamago made the starting line up.
