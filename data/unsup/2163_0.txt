First visit here and definitely not our last. What a pleasant surprise! The menu literally has something for everyone and the seasoning of our dishes was spot on... bland is NOT a word in their vocabulary. The staff was extremely nice and knowledgeable re: the menu too. Very unique and super tasty breakfast\/brunch place. I would give 10 stars if Yelp would let me.
