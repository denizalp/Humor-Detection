Awesome store & employees.  If you have a friend who likes wine or any beverage & have no clue what to get them, come here.  They have the cutest, unique lil gifts & gift sets!  Even fun ice cube trays if you wanna have a conversation piece in your drink lol!  \n\nThey price match w\/ Lees, here is a cheaper by a dollar or more usually.  I love the tasting days & bar set up for it.  Very cozy store, lots of beer & wine.
