I tragically didn't know of the existence of Pamela's until late high school. Being shamefully unenlightened, I likely ingested hundreds of pancakes inferior to these throughout my early years. \n\nI therefore dedicate this review to anyone that's either young themselves or has young kids. Don't waste your childhood. Life is too short for subpar pancakes.
