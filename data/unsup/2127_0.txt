Jill was our midwife and helped give birth to our son in December 2012.  Everything went great and she was very professional.  I recommend her to anyone interested in having a home birth.  She made regular visits filled with great conversation and knowledge all the way up to the birth.  Please give her a call, you will be glad u did.
