A great local bar location with cheap food and nice servers. We arrived around 10 and they were empty in the dining area. The server was so friendly and greeted each patron like she new them, most of the rig upsets she most likely did. \n\nMy mom and I ordered some breakfast and prices were beyond reasonable. My omelet was made to order and was good. \n\nService with a smile and great prices while watching the games, we'll likely be back soon to partake in more of the bar area as well.
