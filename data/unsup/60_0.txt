Customer service two thumbs down!    I bought a 6 pack of beer and a bottle of Baileys. She bagged the items and handed them to me.   Got home no Baileys.   I live 20 mins away.    Return to store all I got was oh sorry!    Are you kidding me,    Check your bags before you leave.    I will never go back.
