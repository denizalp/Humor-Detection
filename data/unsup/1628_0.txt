We were walking by Kona grill in Perkins Rowe on Sept 22 at around 9:15 pm. If your looking for hands on service then manager Michael Hueffer  drinks with his guests and was also then seen beating that man in his 60's up out in front of where he works. The man ended up leaving in an ambulance. So if your interested in that kind of hands on service then Kona Grill is your place.
