Very very pleased with results. I called and was offered next day service, GREAT customer response. The owner is a veteran. Thank you for your service.  They called before their arrival (thank you) and early.  I can't remember his name, but he was polite and professional. He provided booties and represented the company very well. \nMy carpet looks great. My stairs look really really good.
