During the week I like to go here and order up some Buffalo wings or mini burgers. They have decent bar food. The wings are my default choice. They are cooked well done and are never mushy, rubbery and weird. My favorite hot wings in Cleveland. The music is hit or miss but mostly miss. The patio is a great oasis during a summer day or night, as long as it isn't busy. They charge  too much for domestic draft beer.
