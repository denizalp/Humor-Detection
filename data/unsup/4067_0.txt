I enjoy grocery shopping here!\n\nIt's a one stop shop for me every time I go to Smith's. I'm able to buy my groceries, go to my bank (US Bank located inside!), and borrow a DVD from the Redbox conveniently located by the entrance.\n\nThey pretty much have all the standard items you'll need while grocery shopping. The employees are very friendly! Even when you are going through the self-checkout, if they see that you are slightly confused or struggling, they'll come right up and assist you before they even ask you for help!
