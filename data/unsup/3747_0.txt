A lot of mixed reviews about this show and I don't seem to know why this is, since you know the type of know it is .. My kids absolutely loved this show as well as my wife and Me. It had us laughing almost throughout the show and had me of all people wanting to get up and dance ( which I don't do )   2 thumbs up from me. I wish I had more thumbs..... LOL
