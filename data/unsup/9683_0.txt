PHX National always has a good selections of cars.  Very seldom do I find this National location low on car selection in the executive elite or emerald aisle.  Easy to check out.  The only issue I have is with the location of the rental center which takes a 10 minute bus ride to get there.  Other than the bus ride to and fro, very good rental experience.
