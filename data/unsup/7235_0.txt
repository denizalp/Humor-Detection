After the first order, the 7-8 waiters basically ignored a group of 9 people sitting basically in the middle of restaurant. Isn't that amazing? The better part is that basically all our waters were empty and we had people glance over, but didn't even acknowledge our existence. It took 20 minutes for us to even get the check after we finished eating, all clearly waiting for a single waiter to ask if we wanted the check. Simply. Amazing. Forced gratuity for service that wasn't present is psychologically mind breaking.
