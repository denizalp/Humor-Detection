I used to frequently go here because it near by where I live, and it was so good. The service was good and the food was amazing for ayce. However, over the years as it got more popular the service became terrible and your food would never come without a reminder. It was difficult to even get water from the servers and the quality of the food decreased. Not the best but not the worst. Also pretty pricey now.
