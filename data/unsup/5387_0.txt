Got acquainted with this morning Montr√©al tradition that lunch today. I saved my appetite for hours and was extremely well rewarded with the Portuguese chicken poutine. Also got the salad to balance the meal out with some non potato veg. The chorizo was a pleasant surprise and seating wasn't an issue, although we had to wait in line for a bit. Pricing was fair and the charcoal infused rotisserie chicken I watched rotating on a huge spit was a feast for the eyes!
