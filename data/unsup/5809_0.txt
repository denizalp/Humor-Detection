The service is friendly, and the staff are very cool, but come on people.  It's cheap because it's gross.  I really respect the Y and what it does, but I loathe the food.  I tried it multiple times to see if it was a fluke, but it was hideous.  The stuff s obviously microwaved and low-quality.  And just...ICK.  HORRIBLE.\n\nI'm going to call it the Y Bother?
