Dol sot bi bim bop. With a dish name like this it has to be authentic. Yo it was made out of Beef, bean sprouts, egg yolk, over rice. In a hot stone pot which kept the food at times burning to the tongue. Miso soup was good.  Tea was unique as well. Gave it three stars for now until I eat at the restaurant to check out the service. I would recommend if you are craving authentic Korean BBQ.
