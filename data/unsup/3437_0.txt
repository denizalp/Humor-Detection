$30 for a mid May play through the entire 18? Yes please. \nCourse is well maintained and surrounded by nice real estate. The greens roll consistently this season and there are enough 3 & 4 pars to have a non-rushed yet fast round (completed the course in under 4 hours). \n\nI will return & recommend.
