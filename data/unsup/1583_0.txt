Good but expensive chicken wings that don't even come with the standard blue cheese sauce\/carrots\/celery accompaniment, although you can get nearly rotten celery and carrot for an extra charge I discovered.   Nothing else on the menu is any good, tried this place a few times with other people and aside from the good albeit expensive wings, disappointment was on the menu.  Decent beer selection but keg freshness is questionable with a majority crowd of Bud\/Blue light drinks who crowd around the front door to smoke.
