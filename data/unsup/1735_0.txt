Everywhere in Vegas is expensive. So....I think this is actually one of the better deals out there. It's $35 per person (roughly) for dinner. If you drink alcohol it will clearly add more to your bill, so stick to water and get the free booze while you are gambling. Is everything at the buffet amazing? No, but there are literally a million options. The best things- pesto tortellini, squash bisque, crab legs, tiki masala, and roast chicken. The line can be long but it moves quick, but it is worth the wait.
