Food is overpriced. Waited 15 minutes to sit in a half-empty dining room. Waited 40 minutes for a cold, average meal. Potatoes are the size and texture of chicken feed, and are cooked in large batches every 16 years. Benedict was a hard-boiled egg. \n\nAfter surviving a twilight-zone experience at the sister-restaurant Tapacubo - a concept seemingly designed by and for the mentally ill - I don't know why I gave this place a shot, and I feel like a ninny.\n\nPositives:\nBread was good.\nDecor has no shortage of cute ideas.
