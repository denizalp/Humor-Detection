I don't understand all the negative reviews.  It's probably because most filipinos are used to their food being greasy, fatty, and oily which isn't like the food here.  This place is really good.  My family and I couldn't be happier that there is now a good Filipino restaurant in the Southwest part of town!  And it does get crowded (with Filipinos!) so obviously they're doing something right!\n\nBTW - Notice that almost all of the 1-star reviewers have only 1 or 2 reviews to their name?!?! Hmmmm....
