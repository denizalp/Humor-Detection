I can summarize my entire review in four words:  Eight Dollar Lunch Buffet.\n\nMonday-Friday.  The selection is relatively small (maybe 5 or 6 entrees to choose from, as well as rice, naan and a selection of chutneys) but it's just enough that you can try everything and WILL want to return for more.\n\nThere's a good variety of flavor levels, as well as vegetarian and meat options.  I've gotten take out once in the evening and it was awesome.\n\nI can't wait to go back and would recommend this place to anybody.
