You want fries? You got fries! You want a hotdog as thick and long as your arm? You got it, bubba! You want a shake? Good Luck, I've never made it past the first 2 items altough they look fantastic. \n\nThe crew is awesome and it is well worth the wait. Can't say enough good things about this place. You'll see me and the Miata club back there again this summer.
