Thanks to Yelp we found this gem! If we lived in Vegas this would be our go to place! Transports you from Vegas to a relaxing, warm and friendly French cafe. The aroma of fresh baked croissants is intoxicating from the moment you walk in. Tried the eggplant sandwich, vegetable soup and chocolate croissant. All delicious! Amazing white chocolate mocha! Can't wait to go back and try the quiche.
