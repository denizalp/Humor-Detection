This place never disappoint. I get either kofta or sultani kabob dinner. The meats always perfect. Juicy, tender, flavorful and never dry. The hot sauce is amazing, I usually get 2 packs.. I love the rice and the salads is nice and simple. House made naan is hit or miss at times(can be hard at times). I consider myself a heavy eater and I'm always stuffed after eating here.
