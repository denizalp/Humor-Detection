I wish I can give zero star for their poor, unacceptable service. Neither the waiter nor the manager knew the cocktail my friend ordered, which had been on their menu but discontinued at some point; instead of offering alternatives, the manager told the waiter to \"make something similar to blah blah\" in a very snappy manner. We could very well hear you - only two feet away from you. Strangely excellent quality service coming from a bar in a renowned Omni Resort!
