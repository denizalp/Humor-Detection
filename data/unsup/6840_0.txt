It's Subway.. not much else I can say except that this one has a real asshole working the cash register.. the guy who made my sub was nice enough but stark contrast to the cashier jerk off. When I was 18 years old I loved working, seems like this kid not only hated his job but didn't care for any of its customers either. \n\nThe stars are for the sandwich, spinach and the guy who made mine. Otherwise Ill probably only go to the one next to work, if I have to.
