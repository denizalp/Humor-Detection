I went to Hop Social Tavern on opening night and have probably been there 25 times since then! This place is amazing. The service is always outstanding. The owners are so nice and truly care about every customer walking through the door. The food is also very good. The pretzels and cheese and the donuts are to die for. Also, the chicken pot pie is the best i have ever had. This place is definitely a new go-to!!!
