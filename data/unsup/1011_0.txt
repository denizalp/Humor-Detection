I'm of mixed opinions about Baymont Inn and Suites in this case - yes it represents a good deal to those who do have a car, but options are limited nearby and housekeeping needs some serious work.  Admittedly a fan of the 24\/7 gym, the elliptical was broken during my stay and the treadmill belt occasionally slips - all this for a $9.99 amenities fee added on at the end of the trip.\n\nSure it is cheaper than on-strip options, but aside from the basics you also 'get what you pay for.'
