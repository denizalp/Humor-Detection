I love this studio! I have been going here for over 2 years. I always feel welcomed and really enjoy the classes. In my opinion, hot yoga is one of the best forms of exercise. I personally feel the instructors are top notch and occasionally get help with my form. You will get more personal attention if you go the flow classes as they are generally less crowed.
