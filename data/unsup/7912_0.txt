OMG! Our favorite place to go anytime we are in Phoenix! Rode the light rail all the way across town to make it there before heading to the airport! The absolute best customer service we received at any restaurant while on vacation including an expensive spot in Sedona! Food is always top notch quality and best ingredients like sweet cream butter and real maple syrup. Love love love Matts!!
