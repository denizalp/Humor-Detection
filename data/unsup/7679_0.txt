This Starbucks is the worse orders always wrong wait time is awful and staff does not care I tried telling them 22 minutes in drive thru was excessive she said I can't control amount of cars in drive thru okay true but you can take orders faster and get people their drinks in a timely manner am I wrong? How hard is a grande coffee with cream pretty hard I guess considering twice they omitted the darn cream really I wonder if Jarred the manager even cares
