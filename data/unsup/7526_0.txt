Life Goes On at Corky's. I think a lot of people go here for the sing along music. I think a lot of energy has been transferred to that activity. It is sad because that takes away from the drinking aspect. This was a good bar to be down and out at. I still have had excellent times at Corky's and it is one of the best bars in the Cleveland area.
