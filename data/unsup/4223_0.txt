We wanted our pool to be retiled  and replastered. Plus we wanted a new pump. This entire job was to be completed in two weeks. We are into our fourth week and the pool is not completed. Shasta put in the wrong pump and have since put in another one. Neither of these pumps were the one we wanted. Shasta's attitude has been, well it's too early to swim anyway. This disarray has been very trying. I would never have Shasta do anymore work for me. I certainly would never recommend them to anyone.
