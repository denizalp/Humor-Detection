Always go on Mondays.  Senior Mondays! ! Love the 50% off the meals. We always sit at the counter.  The waiter named Constantine is the best! He is so friendly and great at what he does. Always checking on us and refilling our beverages. He aways remembers us. The garlic shrimp pasta was good and the chicken parm was good too.
