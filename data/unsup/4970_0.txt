The food here is always good but the reason I am giving it one star is so that maybe somebody that works here will see this and take care of the problem.\n\nThe little Latina girl that works here right now at about 12 o'clock on Saturday is very rude and I mean exceptionally dirty looks at the customers and acts like she doesn't even want a job.\n\nif this is the kind of people you're going to employ then I don't want to eat here anymore.
