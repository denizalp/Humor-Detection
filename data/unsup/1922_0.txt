I like this little store. It's nothing compared to the giant store in north Scottsdale. However, I like shopping here because it's a little bit less crazy most of the time. They don't carry all the stuff (and no food court or bar-haha) that the other store has, but they still have most of the good stuff. I usually go there after shopping at Trader Joe's!
