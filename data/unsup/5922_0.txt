Did great work the first time. The second time I brought a pair of new jeans in for hemming that had been worn for a few hours to make sure they fit well. The woman working the counter claimed that the small amount of dust on the original hem from this wear constituted soiling, a part that would be cut off prior to hemming. Being that these are raw denim, washing them to remove some extremely insignificant dust would ruin the point of having purchased raw denim. Ridiculous, I'll take my tailoring needs elsewhere from now on.
