Got my lunch here (to go), beef brocolli & chicken teriyaki my all-time fave, this time it is so tender and perfect for my sensitive teeth, satisfied with the food but not really with the cashier who was nice at first but after I said \"next time\" on her offer to donate on a charity they've chosen, she started frowning and didn't smile at all (not knowing I'm donating regulary every quarter for the charity directly)ofcourse I won't say that.Just paid my order and went home to eat.
