This place is pretty darn good. The bar menu is a steal if you come during happy hour. Lunch has amazing deals. The salsa is amazing. Good place to come after-work, or have an office social.\n\nI made the mistake of coming here on Cinco de Mayo... Avoid at all costs.\n\nDinner can be a little pricey, but all in all, Charlotte is lucky to have this place.
