This place is really fun! We took the kids to have some fun recently and we had a great time. The prices are in line with what you'd pay at similar attractions, but they have a lot more to choose from. There were too many attractions to list, but my favorites were the electric go karts, virtual reality, laser tag, and food truck alley. I played putt putt too, but it wasn't very impressive.\n\nWe'll be back for more!
