We actually stayed in a suite in the Venezia tower.\nI loved that fact that we got adjoining suite, and the Venetian did what was possible to get us our adjoining suite.\nIt was a little complicated to find at first but I found it!\nThe rooms were not bad at all. \nLoved the spacious bathroom and the amenities. \nThe bed was comfortable, but the pillows were a little small though.
