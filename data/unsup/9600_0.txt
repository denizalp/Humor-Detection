I know the place looks a bit skeptical but no worries! They do a good job and you can relax and reduce stress while having massage. Their price is really cheap, so I can afford to go there anytime I want! Unless your expectation is really high or prefer gorgeous sophisticated spa, you will be satisfied with their massage. Oh, some don't speak English, but it's OK. You needn't talk to them a lot since you will easily fall asleep in a sofa.
