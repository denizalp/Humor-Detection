It's Starbucks; consistent. \n\nI know that if I need my Chai, or breakfast wrap, they will have it available and ready for me in minutes. It also helps that I use the Mobile Ordering so all I have to do is go to the pick up counter and tell them I'm picking up my mobile order. \n\nService is also consistent. \nAs with all Starbucks, it's more good than bad. At this location, the staff are nice and friendly and I've never had a bad experience here.
