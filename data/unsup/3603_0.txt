The service was deplorable. The resturaunt was about 75% full yet took our server 15 min to greet us and take our order.  I ordered coffee with the meal and it came out well after our food did. At no point were we offered a refill or to go boxes.  The food was delicious.  The manager was apologetic and took off the coffee as well as gave us an employee discount for our experience. Thanks, Michael.
