Great class for facing your fears, or simply breaking up the monotony of drinking on the Strip. Gorgeous view of the Strip as the sun begins to set. I didn't think I'd learn much in a 2 hour class with 12 students, but it was definitely enough. There's a small intro before you begin, the rest you learn in the air. My friend and I were both able to do a catch by the end. The instructors were hilarious and knowledgable. Definitely worth the money.
