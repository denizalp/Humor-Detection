I came here about a month ago with my boyfriend. We sat at the bar, were given a menu, and ignored for about 5-8 minutes. The bartender didn't even say one word to us. I waited patiently, since I am a bartender myself. Then a party of 5 or so walked in the door, came up to the bar, and the bartender walked right up to them and asked if they wanted drinks. So we got up and left.. Won't be returning anytime soon. Horrible service
