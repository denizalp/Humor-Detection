GD is chain similar to a Rock Bottom or BJs. Three stars for a chain is good. They brew OK beer and serve food common to pubs. The only reason we came here instead of one of the better, original places on the square is because we had too many people in our party to think we could get a table together at a better place. GD came through with an immediate table, service, beer and food.... all at adequate quality.
