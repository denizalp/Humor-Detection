I've been here a few times. My kids meals came out wrong, beef instead of chicken. The waitress attempted to argue with me about what I ordered.  Then, I told her we were missing three sushi rolls and she looked at me as if I was in need of a mental facility (that may be true, but a crazy look is not an admissible diagnoses) C'mon really!!!She was so unfriendly and should really consider an alternative career path.
