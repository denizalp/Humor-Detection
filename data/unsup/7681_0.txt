I went for a cheap meal since there was no dinner at home one night. Given the price I paid ($9.00) the servings were surprisingly large. In addition the food was cooked well, the chicken was soft and cooked through, the potatoes were also done well and not over or undercooked as you sometimes find fast food places do it, and finally the rice was also a similar fashion. \nI am satisfied with the service given and would come here again if I am in need of a quick meal.
