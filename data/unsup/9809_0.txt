Friendly staff, local beer and awesome food. Got the Castro on the pretzel bread. The pork was on point. The portions are huge the house made fries and chips are crispy and not greasy. The sauces are tasty. My wife tried the trailer park the chili has an amazing flavor it was also house made. Grab a table get a drink and play a game like battleship or connect four. Well worth checking out if you are in the melrose district.
