The owner called me a \"fucking moron\" for walking through his gravel parking lot to get to my car that was parked on the street.  He threatened to call the police and said I was trespassing.  So, yeah.  I will stick to the sidewalk and definitely will not venture inside if that's how he treats people.  I am a regular at Yoga Oasis and it has plenty of information on Chi energy and Qigong breathing anyway!
