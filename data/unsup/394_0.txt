Incredible!  Amazing service and delicious food. After you get there, they offer you a tour of their fish market, where you can pick your favorite after a fresh selection of fish.  They also guide you on the taste and texture And recommend a style of preparation for each.  But essentially you can choose between grilling and frying.  Appetizers are great as well - really loved the octopus.  They make a mean dirty martini as well.  Definitely stays on my Vegas \"to re-do\" list!
