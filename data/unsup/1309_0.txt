Other reviews about the food are well written and more detailed so this will be more about the service. I will say I liked the variety of noodles as each of us chose something different. The staff here were very proactive and friendly.  They saw us peering in and came out invited us in, very quickly made room for 5 (including baby) stored the stroller in back and explained the menu very well for us newbies.  Later they rescued us when my 18 month old spilled my dish all over the table and floor... 10\/10 polite and patient.
