The food is only slightly above standard, but they do not cook phone orders when you call. I called in an order and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I didn't get my food until 45 minutes after I called! People we're getting orders that they ordered after I was already there. The worst part is that no one apologized or thanked me for being patient. If I hadn't already paid I would have left. Terrible service!
