Being new to this state I'm in need of a mechanic.  When my car needed brakes, I asked Wal-Mart if they did brakes to which I was suggested to check Masterwerks.  \nThey were recommended on the basis of being fair and honest mechanics.\nMy visit was a pleasure.  They were able to service me right away, and I did feel as if they were being honest and not pushing about other work the car did or may have needed.\nThey weren't the cheapest though, but not the most expensive either (as I already had two quotes to compare).
