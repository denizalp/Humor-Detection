Just visited Khaos last week and I must say the outfits are cute but pricey and what really threw me off was you aren't allowed to take pictures of ANYTHING in the store. Funny thing, all I wanted to do was Twit how cute the stick on tattoos were but I was informed it was NOT ALLOWED...WOW. \nMy friend and I left the store empty handy and we were planning to buy.
