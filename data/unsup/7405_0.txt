Got to be honest I had to ask for directions to find this spot because there's no signs for it. So after I found it I walked down the long hallway to a little pizza counter. The menu is pretty small so I got two slices of white and a cannoli which was alright. I was drunk so the pizza probably would've tasted better. The prices were sky high it was something like 5 bucks for a slice. It's not a bad little spot if you can find and the pizza is pretty good.
