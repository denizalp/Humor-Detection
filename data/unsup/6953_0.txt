I have mixed feelings about the purple towels......They weren't all the same shade of purple.  This hotel has a great location and comfy beds.  There's oddly placed tv's in the elevators.  Decent pools, and ample room to layout without actually being near the pool.\n\nIf you can get a good deal on a room, it's got a good location.  The basic rooms are smaller than some other properties on the strip. Also, it was hard to find room to set up the iron without plugging it in inside the bathroom - lack of accessible electric outlets.
