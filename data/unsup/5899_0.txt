I've never tried their food, but this place has a nice selection of fresh-baked, tasty pies.  The employees are very friendly and helpful.\n\nNow to the bad part...these types of restaurants seem to be very popular with senior citizens and you can tell because as soon as you walk in the door, the odor hits you in the face!  The air honestly smells like a nursing home!  Some people may not mind it or be used to it, but I think that smell alone would deter me from dining in at this establishment.  It smells like old people!
