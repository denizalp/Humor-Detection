Vietnamese food of very high quality.  Strong flavors and generous portions of sprouts and greens.  Attentive hostess\/cook.  Not on the level of the South Vietnamese empire in northern Virginia, but to be thought of and mentioned in that context is compliment enough.\n\nI am confused as to why Loi 101 does not mandate the translation of \"Nhu Y\" into French.  Mostly because I enjoy \"Cafe Starbucks Coffee,\" \"Poulet Frit Kentucky,\" \"L'Usine de Spaghetti\" and \"Bureau en Gros\" so damn much.
