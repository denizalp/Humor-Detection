Smallest airport known to man. There's only one airline (AA, unfortunately) and it takes about 5 mins to walk through security. You can get dropped off right in front of the terminal and checking in takes about 5 mins.\n\nAt the gate, there is a coffee vending machine, which was tempting, but I didnt have any cash. The gate itself was FREEZING for some ungodly reason, so I was excited when it was time to board.
