Great place, great people, great food!  Been coming to this establishment for years!  Ask them anything, ask for anything, get a friendly answer!  I have asked for special things I like, and WOW it was done - if at all possible!  Treat these people like family and it's amazing what service you get!  I don't go anywhere else for my sushi fix!  In fact my Father in Law introduced me to this place years ago when it was located in Scottsdale!  Enjoy!
