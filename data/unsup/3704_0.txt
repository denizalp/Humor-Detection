Meh. Noodles were ok, the pork bun was pretty good and the raspberry cheesecake was ok. I know it's a noodle place but other than the pork. In they had no protein on the menu. When one of us wanted to get some protein in their upstairs restaurant to go, they said they wouldn't let us eat it together. So I would not recommend for groups unless everyone wants to eat noodles.
