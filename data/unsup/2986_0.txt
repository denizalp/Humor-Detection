Ah Golden Bowl. I affectionately refer to this restaurant as Golden bowels, because that greasy Chinese food will you know... Make you poo gold. Look don't read too much into it ok? It's a nickname, can we just move on?\n\nThe significance of GB is that they deliver. They're pretty quick, the price is pretty good and the quality has been very consistent over the years.\n\nI usually order the spicy shrimp noodles, salt and pepper tofu and orange beef.. The steamed fish is pretty good too.\n\nI don't like eating there for some reason. It's all about delivery. Cash only.
