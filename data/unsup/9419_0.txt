The Creme de la Creme of Vegas buffets priced around $20!\n\ni like how the main dishes are served ala cart, tapas style.   Quality cuts of various meats: chicken, lamb, pork, and beef.    The trick to enjoying Wicked Spoon is to try a little of Everything.  \n\nSetting is very trendy.  Water is even served in stylish glass bottles (you feel like you paid for it!)  \n\nI'm cutting this review short because I overate and now have a serious case of food coma.
