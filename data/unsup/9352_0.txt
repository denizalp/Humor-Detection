In my top five places to get ramen but definitely not top three. They are always packed. The place is small and intimate. I suggest sitting at the counter. I usually get the shoyu ramen and add some kimchi, egg, moyashi, and extra pork. The size of the bowl is the right size, just filling enough. Overall a good place to get ramen but there are better places in my opinion.
