The food was pretty exceptional and the service was well, but within 15 minutes of being seated a man at the table next to us began to vomit profusley for 30 seconds straight all over the place. The smell was pretty overwhelming and it made the meal pretty impossible to enjoy, yet the staff failed to apologize for the inconvenience and also did not offer to make part or all of the meal complimentary, which is the least you can do after something that disgusting happened. Kind of ruined the restaurants image for me.
