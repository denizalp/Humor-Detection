This place is excellent.  Many of the reviews mentioned the high price, but the quality of the ingredients warrants it.  The mozzarella and tomato sauce on the pizzas are awesome (these have been my primary food groups since birth, so I think I have some authority on the matter).  The truffle pizza is a must try - very unique and incredibly delicious.  This is definitely my favorite pizza in town.
