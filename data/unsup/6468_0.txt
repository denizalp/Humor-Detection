I'm great that i found Dean. He is hidden gem. My hair was so long, dry and tangled. He spend time cutting my hair and very detail as professional. For cutting hair will cost you $ 35-45 depends on the length. Now i already stop looking for the good salon because I already found the best one.I am highly recommended !!!
