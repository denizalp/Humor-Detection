It's our second time to be here. We are stuck in Vegas due to the Hurricane Harvey and this little restaurant makes us feel like home after a long journey.  Especially the pickle cabage is extremely great even though It's free. And they also offer green bean soup in traditional Chinese cups for free. The noodles and the dumplings are authentic as well, which tastes the exactly the same way as we had them in China. I would definitely come here again and recommend it to my friends.
