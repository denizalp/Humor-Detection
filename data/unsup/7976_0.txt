For all you pita lovers, this is your place to go! Friendly service and a variety of food to try from\nPita wraps, pizzas, salads and more. My friends love to come here and recommended the chicken pita wrap which I ordered. The wrap is big and enough to share with 2 people. I only ate half of the wrap. They don't skimp on the chicken either. The wrap came with a salad which was very fresh and perfect complement to the wrap. Next time I want to try their pizzas! \n\nParking: large lot
