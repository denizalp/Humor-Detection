The service was horrible (waited over 45 mins despite not being that busy) and the food was worse. To be fair, the idli and dosa tasted ok, however, the sambar was sweet (not authentic), and the chutneys were bland. I ordered the 'signature' saag paneer dosa, and it was barely green! Where did the saag\/spinach go?
