Kona Grill is always the go-to spot either on the strip or off at Boca Park. Happy hour or even just for lunch are both great options.\n\nI've tried: \nSpicy tuna roll\nCrab crunch roll\nCalifornia roll\nAvocado egg rolls\nChicken lettuce wraps \nLas Vegas Roll\n\nThey were all great options, but definitely worth it when they go on happy hour!\n\nOverall, great place for a good time and good food.
