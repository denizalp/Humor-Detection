Stopped here last night for a quick bite before catching a show at Gammage.  I'd recommend it for ease of parking and proximity to the theater alone.  Fortunately, the food was pretty darn tasty, too.  \nI started with Blood Orange Caipirissima cocktail, which was good, if a little sweet.  My wife had the Mexican Mule, which she really enjoyed.  We both each had a braised short rib taco and a battered cod taco, and these were delicious.  Great flavor, great textures, and would definitely order again.  I'll be back.
