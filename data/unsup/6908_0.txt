I went in with two of my friends and we were told we could not sit inside (with the place being mostly empty) because my friends didn't have their wallets on them and couldn't buy their coffee. Absolutely terrible customer service, and inept social skills. You're coffee rush, not a 5 star restaurant. Ridiculous.
