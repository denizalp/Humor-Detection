I give only 5 stars because there is no 6th star.\n\nClient Service - head guy understood my problem was kind and knowledgable.  5 stars\n\nMechanics - were happy and man that shop is top notch.  You can tell they want to be there.  5 stars plus.\n\nOwner - drove me home so I didn't have to wait at the shop.  5 stars.\n\nPrices - for my newer car they were very reasonable, made me dislike the dealership really fast!   5 stars.  \n\nYelpers, they were better at everything and at a lower price.  Be wise.\n\nThanks guys!!
