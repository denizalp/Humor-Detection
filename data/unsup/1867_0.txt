My beef dip sandwich of the day was drenched in mayo even though I asked for no mayo. Apparently the chef was calling it \"pommery\" so the waitress didn't know. Who would want mayo all over a sandwich served with gravy? Gross! My friend's beans were hard. Three of us spent $100 on unhealthy \"meh\" food and a round of beer. Atmosphere was unimpressive. Hated the tvs.
