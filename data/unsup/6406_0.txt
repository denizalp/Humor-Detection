Needed a special piece for a American Standard faucet that was at least 25-30 years old.\nI brought the part to the counter and showed the man there the part.\nthe customer service was great the gentleman there where very friendly and helpful.\nThe store did not have the part but they did recommend a plumbing supply store that specialized in American Standard parts.\nOverall even know they did not have the part I needed the service was great and I was posted in the right direction for the part.\nWhich in my mind is great customer service.
