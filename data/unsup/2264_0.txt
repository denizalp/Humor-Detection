I can't say enough about Pilgrim Rest. If you are looking for a church in the valley, give this one a try. You will not be disappointed! A world class choir, a pastor that makes the word easy to understand and has you looking forward to coming back for more! Don't take my word or anyone else's ....Come see for yourself! Bishop Thomas and The Pilgrim Rest Family will feel like your long lost church home!
