Got my haircut done via a Groupon Now. Deal didn't include blowdry but that wasn't a problem.  The haircut was pretty good, with the exception that the shape is a little triangular for my curly hair, however I did ask her to only take a little off.  \nThe hairdresser worked quick and was pretty easy to chat with and nice. In relation to other peoples comments about the dirt or poor service, I didn't experience that trouble.  \nOverall, pretty good.
