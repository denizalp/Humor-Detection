My husband and I recently ate there while traveling. The food was perfect. The wait staff was perfect, especially Jake who took care of us like we were very special people. The experience was sexy, very cool and worth every penny.  It really was a treat. Filets were wonderful, salad so yummy, potatoes lovely and ending with the donut holes topped it off. Thank you to all.
