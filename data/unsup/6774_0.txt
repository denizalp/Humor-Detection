I can not, for the life of me figure out how\/why Food Network came to this hole.\nI live within walking distance, and you couldn't pay me to eat here again.\nTortillas are cold and chewy, STALE chips, nasty wanna be \"real\" salsa. \nFish tacos have no taste, shrimp tacos came out ice cold. They make you wait forever, service is meh.....\nOverall, I can't figure out how this place has stayed in business for so long. Maybe because it has become a \"hip spot\" for those without taste buds.
