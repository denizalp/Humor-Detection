Oakville Place is not bad compare to a lot of other Shopping Centres I been to!\n\nHuge skylights letting the bright sunlight filter in... warm even during the dreadful long winter months...\n\nStores are decent with Style Sense, Mexx, Birks and DavidsTea! \n\nFree WIFI access? \n\nComfy armchairs?\n\nClean and Quiet?\n\nNot bad at all!!!
