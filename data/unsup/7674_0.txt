With our American cell service not working, we were allured into La Cubana. We were hungry and the vintage diner feel and good lighting encouraged us to give it a try. Sadly, we were disappointed. In order to pull of the vintage diner feel, you have to keep it classy and the cheesy menus and the t-shirts the staff were wearing, shows it wouldn't be a quality experience. We found the service a little slow and my cubano was nothing special. If you don't have other options, go here, but if you do, try another nearby top rated restaurant.
