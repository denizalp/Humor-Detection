It was just ok. It was so close to my hotel, and I didn't feel like driving around. The sushi was eh, the food was eh. It's a huge ass buffet, almost too big. If they made it smaller, they could focus on making everything better. It's just your average Chinese buffet. You get what you pay for. I don't think I would go again.
