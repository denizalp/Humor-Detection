The food was good. My mother and I were quite annoyed with the staff! Our server was very nice and it isn't that the staff isn't nice, most of them are. What was annoying that the one waitress was allowed to have her children run around. Sorry Luna's is not a daycare! I have no problem with people bringing children to work but watch them!
