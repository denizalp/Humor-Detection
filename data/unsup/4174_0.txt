Highly recommend this spa and specifically Lexis. The location is convenient, very cute, clean, the staff is friendly. The price is great and they have a lot of options for waxing packages. They also offer lash extensions and facials. \nI got the Brazilian sugar and while it's never fun- Lexis made me comfortable and at ease and my results were great.
