I was a little disppointed by my experience at Bacchus Roti Shop.  We tried the jerk chicken roti and the potatoes were so overstewed that it was one mushy mess.  The flavor was ok, but not spicy enough.  The decor was happy and modern, but fit more the neighborhood (hipster) than the food.  We shared one roti, and they split it into two portions for us, which I did appreciate.
