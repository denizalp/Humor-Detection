Came here for a CES networking event and was blown away with the food! We had stuffed dates, garlic chicken skewers, ham and cheese croquettes, and paella. They also passed artichoke crostini and tomato chutney toast. It was all amazing! My favorite was the dates stuffed with an almond, rolled in bacon and cooked with a red wine reduction, melted in my mouth with a little crunch from the almond. I would recommend this place to anyone. Exceptional for sharing as the plates are all served tapas style.
