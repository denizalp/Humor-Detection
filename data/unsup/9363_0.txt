Their chicken is the best. Their marination is my favorite. My husband and I go there for takeout. Also we buy their extra marination spicy sauce and we use more of it on the chicken. In fact we started using it on all our food. Always crowded and busy but worth the wait. This is why we always prefer to takeout.
