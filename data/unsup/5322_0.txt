Why does this buffet get so many good reviews? It's terrible.  Everything is portioned out into small portions and the food is mostly cold. Here's an example: cocktail shrimp are put in tiny cups and they put two tiny shrimp in each cup.  I eat about 20 cocktail shrimp at a Vegas buffet, so you can imagine what that looked like.  Also, the bone marrow had turned into a gelatin.  As if bone marrow wasn't gross enough.\n\nThe only redeeming quality is that there's gelato.  Yippee?  \n\nFor $40 at dinner I should have just gone to Ruth Chris.
