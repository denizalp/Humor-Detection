I visited this place a couple times before they changed the name. The last time we went there was not enough staff, kids running all over and no one really monitoring the ol at areas. I did complain and I was told by two staff members that they agree the place has gone down since the name change. I may give it one more try, but there are so many jump places around, it really don't have to. I hope by now things have gotten a little more organized.
