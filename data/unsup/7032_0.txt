This May clinic is brand new. The first class of medical residents will be matriculating this fall. \nThe outpatient hospital was quiet, clean, and welcoming. There was shuttle transportation available for patients. There was a super friendly greeter who asked us if she could direct us or assist us. \nThe bathrooms were very close to the entrance and were very clean. \nThere was ample seating for family waiting. It was clean and aesthetically appealing. \nThe exterior had a nice garden to walk through and an elevator to the underground parking garage.
