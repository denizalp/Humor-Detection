I checked the rental rates around the country, and the fees are in line with what others are charging.  You get bikes that are in great mechanical shape and the shop is right on the bike trail.  I also like that the ice cream and cold water are sold at reasonable prices.  One other cool thing is the misting station, I just love stopping here on a hot day...just for the misting station.  The staff is very enthusiastic and friendly, this is a well run shop.
