We are new residents of Casa Del Sol and are so grateful for the kindness and care we have enjoyed. Nancy and her staff have gone the second mile to accommodate our needs and make us feel welcome. The office is eager to guide us as we are new to Nevada. We appreciate the cleanliness and order of the park. Todd, the assistant manager is always there to help with projects and problems of any sort. We feel we have moved to a new family and look forward to our time here.
