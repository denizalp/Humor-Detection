I bought a Nissan Sentra in United Nissan.\nI was very impressed with the attention.\nRoland was clear, polite and quick at giving answers,\nnever pushy and it makes a lot of difference.\nCustomer service was impeccable, Elsa was very\nefficient, gave me the impression she was there \nonly because of me. I am talking to my friends about\nthis shop. \nOf course I am very happy with my new car.\nThank you guys. It was a beautiful experience.\nHope to see you soon when my husband change his\ncar.\nNelly Scheer
