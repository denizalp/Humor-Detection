THUMBS DOWN.... Really? When you walk in, the counter has security bars all around it!? We stood for three minutes at the counter, ready to order. We were never greeted but there were 3 people working.... There were no other customers there...not in a good location, between smoke shop and nail salon. \nWho really gave this place so many stars?!
