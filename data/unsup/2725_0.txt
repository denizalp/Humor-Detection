One of my favorite places for delicious food! We've had breakfast here several times with no complaints. Definitely recommend going in as soon as they open on a weekend as they fill up fast! But so worth the wait! Fresh squeezed orange juice, homemade bakery items in huge portions. We always get a large free sample of bagel chips and their flavor of the month home made cream cheese.
