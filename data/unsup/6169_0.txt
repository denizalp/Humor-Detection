Pretty cool place to prep for the end of the world, they have lots of guns and great service.  They have tons of clothing, MRE's, supplies, and just all around army surplus.  The place is not huge but they have plenty of stuff.  They even rent metal targets which is very cool since most people leave their trash in the desert and metal targets can be pricey.  If you are in the NW valley you should check this place out.
