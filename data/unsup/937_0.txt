I am NOT a fan of Charter. The service is spotty. I am constantly having to reset both my modem and router to get my wireless network to work. They keep raising the price every year, and their customer service is terrible. But I live in McFarland and don't have any other choices that I know of. So unfortunately I am pretty much stuck with them if I want high speed cable internet.
