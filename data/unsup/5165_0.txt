Neat concept, mediocre ice cream. \n\nWe came on a Thursday night and luckily snatched the last batch of the Mr. Grey (earl grey with whipped cream and waffle) before it was sold out. \n\nWatching our ice cream being rolled was the best part of the experience. However, taste wise, the ice cream was nothing out of the ordinary. Texture\/ taste was exactly like regular ice cream. The rolls melt SUPER fast so don't spend eons taking a photo. \n\nOverall verdict: Definitely worth a try...at least before BlogTO writes about it and the lines go crazy.
