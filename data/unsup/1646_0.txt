If you like watching long, dyed haired, middle aged men play air guitar and lip sync, this is for you!!  Throw in a few women playing air violin and it's a sensory overload!!  I cannot get over how absolutely pathetic this so called \"Orchestra\" was.  Christmas show?  This was an 80's heavy metal show.  Like sitting through a Dokken show.  Only difference, there was a black man narrating some nonsense between a few songs.  I can't get my arms around how absolutely stupid this was!!!  Merry Christmas everyone and save your money for a real Christmas show!!!!
