We just moved to the neighborhood and stopped in on a Friday night. The owner came up and personally greeted us and gave us a tasty dessert at the end of the meal.\n\nWe ordered the dolmades and 2 chicken souvlakis with a salad. Both were well portioned and delicious.\n\nThe prices are fair here, 2 meals, an app, and 3 glasses of wine for $45! Will definitely be coming back for takeout and to sit down with family.
