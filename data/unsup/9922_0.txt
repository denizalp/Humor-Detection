Ok truth time: I didn't buy anything at this store.  BUT, my experience was amazing!!!! Why?  The owner provided very detailed information about many of the brands we inquired about. She was friendly, smart and oh so knowledgeable. I like that in a business owner!\n\nThe variety of shoes in stock was overwhelming. I could have spent so much money here (but my husband was with me).  Shoes are comfortable, well made, and colorful for comfort shoes. The assortment blew me away. I will go back for some cute summer sandals. Not taking my hubby though. ;)
