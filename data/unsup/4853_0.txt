Went here for a meet up. Called ahead to let them know we had a large group, and would be doing separate checks.\n\nWaitress was nice. Some of the happy hour deals were great. Unimpressed with the garlic fries. Go for hangover fries instead.\n\n She missed a couple of thongs while ordering, and we had to help her with the check when it came to who had what. \n\nShe was nice, and we had a good time overall. \nWill definitely go back. Good for large groups!
