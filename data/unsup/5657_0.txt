The place is cool, lovely and romantic. This is a Brazilian restaurant with Brazilian servers (I think). \n\nMeal portion is adequate and if you are like me, won't be able to finish it. It's not huge like a Montana-type size though. It has more class and presented nicely. \n\nChef Mario knows his stuff. I stayed here for four long hours until they closed just after eleven. We were not kicked out but the music was politely turned off ;). \n\nI will come back here for sure to bring a date or eat with friends. A bit pricey fyi.
