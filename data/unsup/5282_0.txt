This is the location located on the northeast corner of Green Valley Pkwy and Sunset Drive. The place is always very clean and easy to find, being right on the corner in front of the other business there.\n\nI stop here from time to time and I have always been pleased with the service I recieve here. When there is a line, it always moves at a reasonably fast pace. The ctellers have always been friendly and pleasant, while still being efficient.\n\n4 stars
