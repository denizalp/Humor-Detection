I cannot believe how good my Brazilian sugar was here! I was so nervous from my last waxing experience, but Leah took her time and went slow. It was far less painful than waxing, and the overall experience was better. I laughed the whole time! The ladies at the front are so friendly and great as well, I definitely will be a regular here! Thanks guys!
