I ordered a chile ramen with steak and shrimp to go. It was $11 fucking dollars. Get back to work to find out I paid extra for a fucking dish I didn't even fucking want. Thanks for paying attention to your jobs. It's annoying how it's literally the simplest task to give someone the right dish, yet you've managed to fuck it up anyway
