This was truly an experience.  The manager was incredibly unhelpful and the one employee that did help us tried to disuade us from a purchase because the item was \"expensive and we only keep it in the back\".  The item was $19.95. It took 10 minutes for the employee to retrieve the item and another 5-7 minutes to pay for it because the manager and employee were arguing over how to ring up our purchase.  Will not be back to this location
