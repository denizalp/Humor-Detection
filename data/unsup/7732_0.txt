Went here to get a smoothie and a sandwich for lunch. When I walked in the girl behind the counter was cleaning something in the gutter on the floor. She came over to help me in a couple mins without washing her hands. After taking my order she started to prepare the smoothie without washing her hands. I immediately asked for the manager and he didn't seem concerned at all he just asked her to wash her hands. He was not apologetic at all he just went back to what he was doing. This place lost my business!
