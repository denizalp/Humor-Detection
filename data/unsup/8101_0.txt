They do not take reservations so the wait is about 30 minutes.  \n\nThe menu has an option of an all-you-can-eat (AYCE) dinner or ala carte. \n\nWe did the AYCE and the orders came out fast, hot and fresh.  Everything that we ordered was awesome, we ran out of space before we could sample the entire menu (not that it was possible for 4 average appetite people)\n\nThis is another place we are going to visit on our next trip to Vegas!
