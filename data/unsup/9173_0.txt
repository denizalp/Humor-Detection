Amazing! I was so impressed that I'm writing this review. I had eggs Benny and BF had chicken waffle with latte. Everything was delicious. Everything tasted freshly cooked and prepared. I'm not a salad eater but I ate the salad too! Service was fantastic and friendly. I would definitely recommend this place and I will come back again. I live in Scarborough but this place was worth the travel.
