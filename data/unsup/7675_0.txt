Cheap shutters..  Owner talked me into the slider shutters. He said they would block out most of sun..not even close.  \n\nVery flimsy plastic coverings. Installer was very professional and quick. Screws are sticking out at all angles and it will be a mess to replace.  I have been putting it off but need to clean up the mess.
