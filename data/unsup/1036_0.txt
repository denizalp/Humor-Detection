How in the world you can change the definition of Danish pastry for me??? \nYou are making my life harder! \nNow I won't be happy with any random Danish pastry and you are TOO far! \nA sweet client of ours surprised us with three boxes delivered to our office. \nTHE BEST we've ever had in our lives! \nYou guys need to open a location in East Valley pls!
