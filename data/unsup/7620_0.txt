WOW, I like this place.  Really Posh yet comfortable atmosphere.  The food is wonderful and inventive, the beer selection is a who's who of micro brew and the patio is a great place to spend an afternooon day drinking!  It tends to get a little over crowded on the weekend nights so I usually stick to Sat. & Sun. afternoons.  Again a great place to chill with friends, drink great beer and enjoy the weather.  Happy hour here is always popular and the grilled wings cant beat!
