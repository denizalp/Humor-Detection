Bought the Self-Study Guide package last week. They said I had a 28 day time frame to get a refund. I decided I did not want to pursue a CPT career and when I called to cancel, they told me they would have to charge a 10% administrative fee to process the refund. I picked the installment option, so I had only paid $122 for the first month, but the refund 10% was charged on the total package, so I ended up not getting a full refund. Obviously they just want your money.
