I have had a couple of friends recommend this place and I am so thankful I chose to try it out! You get to build your own personal pizza, or choose one from the menu that is already built out. They cook the pizza in a fire oven and it comes out within 5 minutes! Blaze Pizza is super fast, fresh, and all around absolutely amazing! I will definitely be coming back.
