Shamrock roofing company is a sham. Beware of estimates and work done by them. They came out to inspect a roof on a house in Mesa for a Realtor who is the listing agent and did not see the water damage under the eves or in the bedrooms. Three other reputable roofing companies all caught the water damage and gave a fair estimate for repairs. Shamrock roofing on the other hand was going to silicone the cracked and broken tiles and did not inspect the under lament. I give this roofing company two thumbs down and a Dumpster!
