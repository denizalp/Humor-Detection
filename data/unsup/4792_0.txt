Spotted this store while wondering the OP on a lazy saturday. I'm so glad I went in since I snagged a lunch bento box for my friend. It has 2 levels and seals with snap locks. Its microve and dishwasher safe. They sell products from Asian, everything I saw was super cute and practical as well as unique. It'a definitely as investmemt but worth the splurge. Staff is friendly.
