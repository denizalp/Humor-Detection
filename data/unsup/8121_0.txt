Strong pours, intimiate setting with fireplaces, and filled with downtowns best looking group... what more could you ask for? \n\nAlthough this is my favorite place to come downtown I have 1 slight issue with the female bar staff. They are rude & condensending. But I guess that doesnt keep people away.\n\nMy suggestion? Sit at a table, deal with the cocktail servers instead :)
