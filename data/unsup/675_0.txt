Wow, I didn't realize they had such good food. They have vegetarian and vegan options available for many items. \nThe service was the best I've had at any restaurant I've been to and the cooks are great with substitutions. \nI had the barboca califlour tacos with no sauce and cheese. Still amazing! Plus the have a lentil dish that is tasty!!
