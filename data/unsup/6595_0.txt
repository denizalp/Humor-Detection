I called tonight to see if I could make a reservation to eat AND to look at the restaurant as a potential venue for a retirement party (75-100 people) next month.  The Hostess was too busy to discuss it and said they would have to get back to me.  I asked if I could at least see the event room if I came in tonight for dinner and was told no, which didn't set well with me.  Really?  Business must be great to blow a deal for a potential party of 100.  Pretty lousy customer relations!!
