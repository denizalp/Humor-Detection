Not impressed. I didn't really like it last time, and got dragged again by my vegetarian \/ vegan friends. I thought that I played it safe with my order of crispy duck and sticky rice, but for $30 after tax and tip, I could do better in almost any other place around the neighbourhood. My friends loved it; I was the minority opinion... But I like what I like! (and I don't like the food here, not for this price, for sure!)
