Ordered delivery from Eat24. Food arrived hot and on time. Absolutely no complaints. Good food (Mussels, Caesar Salad, Pretzel bites, and Rib Eye Steak....steak cooked as ordered) The only reason I can't do 5 stars is that it is just a bit overpriced. A bit higher quality for the price or just a bit lower price for the (decent quality) food would make this a 5 Star. Overall....I do recommend and will order again.
