Went to Farmhouse Tavern not realizing we needed a reso - the owner called up to the Daughter and had a table ready for us!\nThe food was great - i had the Kale Benny which I loved - the French toast looked amazing and my Dad thoroughly enjoyed the burger... Will def be coming back! And will be making a reso at Farmhouse Tavern
