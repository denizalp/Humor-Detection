This is a great little spot in Charlotte.  It might seem pricey at first, but if you got a special event or special date night coming up, check out this place.  Joe and Tim are excellent butchers and provide you with great advice.  The ladies up front are always friendly and warm to everyone.  You feel as if you are truly appreciated and a guest rather than just a customer.  Great place to go as it warms up.
