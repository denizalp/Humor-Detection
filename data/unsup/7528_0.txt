You can't go wrong with made-to-order cake donuts and freshly brewed coffee. I got the Cinnamon Sugar with Vanilla Drizzle (holiday spirit donut, anyone?!) and Peanut Butter and Chocolate Drizzles, freaking delicious.\n\nHow it works:\n- Choose your coating: glazed, powdered sugar, or icing.\n- Choose your topping: sprinkles, chocolate, graham Cracker, chopped peanuts, bacon Pieces, shredded coconut, or oreos.\n- Choose your drizzle: hot fudge, marshmallow, salted caramel, raspberry, or blackberry.\n\nDonuts were fresh and small.\nCoffee was good.\nStaff were helpful and friendly. \n\nFour and Half Yelps
