Sipping overpriced drinks with short-short trolls, then getting squished and rubbed all over w\/ BO and sweat... \n\nI have to be honest and say the decor and pool area is absolutely gorgeous. I'm sure Steve Wynn spent a fortune and tons of energy in designing this place. You'd think it would attract a more classier, more tasteful crowd, BUT... \n\nI highly recommend going to either Tao or Plams for better visual appetite.
