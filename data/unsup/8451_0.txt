(Note: This review is about the restaurant portion of the grocery store.) Pepero, thank you for being in Charlotte! Besides the items I've tried in my previous review, I've since tried their kimchi jigae and yukae jang. I would try other items on the menu, but the latter two have recently won my heart.\n\nDon't expect anything fancy, but you will be served efficiently and attentively. Pepero can get pretty busy depending on the time you come, but I really think the servers try their best to make sure you have a fine dining experience. I appreciate that.
