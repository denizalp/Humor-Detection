Its 11:15 am and First things first...SHUT THE HECK UP EMPLOYEES!!! \n\nThe burgers, fries, and even the hot dogs are delicious! The prices are reasonable. \n\nI actually left with a headache and could barely hold a conversation with my eating crew. Everyone in the place had to talk loud to be heard over the employees.. Seriously I have a headache!\n\nStill no milkshakes.. Boo on you
