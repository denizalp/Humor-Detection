Spring Rolls is a great restaurant with big portions at reasonable prices.  We shared an appetizer of spring rolls, and for main course one of us had the grilled salmon with pad thai, the other had Tango Mango. All of the food was delicious, and served piping hot!  I would definitely return to this restaurant.
