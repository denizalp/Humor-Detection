Let me start by saying, we're locals. We came in for one reason only, the langoustine appetizer. We saw it on a best of, must try, list, and I couldn't have been more disappointed. It was small, limp, undercooked, under seasoned, and amounted to one small shrimp, cut in half, for $30.00. Shame on you, I know better but most folks that dine there probably don't... Charging $30 for that poor excuse of a crustacean is practically highway robbery.\nNever again.
