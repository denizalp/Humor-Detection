Gave this place another shot. Bad idea. I appreciate the complimentary chips that accompany each order, but they are terribly stale and salty! Yuck! The salsa bar is unimpressive, although I did appreciate that cilantro was available. The enchiladas are still nasty (barely any filling, gross cheese, and dry sauce), and the employees are so blah (smile, darn it!). I will not be giving this place a third try. Adi√≥s!
