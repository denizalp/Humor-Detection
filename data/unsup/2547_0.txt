The manager of this Geico location, Tim, could not have been more helpful than he was following a recent accident on an icy interstate!  Tim walked me through the process, they had an adjustor out the next day, car was deemed totaled and I had a check very quickly.  The reason we switched to Geico was to save $, but getting awesome customer service is the cherry on top!!
