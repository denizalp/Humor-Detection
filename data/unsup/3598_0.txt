My mom has been uber into crafting ever since her and the pops took up going to Burning Man. I've had the pleasure of not only hearing their \"OMG MOM NO\" stories from the Playa, but also going to SAS to help her find pretty things for tutus and hats and go knows what else. This place is MASSIVE. Staff is friendly. A little disorganized, but you can find some great shit there. \n\nLast time, I walked up with a mini glitter top hat. It's amazing.
