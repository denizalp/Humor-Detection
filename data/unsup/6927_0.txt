Such an awesome joint! They have one of the best salads (for a person that is TRYING, to eat healthy) and the most ridiculously delicious burgers (for someone who doesn't care about their weight aka: my husband). We've tried multiple burgers, deserts, and drinks, and they have all been yummy. Definitely love there home made ketchup and different take on ranch! We'll need to head over again real soon!
