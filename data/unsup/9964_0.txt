We visited twice in the week were here. In the main restaurant they serve GIANT portions, if you aren't that hungry eat at the bar. The spaghetti and meatballs is very good and the calamari is amazing. The muscles in red sauce are delicious, order them spicy! It was busy on a Saturday night, yet we were seated immediately and had our appetizer within 5 minutes! The staff is friendly and know the dishes well. Highly recommend!
