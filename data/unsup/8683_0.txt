Really fun place to get a few drinks and some food with your friends! I wasn't that hungry so I ordered half a dozen oysters at MP ($3\/each). I ordered a virgin cocktail (watermelon cucumber juice), which is in their infamous watermelon drink! It's very very sugary, so beware of that. I also tasted my friends drinks, all of them were great! \n\nLiterally if you randomly pick a drink off the cocktails list you will not be disappointed.
