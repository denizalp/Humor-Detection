Called them on April 24, 2018 to do a bid for our HOA and talked to the office and they said they would call me back to make and appointment to come out and bid. Didn't hear from them, so I called them back on May 7, 2018 to hear her excuses of why they hadn't returned my call.  I told them this is bad business and that they lost a possible job because they didn't even have the courtesy to touch base with me.  Poor customer service and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone!!
