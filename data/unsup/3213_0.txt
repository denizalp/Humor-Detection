Very new and nice inside, beer is great, I would say good place but..... you'll probably find a politically charged and angry environment, I've rarely seen a pub or bar that promotes political debate and plays political news, if asked the ladies behind the bar will probably become aggressive and angry. Not my idea of a fun place to get away for a bit and share some community. Find another place in any direction less than a mile. Good luck.
