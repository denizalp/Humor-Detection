Nick was very friendly and the cut was well done. He even stayed late when i called last minute. The place is kinda a closet and could probably use a face lift but I'm guessing then it wouldn't be so dang cheap and I guess that it part of the charm.\n\nIf you want a good value and no bs and you are downtown I'd highly reccommend it.
