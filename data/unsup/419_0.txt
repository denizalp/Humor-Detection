I stopped in here on a whim this past spring, looking for places that were good for me to work at - places that have my big three:\n1. Good Food\n2. Outlets\n3. Free wifi\n\nDING DING DING!!!\nI LOVE greek food, I love hummus, I love pita ... this place is nice and casual, with a fun staff (the manager Michael is really cool). And ladies, HOLY EYE CANDY. The Tempe Fire Department is always in there grabbing lunch. :D\nSo nice to have a side of beefcake with my Greek salad!
