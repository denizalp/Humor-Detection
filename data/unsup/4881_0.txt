Yay! I'm a fan! For serious, though, this place is cool. It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food. $3 bottle domestic beers, which is about as cheap as you're gonna get in this town! It's smokey in there, but that doesn't really bother me. I got this beef brisket sandwich, it was THICK! That's what she said. Very good, though! And waffles fries, yum! A great place to go that feels more like home; I'm from Georgia and there are places like this everywhere. Thumbs up!
