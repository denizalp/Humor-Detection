Convenient location. If you're staying at the Venetian you can go into the elevator and press the canal shops button. It will take you right in front of The Coffee Bean. The line is pretty long in the morning, however it moves relatively quick. The blended drink and tea I ordered were both OK, nothing great. The price is pretty average for what you would pay for a coffee or tea on The Strip.
