We had roti: small for $5 and a large for $8. They looked like the same size. Pumpkin roti. It was like...spicy pumpkin puree. Interesting. The curried chick pea roti was...acceptable but certainly no Mother India. Think I'll give those meals (rice based) a shot next. Seemed like a friendly establishment. Big hats on those Caribbean fellows.
