Had a late lunch\/early dinner with the work wife after taking in a movie.  Nestled in the corner of Craig & Tenaya.  Located in what was once a former Timbers, Joey's has something for everyone.  The service was friendly and seeing how this was last day I gave a S&*$ about calories, I was prepared to stuff myself.  I ordered a burger and split a pizza and chugged down a few beers.  The server was a very nice lady.  All in all a solid three star experience.
