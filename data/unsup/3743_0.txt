I ate here for the first time a couple months ago. I usually don't like to go off the strip when I am in Vegas, seems like too much of hassle. It really wasn't and well worth it. We caught an Uber from our hotel and we were there in 10 min. This was one of the best meals I have had in Vegas and that is saying a lot. Their drinks are just as good. And, it's pretty inexpensive. Every friend I have who has recently gone to Vegas I have told them to go here. So good!
