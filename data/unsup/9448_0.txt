If you're craving fresh fruit on an ice cream slushie, this is the place!  My favorite is strawberry,  mango,  coconut w\/ leches. Plan to be patient because there's often a line,  but the service is quick and very friendly. The restaurant is nice and clean. Not to many tables, so you might want to ask for a top & get it to go. Owners run a tight ship and do a great job!
