I love that you can choose a speciality pizza, customize a speciality, or make your own from scratch. I had pepperoni, roasted peppers, goat cheese and fresh basil with a drizzle of chili oil, and it was really delicious! The pizza is pretty large for one person, so the price is spot on. The area is cool too, and it's nice to sit outside and people watch. Can't wait to go back and try some other combinations.
