Although I usually use Yelp for food, I have to speak out in favor of Keffer Volkswagen in Huntersville. Brought my car in for a regular check up on a Saturday morning. Aside from the staff being very attentive, professional, and pleasant to work with, they offered their courtesy shuttle as a ride to a local breakfast eatery - Cafe 100 in fact (an outstanding, highly-rated local breakfast place). They said to just call when ready for a pickup, but I chose to walk back on this gorgeous fall day.
