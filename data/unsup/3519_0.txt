+Great service--server went out of her way to get me brewed iced tea instead of gross Nestea from the dispenser.\n+They have Splenda!\n+1.5 pounds of king crab for $16.95\n+Good fries.\n\nThe fried shrimp and scallops were so so.\n\n-Didn't love the bread.\n-No ambiance.\n-A little pricey.\n\nI'll probably be back for more crab legs and to try the lobster grilled cheese.
