After I got over the confusion of a high end restaurant located in a dodgy montgomery.. I gave my head a shake and entered. I have been for lunch and dinner, both simply amazing. Many options on the menu, and everything is made to perfection. Finally a restaurant that views food preparation as an art. \nOnly thing I could possibly complain about is that the staff should be wearing more professional attire... I dislike the blue t-shirts... but really, that's me scraping the bottom of the pudding cup..
