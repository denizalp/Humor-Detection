Apache Burger is difficult to review. If it's the middle of the night and you've been out drinking, it's a pretty solid destination. If you are sober and looking for a nice burger, Apache Burger probably isn't your best bet. They only take cash, but have an ATM on location (there is also a BMO around the corner). The last time I went to AB, one of my friends had food poisoning the next morning. I've never had a burger that made me sick, but it's generally not my kind of joint.
