Terrible sushi. We did all you can eat. All the pieces stick to the plate and when picked up they fall apart. AWFUL service! It took me 15 minutes to get a cup of Miso soup. I thought id try a simple CA roll at the end of our meal because I figured it was a simple roll so they couldn't screw it up. WRONG! Again, it fell apart and it tasted like chlorine. DO NOT GO HERE!
