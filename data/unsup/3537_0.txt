One of my new favorites! I went here for the first time a couple months ago on a cold afternoon for lunch and it was so delicious. I got the Morris ramen and my mom got the miso ramen. Both were flavorful, hearty, and so satisfying. We had leftovers and it reheated very well. We also split a pork bun and oh man I could eat 5 of those they were so good--soft and gooey! The place is small with some bar seating. And they were playing Solange so bonus points for good music vibes.
