Worst root top I've ever been to! No bar, no music, nothing romantic about the place!' Big fall! Went inside to get a glass of wine and was ignored, the place was dead, and I look the bartender right in the eyes and they still didn't ask me if I wanted a drink or if I needed help. Very disappointing!
