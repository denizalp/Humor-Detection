What can I say? I love this place! Real good food made with care and love. The soups and quiches are always fantastic, and the bread served as a side is dense and sweet and delicious. \n\nThe sandwiches are the weakest point in the menu, but that's like saying the lock is the weak point in safe. In other words, they're really good too. \n\nDaily specials offset the small regular menu, so there's always something new to try. And be sure to try the tangerine lemonade. Soooo good.
