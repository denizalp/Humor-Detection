I have spent many hours watching planes land and takeoff at McCarran at this parking area along Sunset Road.\n\nIt is great to have an airport so close to the Strip in our city and having this pull off parking area makes it special.\n\nSeeing planes takeoff and land is a fun thing to do.  You can tune your radio to the FM station noted on the sings and listen to the communications with the planes.\n\nThere aren't many cities that have a viewing area like this!
