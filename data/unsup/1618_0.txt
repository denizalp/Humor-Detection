This place sucks. I tell them to lessen the sweetness on my drink and it still tastes like diabetes in a cup. The people working there need to listen to the customers when they tell them what they want. This is the 2nd bad experience I've had and I regret giving them that 2nd chance... Never again. I'll continue going to Tea Street for my boba fix.
