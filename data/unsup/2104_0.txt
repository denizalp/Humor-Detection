I just want to say we are regular customers here.  The food is very nicely served and we really enjoy the food.  Overall we have had good service, really good food and a better atmosphere than most in this price range, which is pretty reasonable.  I agree with a review that the music seems a bit odd for a Greek theme but I believe they are a pretty well kept secret.
