Majestique is marvelous! It's the perfect spot to grab a late night bite and drinks with some friends. The bar is tiny and cozy. Their small plates are decadent and delicious. From what my friend told me, the drinks were awesome. It's also a plus that they stay open until 3 am or so. I'll definitely be back.
