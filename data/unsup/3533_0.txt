i tend to buy more single cards here than packs of cards. i go here every time i get a haircut at steven paul down the way, which is about once a month. it seems like they just dont update their cards very often. i like the store, but sometimes the staff can be a little standoff-ish. it seems to depend on the day. i have to admit they carry some really unique cards and items, but it's just not as personable, but what do you expect in scottsdale?
