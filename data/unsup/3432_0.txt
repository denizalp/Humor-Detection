No frills flying. Pay for what you need like checked bags, in flight snacks, etc. If you don't want or need those things & just want to get from here to there, this is the best option.\n If you need the fluff and extras other airlines offer, book with them. Don't cry on here because Allegiant doesn't offer those amenities, unless you pay. :)
