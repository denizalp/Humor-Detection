I actually like this mall, mainly because it is a place close to my kids daycare\/preschool where I can kill some time.  I know it doesn't have many high end stores, but I can relax for a few minutes.  Another bonus are the girls who are selling the flat iron, if you buy one you can get your hair done for a year, needless to say I am on that chair almost every week.
