Cibo was already a go to for ladies night and date night... but recently I went after work at 4pm and realized they serve their full sized pizzas for $5!!! And the drinks are dirt cheap too, i couldn't believe it. And they aren't skimping out. This place is simply amazing and if you haven't yet - get there before 5pm on a week night! You'll love it!
