I had a great time at the Las Vegas Farmers Market last week.  \n\nTwo farmers from California, Joe Van Dyke Farms and Success Valley Farms offer some great produce ranging  from delicious Oro Blanco grapefruits to orange cauliflower.  I also picked up some aromatic baby garlic and some sweet, fresh strawberries.\n\nIn addition to fresh produce there were other tents including Napa Valley olive oil, Zimmerman Bakery, a pastry tent, and a few tables with assorted handmade wares. \n\nI think I'm gonna try and make this a weekly thing!\n\nPhotos posted at http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/p4xm85
