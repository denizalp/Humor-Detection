Well, there aren't any lineups if you are wanting ice cream in a snow storm!\n\nThis place is fun.\nI enjoyed watching the cream and rolling.\n\nThe Earl Grey rolled ice cream was delicious!\nI liked how you could really taste the tea.\nThe whipped cream and cookie was a good combo.\n\nThe serving is a lot more than I expected!\nI'll have to try the taro ice cream next time!  It was so pretty and purple!
