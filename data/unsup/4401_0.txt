My front door stopped working.  I could go out, but not come back in.  ABC came out, checked out the mechanism and explained how it basically was broken and needed to be replaced.  They had a big catalog of options.  Their friendly service provider Ryan helped me pick out a good match.  He came back today to install the new front door handle, locks, etc.  Pretty painless.  Thanks for your help guys.
