We eat at Distill at least twice a month and I have tried probably half of the menu.  Everything is either good or really good but you have to try the fried pickles and mashed potato bites!  The staff in the dining room is always super nice and the staff in the bar area is great too.  Awesome place to go and hang with friends or take your family.  They also have a little side room if you have a large group.
