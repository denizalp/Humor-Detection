I wish that who ever told me about 'Secret Pizza', kept it a secret!\n\n4.50 for a regular slice of greasy limp under cooked tasteless pie and no tables eat it? Skip on this secret for sure!\n\n'Secret Pizza' rates with any 'run of the mill' joints on the strip.\nSkip the Secret and head to MetroPizza, Grimaldi's, or 'DeFara West' Dom Demarco's when is Vegas!
