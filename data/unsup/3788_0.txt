This is a good little place for a pick me up while exploring Downtown Summerlin. My girlfriends got coffees and we all tried a few treats. Ms. G got a pumpkin bar (she shared a bite and it was nice). Ms. W got a lemon poppyseed muffin. And I got two macarons - one pistachio and one salted caramel. The pistachio was good and caramel was fantastic!
