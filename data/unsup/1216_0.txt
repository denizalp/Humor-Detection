Was at a wedding here last Saturday, Nik and Amber, and it was off the hook.  The amenities, ambiance and the way we were treated by the staff was fantastic.  Constant attention by the management to make sure we got everything we needed in a beautiful environment. In particular I was absolutely shocked at the filet mignon that was the best I've had in memory.
