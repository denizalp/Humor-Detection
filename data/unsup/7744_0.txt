I went here for \"Spooky ranch\". It was pretty boring and definitely not worth the money I spent. the only thing somewhat worthwhile was their extremem nightmare house. Other than that, there was a sub-par hayride that barely had hay (I was sitting on wood actually) and mediocre frights. then the barn was ok, but the haunted barn is just a small barn you sit in for about 5 minutes. The fun house is for kids I think, it wasnt scary at all. Then the other clown house was lame too. Go somewhere else
