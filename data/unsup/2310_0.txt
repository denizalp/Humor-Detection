Coffee time, its allways a good time. Specially with good company. I been here a couple of times because of the coffee. Not because they make me feel welcome. They need to work on customer service alittle bit. Maybe train the employees on that. The coffee shop is supper chill. The coffee has an awesome taste to it. The prices on their pastries are average. Overall they are good! :)°* The parking for this coffee shop is on the side of the building. °*
