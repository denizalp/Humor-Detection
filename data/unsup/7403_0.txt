Shocked that one of Las Vegas' best hotels has one of the trashiest clubs.\n\nIf you want to be the only attractive white kids in a sea of minority girls this is the club for you. Too many ugly girls dancing barefoot. Maybe I'm just a stuck up New Yorker but this club was awful. We were able to get out of the girls cover charger but she wouldn't budge with the guys (sexist much?). Overall one of the worst clubs in Las Vegas.
