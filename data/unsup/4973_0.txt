I cut my teeth as a young professional on coffee and donuts, and lots of them.  Now . . . I look like one, too!  So today, a donut is really a treat and from now on, I'm waddling into Duck D's for whatever qualifies a donut worthy to celebrate!  Really, they are that good.\n\nTip: Wanna get your kids really wired before school?  Like bouncing off the walls just to tick off their teacher?  You know, for laughs and giggles?!?  Duck Donuts will knock their socks off.  Fantastic recipes.
