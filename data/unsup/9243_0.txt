Just as nick wrote, Jordan is awful. She is the most disrespectful property \"manager\" I have ever encountered. She makes everything super difficult and talks to you like you are a child. HIGHLY recommend finding a different place to live!!! Other than management, Lakeview is okay, takes forever to get maintenance and have had my apt flood twice.
