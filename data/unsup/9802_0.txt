Worst service I've ever had. This place has gone all down the drain after their GM quit. They place has super high turnover and the food isn't good anymore. The staff used to be great but this year it's gone all to hell. You sometimes hear yelling, like the owner yelling at employees. The owners daughter dates clients that come in and when the client dumps her, she doesn't allow them to enter the restaurant again. I will never go back and neither will my any of my friends or their friends. It's typical bar food at best.
