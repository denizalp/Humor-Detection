Firebirds is a good restaurant to start a movie night (there is a large theater in the same shopping center). They have a great bar. Try the Double Diamond Martini. It is soaked in pineapple for 21 days. I always start with the Seared Ahi Tuna. The Chile Rubbed Delmonico hits the spot. If you are a big eater, they have lobster tail too. Leave room for dessert. I like their carrot cake.
