Wasn't impressed. I paid $32 for 25 strips which was too much for my family. 15 strips would have been perfect. Didn't come with anything but the sauce. I could have gone to frys and gotten strips, wedges, macaroni salad and drinks for $32.00. Won't be returning for sure. Also the staff was too social with each other that when I was talking to the cashier I had to repeat myself 3 times.
