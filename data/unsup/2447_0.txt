Fern is a veggie lovers dream!  I had heard some amazing reviews, and I seriously would go back weekly if I could to try every dish if I could afford it.  The flavors are incredibly fresh and inventive.  I've been a foodie in quite a few different cities and hadn't quite found a to die for restaurant in charlotte until I came here.  The staff and service was also excellent.  Def will be back, and not just for the mimosas!
