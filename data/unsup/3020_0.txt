I just finished my GTA Photography 101 class and loved every minute of it. The instructor was helpful, patient and an excellent resource (he gave me great advice re. purchasing a camera). I loved the fact that our instructor was a professional photographer so really knew what he was talking about. He also made being a photographer very accessible. The environment was nice and relaxing. I'll definitely take more courses with GTA Photography.
