I mean...how do you rate a print shop?  I needed resumes done so I went in with my external hardrive and...viola.  Staff was really friendly...If I needed a larger job done I'd absolutely feel compelled to return but other than that, not much else to say.  Oh, they had some friendly pooches in the left office, if you want to pet pooches while you wait.  Is that a draw here in Vegas?  Pet a pooch?
