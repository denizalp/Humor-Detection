Oh, DB, you make all other coffee houses seem bland and boring and uninteresting.\n\nSeriously, their employees are like a four year old on a sugar high. They are always super excited to see you and ask about your day\/weekend\/life\/brother\/cousin\/friend\/car\/hair. Seriously.\n\nMy recommendation? An iced annihilator. Do it. You will love it. And if for some crazy looney bin reason you don't, I'm sure they would jump right up (quite literally) and make you something else your little taste buds would love.\n\nDo it. Go to DB. Tell them about your weekend at the pool and get an annihilator.\n\nYou're welcome.
