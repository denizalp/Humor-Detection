Bought a Livingsocial Deal, walked a long way on the strip to get there, and the girl said \"sorry we do not accept coupon, please go to the Fremont Street store\". But the groupon listed this location :( On second day we drove to Fremont Street, paid street parking since its downtown, and guess what, that store didn't open when we were there at 11:50am, although the store hour said open at 11am
