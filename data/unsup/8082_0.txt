My family and I loved this place. Everyone is nice and the fact that everyone works in a team is amazing. I dont live here in Las Vegas but when i do come back and visit Im definetly coming back here. Never had I been to a place where i feel 100% Satisfied with food and service. Thanks for a pleasant time
