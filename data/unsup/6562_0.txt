Yeah... don't call them for anything. They'll treat you like a criminal whether it's justified or not. Lots of young women in the ranks, which would appear a good thing except they all have a chip on their shoulder and something to prove. The rest of the cops are revenue generators. Now if the nosey jerks who crawl this neighbourhood would stop calling the cops for everything, we might be ok after all.\n\n\"Tempe is a high crime area!\" No, it's not, unless you look at the cop-curated records of arrests.
