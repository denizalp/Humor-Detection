Mark was like the chillest server ever. We were his only table when we arrived but he balanced his time coming to our table and even did a really great job yodeling Avocados to our Eggs Benedict. He was friendly and prompt and came by for refills. The food was simply incredibly. I'm not over-eggsagerating! I loved the environment and was able to sit and look out of the large ceiling-high windows and people watch. I couldn't have been happier with this experience.\n\nAnd if you need a suggestion, be Bacon Waffle Benedict was to die for! (See attached picture)
