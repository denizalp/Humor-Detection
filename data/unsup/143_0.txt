The service and setup for this place was awesome.... Which was why I was terribly disappointed when the food came to the table. I ordered the heuvos rancheros and it was so incredibly bland. My eggs were dry and overcooked, my husband's sausage was rubber, and the coffee was literally the worst I've ever had. Not worth the price.
