Weak drinks. I'm more than happy to pay the price for a solid drink. Went with a girlfriend and had 2 lemon drop martinis. Seriously, the weakest drinks I've ever been served and I am a lightweight.I expect more from Trump. Luckily we were hotel guests so we could head up to the room for champagne. Don't waste your money at the bar!
