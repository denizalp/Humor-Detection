The place smells like dirty feet and socks upon arrival but that's because everyone's shoes are off.  However, during the week for $8 younger kids can jump their little hearts out all day.  Children 3 & under and approximately $4.\n\nGreat place to tire the little one's out and for the adults to chill and relax on the massage chairs.
