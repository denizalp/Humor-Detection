Located Inside Walmart, had lunch here today!\nFast service and quick \"turn around time\" to get your order too!\nCan sit and \"people watch\" ALL those Walmart Shoppers while you have lunch. \"Who  Knows\" some of them could potentially even end up on those classic pictures posted on- line called : \" PEOPLE OF WALMART\"..HeeHee\nI finished up my meal (double cheese burger combo with fries & a drink) & did some shopping. Picked up a few things I needed. Don't think I'll end up in those pics, but \"you never know\"..LOL\nExperience was convenient, quick & I had no complaints!
