If you're visiting Vegas this is a really great place to check out. It's pretty much like a lounge\/bar. This place is Beautiful inside and out! The music they played was awesome too. It's located in the Palms Hotel and Casino. The best part is the view! You are up as high as I believe something like 50 stories, and you can see the entire view of the strip. Amazing, Amazing, Amazing that's all I can say. \nIt did lose a star because it's doesn't have a dance area...but it's still worth checking out.
