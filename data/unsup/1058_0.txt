I was sadly disappointed with my visit to Steak on a Stone. While the renovated building did have some neat features (high ceilings and open cathedral like spaces) I was left in want. Service was lack luster and the wait for a uncooked steak was unreasonably long. I enjoy the almost caveman concept of cooking on a rock, but somehow the mark was missed. My only praise goes to the quality of the cuts of meat. The marbling and tenderness of the fillet I had was great, but nonetheless expected from such a cut.
