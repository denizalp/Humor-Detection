Some of the worst service at a chain restaurant in a long time. You'll get better service at the Cracker Barrel if you're black; it's that bad.  The food is below, or possibly beyond, mediocre.  The ordering and paying method on the tablet is annoying.  I get it, you're trying to appeal to millennials, who are typically just as annoying.  Their secret to an awesome burger?  Slap a bunch of shitty toppings and sauce on a poor quality patty.  Skip it unless nothing else is open; pro tip: something else will always be open.
