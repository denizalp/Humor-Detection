Such great service! Our waiter was fantastic and offered a great wine selection and knew the menu well.  The food was fantastic and everyone in my party really enjoyed their meals.  I found things to be a tad overpriced, but not outrageous.  The restaurant itself has an impressive ambiance as well. Would return!
