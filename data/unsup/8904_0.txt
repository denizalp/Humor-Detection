This company is very good.  We were able to trust them with doing our floors while we were away, and the owner sent us pictures and a status report each day.  We tried to do the floors ourselves when we first built the new house, but our job was thin and messy, while theirs was using the best possible equipment, procedures and products.  We are very happy, and impressed with their professionalism.
