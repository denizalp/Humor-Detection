Poor customer service. Tried to charge me again for what I already paid for. Greeting in Spanish who does that at a restaurant???!!\nYou fucken live in America should I remind you that the main language is ENGLISH!!!\nI've had better customer service at different Roberto's, these men employees swear at every other word they say, very uncomfortable. They are the typical 'macho' men from Mexico who just are stubborn and think every women is wrong and none of them have patience. DEFINITELY NOT COMING BACK TO THIS LOCATION. HIPE THEY CLOSE!!!
