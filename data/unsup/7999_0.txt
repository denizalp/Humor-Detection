This was our first and last time at Grotto. We were new to the restaurant so didn't know the menu, the cashier taking the order was not too friendly.  There were no seats available on the patio so had to eat inside.  The table was located near the bathroom, which was not pleasant at all.  Once the food came the experience did not get much better.  The eggs tasted microwaved and there was a live inch worm in my sons fruit.  Needless to say we do not have very good things to say.
