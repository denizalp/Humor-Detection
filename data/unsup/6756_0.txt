Went here for the first time a week ago.  Got sat right away on a busy Saturday night even though they were pretty packed.  We ordered drinks and the waitress looks at my ID and says \"wow you are old.  I mean that in a good way because you don't look that old.\"  Hmmm...  really?  Anyway, the food was really good, the drinks were good, and we enjoyed our meal.  So all in all it was a good experience.
