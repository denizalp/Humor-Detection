Love this pizza.  Great crust, generous cheese and the perfect sauce.  The sausage is outstanding, but my go-to order is cheese pizza with extra sauce on top.  Y-U-M.\n\nThe restaurant is a little dated, but it's charming.  Helps you know the recipes are tried and true to perfection.\n\nOn Fridays and Saturdays, it is hard to get a table for dine-in, but delivery is always top-notch.  This place never disappoints.
