Food and service are both OK. Lucky they don't have a real good Thai food competitor around in North York otherwise their existence could have been non existential. Lol.\nIn a nutshell, everything is average. For example: They will not modify your food according to your ask ( I have requested them several times to make the crispy pork \"crispy\" but they always have a reason on why they cannot do. Also they will not give disposable plates and napkins because regardless of your asks. Either way, thumbs down for both for food and service.
