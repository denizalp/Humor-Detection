Came to watch the NFL game and sat in the bar. Our waiter, Aaron was so patient and on top of things. The food was delivered in record time, and our waiter was extremely understanding as we ordered our food while not taking our eyes off the game. Before we left he made sure we were completely satisfied . The food was exceptional, but the service was even more so. Definitely coming back.
