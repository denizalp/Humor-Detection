I don't care how good yelpers think this pizza is.\nAs long as they have those dehumanizingly long lines to get food, they are odorus cow-dung to me.\n\nIf I had this business, I'd realize that the demand outstrips the supply, and following basic economics 101, (which obviously the owner did not take in college, if he even WENT to college), would lead me to open a second restaurant, somewhere else, to take care of the overflow.\n\nMan, I hate stupidity!
