The beautiful wife and I stayed at the Bellagio when we got married (and have stayed there subsequently).  The fountains, and yes, \"Con te partir√≤\" will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\nAnd yes, any time I see a fountain, no matter how small or pathetic, I start singing in very poor Italian, much to my wife's horror...
