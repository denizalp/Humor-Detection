I had lunch at this restaurant recently and ordered yellow curry with rice noodles. There is a choice of 3 meats and I got chicken. The taste was excellent, amount of food was fair, and the cost fair. The atmosphere was fast food like but aesthetic. As a restaurant  \"to go,\" I rate this as 5.  As a \" sit down\"  restaurant I would rate it a a 4 because of the fast food atmosphere.
