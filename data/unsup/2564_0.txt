I would give the customer service in this store a -100 There is always 4-5 sales associates and they are sooooo pretentious and rude.  I was the only one in the store, they never said a word to me, in fact the African American associate bumped into me putting clothes away and didn't even say she was sorry, she acted like I was the burden in the store!!  Look ladies, I have a LOT of of money, and I'm not spending a dime in your store!!!  Pathetic!!!!
