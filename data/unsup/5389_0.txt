Great customer service! The bottomless curries were delicious. We got the butter chicken with the assorted grilled meats and seafood platter (forgot the name). The restaurant was clean and comfortable. I like that it wasn't loud.  Definitely try the garlic naan and the chocolate filled samosa. YUM!!
