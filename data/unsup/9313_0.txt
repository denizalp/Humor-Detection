Nice place with good amount of gluten free and vegetarian and vegan options. The free chips and salsa were average. Wife ordered nachos with jack fruit and they were ok. Jack fruit was a little too strong on the spice side. I ordered the albondigas (meatball) soup with a side of Spanish rice. I liked it. Waiter was top notch.
