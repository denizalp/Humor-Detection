Asked a friend where to meet for lunch and they picked out this place. It was 4 of us and it took about a hour to be seated around 11am on a weekday. Wouldn't recommend coming here during busy hours with a larger group because of limited seating. \n\nOrdered the Special on the Spicy Ramen and it was very good but needed a bit more spice in my opinion,  also the fried rice was really good. Would come here again if they didnt have the wait.
