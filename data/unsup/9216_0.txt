Let's get one thing out of the way... If you love only restaurants with parking lots, hate potholes and narrow streets, you're claustrophobic, hate long waits, then this joint isn't for you. Ok, we cool?\n\nThe quality of the food though, is awesome. Farm to table fresh and served very hot. Crowd favorites: biscuits with gravy, the shipwreck, waffles, and, who am I kidding?! everything on the menu is great. I'll make special mention of the Lucky's Latte -- it gave me wings... Not real wings, just speaking figuratively.
