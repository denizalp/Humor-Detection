Seriously no better place to eat in Toronto than one of their wild salmon sandwiches washed down with a housemade limeade.\n\nRich, succulent, meaty, and tender strips of vibrant sunset-colored salmon nestled between verdant romaine leaves and slices of ruby red tomato wrapped by an amazing Portuguese bun. The rich meat of the salmon flavored by some fragrant spices and sea salt is perfectly complemented by a sweet and tart limeade.
