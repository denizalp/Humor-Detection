Absolute perfection! \n\nBest service and friendly staff and the food was very delicious. \nI had ordered teppanyaki  set (sea food and vegetables) and sushi set. Not only the chef did a great job in preparation of the meal, the presentation of the food and attending to all customers were done in a timely and professional manner. ( not to mention, It was very entertaining as well- see photos )\n\n\nIt's a little bit pricy but I think it's very well worth it.
