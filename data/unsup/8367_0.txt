One of my all-time favorite places to eat in the mall.\n\nFrom the teenage girls in quirkly yellow,red & blue striped uniforms to the fresh lemonade(cherry,apple or lemonade) to the corn or cheese dogs. I just love it.\n\nGood stuff....\n\nPLUS its Cheap Fast & always good.\n\nNEW  they now offer FUNNEL CAKE STICKS with Chocloate syrup OR Raspberry Syrup  & powdered sugar !!\n\nSooooooooo  Yummy!!
