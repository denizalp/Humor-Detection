I wanted to love this Irish Pub soooo very much, but the place is NOT AUTHENTIC. Yeah, I know the exterior looks pretty authentic and the interior has an Ireland theme, but the food is American fare 100%. \n\nTake the fish n chips for instance. Not hand beer battered at all. Probably frozen with the breading on it from the factory. \n\nAlcohol choices are plentiful with a cider on draft. \n\nBut hey, let's get darn the fish and chips right, folks!
