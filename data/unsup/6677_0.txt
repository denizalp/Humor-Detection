I really have to say I had my doubts abit eating a different cuisine than I'm use too. Mainly cause my stomach is very weak sadly. However this place was golden! Food was awesome and very friendly staff! Get here early though so you get some awesome food! I had a whole bunch of food here I've never had. It was all good and perfectly cooked. I would highly recommend this place to everyone. I never write this much about anyplace but this is well deserving
