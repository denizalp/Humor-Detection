I'm sorry but this subway is horrible . Use to be great but now all that works there are teenagers with additudes. I never had to ask for \"more onions, more mustard , more more more .....\" they are so skimpy on EVERYTHING . And every time you ask for more they just get irritated , I basically gave them directions on how to make a proper sandwich because they don't know how! It's not that hard to make a sandwhich !!!!! . Will take my Business down the street to the burmuda and windmill location from now on.
