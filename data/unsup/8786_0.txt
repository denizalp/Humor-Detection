AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING ICE CREAM! Was visiting from Detroit and we stumbled upon summers ice cream. Best decision of our whole trip. It was so good that we ended up having it TWICE lol. The ice cream was just so creamy and so good. This place is a must try. Maybe a little bit on the pricey side still worth every single penny.
