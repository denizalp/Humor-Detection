One of the first specialty grocery stores I've been to in Toronto!\n\nEverything is super clean, you can automatically assume that it will be a little more pricey than  your Food Basics or NoFrills. I'd say it's around the same price as Whole Foods. \n\nThe thing I like most about Pusateri's is their selection of cakes and baked goods - I wouldn't say they're top notch in Toronto, but hey, it's worth a try, and you get nice comfy seating outside in the mall!
