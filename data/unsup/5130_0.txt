The service was great, the food was delicious, and the decor and music--outstanding! My husband and I had the Hash. It was a perfect amount of food, creative and well cooked. I had my eggs over medium, hubby had poached as on the menu. Coffee was nice as well. I think the menu could stand to be $1-$2.00 cheaper but overall a great experience. I will be back, probably this week.
