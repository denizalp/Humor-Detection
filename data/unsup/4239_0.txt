I stopped by this location after placing an order online and was pleasantly surprised with the level of service. It's the first Chipotle I've been in where they make your order in the back and have it prepared at pick up.. I'm used to them waiting until I arrive then making It down the line with the rest..\n\nOtherwise it's a normal chipotle.. The line was wrapped around the store when we arrived so it was nice to grab my order and go!
