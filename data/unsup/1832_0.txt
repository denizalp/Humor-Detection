This place is an insult to pubs and an embarrassment to restaurants everywhere. \n\nThe service is appalling. Staff is highly untrained and do not know how to induct themselves professionally. \n\nAs a large group with some underage individuals we were discriminated against and \"spied\" on by staff members (presumably to watch our behaviour) \n\nFood is well below average. I order the wings they were cold and apparently 7 wings qualifies for a pound here. \n\nDO NOT EAT HERE FOR ANY REASON WHAT SO EVER. There are many other restaurants in the area with better service.
