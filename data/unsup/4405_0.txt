Sandwich Shop Located here in Las Vegas NV. Was Pretty Good!\n\nAfter reading many great reviews on my Yelp I knew we had to come give this place a try. I'm glad we did. :)\n\nEmployees Were Friendly and the Service Was Fantastic!\n\nSandwiches Were Really Good and Exactly As  Ordered!\n\nSalad Was Fresh and Extremely Filling!\n\nFood Was Delicious!\n\n  I Recommend Giving The Sandwich Place A Try. \n\n It's A Great Little Business. :)
