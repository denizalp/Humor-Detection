JJ Where Are You???  Here in the Vons Grocery Store in Henderson! =)\n\nLocated inside Vons on the Corner of Windmill & Pecos, on the Far end of the Store! I always forget about this Little Place & end up going to the Other Location on Eastern by McCarran Airport!\n\nThey Serve the same as the Other Locations, The Workers are Very Friendly & You get your Order Fairly Quickly! \n\nThere is\/are seating available, and if you Don't want JJ, You can also have Starbucks, or Panda Express if you are Really Hungry, lol!\n\nAgain Keepin this Short & Sweet....Like Me! hahaha
