I've been a vegan for more than 10 years and I'm always excited to try places with vegan menus. This place was a complete disappointment. The tomato basil soup tasted like canned crushed tomatoes with too much basil and the grilled vegetable sandwich that came with it was cold and lacking substance. They put more time and effort into \"sustainability marketing\" than the food. Overpriced and underwhelming.
