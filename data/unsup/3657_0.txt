Holy crap, Sole. Why the hell have I been going to Nanta's sticky disease-trap this whole time, when I could have been partying with you?! \n\nYou have the same song selections, your private rooms (and bathroom!) are much cleaner, and at the end of the night; I don't feel it necessary to burn my clothes, bury them and then salt the earth.\n\nPerhaps it's because you're located in a top sekrit alley way, accessible only either through said alley or Downtown Food's back door.\n\nI like you. Let's be friends. You have food too? Need to come back for that!
