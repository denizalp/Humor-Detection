I requested a grilled cheese (as it is Friday during Lent) and was told that would not be possible. Apparently it's against company standards. \n\nI wasn't requesting someone catch and skin a fish for me, I was simply asking for a meatless option at the same price as a typical cheeseburger. \n\nI work real hard for little bit of change that's left in my pocket at the end of the day. With that being said, if your business isn't willing to accommodate my request I will take my coins some place else. \n\nGirl bye.
