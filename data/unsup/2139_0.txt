First off, this is a bar! If you're looking for a restaurant to take the kiddies or have a romantic dinner then this is not the right place! Better than average \"bar food\" with HUGE  portions! Extremely cold beer! The entire staff moves fast to keep your drink full. Pool tables, darts, corn hole, ntn, nice patio with coolers, decent amount of tv's. Live music. . . What else do you need from a bar?
