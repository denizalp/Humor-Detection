I have been back to HKS since my first visit. Now I downgrade my rating to 4 rather than 5 stars. \n\nWe have tried various kinds of noodle and rice--the food is consistently delicious. The problem is HKS's service. We waited more than 30 minutes for our meals during busy hours on a Saturday. I in general support family-run small businesses, but they seriously need to improve the overall coordination of the restaurant. It's a mess. \n\nI also witnessed many communication failures as the servers do not speak perfect English. Be patient, and you will get good food later.
