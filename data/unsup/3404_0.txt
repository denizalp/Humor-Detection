Yes, I am sad to say that I am a heterosexual male and went to Jo-Ann's by choice.  That disclaimer aside, I must admit I had no idea what I was doing in this shop, and the employees walked me through finding what I was looking for and telling me how to complete my project.  No, you don't get to hear what my project was, but it was very, very manly.
