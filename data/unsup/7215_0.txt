One word delicious...this place can handle large parties and cater to unique intimate occasions of any kind I celebrated a anniversary here a birthday a graduation party as well as have enjoyed the happy hour that has amazing appetizers and drink specials def get the calamari and the lobster cups!!!! It sometimes can get busy so I suggest make a reservation whenever possible ... And enjoy the service they are some of the most fun, cultured, hardworking service I have ever received.
