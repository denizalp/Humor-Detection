I got what I wanted after looking for quite awhile--both for someone to get help and then trying to find the place she told me to go.  The aisles are not too well marked for items like a grocery store aisle, so I had to search for another time.\n\nI would advise bringing your spouse who probably knows a hell of a lot more than you do and let them help you!
