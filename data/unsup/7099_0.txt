If I was a chicken I would like the be slaughtered here at Ma Poule Mouill√©e. Their poutine is the holy grail of chicken heaven. Even the prudest vegan from Plateau Mont-Royal would get wet eating here.\n\nI feel bad for tourist waiting in line across the street at La Banquise, thinking they'll get the best poutine. La Banquise lost its touch, the fries are too burned up.
