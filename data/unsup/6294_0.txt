A single sampling of the Almond Concha proved to be light and airy on the interior with eggy notes and a bit of butter beneath a crackling sugar topping.  Definitely something different and definitely delicious despite not tasting much like almond I have to say this item gave me hope for Mexican pastry in general - definitely a place to consider the next time I head down Indian School Road.
