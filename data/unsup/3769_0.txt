This store is so cute!  Came looking for a baptism dress for my niece and Alyssa was so helpful (so were all the ladies in the store). The selection was extensive and if they didn't have the size I needed they offered to order it or showed me other dresses that were in line with what I was looking for. They helped me with not only the dress but all the accessories and even exceeded my expectations by customizing the pieces for me. Love this place!
