Have gone a few times over the past years never thought it was great or bad, just a local neighborhood place with a nice outdoor cafe.  A few weeks ago an out of town guest wanted to go and I gave in.  It was really good!  Nice atmosphere, I had never had dinner or eaten inside before, we all thought our dinners were great and the desserts were outstanding.
