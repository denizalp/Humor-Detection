I waited 15 minutes for a \"Clucker.\"  Let me reemphasize that, I waited 15 minutes for a breaded, deep fried chicken patty that came with Miracle Whip and a side of cranberry jelly.  It wasn't even that good.  That's what I get for listening to a recommendation from a guy who thinks Japanese food is gross.  \n\nI may go back to try the fried chicken.
