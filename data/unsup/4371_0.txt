Needed taco fixin's for a last minute office lunch party.  Not being a party planner, I was advised to use QDoba's.  Called and spoke with Rebecca, who could not have been nicer or more accommodating. She helped me figure out what I needed...and got it to us at the agreed upon time.  The ingredients were fresh and well prepared.  I would highly recommend, and will most likely use again, although we don't have many office parties.  Thank you Rebecca!
