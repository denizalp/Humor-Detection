Not understanding the \"greasy\" comment from June because it certainly is not.  Ordered a California burrito and was disappointed that it did not have fries in it. In CA, we put fries in our California burritos... that's one of its traits!  I will let it slide this time because the food otherwise reminded me of the food back home.  The other ingredients were all in proper proportion.  The carne seemed a little dry, but the rice was delicious!  Service was fast and friendly.  Prices were quite reasonable.  I will definitely give Fausto's another try.
