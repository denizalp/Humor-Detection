We had a novel experience at \"ESCAPE FROM THE TOWER\", and I would highly recommend this establishment. I participated with 6 friends and six strangers, and I felt the size of the room was adequate for a group this size [*8 people feels like an acceptable minimum]. I rate the difficulty at 5\/10. The live actors were helpful and funny, without being distracting or giving too many hints. The greatest strength of this escape room is the immersive environment- 9\/10. Very cool!
