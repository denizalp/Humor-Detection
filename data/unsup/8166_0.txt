Excellent new sushi slot in Snotsdale. This sushi place is a nice little secret and not located in the center of the hustle of Old town Scottsdale, but is easily accessible due to its proximity to it. Wonderful service and candor with Rachel who is A+++ as our server last night, and made my visiting friend feel like he was eating grade A sushi in SF! We were not terribly disappointed for the lack of the liquor license as OHSO and other fine drinking establishments are not too far away.
