The food was great from what may have been an authentic Thai family. It would have got a five star however it is in a really bad neighborhood and just slightly priced above what I think a quality food restaurant in a bad neighborhood should be priced. It is priced just about right if you have a Groupon; if this restaurant were in town square or downtown summerlin the prices could easily be twice as much !
