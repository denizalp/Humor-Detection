Tonight was my first time at Pizza Rev and based on the service alone I will be back! Brandon the manager was the best! Super nice, knowledgeable, attentive and he has the most awesome fun personality that made the experience more enjoyable. He walked me through the process of how they operate and even helped me decide on which pizza creation to choose. I chose the Mediterranean pizza and it was phenomenal! I highly recommend Pizza Rev! You will love it!
