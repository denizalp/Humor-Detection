Although they had a table for a medium group already ready at dinnertime on Saturday (surprised!) I was summoned instead to a large party with friends and family in the other room pre-UFC fight.  I tried a little bit of everything!  It was all well above average with a nice mix of raw and crunchy items.  I'm sure it was expensive but some old rich guy got the bill, bonus!  I would came back for sure to sample the other items but it does look expensive.  Easy to get a table it seems
