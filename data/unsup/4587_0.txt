Stoped into this spot because it was on our way home, and one of the only places open. Wasn't sure what to expect. The food was pretty good, I got some wings, which were bomb, and some 1.50 tacos, but they were a bit underwhelming. Oh well, they were only 1.50, what else could i expect? The service and drinks were even better!!! Our bartender,a hot blondie, Micky was super fun and makes a killer gummi bear shot, I'll deff be going back!
