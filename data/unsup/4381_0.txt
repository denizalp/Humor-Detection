I will support any business that shares their proceeds with charity...I went in support of Baby's Bounty and in turn found a cool new poppin' spot. Corny pun intended. \nThey gave out free frozen popcorn and I got a 15% off coupon just for checking in. \nIt's worth smuggling this gourmet popcorn into the movie theater, which I may do when I see American Sniper this week ;)
