Hey!  Lots of people showed, new friends, beer!  Bowling was cheap, but 3 games, WAAAYYYY too long.  If it weren't pimp & ho night, I think they would have flashed the lights at 1AM.\n\nWhat else could you want from a UYE?\n\nAlso, there was a pimp throwing money at kids!\n\nThanks Roger for putting this together & thank your wife for the cookies!
