I drove a neighbor here today for pre-admission paperwork and testing.  The place is very pleasant, but boy were they slow.  We were there for two hours!  I'm glad I had my iPhone.  The birds were really angry at me for bashing their little bodies into various objects, but it passed the time.\n\nThe place seemed very quiet.  For a hospital, it's OK.
