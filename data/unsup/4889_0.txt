My husband found this show to take my mother to; we suspected she would like the performance of martial arts, acrobatics and graceful elements of cirque du soleil mixed together. He was RIGHT! But not only that, he and I thoroughly enjoyed the show. High energy, fun and appealing to both kids and grown-up.  When they invited 2 boys on stage to be part of the act, they personalized it and was downright charming.
