This place has a wide variety of quaint desserts, sandwiches, coffee, and tea. \n\nHowever, the novelty of the decor (french decor, lots of artistic decor) quickly wears after a few visits. \n\nThe pastries are totally overpriced, the service is pretty bad, and this place often seems to be the high school and stoner hang out.
