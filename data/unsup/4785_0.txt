This place only does dinner which is the only negative thing I can say about it. Service with a smile comes to life as soon as you walk in the door. It's always a busy place especially on weekends and they don't take reservations so plan on waiting friday and saturday. Once seated the servers are eager to bring you your hearts desires and in a timely manner. From the nigiri to the custom handrolls the fish is ample and fresh tasting.if your all about the AYCE, this is your place.
