Really nice store. Well laid out and they have alternative health care and food items that are very difficult to find otherwise in the area.\n\nThe prices are slightly inflated, but whatever. I don't buy much there because I can get it for less somewhere else that I already shop but for the items that I can usually only get in the states, I buy them here.
