Have eaten here a couple of times.  Smell of grilled dogs fills the air and it's great.  The (basic) hot dog is pretty good.  Haven't tried the brat or other varieties yet.  But the shoestring style onion rings are the bomb!  They don't open too late to plan your dog craving accordingly.  And oh yeah, they have Buffalo and New York papers from weeks past to satisfy your curiosity of what news from the right-coast reads like.
