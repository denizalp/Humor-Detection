Alright Eastend. Calm down with this whole \"you've got the best brunch\" thing you've got going for you. I was not very impressed with BB. It was busy, the selection seemed homogeneous (egg with chive\/cheese and brioche), serving was small, our server looked like he was from a steampunk convention, and I had to run to the bank for cash because they don't accept plastic. \n\nAverage meal. Still was hungry. Ate a crepe on the way home.\n\nFuckin' steampunk!?
