After my review I haven't signed on to yelp for a very long time only to notice that chef\/owner had personally wrote me a sincere message regarding my experience, and although I have not yet returned to Monarch (since its closed in the summer) I'm truly touched by the thoughtfulness and gesture of owner\/chef to make the overall experience better.
