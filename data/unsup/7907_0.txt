This place is a must try! The food is delicious and so is the salsa bar. If you're a picky eater, which I happen to be, this is the place for you. I ordered a Fresco vegetarian burrito and will continue to order for the foreseeable future. \n\nThe staff is so helpful and friendly. The head cashier, Jesus, can help you pick something out of you're undecided. Super helpful and welcoming staff...can't stress that enough. \n\nSide note: if you're craving some pretzel bites, this place has some yummy-delicious bites with homemade \"queso\"! Loved it!!! A+
