Got two new piercings for my 18th birthday! The manager helped me come to a decision, I'm very indecisive. She didn't seem at all rushed or irritated. I felt very comfortable being in there. Sadly, I don't remember the guy that worked on me but he was super sweet and make me feel super relaxed. I felt nervous at first to get my naval pierced but he helped me relax! It went very well and was a quick process. PLUS, I love my new piercings!
