Inexpensive Travel Option and Friendly Staff\nThis was my 3rd flight experience and simply in love with the airline.. everyone is treated with respect and the crew itself is simply awesome .. my first flight ever with southwest was to the west coast and saw the pilots standing by the door greeting the passengers:) flew with other airlines but never felt so welcomed like I do with southwest .. thank you LOVE flight :)!
