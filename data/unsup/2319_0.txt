Mr Vac is great on experience, but horrible on customer service. Have these guys heard that computers can actually keep a record of your customers. If you don't have the receipt, you're dead with these guys.  Time to join the rest of us who have gone beyond 1970. Never ask to speak with the owner. His motto is that he is always right. Way too much attitude.  He obviously missed the class on manners and treating his customers with some level of respect.
