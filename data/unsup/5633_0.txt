Not sure why my seafood rositto didn't look like the pics on here. There was no scallops. The seafood was shrimps, clams, 1 mussel, and squids. Rositto is basically cheesy rice.\n\nThe waitress was nice & friendly. The atmosphere & interior were great!\n\nThe only suggestion to management is order paper bags with Bistro 57 printed on them. That way customers wouldn't have to carry around leftovers in a cheap \"Thank You\" plastic bag. Lol!
