I stopped by Gadzooks on my lunch break. I was looking for a quick and delicious lunch and Gadzooks sure did satisfy. My co-worker and I were both quite impressed with the flavor, super yummy. It took about 10 minutes to get through the line which is not too bad in my opinion. I took the food to go. The restaurant was very crowded and a little small as was the parking lot. But all in all, I would be willing to eat here again! Maybe, I'll try the salad next time!
