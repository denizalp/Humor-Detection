Very fresh! Sandwiches are nice and cheap, mine was under $4, and served on fresh baguettes. The bread is his enough to eat on its own! I had the Bbq pork sandwich with everything on it. At first I was weary about the jalape√±o but my mouth can take some heat and it turned out to be very complimentary. My only complaint is that I would have liked a little more filing, I typically prefer my sandwiches overfilled, but I would recommend and come back again.
