Cool, clean place.  Saw my first movie here (\"Horrible Bosses\" w\/ a friend) a couple of weeks ago, and I wouldn't mind going back.  Nice to see a bit of Cine-Capri's history tucked in a corner...\n\nWill have to go back and have a longer look around... Wonder if there are D-box seating here?  IMAX, maybe?
