Went to Arizona for a guy's golf trip, and tried this restaurant. \n\nActually desserts are surprisingly REALLY GOOD! Not sure if they order it in, or prepare in-house. But it doesn't matter, they were really tasty.\n\nThe entrees, that's another issue in itself. I am giving it two stars because the gnocchi was nasty. But then again, this place isn't called Amy's Pasta Company. Its Amy's Baking Company.\n\nI say only come for coffee and dessert, and you will have a 5 start experience.
