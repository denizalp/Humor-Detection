Always slow or understaffed. Orders come out correctly. Kids working are always kind. The French fries are my weakness. The drive thu is poorly built. Many times you will see ppl backing up and re attempting the turn. Also exiting is sketchy they have a bar and stores as you exit and often people are parked randomly (parking lot is not well defined) and this makes it difficult to wiggle your way out \nI love Taco Bell but honestly the food here is better
