I got excellent service from Valley Respiratory Services. They (two different technicians) did great work for me when I needed it.  VRS are trusted by my doctor, who is excellent. I will continue getting my supplies here. \n\nBad reviews are a way to punish a business and should not be done lightly. Then we lose neighborhood services that we need and are excellent.
