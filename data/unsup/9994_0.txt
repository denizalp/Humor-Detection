This is my Favorite Starbucks, Why? Because it's not too crowded, and it is located in Target!\n\nThe Baristas here are Always Very Friendly & The Service or Wait time is very Minimal! \n\nThey do not have most of the Amenities that the other Regular Starbucks do, but  if you just want a Frappe, Iced or Hot Coffee, Iced Teas while shopping in Target then you are good to go! \n\n* If you wanted to try any of the New Drinks, you may want to ask the Baristas Before Ordering.
