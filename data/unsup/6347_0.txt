Delicious. That's all there is to say! Why only 4\/5? They over salted their fries by a long shot - and I like my salt. When I mentioned it to the waitress, she noted that it's how they do it. You can't take salt off, so my recommendation would be to ask for them to not salt at all, and do it yourself at table.
