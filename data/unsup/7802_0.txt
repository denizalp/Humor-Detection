They're baaaaack...\n\nIt's like I went back in time to 1997. Since the move I can't recall being able to get a pie, garlic bread and salad for under $50.. It was $38 for dinner tonight so their prices have become more reasonable and the quality is old Dante's. The dudes across the street better mind their p's and q's because these boys are out for pizza blood.\nBravo Paoletti's!
