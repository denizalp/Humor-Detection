Oddly enough it's very funky place lost a star over the desserts. They were good but not great. However the sandwich we had was fantastic. Roast beef with mozzarella cheese and horseradish. Real horseradish, The kind of gets up in your sinuses and clears your head for you. Very unexpected on a sandwich at a place like this. The Decor is fun and funky, the coffee was very good too.\n\nThe desserts were certainly above the median but clearly not what I expected from a place that seems to market itself as French pastry shop.
