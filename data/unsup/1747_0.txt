Taco Tuesday's are amazing! $2 tacos and margaritas! It's really unbeatable. The tacos are delicious, the margaritas are good (if there's too much mixer, they will make it stronger) and the staff are great! It does get VERY busy! We had to wait over an hour to get seated for a group of 6 when we went on 9\/13. But you can get drinks from the bar and take them outside, so that made the time pass a little faster.  I definitely recommend Hot Taco for Taco Tuesday!
