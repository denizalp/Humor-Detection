Dr. Hall is so kind and gentle. I brought my dog that is normally skittish of strangers and he put him right at ease. I highly recommend Dr. Hall because he obviously loves animals and enjoys what he does. Too bad he is a Vet; I wish that going to my doctor was such a pleasant experience as taking my dog to see Dr. Hall. I didn't even have to wait and we were out the door in 15 minutes.
