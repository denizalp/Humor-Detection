Have been here a few times and always thought it was a nice place to hang out until other places got going.  It's layed back, nice patio off of Scottsdale Rd, open bar to the outside, good bartenders and waitresses, and so on.  This time just had a drink and spent an hour or so there.  It was busy on a Saturday, which isn't out of the ordinary, and overall enjoyed the experience.  I never considered it one of my favorites but it is a good solid place.
