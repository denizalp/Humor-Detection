Used this glass shop once several years ago as it was one that my insurance had on a list.  Since then they have called every month, up to three times a day. Asked to be taken off the \"call list\", which I was for only the specific number they had called from with continued calls from other numbers.  Have now blocked and reported six numbers. You can file a complaint with the BBB.  This company is currently listed as:\n\nA & J Auto Glass\n2429 W. Willow Ave\nPhoenix 85029\n\nThe more complaints the better!
