Can't say much that others haven't before me- stopped in with my sweet-tooth BF. I don't really care for sodas or candy, so I'm not really part of the target audience here. Appreciated seeing the many vintage or limited-edition items and signage, though.\n\nIn addition to eatables and drinkables, there are some novelty items- picked up a few items as gifts for a friend. Would come back to get a selection of oddball treats as a white elephant gift or to look for a particular sweet for a friend.
