This place is good. Sushi Ichiban and MacLeod Trail Sushi should be worried. This place is light years ahead of the restaurant that ,was previously here. If you like sushi, you'll love Sushi One!  The mixture of flavours and presentation is similar to Globefish, but on an all-you-can-eat menu. I just hope they keep up the good work here. The quality and freshness is fantastic! \n\nThe d√©cor is contemporary  and comfortable. You order you food through an iPad provided by the Restaurant. This place is not to be missed.
