Food was bland and really under seasoned. I'm from South Carolina so I do know a thing or two about a good shrimp boil. The crawfish over cooked.  The lady on the phone was rude and extremely not helpful.  In case the manager is re-viewing this review I spoke with a female on 6 September at roughly 4 thirtyish.  Not a way to speak with a guest trying to order.  \n\nOverall bad experience
