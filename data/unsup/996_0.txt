One of the better 24 hour fitness clubs in Vegas.  The treadmills are a bit on the old side...but the club is clean, spacious and well lit. There is a swimming pool, sauna and steam room just as any other Agassi Sport does but its just ...clean. :) I've been to quite a few gyms in my days and can say that I would pick this gym over Green Valley's any day.  \n\n\n The drive is work it.  :)
