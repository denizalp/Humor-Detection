This review is for the breakfast only.\n\nHUEVOS RANCHEROS:\nEgg's \"over medium\" had raw egg white in the center.\nRice was bland. Tortillas were store-bought, not homemade.\nEach table is given chips n salsa and bean dip.\nSalsa was average. Bean dip tasted like they made it from canned beans. \n\nCoffee was bad, and they didn't have half n half. Just non-dairy creamer. \n\nService was excellent.
