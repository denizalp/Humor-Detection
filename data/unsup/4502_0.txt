I am one of those Americans who loves lebanese olives.  So I asked for some here and got a free plate of this candy.  The meal was pretty good overall, but I think next time I may not get the beef shwarma.  Next time it will will be chicken.   Oh, and the desserts are great here, and reasonably priced.
