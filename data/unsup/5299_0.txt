Save your money and go somewhere else. The rolls tasted like the ones you can buy at smiths or any other market. The nigiri sushi was also terrible and too dyed. The person who cut the fish did not know how to cut and would make the fish look stringy and dry. The service was also terrible. The only ONE waiter would just talk to the sushi chefs about their girlfriends and did not refill our drinks not even once.
