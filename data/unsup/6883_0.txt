So many places to stop for fuel.  So many places to stop for sundries.  I stopped in picked up a few things and went to the counter to conduct my purchase.  The grumpy dude with money tail behind the counter was a d!&%.  In fact.. he showed more pleasantries to a woman trying to commit petit larceny instead of the paying customer.  Next time I will spend my hard earned cash across the street ,or the street after that, or the street after that, and so on.
