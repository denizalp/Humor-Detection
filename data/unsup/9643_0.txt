Dang! I used to live right around the corner from this spot, yet I never managed to check it out... I'm glad I finally did!\n\nCame in one late Saturday afternoon for a quick bite before checking out Lonnie Hammargren's house. To my surprise, they serve breakfast 24\/7, so my friends were able to get their fix while I ordered a plate of their famous chicken fingers and cheese curds. Both were very tasty, and I actually left with enough food for another meal later on.\n\nAnyway, this place is great and I'll be back again, I'm sure of it!
