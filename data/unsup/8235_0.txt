this place is truly amazing!!! wow where do i start??? the service is great the waitress that was taking care of me her name was taylor was real professional, she would just keep bringing me drinks without asking and she even brought me one to go when i was done eating so props to taylor for a job well done. then next came the food which was excellent not to pricey and you get a lot for what you pay for which fills you up. i was very happy with my experience here and will difitnley be back again.
