Refreshingly unique\n\nThis was my first time stopping by the Pop n Tea Bar but it won't be my last.  This place is amazing. I guess the only way to describe to describe \"Pop n Tea\" is refreshingly unique deliciousness. \n\nOn this visit I had the New York strawberry cheesecake, dipped in dark chocolate, and covered with crushed graham cracker crust and almonds.  It was amazing.  I can't wait to find another one soon!
