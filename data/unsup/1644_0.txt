I love this place! I come home to Pittsburgh about once a year and I look forward to eating at the Cornerstone. The menu is diverse and well executed. The waitstaff is friendly. This year I happened to come on a Wednesday and it was Lobster Night, and was pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality of the seafood (I live on the coast and am usually biased about seafood in landlocked places) I highly recommend coming here with your family.
