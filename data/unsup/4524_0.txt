Sahara Location For Lexus of Las Vegas.\n\nBetter Lexus Dealership than the one in Henderson.\n\nClean Store.\n\nEasy to find  location.\n\n\nWe stopped by to pick up some things for our car and the staff guys working the counter were nice and efficient.\n\nTo find a salesperson working outside was a challenge so we just left. We had seen ONE salesman and he was busy with a customer. More sales associates would be nice. ;)\n\nOverall I would recommend. Enjoy!
