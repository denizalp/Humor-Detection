I think I have been here before...Where is my review from that?  Who knows?  Anyways, we waited 20 mins for a table for 4 on a Saturday night at 7pm.  Not too bad considering the place was PACKED with people.  \n\nI wanted prime rib and they are OUT.  Bummer.  So I got the New York Strip with mash potato with cheese and bacon, and buttery corn.  It was good.  The bread and cinnamon butter is the BOMB.\n\nThe service was great.  Why the 4 stars?  How can you be out of prime rib?
