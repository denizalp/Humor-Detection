Not only was the fish fresh, the wasabi real, and the roll combinations unusual and delicious, the prices affordable, but the service was SPECTACULAR. After one visit, this has become our go to place for sushi in the valley. We've had a few sushi places that we have enjoyed, but they paled in comparison. We will highly recommend Iron Chef to everyone we know.
