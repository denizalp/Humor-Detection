I really enjoyed the Connecticut lobster roll with fries and a drink. Service was fast, friendly and helpful. Total was $22.40 for the combo which was a bit steep in my opinion. \n\nI am from CT and it's hard to find CT style lobster rolls. This one didn't disappoint. I just wish it was bigger like the footlongs in CT. The fries were hot and very tasty and were a food compliment to the roll. I will definitely eat there again.
