Pretty good spot. nothing special, unfortunately. They did a fantastic job on my pedicure ( I checked this spot out as my regular go to had a long wait, and unfortunately I didn't have the time or make an appointment). I would definitely stop by here again in the future if needed. Super friendly as well!
