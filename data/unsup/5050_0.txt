Just what you expect, it's a diner. We were seated quickly, in a shabby but comfortable booth, at 11am on a Sunday. The service was good, our coffee cups were never empty.  Our breakfasts were solid, what you'd expect of the classic 'diner' experience. The waitress did lose points for forgetting to have the peppers and onions left off my hash, but otherwise it was a nice find in Carnegie.
