I'm so happy with my new (used) car and the people I met at Volvo of Tempe! Kim, Scott and Charles really made my buying experience as simple as possible. Kim was extremely knowledgeable and just a good guy. Glad I chose to make the 40+ min drive from North Phoenix to buy my S80 here. The car itself is in great shape and this dealership really went the extra mile to make sure they got it tuned up before it was sold. Couldn't be happier, thanks guys!
