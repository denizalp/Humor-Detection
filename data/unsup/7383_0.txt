I love love love this place. Over the course of three days we went there about 10 times. The WINNER is the coconut grass jelly drink. It's a mix of everything good with ice cream on top. We also ordered the chicken several times. \n\nWe go to Ten Ren when we're in California but I never ordered the grass jelly drink until Vegas. \n\nMakes me want to buy a franchise.
