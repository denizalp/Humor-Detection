Chris S. personally attacked me for disliking Cucina Tagliani. So, I would definitely listen to him when he asks you to consider the validity of these reviews. It may be upsetting for Chris to read such hatred in reviews, but it is more upsetting to get a message full of hateful personal attacks. I hope Chris isn't the owner, he seemed to be mighty emotional over the whole thing! I'm not the only one who hated this place, Chris. Are you going to attack us all?!
