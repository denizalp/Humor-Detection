Located inside the Golden Nugget. Frank Sinatra music playing and a cool classic vibe. Service from Dennis was excellent. Everything we ate for dinner was fantastic. The steak was top notch. Appetizers were good as well. Pricier place though. Plan on spending $100 a person with a drink or 2. Not a fan of the downtown Vegas scene but we will be back!
