Nothing really bad or good to state about MGM's. A stay in their West Wing or loungey whatever it's called last year, 2 buffets were included. We came during a late breakfast hour, such that we were still eating when they started to dish out lunch items. \n\nSatisfying for the one who just wants to get full. But it ain't no Wicked Spoon or Aria Buffet....let's get that straight!
