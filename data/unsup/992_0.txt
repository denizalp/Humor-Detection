Well, so sad, but I must write an update....\nThe last two times I've been in, it was lame.  I hope they aren't getting lackadaisical\nsince they are busy the majority of the time. \n\nThe girl that I had, kept burping and was leaning against the wall and then was falling asleep. OYE!! Are you freaking kidding me????\n\nI might reconsider going back :\/
