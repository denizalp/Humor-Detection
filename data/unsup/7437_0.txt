Wendi was one of the most professional and friendly real estate agents I have ever dealt with, and I have gone through a lot of different agents. What really set her apart from the others was her knowledge and over all ease of communication. I would recommend Dana realty group for everyone in the Vegas area trying to sell or rent out  their home.
