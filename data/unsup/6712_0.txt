If you are going for dinner.....bring some snacks with you... The service is SO POOR you might pass out before you get your order... That is IF you get what you ordered. I'd like to comment on the food, but after waiting 1 HOUR AND 45 MINUTES I left. Very rude owner said they had a computer failure and orders were delayed, but people seated after us got their order?????? They felt sorry for us and offered some of their pizza. However they said it was not good....
