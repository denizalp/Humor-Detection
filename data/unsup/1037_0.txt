Am i the  only one who thinks this place is bit that great. Their servings for large are not that big and when i ordered beef fried rice there was hardly any beef in it. Their drinks are over priced, they sell sushi but honestly would you buy sushi from a Chinese place.\nIts like buying Mexican tacos from an Italian restaurant. Never coming back here.
