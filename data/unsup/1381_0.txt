I can't recommend their service highly enough.  It was easy to speak with someone who understood my issue, and to schedule a service when I needed them to come by.  Rich, my technician, was excellent.  Very friendly and professional and did a good job diagnosing the issue.  Even though it required a return visit, he owned my issue and came back to complete the repair\/install himself.  Many thanks!
