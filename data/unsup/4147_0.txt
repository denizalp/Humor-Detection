Just OK. Nothing special. Personally I thought the fries were way too greasy and the chicken was the same, if not less satisfactory, as a frozen pack of chicken tenders such as Tyson. Was really disappointed considering its a bit pricey & I had high hopes. The interior is retro and adorably set up and the overall the place was very clean and the staff was very attentive and kind- the food...meh.
