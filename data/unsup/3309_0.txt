First thing that strikes me about this place is that it has a bright and cheery interior. The cheerfulness was also reflected through the staff there as we were greeted with a smile and were promptly served. \n\nIt had a menu of regular flavors (which included interesting flavors such as Key Lime Pie) as well as a menu of seasonable flavors. I got a small cup and got a scoop of Key Lime Pie and a scoop of Banana Cream Pie. Both flavors were quite creamy and delicious, exactly what I look for in my ice cream.
