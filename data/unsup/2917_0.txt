My first time and I loved it! \nBut it started off on the perfect note because I was greeted at the door by the owner. \nThat never happens anymore! \nI own a service consulting and training company so I was impressed to see this and I wish more owners would be present at the door to greet guest more often. \nThe service was fantastic, the food was perfect and they served my daughter ice cream at the end allowing my friend and I to enjoy a peaceful glass of wine. \nBravo bravo :) \nWe'll see you again soon
