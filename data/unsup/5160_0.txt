My husband surprised me with flowers while he was away on business and these were spectacular! This was easily the biggest and most beautiful bouquet of roses, lilies and hydrangeas I'd ever seen, and the lilies had not truly bloomed yet. The flowers were so fragrant they made the entire office smell good. I have no idea how pricey this arrangement was, but I can attest to the quality. Days later my flowers still look beautiful and smell amazing!
