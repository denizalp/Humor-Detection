Not too long ago, I worked in Green Tree (no this isnt deja-vu of another review, I've literally worked everywhere!)  \n\nAs much as I disliked that call center job and the traffic on the way home, I always made sure to appreciate 'the light at the end of the tunnel' - or in this case the view at the end of the tunnel.\n\nIt's so amazing and something I always look forward too. We are so lucky to have that unexpected, breathtaking view of our city! \"The city with an entrance!\"
