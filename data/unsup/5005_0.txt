Pretty radical.  \n\nAlthough personally I'm more of a 'used bookstore' kinda guy rather than the 'antique\/first edition bookstore' kinda guy, Caliban is a great place to poke through.  Tons of potential gifts and 'impress the person you brought over to your house from the bar for a one night stand with your amazing bookshelf' type books.  Even better, the place is not dusty.  All too often these sort of places get a bit unkempt and cause my allergies to freak.  No such problems here.\n\nThey even have a graphic novel section!  Nice!
