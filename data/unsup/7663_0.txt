Awesome customer service! I had my wife's grandfathers ring repaired here and it was a job well done.  The ladies who helped me were over-the-top nice and even offered me a COLD bottled water as I waited for another quick fix.  I would reccomend this place for all jewelery repairs.  Great service and very fair pricing.
