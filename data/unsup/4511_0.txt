Texted this person, got a reply next day. I explained the work i needed done and sent him pictures with detailed information. I never heard back from him. I texted him again to ask if he was going to be able to do the job, No response. I just wanted at least a yes or no if it was too hard for him.....too bad he lost an average of $700 work.
