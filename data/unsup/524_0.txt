This spot is so awesome! They have a great selection of beer and liquor. The bartenders really know their stuff and you can tell they're passionate about what they do. They have many arcade games and tons of board games. Great place to grab drinks with a date or with a big group of friends. I highly recommend the tater tots, they're crisp and warm but not too oily.
