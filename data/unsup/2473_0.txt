When I was told we were going to Fry's, I thought we were going shopping for electronics (http:\/\/www.frys.com\/).  So I was surprised when we ended up at a grocery store.  We were there specifically to get wine for our hosts for the weekend.  I was impressed with their selection and prices - very similar to what I am accustomed to.  I ended up finding a very reasonable Sauvignon Blanc that I will be stocking up back home for a daily drinking wine.
