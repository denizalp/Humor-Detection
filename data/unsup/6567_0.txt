We were craving some desserts so we decided to drive to this place which was 20 minutes from our place. It was a long drive but it was worth it.\n\nTheir gelato are amazing! They have some very unique flavors which I heard changes on a daily basis. We tried the Ube, Halo-Halo, Cookies & Cream and Green Tea flavored gelatos and they were delicious. It satisfied our late night craving.\n\nThe staff were very friend and upbeat. They allowed us to taste every flavor we wanted until we made our decision. We will definitely come back here!
