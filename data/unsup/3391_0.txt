So cute and so on the way home.  How can you go wrong?!?!  I had the Beef Bulgogi to go but I wish I had the Bibimbap instead.  The beef was plentiful and yummy.  Great take-out place just wish they offered brown rice.  I cannot wait for the new menu and I will have to try everything they have at least once.
