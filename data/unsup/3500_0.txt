i was a remember here for a yr or so i decided to cancel my membership for the following reasons:\n\n#1--Parking is a nightmare esp in the early am\n#2--The Floor plan is a mess and too broke up for me\n#3--Lack of Tv Stations\n#4--Reception seemed too snarky for me\n\nin the long run they were costing me more than Princeton Club East(who I went back to) and love it...esp open 24\/7.  In and Out before the crowd starts coming in and prices are now cheaper than PAC and include everything(pool,Sauna,Hot Tub)  those are extra $$ at PAC on top of your membership
