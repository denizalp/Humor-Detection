The food was good not amazing. 3 tacos (tasty but tiny) a few tablespoons each of rice and beans $10.00. Another $2 for a soft drink. The fountain is behind the counter so apparently no refill. $12.98 for a meagre lunch . This price point may fly in Summerlin but not here in working class Spring Valley.
