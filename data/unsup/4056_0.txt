Until recently, this was one of our favorite neighborhood joints.  We were happy for their success as the place is busy every night. Sadly, our visit this week may be our last. They scaled down their menu and seriously raised their prices on drinks and food! Dinner for 2...2 rounds Absolute rocks, shared pulled pork and kale salad...over $70!  I love the food, but not that much. Bye bye Bootleggers :(
