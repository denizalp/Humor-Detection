SHOCKINGLY GOOD.  Took my boys here this morning after dropping mom off at the airport.   Had a wonderful meal that was served up not more than 8 minutes after we ordered even though it was busy!   We luckily snagged the seats right in front of the kitchen and the boys LOVED watching the crepes being made.    I can't recommend this place enough and we'll be back next weekend!
