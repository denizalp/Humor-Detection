Had an excellent schnitzel sandwich here. A lot of options in terms of buns\/toppings (get sauerkraut) and a very reasonable price point (about 7 or 8 bucks). Unlike the breaded veal you'll get at Italian places around the city, the meat here is much denser and less reliant on the fried exterior. \n\nService was prompt, goulash and bread puddings were both enjoyable and although didn't try it - the Czech allday breakfast with Kielbasa, dumplings, and eggs looked wicked.\n\nCzech-please!\n\nGreat lunch spot.
