Friendly staff.\n\nGreat selection.\n\nI've already got two cats but I can't help checking out the cats up for adoption.  I always pray they find great forever homes and can't help but leave with a tear that I can't take them all.  But I'm not ready to be the cat lady just yet and was told if I have more than two cats I'm undateable.\n\nI always give extra money for their pet adoption\/care thing.  Makes me feel better.
