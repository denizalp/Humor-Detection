Being Greek myself, it is hard to say that this place is the best because my mother would kill me...but it's awesome!\n\nI would stay away from the boring dinner plate option that offers rice and salad with the meal and go family-style, ordering the horiatiki salad, calamari (fried or grilled), taramosalata and ordering your choice of grilled meats (ALL SO GOOD)!\n\nBy the end of the meal you will be too full but order the honey walnut cake anyway with a greek coffee, you won't regret it!\n\n(p.s. Don't tell my mom)
