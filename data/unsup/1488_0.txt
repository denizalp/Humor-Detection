Definitely recommend this place, everyone is so nice and treats you like family not only that but they left my car looking like i had just driven it off the lot! They gave me a small bottle of paint just in case i ever needed it and knowing my clumsy self i probably will. Thank you Las Vegas Collision Center, i am very satisfied!
