This place is gross their sauce taste like ketchup the food is alright but this is not award winning BBQ they must have stolen someone else's awards and put their name on them! We went here cause it was on DDD and boy were we disappointed not to mention our waitress was rude and took forever to bring anything to our table in the middle of the day the place was empty! If you want good BBQ don't come here because you won't get it!
