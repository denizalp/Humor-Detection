The tacos here are really full flavored. No bland browned ground beef here.  I'm talking about carne asada, carnitas, marinated chicken, shrimp and fish.  There are vegetarian protein options of black bean, grilled veggies and tofu. Fresh toppings to choose like lettuce, tomato, onions, peppers and cilantro.  Choice of various chilies from mild to x4.  Make your taco custom or order \"authentic.\"  The tacos are prepared with no shortage of spice.  \"Authentic\" tacos with carne asada on this visit.  They are currently my favorite on the menu.\n\nThis place is worth trying if you are in the area.
