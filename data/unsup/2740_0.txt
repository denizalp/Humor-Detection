The weather is getting nicer & we are outside at this beautiful place. I came to this place so many time but until now I could stay outside & enjoying the weather. I had a chances to meet Diane, it is a lucky day for me. We got a delicious dinner, good time. There is nothing else I could expect from this. Thanks Diane!
