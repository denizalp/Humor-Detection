First to Review?\n\nI wish someone would have taken the time to save me the trouble..\n\nVery small selection, lackluster at best. The fried chicken looked yellow?WTF!\n\nThey have seafood,BBQ,Mongolian,Chinese,Mexicano,American,Italian and a 6 item salad bar.plus a dessert station.\n\nThe big attraction is the Mongolian which is made to order-NOT for me.\n\nI tried a little of everything and was pretty disappointed but I filled up on eclairs & cheesecake.\n\nIt beat having to stand in line 2 hrs @ Green Valley Ranch but I wouldn't go out of my way.
