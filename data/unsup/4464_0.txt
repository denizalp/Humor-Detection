Great experience at The Strip location! Typically visit the one in Boca Park, but we dined here for a birthday over the weekend and had a wonderful time. Louis was a fabulous server who really played into the birthday and made sure everyone was well taken care of. Food was great and come to the table quickly. We'll definitely be back! Thank you Louis :)
