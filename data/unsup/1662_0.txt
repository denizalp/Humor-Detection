Beautiful on the inside; it looks like the Catholic churches of a by-gone era .....but the mass is liberal post modern & completely contrary to the reverence one will find inside \nmuch like being served a wonderful meal that is pleasing to the eye only to find it is with out taste, smell or nutrition. \nFor a Mass that is all the things the basilica is lacking, just head south on 7th street to Baseline rd. there you'll find Our Lady Of Sorrows.
