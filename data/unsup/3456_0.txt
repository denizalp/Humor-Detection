Mmmm! Not sure what to say.  Ordered the Lamb Choolaah.  When about half way thru found a small piece of plastic wrap (see picture).  Kind of took the edge off a meal that was pretty good.  Actually finalized my eating.  \nAbout half the tables were empty but most were not cleaned\/wiped off.  Our table had a lot of crumbs on it as did a few others we looked at, took the cleanest table.
