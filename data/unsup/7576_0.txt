My review still stands but I wanted to add a tip to the previous review.  \n\nFirst off.  If you look in the internet it lists the place as closing at 4:30pm.  That only applies to the Visitor center and not the hiking grounds and scenic drive.  \n\nThose are open earlier and until dusk each evening which on a day in the summer is more like 8pm or so.\n\nAlso.  A quick update as of May 2018.  The price for a single vehicle was increased from $7.00 to $15.00.  Its a bummer but the price is still a great value.
