I can't speak more highly of The House Brasserie. My husband, toddler and I came here on Christmas Day for dinner and had an incredible evening. The service was brilliant we were completely taken care of without anyone hovering over us. The food was some of the best I have had in Arizona, and the atmosphere was unique and charming. \n\nA fantastic restaurant for couples or small groups who enjoy a beautiful dining experience.
