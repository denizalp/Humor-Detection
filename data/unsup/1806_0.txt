Decent bar food. Wines are pretty high in my opinion but Draft Beers aren't bad. Food is spot on BAR food. Don't go expecting anything fancy. Burger was tasty albeit SMALL (5oz?). Tuna app was decent but no mistaking it for sushi quality. \n\nIt is loud especially during game day.\n\nNot a bad option when in this area...... just keep the expectations low.....
