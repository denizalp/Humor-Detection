An absolutely fantastic experience.  The grilled artichoke with garlic butter was to die for! My wife had the Ginger Tag Grilled Shrimp Salad and I had the French Dip that was anything but usual.  Screaming delicious food.  Our waiter,  Dragon from Croatia, was attentive, personable and took care of our every need. A wonderful experience.
