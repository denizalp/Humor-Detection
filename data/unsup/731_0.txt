Once the king of buffets in Vegas Bellagio is still a solid contender.  I have eaten here several times for the seafood buffet and always enjoyed it. The food quality is good and the selections are good as well. This buffet wont blow you away, but if you have some comps to use at Bellagio this wouldnt be a bad choice to use them.
