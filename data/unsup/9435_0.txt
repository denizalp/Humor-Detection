This is an A&W\/LJS-so everything taste fishy & fried-jk\n\nReally its a pretty good fast food burger & hotdog but the fried stuff is just too greasy & heavy for me.\n\nI jumped on the $.90 papa burgers on Fathers Day & this is one of the best bargains you will ever find at a fast food joint.\n\nI still hang on to the memories of yesteryear when A&W was just like Sonic with the roller waitresses and drive-up ordering unfortunately the food is no where near the same as it used to be.\n\nJust too damn FAST!
