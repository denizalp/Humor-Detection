We recently held a fund raising dinner at my daughter's high school using Dickey's as the caterer.  The theme was Mardi Gras Murder Mystery.  Mitch from Dickey's couldn't have been more supportive and helpful, especially when it was discovered we did not have the proper sized chafing dishes, which he helpfully loaned us.  The food?  Absolutely finger licking good.  The BBQ sauce is perfection, the Mac and Cheese divine.  Both the brisket and the pulled pork were huge hits.  Thank you Mitch and the staff at Dickey's for helping make our evening so successful!
