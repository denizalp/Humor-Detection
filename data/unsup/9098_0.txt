Ridiculous and sexist service. A bus boy spilled my plate on my brand new bcbg outfit ($400) I was given a card with an email address on it to send the dry cleaning bill too. THEN my friends card was decided due to fraudulent charges and while she was working it out on the phone the owner came up to the table demanding \" collateral for the bill\". Disgusting with the service from management. Hostess were great.
