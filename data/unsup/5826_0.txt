I can cross this off my list.\nFour of us had dinner there. I had a Ruben that might have been good if it had been served promptly. The fries that were the side were luke warm smothered in salt. How hard is it to serve fresh crisp French fries? \nA glass of lemonade that my husband said they must have squeezed a lemon over a glass of water...\nFish tacos for my daughter and husband with a disgustingly over cooked rice. \nWill I be back? Hell no!
