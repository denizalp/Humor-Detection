The use of a \"complex\" ordering system keeps the low iq people, like the gentleman below out. The sandwich was soooo good. The muffeletta had an awesome tapenade, cronic.  A little pricey, but they pile the meat on there. The 3star review is because of the bossy manager lady constantly yelling and micro managing the lackeys like she was Gordon Ramsey. Oh. They have melloyello, too.
