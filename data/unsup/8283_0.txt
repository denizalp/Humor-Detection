I wouldn't get married here, but the museum is very metaphorical and offers wonderful insight on urban art, signs, graffiti and artistic chaos. A lot of it is signs from old businesses, and lots are on the ground and very fun to explore with your party. This is a tourist thing for sure, with lots o gift shops aimed for that as well. Nothing much to say here, but it is worth a stop.
