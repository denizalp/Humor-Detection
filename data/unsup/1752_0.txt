Spoon and fork is one of the higher quality ayce sushi restaurants. Must haves include: sashimi,  sushi, escargot,  their pastas and their lamb racks. It's also a plus that they have sashimi for lunch!  Our server Ivan was attentive,  well groomed,  and prompt.  He made excellent recommendations.  \n\nA great spot for lunch
