This was one of my favorite vegetarian restaurant in town but since last 3 times I had South Indian and Gujarati Thali and it was all disaster. What kind of vegetables they used! Pathetic ! I never had such weird subji in my life. Some standard subji they should provide in thali like spinach , garbanzo etc. I don't think I will ever go again now to this place.
