Ghetto. Dirty.\nBathrooms are disgusting.\nParking lots sucks, spots are small.\nSet up is terrible!!\nNever heard more crying and screaming kids in my life at one mall. Come on people, if your kids are tired and cranky, do your kids a favor (and those of us who have to listen to them while we attempt to shop) and take them home for naps.
