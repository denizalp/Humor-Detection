Howlers is what it is. A divey Pgh bar with a good scattering of yinzers, hipsters, punks and everything else.\n\nDrinks are cheap and varied, they allow smoking, and there is always live music. If you're like me, and enjoy a bar for being an actual BAR, you will like this place.\n\nIf you are turned off by cigarette smoke, metal\/punk, or fret about what size heels to wear while telling Brittany shes \"your bff\" and \"oh my gawd skinny girl vodka is the best\" then maybe you shouldnt go there.
