Celebrated my brother in law and his birthday buddy's bday here! BEST TIME EVER!!!!! Pantera on,Drinks were cheap, flowing nonstop and the dancers were cool!! I've been to Vegas strip clubs and the dancers are practically begging you the minute you walk in the door, they're all over you, it's a hot mess!! Lol. Not here!! Girls were great, no attitudes and no begging!! No problems getting drinks or lap dances for the guys! GREAT MEMORIES, we will DEFINETLY be back!! We ALWAYS have a better time at the smaller places!!
