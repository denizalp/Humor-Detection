This place is a small stand within Wholey's, which is itself an awesome store of fresh seafood. The sushi rolls here are the BIGGEST I have ever seen! We've been twice as we are addicted to the Salmon and Mango roll. One roll ~ 3 rolls anywhere else and the fish is so fresh and clean. Andy also makes waiting fun and is always handing out samples. If you make it to the Strip District and like Sushi, this is a MUST!!!!
