It has been over a week since I ate here and I am ruined from all other food; nothing tastes good in comparison to what I ate at Social House!\n\nIn all seriousness, it is one of the most delicious meals I have ever eaten, and I found the staff to be extremely attentive and helpful. \n\nI can't wait until the next time I am in Vegas so I can go back!
