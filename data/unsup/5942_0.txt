Spectacular hiking, scenery and nature. I spent most of the afternoon walking up to Tom's Thumb and then wandering around on my way back down until sunset. A couple of small storms blew through making everything high-contrast. The smell of the desert after a rain is impossible to describe. It's better than real good.
