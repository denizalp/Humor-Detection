Havana has come home to roost. La r√©volucion marked Cuba as a radical state, marooned from the colossal consumerist behemoth of Americana, freezing it's beauty like a perpetual cold-war era oasis. El Cubana offers uo a sliver of this marooned time with its phantasmagoric splendor. I consumed the Guava Bbq short ribs along with rice and beans, tostones (made with plantsin) and the creamiest slaw on the planet. It was a hate fuck for my diet but a mouth fuck for my taste buds. Get it. Get all of it. Love it.
