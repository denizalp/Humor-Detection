To be honest, based on this experience, this place is a little bit over rated. The salmon we had wasn't fresh, the sauce on the pork ear taco was too sweet. But the tuna was pretty decent. The presentation of the food was so so. And the waiter was grumpy which made it kinda unpleasant. But the manager was very nice and took the salmon dish off from the bill after we told him how we felt about it.
