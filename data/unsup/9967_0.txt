Shauna really loves what she does and it shows in the results. I have been to her twice for my initial and my touchup microblading and I love my results. Nothing better than waking up and just doing a quick brush of the brows and being able to start your day. \n\nShe's very attentive and detail oriented. You won't be disappointed. Brows are everything these days. I'm so glad I got mine done.
