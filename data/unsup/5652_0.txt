This was our first time at Green Beanery and we were pleasantly surprised at how great this cafe is. We ordered ice cream (sweet cream & roasted marshmallow) in waffle cones with a latte. The latte was a bit bitter but we still enjoyed it. Service was quick and friendly. Price was decent - $2.50 for a one scoop ice cream cone, latte was $4.50. We will definitely come back for the ice cream!
