Is pizza on 40th the best pizza in the world?  No.  Is it easy in a pinch, consistent, moderately priced, and a great neighborhood go-to spot for pick-up or delivery?  Absolutely!\n\nMy kids are a bit picky about their pizza and they eat pizza from this place quite often, so I consider that a huge win... In addition to the delicious pizza, this place does a great job with chicken and eggplant parm dishes.  The salads?  Not my favorite.\n\nI recommend ordering delivery if you live in the neighborhood.  Pair up your order with some wine or beer and enjoy!
