If you're looking for a professional with the right equipment and experience, Michael is your guy!\nI recently switched careers and wanted to have professional headshots taken for all of my new marketing material. Called Michael on a Friday evening and he got back to me promptly for an appointment on Monday. Just got them taken yesterday and he was great to work with. I've selected the images I want and I'm happy with the results. \n\nThank you Michael.
