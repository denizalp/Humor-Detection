This place is beautiful!  My buddy and I decided to check it out on a Thursday night the week after it opened.  The venue is really clean and decorated perfectly.  The drinks are average to high priced.  \nThe most impressive part about this place is you don't have the douche bag bouncers and door people giving you a hard time.  They were happy to have us.  Give this place a try.
