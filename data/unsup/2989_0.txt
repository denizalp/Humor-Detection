They serve melted cheese on buttery bread and play roots reggae in the diner. I'm sold.\n\nThe place is small and casual but well designed with a cute vibe. The menu changes all the time but obviously consists mostly of variations on grilled cheese. Some funky ones I've tried include: burrito grilled cheese, pesto grilled cheese, and drumroll...poutine grilled cheese. \n\nSo if you're looking for a quick, casual meal or a naughty snack this side of Decarie, Le Cheese is the place to be.
