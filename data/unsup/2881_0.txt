I went in many months ago for a consultation. Then returned yesterday with a cracked tooth. They got me in right away and as others have said, Dr. Hoaglin is great. He told me what needed to be done and proceeded once I was numb and ready for extraction. It was a tough extraction, but I went from popping Advil like candy, to barely feeling anything in the blink of an eye. Not cheap, but you get what you pay for! I will definitely be back!
