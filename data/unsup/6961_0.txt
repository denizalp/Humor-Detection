I personally found Ashley Furniture to be a little bit better. \n\nThey both have hyperactive salesmen trying to sell you anything that isn't nailed down...but Walkers seemed to be a little less knowledgeable about their products.\n \nEither way, you're going to choose whatever you think looks the best...so what's the point in leaving some long drawn out review? \n\nEnjoy...
