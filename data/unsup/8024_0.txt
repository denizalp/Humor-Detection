Came in with 3 colleagues and all had the 5 course sampler. Everything was okay, i think just too sophisticated for my pallet. Also, nearly everything had cilantro, which i have a dire aversion to so that was my fail for not telling them to hold the cilantro after seeing it the first time. The cod sample was good, but the duck had so much sauce I couldn't taste the duck itself. My favorite course was the dessert.
