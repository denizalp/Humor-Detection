Had my new Kia Sorento tinted here recently. Knowledgeable staff and owner. Real easy to make an appointment on Yelp. Was in and out in 2 hours for full SUV tint job with Windshield. After everything has dried, the tint job is immaculate. Watched a movie while I waited too. Can't recommend this place enough.
