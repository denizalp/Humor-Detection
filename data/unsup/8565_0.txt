Just had another yummy lunch delivered to my office from this location.  Capriotti's is one of my office's favorite things to eat at our meetings.  Everyone is happy when the food arrives. My orders are always correct and on time, and the customer service is extraordinary, they really go the extra mile to give me great service every time.  They make ordering lunch so much easier.  Thanks so much so for all you do.  \nI just hope that the guy who signed the bill gave you extra extra beer money!\nThis is hands down the best Capriotti's in town!
