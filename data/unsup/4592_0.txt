I can't say enough how much I love this place!! I always get the Pure Bowl (acai, bananas, granola, strawberries, and seeds). The staff is nice and helpful. I totally take advantage of their drive thru when I'm on the go (cute guy working btw LOL) Everything made fresh to order. Looking forward to try out some more items on menu.
