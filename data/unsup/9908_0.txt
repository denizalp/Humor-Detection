Matthew Smith not only found me the loft-condo I thought I could never have (or knew existed!), but he made the process of looking for it educational, confidence-building, and an all-round pleasure. Matthew is a great reflection of Bosley's professionalism, unique style, and friendly attitude. He understood that he played a role in this large financial and emotional step I was taking, and it was a responsibility he did not take lightly. I would recommend Matthew to any new or experienced buyers in Toronto looking for a positive and smooth experience in real estate.
