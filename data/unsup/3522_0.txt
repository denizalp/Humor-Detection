THEY ARE CLOSED FOR BUSINESS!!! \n\nI had an errand to run and looked up \"Bakery\" on Yelp and this was the closest one. I arrive, check-in, walk over and lo and behold the place is closed. I was upset. Why would it still show up on my lit or map.. I wasted 10 mins trying to get in the parking lot just to be in shock there are chains and a lock on the door. Maybe they didn't pay their rent?? DO NOT DRIVE HERE..
