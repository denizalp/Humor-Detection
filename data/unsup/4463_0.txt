The salon prices are sky high and I paid $52 for a haircut!!!! The woman who did my hair was not very friendly at all. For a cut and color my bill was $187!!!!! I definitely was not expecting that. And it honestly looks like a cut I could have got for $12 and the color could have came from a box. Will never go back again.
