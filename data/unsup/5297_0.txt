I'm turning green with envy at the thought of this park. They should have these in every downtown.\n\nThis tiny little sliver of green in the very middle of the high-rises of downtown Charlotte is a brilliant idea. They should put little parks and green strips like this all over all the downtowns and shopping areas and industrial areas and also residential areas of America. The more, the better. A very good idea and a nice place to hang out when you're lost in the sea of concrete that is Carolina's biggest - but not best - city.
