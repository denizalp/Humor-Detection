You won't enjoy LOVE if you're not familiar with any Beatles songs. I personally had a blast and thoroughly enjoyed watching some of my favorite songs translated visually. I like the fact that a history of the Beatles and the social context in which they performed was incorporated into the show. \n\nThe stage is a round one so every seat is a good seat. They have performers interacting with all levels of seats. Our tickets cost $110. We were seated in the fifth row.
