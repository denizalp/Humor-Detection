I have yet to eat in the restaurant, but Banana Blossom KILLS IT on take out.\n\nThe prices are decent, they label everything very clearly, don't charge you extra for rice or special requests, and the food is tasty and comes fast. \n\nThey also have quite a few traditional Thai dishes that many American Thai restaurants don't have. \n\nBravo! Go visit them now so they can stay in the 'hood for a long time to come!
