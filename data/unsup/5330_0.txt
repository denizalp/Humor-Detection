Allstate Electric is one of the finest electric companies in Las Vegas do to their professionalism and creativity and prices are awesome. We had ceiling fans, electrical outlets, specific wiring and even a solar quote which was amazing. Their prices are fair and reasonable and I'm sure you'll enjoy working with them as much as I did.
