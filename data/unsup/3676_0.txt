If I could give this place a 0 I would. We were In a bachelorette party that literally was in the building for a minute and we were told if we weren't going to order drinks we needed to leave. By a guy that was in too little of shorts and a tank top  told the Bachelorette that was not even drunk that she the water she had had to be dumped. We weren't even given a chance to get up to the bar!  Terrible service. TERRIBLE!!
