An industrial-chic bungalow built just inside of the Coronado Historic District that showcases a loved downtown in an urban setting. The art and people are always beautiful.\n\nCappuccino, along with Caffe Latte are my two most common espresso drinks. This one today gets four shots of espresso. The cup is huge. The drink is excellent.
