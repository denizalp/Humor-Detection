After many unsuccessful attempts to solve my husband's hearing problems, I was skeptical when he told me he arranged for Keller Hearing to come to our house.  I expected an \"old\" approach, and couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nRyan is terrific.  He asked lots of questions, listened, and suggested a perfect solution. I'm so glad to have him working on our behalf and highly recommend him and Keller Hearing.
