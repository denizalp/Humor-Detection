I went in and needed something for work for the next day. They didn't carry it and I asked the sales associate if there was anywhere nearby that might carry it, and he refused to help me out. He said,\" I'm not at liberty to tell you another stores name.\" we'll I'll never go there again. And I went to American shooters and found they were cheaper, had a better selection and appreciated customers.
