First time clients must register so they can look you up in their system by your phone number. I'm from California so men's haircut is only $8 & it's a top notch barber shop, can't beat the price. The prices in Vegas is ridiculous. I figured I'll give this place a try for $13. I asked for a  \"skin high fade\" (straight fade) & I came out looking SHREK. She gave me a high pineapple fade. I didn't want to complain and make it worse, I don't plan on coming back. Very disappointed. Would not recommend this place.
