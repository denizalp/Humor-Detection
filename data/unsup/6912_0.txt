1 star for the price and the information wasn't made clear without clarification.\n\nI am on a tight budget and was in need of someone to come and feed my dog once a day just for few days.\n\nHe is old and very low maintenance.  But due to the Mandatory 2 visits a day (23$ a visit) I cant afford to use this service.  To me its not worth almost 50$ a day just for a feeding and water change.
