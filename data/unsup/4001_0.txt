Definitely surprised when I walked into my room here! The rooms are actually pretty nice. I had been coming here for years as a local when I lived in Vegas but never needed to book a room before. \nComfortable beds, updated decor, easy check-in with friendly staff, cheap rates. Definitely a place you should consider staying at on your next trip to Vegas.
