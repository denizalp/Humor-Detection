Overpriced and just average pizza. We ordered a pie and they split up multiple existing whole pies by giving slices to parties behind us, and asked we wait for 25 minutes for a new pie to be made. They force you to order by the slice which is a 15$ price difference. A pizza does not take 25 minutes to make.
