This is a very basic Subway location, except it shares a space with Wienershnitzel. That was pretty weird. We wanted to grab a quick bite in the area to take to the drive-in with us and were trying to get something a little healthier than the typical fast food options. Service was basic and quick. We'll probably be back when we come to the drive-in again.
