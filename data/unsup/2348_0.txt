One of the nicest Targets I've ever been in! The store was clean and neat and the staff is so nice! There's such great and ample selection as well! I always go to Target for baby supplies and there was a bigger selection than others I've been to. They also have a great clearance selection of toys and baby items. Wish I lived near here. haha
