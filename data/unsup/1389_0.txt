I recently had my starter changed at this place.  They charged me $370 for the part plus labor.  I thought that was bit much but was desperate so I obgliged.....after thinking about it a couple of days later and talking to some friends, and did some research on the web, I found out that I could buy the parts over the internet for little under $150.\n\nNeedless to say, I wont be going back there.....
