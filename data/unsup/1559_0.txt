Outstanding coffee experience. Coffee Island is the Starbucks of Greece. They serve delicious pastries and sandwiches along with single origin coffees from all over the world. They sell their high quality coffees and teas for home in wonderfully branded packaging. What completed the authentic experience for me was their Greek coffee made in a Greek copper Briki. I'll be back to sit on their patio.
