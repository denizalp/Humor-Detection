Terrific ambiance! Drinks are somewhat overpriced but the food is excellent and worth the value. We went for Restaurant Week and got 3 courses for something around $30 and all 3 courses were cooked to perfection and delicious. I would definitely recommend this as a first stop when you get to the city!
