Start with the off-menu hush puppies and honey butter. Move to a combo plate of ribs and pulled pork. Texas toast and baked beans are a must, also. Save some room for banana pudding - REAL banana pudding. \n\nMacs is a great BBQ joint with great live music (sometimes too loud if you just want to talk) and there are always some hogs parked out front to give it that authenticity of a biker bar. Plenty of TVs for sports if you're looking for that.
