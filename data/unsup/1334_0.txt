This place is outstanding. Friendly staff whom do not hover but make sure you are all set, absolutely delicious food and a good drink selection. I had the chef's special which happened to be filet mignon with greens and potatoes.  It was so good I honestly wanted to go back a second night during our trip. 10\/10 - we'll be back during our next visit to Montreal.
