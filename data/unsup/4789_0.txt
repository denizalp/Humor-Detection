The ID I provided to the TSA was STILL not enough to get a drink here. We would have stayed, but their prices are ridiculous, so we walked up to FOX. They were far busier and it is obviously for a reason. They happily accepted my ID here and we ate and drank our way through a rather long layover.\n\n\nThis place stinks, even for an airport bar. Avoid at all possible costs. Only gave 1 star because I had to.
