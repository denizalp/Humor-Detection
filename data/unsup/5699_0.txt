Well we stopped in again tonight and the food was terrific . I had salt and pepper fish again and I tried some tripe with a really delicious sauce they give you this is definitely handmade very very tasty .The service seems to just get better the food is really good great for the budget the kids love it and so do I. I think we will become a locals because the price is right and the food is great.
