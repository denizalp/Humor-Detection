One of my favorite places to eat breakfast in Arizona! When we go out for spring training each year, its a must we stop when we arrive in AZ , and as we leave AZ! Gets pretty packed but they get people in quick. Love their omelettes and all dishes are huge portions and good service. They even sell their own hot sauce which is good too! Recommend Papa Burn sauce
