All the shit I've gone through with this place, first it relocated and is not easy to find, 2nd when I do find it its during the holidays and its closed and now........I walked in the door 5 minutes after 4 and asked if they still served th lunch special-1 meat 1 side for $5.\n\nThey said no-the rest of the menu is way overpriced, this place is in the sleaziest neighborhood right behind Little Darlings nudie bar.so i left\n\nI never ate here but to me it's not worth it-no wonder the cook is packing heat.
