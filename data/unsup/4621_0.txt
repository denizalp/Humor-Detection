Great food great beer, service is a little slow at least when I usually go which is late so maybe it is not like that all the time. It has an outdoor space that has great atmosphere. I usually get a flight of beer because they have so many. Servers are very educated on the beers they offer. I have had quiet a few of their dishes and don't really favor one over the others everything is really good and has a slight variance to what you would usually find in the exact same item elsewhere.
