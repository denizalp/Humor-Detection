I have been to many outback all over .in california,utah,and here in arizona.this was probably the worst one.the restaurant was not that busy.but trying to get service was hard even when you use the little monitor to summon d your waitress like a flight attendant. The other servers seen the flashing red light didn't ask if they could help or go get our waitress.
