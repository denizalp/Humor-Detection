What a unique ice cream retreat to enjoy in the dead of summer! We truly enjoyed our treats! We tried the Macho Matcha, the S'mores, the Mango Tango, Mixed Fruit Tapioca, and the Hong Kong Style Egg Waffle! Everything was so delicious and absolutely picture perfect. We are trying to get our son to get a job here so we have an excuse to be regulars...
