I came in today, I was \"greeted\"by a girl name Hanna. She's very unprofessional and uneducated with certain animals. I was asking certain questions of the animals we've gotten here. She was rude with her answers and make me feel really uncomfortable. She also rolled her eyes at me several times. Let's just thank God I had my Xanax because I would flipped on her. Petland give the customers a favor and fire her. Get someone that knows what they're doing!
