Papago Park Amphitheater. This old 3,500-seat amphitheater is located in Papago Park. It was constructed in 1933 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Stone and mortar. It is located next to McDowell.\n\nI don't sit at the top of the masonry seats in the shadows of Barnes Butte like I used to and the theater hasn't been used for over 50 years really. But when I have a moment and a guest I like to walk to the top and chat for a bit, enjoy the view of East Phoenix and Scottsdale while talking about yesterday.
