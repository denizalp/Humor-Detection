So, I have had times here where the service was bad because the cook had a bad attitude. But the food is so good that I hade to come back. My favorite item on the menu is the Italian beef sandwich. The specialty fries are also delicious. Tonight I also tried the pizza bread which was pretty good and very inexpensive.
