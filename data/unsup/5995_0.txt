Dessert Lady is the best. This was my first experience with them, and I wanted to surprise a friend with a cake. I made the order and arranged to pick it up the same day, but unfortunately had to leave early for an emergency work trip. I didn't get back until three days later. When I called, they offered to remake the cake for me! I was so touched, and the cake was beautiful. It's incredible that they're so thoughtful of their customers--I really appreciated it. Thanks so much!
