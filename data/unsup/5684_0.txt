Four of us stopped in for a late lunch having just arrived in Pittsburgh. We ordered small plate warmed olives and the roasted Brussels sprouts. Both of these were absolutely to die for good!  We also did a margherita flatbread pizza. It too was delicious. The ladies had a Sauvignon Blanc, I a Chianti and the other guy a draft IPA. All were excellent.
