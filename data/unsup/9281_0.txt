We hadn't seen the show but while dining the owner Sammy mentioned it so we went there unprejudiced.  First of all, we met both owners and they were super nice.  We got our food in a timely manner and it was delicious.  We got a cheese panini and a turkey sandwich.  Yummmm.  Then a chocolate cake which was heavenly.  We will have to check out the show but as an unbiased reviewer we loved it!
