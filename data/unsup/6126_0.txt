Ambience was spectacular. Service was pleasant. Food was mediocre. I walked in expecting an expensive evening, but did not expect to be charged for water and have gratuity added. We were not pleased that we arrived at 630pm on a Wednesday (for our reservation) and did not leave until 840pm (seated the whole time). We were also not offered the Wednesday special (we found out from a table next to us after it was to late to order). Unexpectedly dissatisfied after hearing so many great things about this restaurant. I would not recommend.
