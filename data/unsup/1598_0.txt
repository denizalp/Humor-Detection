We ordered take-out tonight for our first experience with Libretto's. It arrived 35 minutes past the scheduled delivery time, food was cold and had to be re-heated, and nothing was particularly good. Mozzarella sticks were bland and the pizza was about 45% plain crust on the edges with all toppings\/cheese piled up in middle. Really disappointing. \n\nIn the future, we'll stick with our regulars of Hawthorne's and Dean & Deluca.
