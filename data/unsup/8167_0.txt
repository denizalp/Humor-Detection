Visited after panthers game my husband and I wanted to find a good place to get wings and watch football, we were seated immediately but walked out after reading through the menu a few times and did not receive a single word from the server at the table, not even a \"I'll be right with you.\" Can't review the food as we waited around 10 minutes before escaping after no service from our waiter.
