I personally think this is the best ramen place in Vegas. My all time favorite is the original daikokuya location in downtown LA. I love the tonkotsu broth that daikokuya serves, but Monta's isn't too far behind. This place is definitely not good for groups or if you plan on having a leisurely meal. You're meant to order, eat, and get the fu%& out since there's always a line here starting about 30 minutes before they open... Even on a Wednesday!
