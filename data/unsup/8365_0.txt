This restaurant is so friendly and inviting I feel like I am a part of the family! Welcomed by many smiles. The food is delicious and fresh. Not to mention it didn't take long at all to receive our food. Overall would recommend this new place to anyone! The place has a really cool atmosphere and design. Very great  menu with Thai Vietnamese and Chinese options! Good for everyone! Their beverages are so refreshing and homemade!!
