Having been here many times, I decided to try something new.  I tried the Bandido Burrito (Carne Asada, Chile Relleno, Guacamole), $5.99.  It was amazing and very filling.  The combination of Carne Asada & Chile Relleno w\/Guac was perfect.  One of my favorite Taco Shops in AZ.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%
