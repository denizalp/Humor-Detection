Words that come to mind when I think of my stay at the Venetian:\n\nHuge\nGrandiose\nOpulent\nGarish\nSprawling\nComplex\nConfusing\nBewildering\nFascinating\nIntense\nExpensive\nSuites\nPerfume\nWalking (lots of)\n\nI could connect all of those words together to form some form of verbose review (as I usually do), but I think you can figure it out from there.
