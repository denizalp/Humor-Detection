This is a hidden gem! So happy my husband suggested this off-the-beaten path eatery. We thoroughly enjoyed our soup and sandwich dishes. The meatball sandwich was THE BEST meatball sandwich I've ever had! I also had a super indulgent cookie\/frosting sandwich. So good! We're definitely visiting again when we're back in Davidson. Cudos to the chef(s)! The service was also great as well as the ambience.
