I've been here a gazillion times, not only because my mom works there, but also because the food is absolutely amazing. But if you're looking for a cheap restaurant, stay away! Haha. \nThe service is okay, isn't fast but isn't slow. It all really depends on what time of night you go. \nBut if it's slow, it's okay! You can enjoy a Chinese drama\/show on the LCD TV there! \nI recommend the Sesame chicken\/beef. SOO GOOD. It's amazing and my favourite dish there. \n\nSo if you're looking for delicious chinese food at night, this is the place for you!
