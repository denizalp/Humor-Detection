the food is great, the price is great, and the beer is great. Also great are that there's typically no line and that it's quiet enough to have a conversation, unlike Guu down the street.\n\nLots of great dishes here and very nice Takowasa. I like Takowasa so it works well for me :)\n\nThe hours seem a bit random though - for whatever reason they're only open when I'm already full! (hasn't stopped me.)
