Oh my god. Just don't go here. Had a reservation for 6:30, didn't get food until 8. Didn't get the check till 9. I have never experienced such aggravatingly SLOW service. Must have been one guy in the kitchen. \n\nDon't even get me started on the food. Extremely bland. DEFINITELY wasn't worth it, SUPER OVERPRICED. \n\nStill ripping my eyeballs out in frustration!!!
