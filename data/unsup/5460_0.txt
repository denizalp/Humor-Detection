Cant even rate the food.  Wanted to give it a shot and drove all the way across town to try it and by the time we got there everyone has to use the restroom.  So I ask where it is and the kid behind the counter tells me they don't have a restroom.  So I ask him where he goes & he looks around and was like \"uh you could use the liquor store next door\".  Rude.  Yeah no thanks.  Ill pass.  We left without ordering.
