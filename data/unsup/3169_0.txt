This small Crepe shoppie has so much charm!  It's packed Saturday morning but it's worth the wait.  Shelby (beautiful Ginger) makes everyone comfortable while they wait.  The coffee taste green.  Some people really love that taste and it is not your typical Starbucks roast. Great job being different and standing out.  The granola was really good.  Surprisingly good..  I don't like granola so you really should ask for it.  The first time crepe was AMAZING.  To the eye and the palate.  I will be back, for sure!!
