Very cute store with adorable soaps, bath bombs, bubble bath powders and more. A bit on the pricey side, but everything smelled great, and I wanted a cute souvenir for my kids. The sales clerk (Ellie) recommended several items, described them in detail, demo'd them at the sink, and told me about the promos going on. She was great! How could I say no. Bought a Macaron shaped soap, and the face mask marshmallows.. Kids loved them!
