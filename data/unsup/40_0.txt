I rent at Hertz a lot as I travel for business, this was by far the best Hertz I have ever rented at.  I am a gold member, I got an email immediately after departing the plane with the stall number.  I got a relatively new Toyota Camry.  The entire process took about 15 minutes, the location is only 3 miles from the airport.  Drop off was just as easy.
