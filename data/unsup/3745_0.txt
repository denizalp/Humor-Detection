I would give this zero stars, if I could.  It is literally the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. We sat for 45 minutes with no food. The owner came out and berated us and never apologized.  The owner was extremely rude! The only positive note was the server, Candace, was wonderful!  Do not eat here unless you enjoy being yelled at and insulted by the owner.  The old Amy's baking Company just closed because of horrible owners. I guess Il Capo took its place!
