Came by this cupcake store to grab a cupcake for my moms birthday. They are very pretty and many are super shiny! Very well worth the price! About $4.50 per cupcake they're super camera worthy! The taste is okay, not bad. I find it very creamy. However the packaging is great too! Cute little bakery! You can find parking on the side or a parking lot right by!
