Came in here for an espresso since this was close to my hotel and the lady didn't seem to understand my French when I asked for a shot of espresso with a little milk.\n\nNo problem, so I switched to English. \n\nShe still didn't understand so I said nevermind.\n\nThen she tried to charge me for a con panna.\n\nUm, I don't think so.\n\nAfter going back and forth she finally charged me correctly but she was super rude.
