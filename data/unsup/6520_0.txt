When I was a kid, my dad used to fry bologna for dinner. \nI hated it. \nIt was so greasy, it left a film in my mouth...as if my tongue was coated with some sort of lard.\nWell if you like this sort of thing, I highly recommend going to Church's. \n\nI ate there last week. Afterward, one of the women in my office asked if I lost a bet.\nWhen I pressed, asking why she'd say something like that,  she responded;\n\n \"I noticed you had lip gloss on.\"
