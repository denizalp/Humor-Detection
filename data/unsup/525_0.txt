They can do the burger medium rare, albeit theme felt cold eating it : (\nAnd they have a nice cozy space and incredibly attentive service from the waitresses.. sometimes not the couple male staff I encountered.\nCute place, good food, ok price. But not special enough to return\/ go out of my way for.\nI think if I lived in the neighbourhood it would easily be 3.5-4 stars.
