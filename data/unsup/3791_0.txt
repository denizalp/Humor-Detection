I'll admit it I hate dealing with auto repairs and the mechanic is the one who usually takes the brunt of my rath. I found this place in the beginning of October when I got a new used vehicle.  I have to say Juan has been amazing at calming me down and getting me thru these repairs while staying with in my budget and and not feeling like I am being taken advantage of and robbed! Thank you so much to those that  work here and take care of me and my Sherman Tank!
