I was a member here for years, loved the people. volunteered as a prayer chaplain. WOW, lots of things have changed!  NOT 4 the good!\nThey now have a pastoral care minister from Chicago who is extremely prejudiced against vegans, kicked me off the prayer chaplain program and asked me not to come back to worship! \n\nConsider me gone! At least until this Jimmy Scott person is!
