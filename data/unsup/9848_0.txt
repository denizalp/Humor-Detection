Checked out their happy hour on a Thursday. Too hot for outdoors, but not crowded inside this day. Happy hour until 6:00. Good selection of local brews for $3 during happy hour. Tried the wings and fried balls. Both excellent. Not a large space, but really nice. Will definately be back, especially since within  a 2 minute walk from our place.
