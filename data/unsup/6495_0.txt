So I'm not super big into frozen yogurt, but I do find it refreshing at times. \n\nLikes:\n-Everything is organic\n-GMO free\n-The fruit toppings are very fresh and none of that frozen garbage.  The lychees and kiwi's were so fresh and absolutely delicious. \n-Free samples.\n\nDislikes:\n-It's a bit more expensive than YoYo's at $0.65\/oz vs. $0.55\/oz.  While that doesn't seem like much, if you buy 10 oz, it's a $1.00 difference.  However, you get what you paid for.\n\nVerdict: Good fro-yo place while you do your shopping in Square One.
