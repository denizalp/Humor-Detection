I've been a One Nevada member since 2000 and will never leave them! The location I frequent the most is the one on Lake Mead near Buffalo. The staff there is so friendly and professional. Corie C. Is the one who helped us activate a card that we had a problem with and she made it so simple! I also have to give a shoutout to my other favorite agent at that location -- Margaret M. She is sincerely interested in her customers and takes care of them!
