I'm really not sure why this place is rated so high! Probably the worst mexican food I've had. Ever... The quesadillas were beyond dry and the bowl was very mediocre... I would probably give this place a 3 star rating for the nothing special kind of food.. However, I did find 3 pieces of hair in my buritto bowl and that really put me off. A piece of stray hair accidentally is sometimes okay but 3 is not. Gross.
