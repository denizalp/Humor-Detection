I went in for my usual Oil change service. The crew as different , New  Manager and Counter Help. They completed the oil change attempted to get $448.00 out of me for a service they were recommending that was needed and asap. They lied about what was needed and what was completed along with the oil change. Avoid this place at all cost!!!!!\nLiars, Cheaters and Thieves!!!!
