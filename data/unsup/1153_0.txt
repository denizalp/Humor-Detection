We just bought a new home and we had several different contractors\/service men in our home to address numerous things that are under our homeowners warranty. Of all the the contractors, \nJim was by far the most professional and meticulous person that has come through our home. \n\nHe did an excellent job repairing a scratch on our Quartz countertop and gave me great advice on how to care for our marble counters in our bathroom. Definitely adding his name to our contact list.
