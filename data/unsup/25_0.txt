Pros: cheap gas\n\nCons: I drive a high performance car and the manufacturer recommends only premium gas. I thought I was buying that from Costco. Turns out I wasn't. My car mechanic told me that my engine was full of deposits left by poor quality gas. The check engine light came on. Costco buys their gases from whoever is offering the lowest prices (savings they pas on to their customers). I guess that's fine for a regular car, but not for mine.
