My husband got off work early to make it down there to pick up steele before you guys closed.  He got there in plenty of time but apparently all your guys had already started drinking beers for the day and couldn't help him.  He was literally told that!  The steele was for my son's Christmas gift.  They were going to build it together on Christmas Eve.  My husband is a very regular customer and brings A LOT of business to you guys.  Pretty sad guys.
