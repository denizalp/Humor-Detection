This place is always good. Daily .99 specials and on Sunday it's 3 rolled tacos. Whoot! Whoot!\n\nThe kids love the #2 kids meal. Its a bean and cheese burro with fries, a churro and a juice drink for $2.99. For REAL?! You bet. Bite it McD's. My kids have a way happier meal from here without the cheesy toy.\n\nSuper nachos are my fave and always last into the next day due to the portion size.\n\nThe place is always clean and the girl behind the jail bars (order window) is always friendly.\n\nPS. they don't take American Express.
