It was empty when I arrive.  A little after two on a Tuesday.  The hostess must have seen my apprehension because she stated that the lunch crowd had just left.  Sure.\nAnyway the sushi was nothing spectacular and the sushi chef kept wiping his nose with the back of his hand.  Awesome!! Oh and then he would make my sushi with his bare hands.  I didn't need to see that.  I still ate, cuz I'm not a pussy.\n\"yes this is delicious what do u call this roll\"  \n\"Oh this is Haka Lugee Snot Rorr\"\n\"Mmm, Delicious\"
