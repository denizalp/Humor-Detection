Make sure that you let the patrol boat know if you are having a hard time, otherwise it'll just say hi and pass you by meanwhile leaving you with big waves to deal with... while paddle boarding! The patrol guy was so naive, I don't understand how he neglected his responsibilities even after being told to go check out on my friend. He thought a wave meant she was doing just fine. Other than that, just make sure you don't paddle out too far. Going back is much harder than it looks, especially with already existing winds.
