I've been coming here for years now and Eileen and her staff is always consistent with their services. I make sure i always take someone with me like a friend or a family member just so they can experience a good relaxation. They've been running their $22 an hour specials for a while now, so very cheap for a great massage!!!  Their staff is very nice, polite and professional. another star for the the place being neat and clean.
