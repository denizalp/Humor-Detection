I called this school looking to hire a Nanny.  I was sent some resumes and the girls had no experience just schooling from the English Nanny & Governess school.  Asking top market rate for a inexperienced nanny seamed odd for a agency claiming to make a difference in the nanny market. I did a little more research and they seam to be very shady they lost a lawsuit involving child sex abuse. Article below. Not going here for any nannies. http:\/\/m.clevescene.com\/scene-and-heard\/archives\/2015\/03\/31\/chagrin-falls-nanny-school-heads-to-court-in-sexual-abuse-cover-up-case
