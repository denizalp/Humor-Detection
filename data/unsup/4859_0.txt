Yet another place in markham that sucks.  And I say that based on the service we received from a real winner of a waitress. She had such a snotty attitude, and condescending as hell.  The only thing that saves this place from a 1 star was the host\/busser who was very warm and welcoming and made great recommendations.  We ended up giving him the tip and leaving her a toonie.  Its a shame she ruined the place for us because the food was pretty damn good.  Never going back.
