I had my side ribs done by Willy. He recreated a drawing that i brought in which looks even better.  It was a cover up of a small tat from 10 years ago. My new tat  looks pretty cool as hell. So if you want a bad ass tat with great details and not cartoon looking tat drawn by a five year old,  Swing by here.  Its worth every penny. lol..Thanks again Bad Apple.
