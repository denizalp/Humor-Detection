I was referred to this practice by Wadsworth Family Practice for a shoulder\/arm pain (I had previously been treated in Wooster by a physician who prescribed muscle relaxants). I was thrilled that they quickly and accurately diagnosed my problem and gave me exercises to relieve and prevent the pain. I often informally recommend this practice.
