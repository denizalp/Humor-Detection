Great food! I love their fresh and healthy approach to classic favorites. The employees are happy and friendly so it seems like one of new favorite local hangouts. I've eaten here three days in a row!\n\nOnly complaint is the music, it's a sleepy and dreary depressing mess of old depressing songs. Not sure if they're trying to attract an older clientele but they better switch it up to some Verve Remixed, Reggae, Jazz, soft hip mix. Hoping for something new like on Pandora.
