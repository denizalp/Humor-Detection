Used to be the best roasted duck in town but since the owner got changed, the food too got changed.  Besides roasted duck was a disappointment, roasted pork was too fat and not crispy. Eggplant and beef chow fun were so oily. I can see the oil was dripping from the eggplant and the chow fun on the plate was shiny. The wonton soup was just ok. The price wasn't cheap compare to other better Chinese restaurants around.
