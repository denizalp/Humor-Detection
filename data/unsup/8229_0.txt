Popular spot in Coventry, 20-minute wait on Saturday late morning-not bad, tables are very close to each other so don't go if you're wanting to have a private conversation. Omelette was pretty good, hash browns were good until I chomped into a huge chunk of undercooked onions. Not a fan. Will go back to try the pancakes. Really friendly service!
