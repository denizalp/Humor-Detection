I would recommend Spay Neuter Charlotte to anyone. It seems to be the only vet that is honest and my pup isn't afraid of. After a horrible experience with Banfield, my pup will be having all of her wellness done here. They have a very friendly staff and do incredible work for the community. I also had my cat spayed here with no complications and she healed very quickly. You guys rock!
