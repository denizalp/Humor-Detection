We won't ever be back. We had to wait 10mins for coffee, the food was mediocre and cold, and the place was dirty. We sat at the table outside the kitchen, and saw the cooks place plates of cooked food under the fryer while they waited for food staff to pick them up; no hot plates or anywhere clean. Their \"A\" rating is a sham if this is a normal business practice.
