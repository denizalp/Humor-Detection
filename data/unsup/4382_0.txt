I had the haddock and chips. It was just alright. I'm from the East-coast and find you Toronto natives are so eassssssssssily impressed with fish. It was too expensive for haddock.\n\nFries were pretty nice, though. SALTY. Skip this spot and make your way up to Harbord FnC. It's worth your commute from douchebag alley.\n\nPS The chairs were really uncomfortable. So get take out. Or nothing.
