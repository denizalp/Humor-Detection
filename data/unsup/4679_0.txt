It's a very small place and you cannot choose your bartender so your stuck with what you got, can you say I'm not going to serve you any ruder. I came for the happy hour since it's the only one that keeps a special on beer\/wine until 8 p.m but it was NOT a friendly experience so I just walked down the way to hopefully a friendlier environment.
