If you want GHETTO, this is the place. Went there only because it contains the closest Lenscrafters location & my son had to have glasses today. The mall itself is in a decent location but MANY stores are out of business. Lots of hood rats running through the mall yelling obscenities, playing grab ass etc. Food court is dismal. Some of the \"restaurants\" are run by quite the shady types with handwritten signs posted \"CASH ONLY.\" Unless you absolutely positively have to have something from here, I WOULD AVOID this dump.
