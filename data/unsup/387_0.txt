I don't actually go here...I recommend the guys hang out front and wait for the show to end.  Hoards of wedding shower ladies and strike teams of cougar MILFs roll out of this place ready to pounce the first male member of the species.  It's not even fair, like shooting fish in a barrel.\n\nOf course, I would never stoop to such lows.  It's just wrong.  However, if you have been striking out, check the show schedule!  :-D
