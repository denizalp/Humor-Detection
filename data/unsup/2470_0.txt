The line in this outlet mall Starbucks is usually ridiculous. It pisses me off that I pay almost a dollar more for my \"regular\" drink here than I do at Starbucks a few miles away. Do you really have to price gouge in a crappy outlet mall? On the plus side, there's wifi access here. I'll just remember to get my Starbucks drink fix before coming to shop here.
