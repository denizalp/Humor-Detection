Everything you could want from a place like this: great service from Olivier and his family, amazing food cooked perfectly with pleasantly simple, great tasting ingredients, and prices that will prove to you that not everything good in Vegas has to be stupid expensive. Owners passionate about serving great food with a smile, and it shows. And now they're opening weekend so we can actually go more regularly. Great place, hope they keep doing this forever.
