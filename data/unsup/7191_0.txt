Horrible.  Don't waste your time.  Rude staff, ridiculous security.  They wanted me to check my purse for a $10 fee.  Excuse me, it's a LV purse and I had over $800 cash in there.  Why did they want me to check it?  Omg, because I had a make up compact in there.  That's a security threat?  Bogus.  They are just wanting more money.  Suck it, Rehab.  I will pass my info on to everyone.  NEVER COME HERE!!!!!
