I went to this escape room with some friends there was 5 of us in totally. None of us had ever been to Paradox and we were all super pleased with how great the staff was. We spent most of the time with the manager because it was an after hours appointment and she was super helpful and awesome! We did their murder mystery room, their hardest, and surprise, surprise we failed but had a blast doing it. I 100% recommend this escape room it's by far the best in the Phoenix, Gilbert area!!!
