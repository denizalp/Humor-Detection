My son Lucas and I came in and were welcomed with a great attitude. My kid loves the BJJ and Muay Thai classes. He is only four and the curriculum they have for the kids is really engaging and informative. The coaches are really great, they know there skills and know how to talk and work with kids very well. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to work on there skill or learn some real discipline not just for fighting but for LIFE!!!!!
