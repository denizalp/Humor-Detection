This a review for the vegetarian bunch.  This place was fabulous.  We both had the vegetarian entree which was a combo place of many of their sides.  Not only was the food good but the waitstaff was excellent and helpful.  It was shame to see them not busy on a Friday night, but can only claim a low profile location for the reason. Go here before it becomes crowded!!
