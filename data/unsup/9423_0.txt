My coworkers and I have eaten here once weekly (at least) for over a year: it's a gem!\n\nThe food is great, the prices are reasonable, and ambiance is pleasant.\n\nI tend to order the cheese garlic knots as an appetizer for the table, two slices (either Big Kahuna or Da Works), a caesar salad, and a Mango tea. Berry good.\n\nThe service here isn't consistent, but it's not poor enough to override the strengths of the establishment. Pros vs cons . . . pros win!
