Meehh, gotta give it to Hakkasan for getting us in easily without glitch, with a couple drink tickets each.  Came on a random Thursday night, but apparently some famous DJ was spinning.  i heard the line up is always great, but it's just the overall experience.\n\ni'd say it's pretty awesome, if it existed like.. 7 years ago.  But with Light right down the strip, i'd rather visit XS\/ Tryst and not have to venture outside the Wynn.
