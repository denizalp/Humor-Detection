I am on the hunt for oysters, any way, any style.  I get odd cravings for iron (I'd say \"blood\" but that would be instant freak status... oh crap)... so I hunt for oysters or liver (I am the only person my age who eats this as far as I can tell... freak x 2).\n\nDeep fried oyster platter with fries, got 7 oysters and it was ok.  The meh rating is for the all other, rice & beans and the etouffee.  I'd only came back if I'm craving oysters in the area...
