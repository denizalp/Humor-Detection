Nice stuff, but bad experience. My mother-in-law is closing on a house in two weeks but they wouldn't sell her the furniture until she closed as they didn't want to hold it in their warehouse, even though she would have paid in full for it. So if you're planning a move to a new home, don't tell them about it!
