this is some serious taiwanese food. i can't believe it took someone so long to see how many chinese students there are at case, and that they should open a restaurant there!\nthe owner is the most friendly restaurant owner ever. my friend who is half chinese was trying to speak chinese with him, he was super patient, and when she got her leftovers to go, he topped it off. so so nice!\nwhen i went i got scallion pancakes, buffalo tofu, bbq ribs, pan fried dumplings, and popcorn chicken. all delicious. next i want to try the bbq tofu!
