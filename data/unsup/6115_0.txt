Huge club, love the outdoor space, great music and dj's.  Only downside was HUGE line and wait for drinks (bottle service totally worth it here!).  We tipped a bouncer to skip the humongous line, but still had to pay cover.  Definitely worth skipping the huge line.\n\nPlus side - I got to touch Paris Hilton's leg.
