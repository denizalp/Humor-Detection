I usually dislike burger king but when you are desperate and do not want to spend 25 bucks at a more expensive place in the airport this seems like a best bet. The burgers were not dry... the fries were fresh out of the fryer and crispy outside soft inside... boyfriend left and came back within 10 minutes... no gurgling upset stomach during the flight.. I guess we lucked out.
