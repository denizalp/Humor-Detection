La Diperie's teeny-tiny mix and match dip cones have made my little family's W Queen W life so much sweeter. If you want to live life king size, that's available, too. They have pretty much every type of dip, topping and magic you could ask for on your soft serve. \n\nThis mint green lover is instagrammable and it actually tastes good. No offense to the charcoal kids on the block, but is that actually a treat, or just a photo op? To be determined.
