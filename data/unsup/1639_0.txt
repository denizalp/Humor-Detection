If you are in the neighbourhood and have nothing better to do.. Oriental Centre is a good place to hang a little...\n\nNothing much there... nothing really worth buying... and on the higher floors a lot of the stores are empty.\n\nSad to see that bootlegged movies being sell here occasionally.. but if you are coming just for that, you might be disappointed!
