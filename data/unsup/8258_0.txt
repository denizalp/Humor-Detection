I loved the food here more than my companions did, but one thing we all agreed on was that whoever designed this place was BLOODY INSANE. OK they have this non-ironic crap '80s music playing, and these weird little uniforms on the staff, and the FUGLIEST wall decoration: photos of food wrapped up in clothes. \nPicture a shiitake mushroom leaning up against a high-heeled shoe, that sort of thing. Bogus.\nOh yeah, I'd definitely come back for the chow, but I'd wear blinders and ear plugs.
