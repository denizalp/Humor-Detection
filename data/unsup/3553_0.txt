Can't believe a restaurant would serve tomatoes that are green. This is embarrassing. Just throw away the tomatoes next time, we obviously won't be eating this salad. Also we ordered meatballs sliders and they gave us chicken parm sliders.\n\nOwner's reply to our review is a joke, blames supplier and doesn't address providing the wrong meal. If you can't provide a quality product then don't offer it on your menu. Doesn't even apologize for giving us the wrong item. One star seems very appropriate, I would give zero stars if that was an option.
