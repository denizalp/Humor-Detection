I do not know what all the four star ratings are about for this place. \n\nI ordered a salad and I got something out of the 1970s -- iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and chopped olives out of can. The lettuce was fresh but who wants to eat stuff like this??\n\nI ordered falafel. I ordered one with baba and mushrooms. The whole pita was drowning in baba. There was no balance to this dish. It was not enjoyable. \n\nI would not go back and I would not recommend you go there either.
