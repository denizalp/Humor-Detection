I've been dealing with St Andrews for many years and I'm very pleased with their service and understanding of my business needs.  They work with me when I've needed last minute requests or come up with solutions to many problems that i've encountered over the past years.  The meat quality is excellent and they have high standards and procedures in place.  Sometimes paying less doesn't always mean you will get that service or quality that you need.  Thank you St Andrews for your continued support.   Sharon - Jerk Joint
