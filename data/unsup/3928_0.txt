My BF and I finally decided to make the commitment and open a joint checking account for our bills. We booked an appointment with CT, who was highly recommended by friends. He walked us through everything he was doing and answered all of our questions. He made sure that we were comfortable with our decision and even gave us options for future investments. He's super funny, so it didn't even feel like we were there long. I would definitely recommend him for your banking needs. Thanks CT, you're awesome!
