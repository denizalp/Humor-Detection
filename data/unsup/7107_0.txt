I've been going to Tommy's for more than 30 years and haven't found anything like it anywhere else in the world.  While billed as a vegetarian restaurant there's plenty for my fellow carnivores to eat as well although there's enough on the menu to make you forget about meat.  The portions are generous, the service friendly and the environment is everything good about Coventry Village.\n\nOn your first trip to Tommy's make sure you save room for one of their thick creamy Milk Shakes.
