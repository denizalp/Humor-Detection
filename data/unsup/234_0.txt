Friendly bartender,  yes singular. And cheap,  cheap drinks. Our group had a vodka and cranberry, two tiger beers,  and a bud light for $13.25!\n\nIt's there's tigers everywhere and you can easily get lost coming back from the bathroom and end up on a Mexican grocery store but that's part of the fun right?  \n\nIt was turnt up as we arrived,  clearly they've got some following!
