Place is still awesome and Chris is the best bartender I have had the privilege of being served by. My drink is always ready as I walk in and not left empty till I decide to end my time there.\nThey do have a breakfast Menu. Please ask for it. Chris is good to offer it up. My mistake for not asking when I first tried food here. The food is incredible the staff is outstanding.
