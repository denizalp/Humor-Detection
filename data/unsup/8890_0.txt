I was leery about eating at a restaurant in an over populated area. Usually the service is so overwhelmed the food lack the quality that you would receive in another area. Fortunately,  I was wrong. The food, service and atmosphere was fantastic, in spite of the remodeling going on. But I'm not here to eat the walls.  I will be coming back, great job everyone.
