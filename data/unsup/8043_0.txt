If I could give negative stars to this place I would. Staff is the most disrespectful and rude I've had in Vegas. As a local who works in the industry I find it extremely unacceptable to give the kind of \"service\" they give at Blue Martini. \nHowever, if you're trying to pick-up desperate middle aged women, this is the spot!\n\n\nUpdate: 10 minutes after the above review, a cockroach ran across our table. Fortunately I have the reflexes of a cat and smashed it with one of Blue Martinis excellently durable menus. (Photo to follow)
