Nakama is a go-to Hibachi spot. While not overly pricey, the portions are ample to leave you satisfied without denting your wallet too much.\n\nIf you're hankering for good Hibachi food, definitely stop by Nakama. I've been here many times, and they consistently deliver a good meal with a good atmosphere and friendly staff to boot.
