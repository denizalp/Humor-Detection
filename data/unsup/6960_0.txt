I loved this place!! I went for my birthday and I had an amazing time. The food was really good sushi was fresh. But the best part about it was the chef!!! He made my night! I can't remember the last time I had so much fun going out to eat. But the server was rude and slow and I brought it to the attention of the chef and he got him together. I recommend the place almost daily at my job ( hotel) and everyone always thanks me! Highly recommend this place! Even the take out is great!
