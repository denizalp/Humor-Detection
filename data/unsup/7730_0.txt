This room is gross!!!! We just stayed at the cosmo for 2 nights, and wanted to try Planet Hollywood for the first time... I definitely regret it!!!! It's old and the smells are beyond nasty! They tried to cover up the smell with so much lysol that it makes us sick to stay in the room too long! Our sinuses are BURNING!!! The casino seems fun-ish and ok though.
