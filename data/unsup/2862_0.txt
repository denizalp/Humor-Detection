This is my favorite Sonic location and I have been going here for 15 years. The staff is always friendly and the service time is usually very quick. Today we ordered the new Double Stack burger with medium tots, they have a promotion to get this for $2.99. Disappointed doesn't even cover this burger. It is literally the size of a slider. We waited 15 minutes for two tiny burgers and soggy tots! I usually love sonic but this burger was a joke compared to the advertisement, and the wait time was extremely slow for such a disappointing meal.
