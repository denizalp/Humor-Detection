This place was very delicious. We decided to not order anything healthy and tried the Big Wac and animal fries and both were so good! I usually do not love vegan cheese but it tasted so good in both dishes. I am a long-time vegetarian and want to go vegan soon, so I hope to come here in the future, both to try other menu items and get some inspiration for recipes at home! It is so good.
