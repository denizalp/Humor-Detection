I went there for 6 months, the barbers don't put that much effort or thought in your cut. I noticed they were always more focused on getting to the next customer rather than really giving a great haircut.\n\nThere were numerous times I went there during their business hours and they were closed. Not just once but 3 times in a matter of 2 weeks.\n\nYeah it's decorated cool and they play metal music..but do you really want a bad haircut?
