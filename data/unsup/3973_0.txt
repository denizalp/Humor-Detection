A frequent visitor to Big Daddy's and Cantina 1511, this is one our restaurant stops on many weekends.  Breakfast is great on Saturdays and Sundays - pancakes are a hit with the kids, while I like the egg scrambles and jalepeno bacon.  For lunch and dinner you can't go wrong with many of the eclectic gourmet burgers or build your own salads.  Service is typically good and the patio is always popular in the warmer months.
