Definitely better than the R&T north of I-10.  The service is so-so but the food is delicious.  I like their fajitas.  I'm still waiting for the \"perfect\" Mexican food place on our side of town but this will do until then!\n\nI rated both location 3 stars.  Although the food is better here, I think their service lacks.  It's not horrible, just not very good.
