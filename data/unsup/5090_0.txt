I stayed here for the weekend while being at the Pure Aloha Festival watching dancers compete and performing with my group. The rooms were nice suite style. They didn't let us ask for more then 2 extra pillows but oh well.\nOverall they keep the rooms clean and tidy. They also have a shuttle that can take you to the strip without having to walk all the way over there. Believe me I did it and it wasn't a short walk! So if you are in heels take a taxi or the shuttle:))
