I don't know what these bad reviews are really about. First off what do you want for 13 bucks? I got a soup and large felafel that was made fresh. I never have been a fan of felafel but this was amazing!\n\nI think they are under new management but I have been coming here for ober a decade and still am in love with that lentil soup.
