0 stars was not an option... I came in looking to upgrade to a 2013-14 SRT Charger and this IDIOT that barley spoke english treated me like I was joking. I asked for someone else and was kept waiting for 35 minutes. I may not look like somebody that has $50,000 to spend on a car but looks can be deceiving. fuck these people!
