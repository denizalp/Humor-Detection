We had the laksa (SO good!), Mee Siam (good), and honey chicken (not bad but not something I'd order again).  My pick-up order was ready on time and the staff was courteous. I didn't get much of a look around due to my accompanying hyper toddler but the place looked very spacious and much more modern than I had expected. Great place!
