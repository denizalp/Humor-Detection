Talk about a random find. This place is right behind Soyo and the new Windmill library. Who knew?\n\nThey hold monthly food fairs to raise moneys for their mortgage. Coz even the monks gots bills to pay. I stopped by for some Pad Thai, some sort of lychee drink, and some desserts. The food's not mind-blowing, but it's a nice way to spend your Sunday morning and support our local culture. You are welcome to take off your shoes and go inside the monastery.\n\nFor their event schedule, visit http:\/\/www.chaiyacmm.org\/.
