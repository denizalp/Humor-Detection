Ate here twice for breakfast. Ordered the same thing (Avocado Scramble) each time. The second time, the serving size was half of what I received the first time. The service is inattentive. On the second visit, the server didn't offer cream or sugar for my coffee, and when I requested a refill, she just brought another full mug, so I had one and half mugs of coffee sitting there. Hopefully the service will get better, as it seems like a nice addition to McFarland.
