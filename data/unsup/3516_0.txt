Sat at the bar on a Friday night, the place gets really busy so I would suggest a reservation. Had the French Dip with fries, the sandwich is packed with flavorful meat and the fries were crispy. My partner had the meatloaf which came with whipped potatoes which I thought were too runny for my liking. Dark atmosphere and very loud when we were there.
