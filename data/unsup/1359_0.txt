I ask the chef who was wearing a cap about wifi password on May 1 ,2018,and her attitude was so rude.maybe she was busy at that time ,but her attitude were so unprofessional. I asked her \"coud you type the password for me and she did .And after that,she throw my I phone on the counter strongly.\nShe need to lean about what is customer service and hospitality.\nThank you for your ruining my first trip to montreal.
