I have a mild obsession with this place. I highly recommend the guac, white queso and blood orange margarita (by the pitcher). Worth every penny and happy hour is key! But just know if you show up for happy hour you have to sit at the bar or a high top table. Which means you can't get happy hour prices at the low top tables. Don't be sad when you see your bill.
