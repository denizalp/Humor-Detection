The place is interesting, the music is nice but doesn't correspond with the theme (music: American rock) it would've more suited for this place to be a dinner due to its configuration and the tunes they blast. \nFood wise, okay ish, lots of salad in the dishes kinda feel like it's cover up which is to bad because less is more. \nNice staff, but yeah the food is not that amazing but for the price it's reasonable
