My appointment was at 3pm and I got a flu and fever and felt horrible so I called once I woke up at about 10am. Was told to still come. Then I said sure if I feel better I'll still come. Then I felt really bad after lunch, called in to cancel the appointment. Then was told to pay for $50 dollar fine for emergency cancellation. I asked even thought the client is dying? Was told that \"no you are not dying\" wow. Will never ever go here again and will tell entire office not to come here!!!!
