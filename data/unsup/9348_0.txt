I scheduled a service appointment the day before for 8:00am the next day.  I explicitly detailed what I wanted done and they said, \"No Problem\" I arrived on time but they had no record of my appointment nor any recollection of my call.  They did have plenty of excuses.  This place sucks and the functionaries are idiots.  This is the first time in 30 years I bought an American made car.  Never ever again.
