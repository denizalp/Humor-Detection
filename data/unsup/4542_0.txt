They seem to run out of everything I ever pop in for \n1) no Janelle Monae Dirty computer cd,\n2) no spicy pickles,\n3) no clementine Izze's in the Glass 4pk but they've got 20 Pomegranate Izze's on hand. \n\nEither way, c'est la v√≠a. But with the traffic, some good folks that provide great service then just some okay folks with bleh service ..they have earned 2.5 stars but I'm generous with the curve. 3 stars it is. \n\nI'm not an employee, a la Bill Burr routine or bit, so I don't want to do self checkout ... period.
