Went here on a Friday night, as many of the reviews attest to, atmosphere was very neat. Kind of like a rennaisance dungony kind of feel in a very cool way. I like that dance and music was seperate from main bar so you don't have to yell to talk to ppl.\nSurprisingly, was not so happening vibrant crowd the night I went. It was clearly an off night.\nDrinks were reasonably priced and service was good. Ima be goin back and get all mideival on someone!
