Let's face it; Home improvement warehouses are necessary. \nI am the typical handy homeowner and have  been to almost every home improvement warehouse in the Phoenix area.\nThere are knowledgeable staff in all of them, but a helpful AND knowledgeable AND cheerful AND friendly staff is uncommon. \nThis Home Depot is packed full of staff with those qualities. \nI go out of my way to shop at this HD location.\n\nSpecial \"props\" to the man in the attached photo who helped me today and is the reason that I decided to take the time to post this review.
