It's not no Jim Chai Kee, but it's pretty good.\n\nI've been here multiple times, however I haven't gone to their flagship location at the langham plaza on Kennedy. \n\nThe soup base is okay, kinda salty. But who doesn't like salt? LOL\n\nThe wontons I found had a lot of shrimp and some filler. But the shrimp is still the star.\n\nThe beef was good, nice and tender.\n\nOverall, it's pretty good. I'd come again :)
