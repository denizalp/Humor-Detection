I have to confess something about Villa and that's that, while I love their souvlaki and think their tzatiki sauce is really top-hole, the real reason I keep returning is probably those fantastic round fries. \n\nYes, the ones I can probably get at any grocery store. The ones I could order at a dozen other restaurants. The frozen ones.\n\nI even admit that I occasionally profess to be a foodie, but I love these fries so much that I cannot even muster the appropriate level of shame. They're just super salty, super crispy and super good.
