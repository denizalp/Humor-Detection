I called one afternoon, asking about getting a tube replaced on my bike. The person on the phone told me that they'd be able to do the repair on the spot, assuming the store wasn't busy.\n\nI came in two hours later, expecting the repair to be done on the spot. The store was empty, but the person there told me they couldn't do the repair.\n\nI travelled across the city to get there. Why waste your time with a place like this?
