Our family frequently visits this location, we never had any issues before our last dining expirence. We ordered the deluxe oysters, served with shrimp; hindsight shrimp should be consumed only when thouroughly cooked. One hospital visit later, benadryl and antibiotics we now know not to order this dish again.
