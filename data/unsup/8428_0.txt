Worst place I have ever been to.  The service makes dicks last resort look like a welcoming committee.   I have felt more welcome with monkeys flinging poo at me at the zoo.  Some people shouldn't be bartenders.... Some people should live in the mountains.   Save your money and throw it on the floor because they will take your order, give you something else and blame it on you.   Once upon a time... I wanted a drink... then I came here.  I'd rather be Mormon!
