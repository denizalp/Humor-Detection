I am a frequent regular at Perk Up because of the delicious coffee\/drinks\/desserts,outstanding, friendly baristas, and relaxing environment. It's a great place to catch up with a friend,relax,read or have a study party in the suburbs of Vegas. \n\n I recommend the black\/white cookie, *Highlands*, or a regular coffee
