I really like it here! My pedicure lasted three weeks and the only reason I came back was because it had grown out. Today I tried to get the hot stone massage pedicure but we switched it to a regular pedicure half way through because the wax was way too hot for me. I will definitely be back because 30 for a pedicure that last so long is a great deal.
