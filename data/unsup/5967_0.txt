They probably want to rename themselves to douche on wheels! \nI actually really liked the selection at this bike store but the staff here is ridiculous. I went in on three separate occasions and each time I practically had to drag the self-important staff away from their cash area powwow to get questions answered.\n\nNot once was I approached by someone while browsing, or offered to take a test drive. Of all the bike shops I went to they had by far the worst customer service. \n\nWhen you sell $400-$2000 merchandise you might want to be a bit more attentive.
