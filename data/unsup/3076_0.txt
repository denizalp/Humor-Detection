Spent our morning hiking South Mountain and have been wanting any reason to try this place out. We loved it! Got the turkey sandwich, roasted chicken sandwich, chili, lemonade and a PB&J sandwich for the kids. We all thought everything was delicious! And refills are free. Heeeeeeeey   the service was great. The oatmeal cookie I snuck in last minute was so yummy. And it was really nice to walk around and explore. For a second there my husband and I thought we were legit photographers taking adorable pics of our kids.
