Great variety of not-so-great food. There are much better meal options in the area.\n\nThe desserts looked fantastic although it tasted as though they were missing all sorts of sugar, spice, and anything nice. \n\nI'm generously giving it 3 stars for the variety although that should be assumed since it is a buffet.\n\nYikes MGM.
