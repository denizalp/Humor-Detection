Meh. Typical BT place. There is no AC in here so on a hot day it sucks to wait for your drink. You will literally melt. \n\nNo aloe vera when I came here .. I feel like a BT with no aloe vera is like a McDonalds with no French fries. \n\nAnyways, 2 stars.. Just because there is another BT place on main, this one is slightly better than that one. Fruit slush was okay as well.
