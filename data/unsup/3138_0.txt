Completely unreliable.  Make wonderful promises then fail to return phone calls.  Per their policies, vehicle must remain at repair shop until claim is approved.  Getting the claim approved takes 5 days plus.  Offices close at 1:30PST on Fridays, of course they are not open on weekends.  Fully intend on paying out of pocket for my relatively minor (but covered) repair and suing them in local small claims court for costs plus associated fees.  This is when Nevada Service by Publication laws come in very handy.\n\nRun and hide from these clowns.
