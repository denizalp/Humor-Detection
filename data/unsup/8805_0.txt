Being first time home buyers, we really needed a real estate agent that is patient and knowledgeable, and Victor exceeded our expectations. We were able to find our perfect home with Victor's help. He and his team worked around the clock to make sure all of our needs were met. We had a complicated road to get to closing and Victor was there every step of the way. We highly recommend him!!
