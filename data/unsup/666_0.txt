This place was simply delicious. Originally planned on getting Thai but drove by and decided to switch it up a bit and so glad we did. Hands down best Indian food I've had. The butter chicken was amazing and the owner even sat down at our table to discuss the menu with us to decide what to get. Will definitely be going back soon!
