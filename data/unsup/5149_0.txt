A must see if you're in Vegas!!  It's extremely close to Vegas.  You have to pay to get in, less than 10 bux.  It might be better to go with kids during cooler temperatures. Extremely Beautiful scenery.  Have been a couple times, they do need to work on the trails though.  Good times though very beautiful.
