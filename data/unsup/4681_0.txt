I have an Envirotec I bought at Spencers TV and Appliance. Softener and reverse osmosis. Had previous softener that worked good but lasted 2 years paid the same for Envirotec to replace it and it has lasted 6 years with no problems as it is a much better quality unit. I am waiting today to have a filter change for the reverse osmosis and just thought of how great they have been and how nice to give a quick \"Thank you\" in public.
