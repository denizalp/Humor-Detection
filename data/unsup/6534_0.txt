This place is loud. Sit outside if you prefer not to yell at your companions. But omg, what a great and ever changing selection of beers on tap! The staff are pros. The kitchen is pretty fast, even when there's a large crowd. And the food is excellent. The 810 is probably the best turkey, ahem, *smoked* turkey sandwich I've ever had. Flat bread pizzas are excellent. You can't really go wrong here. Don't think too hard about it. Order what sounds good the day that you're there and prepare to enjoy yourself.
