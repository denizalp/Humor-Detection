I have mixed feelings about this place. \n\nThe food itself is delicious. The negative part is the portions are extremely TINY! I also didn't care for the price for such small portions. For the price I paid, I felt like I should have gotten a. decent meal, when in reality it felt like I got 2 half-portioned sized appetizers.\n\nGreens and Proteins is much better in my opinion.
