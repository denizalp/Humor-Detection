Small shop in a strip mall but I've always had good service.  Our visit today wasn't any different.  Friendly, efficient, and accurate!  Can't ask for much more.  The tables could be wiped down but since the line has been non-stop since we got here in just going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they just haven't had time.  That's important though, Starbucks!  Don't let it become a habit.  Otherwise, keep up the great work!
