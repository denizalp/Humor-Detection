My first time here but I love these places. For $7 you get a good exterior was and mostly dry (bring a shami for touch up).  The reason I prefer this to the full service places is that you also get free vacuum and a shaded place to clean out your interior.  YOU will always do a better job in 30 minutes than you would waiting 30 minutes for the full service place.  Bring some simple car care supplies and do a better job for $7 than you get for $25 at most places.
