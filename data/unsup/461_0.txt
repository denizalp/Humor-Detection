Nothing Fancy \n\nLucie's Sage and Sand Bar is located across the street from Luke Airforce Base. Lucie's is one of those \"dive\" type bars. Nothing fancy here. \n\nLucie's Sage and Sand Bar has a nice outdoor area with \"backyard\" style games which I enjoy. There's  a lot to do at Lucie's, from the giant \"beer pong\" styled volleyball, pool, dancing, and even \n\nThe drink prices are amazing and the staff are very friendly, not a bad place to grab a beer.
