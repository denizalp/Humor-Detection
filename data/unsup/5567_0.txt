This place is very spacious and nice looking place. Location is good and is attractive set up. They loose a star because the chair on the outside are so incredibly uncomfortable i left with my back hurting :( so sit on the inside or bar. The food was very tasty, one of the better spaghetti and meatballs iv had in a while. Also tasted there pizza. which was so super delicious! It is a must get. Prices are average cant complain. Would return.
