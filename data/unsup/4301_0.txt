We ordered a large pizza for takeout so I can't really comment on the dining experience. But I can safely say the pizza itself is fantastic. This pizza tasted so fresh and full of flavor. The cheese was great quality (real Wisconsin cheese), the sauce had a good level of different flavors, and the chicken was good as well. The crust was thin but crispy and fresh.\n\nOverall, a great pizza with a lot of flavor. I would highly recommend it.
