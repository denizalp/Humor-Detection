This is definitely the place to go for a real Coney fix.  The dogs have a nice snap to them.  The Coney sauce is nice and simple as it should be, and the fries are the real deal.  Anxious to try their burgers!  Easy to see why this place is successful!  Simple Concept that Northern and Midwest transplants to AZ will always support and appreciate!
