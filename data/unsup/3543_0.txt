This place stays alive becase there are hungry jurors trapped in the basement of the grand jury room who need food.  The carpet hasn't been cleaned since probably the Nixon era.  And the food is pretty standard.  That said, everyone has to go there at least once so that they say they have a) survived it b) been there c) surprisingly crave it.  Most people pick a, but some surprisingly pick c.  It's an old-school Phoenix thing and you have to support that!
