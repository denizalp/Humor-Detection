Random anecdote:\nOn Sunday morning after a night of partying, I woke up and was confused about where I was, what had happening and how I got there. Was I still drunk? Yeah. I think I still was.\n\nThen, I realized I fell asleep with my contacts on so I walked to the bathroom to take them off. Somehow I managed to wash my contact down the drain :(\n\nOh, Vegas....you win this round.\n----\n\nThe location is awesome with easy access to everything. Staying at the towers basically offers everything you need at a decent price.
