Daiquiri Ice! This is my daughter's all-time favorite frozen treat. We were so excited to discover a B & R in Glendale. On special occasions, we spoil ourselves. I love the Jamocha ice cream or strawberries and cream. The other members of our family love the sherbets: rainbow, Wild and Reckless. Where do they get these names? I love the sugar cones. The others like the cake cones. I have never tried the waffle cone, but one day, I will.
