A decent brunch option off of the strip.  Called ahead and arrived to a set table in the side rooms. Arrived with 10 family members. Very friendly staff. Kitchen was quick to serve. Food was decent. Not the best omlette or steak and eggs. But, it did the trick after a night out. Decor was chic. I could see this place being booked for events. Something to consider for a nice lunch or dinner.
