I ordered a oxtail lunch today which came with rice and peas, also cabbage on the side. This was the worst oxtails I have ever tasted. No flavor,  they had actually tasted like they had been burnt during cooking.  No meat on them, and super fatty. I should have taken a pic. So basically you can say I really didn't have oxtails, just all sides. The only thing that was decent that I tasted today was the side of cabbage. Waste of money and totally disappointed.
