I've used this service around 10-12 times, and all of my experiences have been positive. The reason I prefer Lyft is that they're more reliable than the local cab services, courteous, and an overall better value.\n\nI've never once encountered any kind of sexual harassment or rude behavior in any way, shape, or form.Also, make sure to tip your driver!
