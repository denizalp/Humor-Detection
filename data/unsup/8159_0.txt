It seemed like a nice place...bar maid was incredibly nice. Guy with white hair in the back watching me like a hawk..don't mind..get ready to leave and him and a couple buds wait in the parking lot....parked there plow truck behind mine as they wait in a car to see what I will do....Weeelll they left me some room....snow doesn't stop me....be careful they are trying to set people up...despite their efforts I escaped.....I'm not sure what is going on but BEWARE if your not one of them
