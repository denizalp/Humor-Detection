Great experience on opening night! We had two Jaegerschnitzel (one each pork and chicken) and one Gorgonzola Schitzel. Sides were fries, Spaetzle and some absolutely fantastic cream of broccoli soup. Everything was delicious- Schnitzel were all tender and perfectly cooked, fries were excellent, the Spaetzle was gorgeous. We all had the same desert, the vanilla pudding with whipped cream and fresh fruit (kiwi for now)- delectable, not too sweet. Some Koelsch and grapefruit Radler and a couple of dry Rieslings. Service was friendly but given it was opening night quite slow, but I'm sure they'll work it out.
