This review is for the Breakfast Brunch on 12\/24 only - at Christmas pricing. We got here at about 1pm. And yeah... $42 a person... for brunch. There was nothing here that justified the pricing!\n\nI only had the Korean Kalbi, top sirloin, a slice of turkey, a cocktail shrimp in a shot glass, a piece of pork belly. And dessert. That's it! I didn't want anything from the omelet bar... It was past 2pm! Where's the seafood... The crab legs... Nothing! $42?! Serious?!
