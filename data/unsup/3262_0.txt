Here's my thing when it's NOT that busy and I have to wait 15 min for a simple buffalo chicken wrap I have a problem. For the price of the wrap  it's decent could add a little bit more \"mmmph\" in the wrap... I don't knock anyone's hustle however, there's chipotle next door and in n out across the street where I could be happier with a protein burger....just saying. On the bright positive side the owner is VERY NICE and welcoming, this place is very clean, nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and entertainment while you sit down and eat
