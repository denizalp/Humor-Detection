Ordered the seafood linguini. The waiter was very nice and personable. Even though the restaurant seemed full, the orders came quickly. We sat on the patio near the street so it was a bit loud but a nice environment. The pasta itself was great. The sauce wasn't too heavy and the mussels and other seafood was a very good complement to the dish. I've had many seafood linguini dishes and this one did not disappoint.
