Love this place!\n\nSamuel our server was great! We came in for the lobster rolls and they were amazing! The tavern is beautiful and to the point. Great for date nights or to even impress a first date! My fianc√© and I can not wait to come back!! This might be a weekly hang out spot for us :) next to try : Killer corn beef
