This place is disgustingly dirty. The tables aren't cleaned properly, the floors are greasy, the washrooms are atrocious. \nHowever, the food is decent but extremely questionable with their lack of hygiene. Most of all, the owner of this restaurant asked me to pay tip when I went up to the counter to pay my bill.  Obviously the owner collected all the tip and I refused to give him the tip but instead I went back to the table and gave it to the server. I would never come back to this horrible restaurant ever again.
