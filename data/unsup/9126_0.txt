Have seen WoL at a few places and always seem to have a line so decided to try it today.  Had a combo of Chicken and Cilantro Dumplings which were very good.  The main course was Spicy Chicken Fried Rice and was not spicy and really below average.  Trying to figure out why there is a line for below average fried rice.
