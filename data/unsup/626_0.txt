Fatburger is the perfect place to drunkenly eat burgers at 4 am. I think this will be one of my fondest memories during my Vegas weekend -- drunkenly chatting with you friends over greasy food... I particularly am thankful for my drunken munchies here because it prevented a terrible hangover (cue angel choir singing). \n\nThis place isn't exactly the yummiest but it is when you're hungry at 4 am.
