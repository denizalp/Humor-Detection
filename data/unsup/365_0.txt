worst experience trying to cancel my case. Jason Flory at X 399 the biggest unprofessional Jerk in the world with complete lack of any people skills. Doesn't even check his own voice mail and when his assistant is out of the office they don't get checked. Had to drive all the way down there to talk to him face to face, dressed like a slob, wrinkled suit. I do not recommend this firm to anyone for anything.  we have been trying for over a month to get our $ back
