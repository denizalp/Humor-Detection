One of my fav places to eat in the valley!!!! You have to have the jade chicken and pork fried rice!!!!!! MUST have!!! You can sample all of their food before ordering which is amazing!!!!!!! They atmosphere is not amazing..... Whole in the wall in a strip mall but the food can't be beat!!! Promise!!!
