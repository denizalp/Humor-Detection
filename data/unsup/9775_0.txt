This is authentic, delicious Bangladeshi food from the Indian subcontinent. The biryani and lamb kebabs are a must. Vegetable\/non-meat dishes were okay not great but the meat dishes are what gets one raving. 1 star deducted because it is a tiny place and gets very warm and stuffy. Especially when the weather is nicer, it would be pretty uncomfortable. Good for trying out several new items. Their buffet has more items than other places and is worth it.
