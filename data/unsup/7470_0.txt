This is a must stop for me when I'm in town and need some grease in my diet. O's supported my food addiction my freshman year at Pitt.  Back in the day we affectionately called it the Dirty \"O.\" Very large menu but the hot dogs and fresh cut French fries are the way to go. If you are extremely hungry, hungover or high this is your place. It's also a bar, and gets very busy on Friday and Saturday nights.\n\n* love this place but stay away from the restrooms....you have been warned.
