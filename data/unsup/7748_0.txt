March 8th 2017, I pull into the drive thru with 1 car in front of me at 12:40.  I didn't get to the window until 1:12!  Over a 30 minute wait!!!  I asked the worker why I just waited over 30 minutes in the drive through and she explained the manager just left and they were short staffed and couldn't handle the order before me.  THE MANAGER LEFT at 12:30pm!! In the middle of the lunch rush! Unbelievable.  If you are the manager of this location I would love to talk to you pronto.
