Leaving a short note.. I continue to love this place for the all round supportive, you can do it environment. It's not the most technical toughest routine pole studio I have been to but certainly wins in the feel good factor... this does a lot for everyday women of all shapes and sizes to pursue their passion..and Laura is behind it all, the sweetest lady ever!
