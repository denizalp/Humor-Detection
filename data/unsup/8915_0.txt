Very disappointed.  Had acrylic nails applied, tech rushed thru the job. 6 days later looks like I need a fill already and nails don't go completely to the edge on the sides.y daughter had her nails done at the same time, tech argued with her about what she wanted and she wound up with bubbles under 4 if her nails.  We WONT be going back.\n\nP.s. They speak English, but only if they have to.
