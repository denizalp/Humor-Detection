DO NOT DRINK THE DRAFT BEER.  We were visiting over pride and went in the Monday after for some drinks.  I ordered a pitcher of draft beer and drank it.  Within four hours I was vomiting and not able to leave the bathroom for four days.  The draft beer was the only thing that day my partner and I didn't share so it had to have been the draft beer.
