Great bar. \n\nThis is a place you should go with your friends when you want to play something at same time when you want to drink. They offer old Nintendo games, something you can't easily find right now. They got most old popular games. As long as you order something to drink or eat, you can play the game for free.\n\nThey also got promotion night (discount on drink or food like nachos)\n\nOnce again, good place.
