Read the other one and three star reviews about the waiter!!   Surreal and confrontational 'fine dining' experience.  \n\nWe almost left when we pulled up because the neighborhood is very bad and the restaurant looks like a run down house.\n\nI only had bread and wine because I was so disturbed by Keifers bitter attitude and confrotational nature that I declined to eat my entree.  \n\nThis is the perfect place to go if you have had a terrible week and you want to take it out on a true nutjob who lives for arguing.
