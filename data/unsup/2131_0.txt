This should be 2 1\/2 stars. Dirty inside ... ALL TABLES WERE DIRTY..she did come and wipe one table down right off on to the bench seat and floor and it wasn't just a little bit of food. Not sure why only one table. The  same lady took our order and was not overly friendly. When you pay they ask for a tip really for what they don't serve you it's like a McDonald's ok maybe not McDonald's wipes there tables down. I will say the breakfast burrito was not to bad..
