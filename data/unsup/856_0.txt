Stopped here with a couple of friends, for a relaxing night, with some drinks. Agree with most of the reviews, that the environment is that older diner style, a lot of stuff going on with the neon lights, and flowers\/trees, but i think that it goes with the whole old diner vibe! \nHad a coronita Margarita that was delicious and paired it with the Peppermill sampler that as well was delicious!
