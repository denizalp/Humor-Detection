It was funny in parts.. though him calling gays disgusting was pretty lame. Plus before the show they show audience members on the big screen and put \"funny\" captions.. like \"homo\" for one guy.. I was wishing they would have shown my bf and I.. we would have started making out! Now that would have been funny!!\n\nIf you HAVE to check it out go to Goldstar.com.. you can get discount tickets there.
