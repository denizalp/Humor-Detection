The decor & ambiance were wonderful but we were not impressed with the food...\n\nWe ordered Eva's Tortilla Soup, Caesar Salad, Mac & Cheese, Pan Seared Pacific Salmon, & Plantains Con Cr√®me.\n\nThe best thing we ate was the Mac & Cheese! Don't waste your time here! Sorry i feel bad about this review but it is what it is.
