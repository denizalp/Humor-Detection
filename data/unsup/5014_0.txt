I have spent a lot of time researching pizzerias in Montreal... reading reviews, going to recommended places.... but so far, the pizza here is by far one of the best in Montreal.  The atmosphere is very welcoming, staff friendly and efficient- there is a lovely selection of wines, sometimes with incredibly good buys with their private imports...  All around I love this place and would say truly, one of the best Neapolitan style pizzas in the city.  Highly recommend.\n\nNow.... if only they had an appetizer of fresh mozzarella..........
