1 star for manager Bill who proudly proclaimed that, \"as a manager, my job is not to make decisions for people but to enforce the company policy.\" - WOW! Thanks Bill! You're a real winner, and really helpful to boot.\n\n5 stars for the Store Manager Dave who apparently shares a different view of what being a manager means. Thanks to him, I'll definitely return at some point in the future!
