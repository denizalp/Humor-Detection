This place is terrible.. AVOID,  AVOID, AVOID , unless  you're  looking to get an INFECTION! !!! they use the same  pumice on EVERYONE. .. Not sure if even  disinfected  properly.DISGUSTING!!!   I wont be surprised if health inspection shuts them down. The guy there, (I'm assuming is the boss) tries to be nice with small talk but reeks  of cigarettes. Don't be fooled by the exterior  design... they are not all the rave..
