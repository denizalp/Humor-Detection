I am going to jump on the \"this bar sucks\" bandwagon. I am not fond of the bar, the staff or the cliental. My experience was a crowded bar where I had to push myself up against every Tom, Dick and Hairy just to make my way through the crowd. I even got my butt grabbed by some random guy and when I turned around to shoot him a dirty look he said, \" pass that on to your friend with the nice ass.\" Thanks- real boost for the self esteem buddy.\n\nAnyways- don't go there unless your desperate.
