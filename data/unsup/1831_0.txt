This Walmart looks and is set up exactly like the Walmart neighborhood store that I usually go to but at this location there is a strong fish odor near the entrance. \n\nThe employees here that were stocking the shelves were not too friendly at all. None of them said hi and one of the guys was even throwing boxes around. Come on now, there are customers walking down the aisle, have some respect.\n\nThe one star that I gave is for the cashier who was very nice and friendly and she was the only employee there who said hi.
