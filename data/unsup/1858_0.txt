Rates go up for no reason, closed or close early on non-holidays, unprofessional personnel, \"hospital-like\"  atmosphere; horrible daycare, not even close to a pre-school (your child will learn nothing here). In short, this establishment is merely an expensive baby-sitting factory that is poorly disguised as a pre-school \/ daycare.
