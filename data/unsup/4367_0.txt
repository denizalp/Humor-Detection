Few times I am surprised when it comes to brkfst. Eggs are eggs. This place really rocks. Stopped by on the way home to LA. \n\nBest steak & Eggs for the hubby. Kids loved the pot of bread. I recommend the corned beef hash extra crispy. The french press coffee a plus! \n\nTake the family. U won't be disappointed. Ask for Lisa. Just the sweetest waitress ever. The pjs are a cute touch.
