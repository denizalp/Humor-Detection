Worst haircut ever. Also the group here were super unprofessional and chatty amongst themselves as my hair stylist was cutting my hair. Maybe he was distracted by their gossip and just totally screwed up my hair? \n\nNEVER AGAIN! I'm getting a haircut somewhere else now to fix this mess on my head.\n\nAlso I want my money back. The lady on the phone said $50 for a women's haircut but the dude who cut my hair said its $75...so irritating. I paid money for the worst haircut of my life. Feel scammed.
