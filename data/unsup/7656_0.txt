I ordered for pickup from this location and I am very, very disappointed. I was excited to try the vegan chicken nachos, but when I got home, I saw there was no chick'n!! I ate them anyways, because the vegan cheese was pretty tasty, but halfway through I found a very long dark hair, presumably from the host who gave me my food. Thumbs all the way down!
