Alright. So the dumplings are pretty lit. Try it. See for yourself, read the other reviews, taste the soup. \n\nBut that's not what this review is about.\n\nThis review is about those that dip their soup filled xiaolongbaos in soy sauce instead of vinegar. It's really an atrocity that the option is even provided. Let me tell you, the soy dip is the inferior dip. It overwhelms the taste of these juicy dumplings, slight gaminess of the pork and delicate soup flavour with the extra taste of unnecessary sweetness.\n\nDo the world justice and dip your xiaolongbaos in black vinegar.
