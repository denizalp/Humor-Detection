Newtek is unreliable, slow to respond, and when you do get a response it usually does not solve the problem. I'm a pretty patient guy, but after lots of mistakes, a horrible support ticket system that lands you with a new tech after every reply (maybe this is why they're called \"Newtek\"?) I couldn't take it anymore.  They have some areas to improve before I would ever consider doing business with them again.
