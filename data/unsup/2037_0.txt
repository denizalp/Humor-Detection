Looking forward to some fried chicken and bourbon concoctions at Yardbird tomorrow evening! Last time we were in Vegas we had gone to the \"just ok\" Mario Batali restaurant across the way. We noticed Yardbird was packed and people were having a good time. We went there the following day and were not disappointed! I remember the friendly staff as well as the fried green tomatoes, cornbread and fried chicken. Of course we tested some specialty drinks. Hoping we have just as good of an experience tomorrow!
