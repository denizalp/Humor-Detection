First time at this location.  Ate lunch Monday.  I ordered \"J\" which is a chicken burrito covered with their creamy\/spicy cream cheese sauce served with rice and beans.  Really delicious dish and HUGE.  I took 1\/2 home and ate it for dinner.  Adorable and pleasant waiter - great service.  Chips and water at our table within 1 minute of sitting down.  Restaurant clean.  No complaints!
