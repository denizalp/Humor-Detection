During a recent vacation in Phoenix we had both a casual dinner and lunch on the terrace at this restaurant. Both were outstanding. Service was excellent and cheerful. The food was totally appropriate. My wife and I would highly recommend sitting outside where umbrellas shaded us from the sun and kept things cool. Very nice restaurant in a very nice hotel!
