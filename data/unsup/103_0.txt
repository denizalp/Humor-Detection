We stopped here eat as part of pub crawl around the area, the male host informed us we were being too loud and hinted at us to leave. Luckly for us, we didn't get to eat the terrible food. To bad for them, our bill at the next stop was around $500... \n\nThey should be nicer to large groups of people.
