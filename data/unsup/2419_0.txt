My wife and I went there for anniversary last night.  The food was phenomenal absolutely delicious. What made it very very special however was the ma√Ætre d' or manager named Chris.  He made it absolutely clear that our comfort and total satisfaction was the most important thing to him.  He made us feel very special and welcomed.  We recommend this restaurant very highly and we look forward to coming back for another fantastic dining experience.
