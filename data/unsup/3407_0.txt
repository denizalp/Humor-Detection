I celebrated my 21st birthday dinner here at Lucky Foo's and it was amazing! the food was excellent and they had some really fun cocktails. The staff was also really nice and answered all of our questions and the owner is a super awesome and friendly guy!  My friends, family, and I all  had an amazing time and the next time we are in Vegas we will definitely be coming back!
