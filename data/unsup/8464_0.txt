Quiet.  At least it is at four in the morning, when my neighbors are, you know, \"cooking.\"\n\nSpacious.  55-gallon drums of chemicals fit easily through the guest room doors.\n\nEnergy:  Very, VERY easy to stay awake.  For days.  There is just, I don't know, something in the air?\n\nTweaking:  I doubt there could be any more tweaking that could be done, here.\n\nMethy:  It is pretty damn methy.
