Yeah there are lots of weird folks trying to get money from the government and yes they like to shout at the poor workers in the windows but MAKE AN APPOINTMENT PEOPLE!!  It's not that hard.  If you have an appointment they come and take you away from all the drones sitting there waiting to a nice office in the back where you can have a quiet discussion.  My appointments have all happened as scheduled.  You get weird looks from the folks that have been waiting for an hour before you even walked in the door.
