Empty soulless desert dirt box. This city has everything for sale and not much of actual value. The psychology that went into designing and executing this all consuming money trap is as impressive as it is pernicious. You can do everything under one roof if you like, everything except improve your humanity. If you have a soul or a brain I recommend never visiting this garbage city.
