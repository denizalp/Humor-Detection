The bad reviews puzzle me. This is a *free* show set inside the spectacular Caesar's Palace Forum Shops.\n\nNo, I wouldn't pay $30 for it. No, it's not as great as Disney or Universal Studios as one rocket scientist reviewer noted (are those free?). But it's a free 8 minute show. You waste more than 8 minutes watching commercials during a typical 30 minute brain-numbing sitcom.\n\nIt's not a \"let's set aside a day to check out\" attraction, but it is a \"We're already here so let's spend 8 minutes watching this free show\" attraction.
