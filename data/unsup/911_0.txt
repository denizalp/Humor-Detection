Never again !\n\nThe fish here is as cheap as you can get, pre-fabricated fish squares that are slightly better than McDonald's filet-o-fish. The shrimp that I ordered were flat, like pounded out flat, who knows what this crap was. The fries  were limp and flavorless. The only thing that made this any better was the \"special sauce\", which I believe to be hot sauce & ketchup.\n\nThis place is SUPER cheap and the food reflects why. There is no reason I will ever eat here again, peace out Pete's !
