College students on a budget? You can squeeze 9-10 people in here comfortably. Trust me, i've done it before. On multiple occassions. SCORE. \n\nAfter writing this review, i'm probably going to be blacklisted by this hotel, but hey there are a few things to take note of: college students don't have money, we're currently in a recession, it's more fun if we're all together!, and when you bring 3 air-mattresses, life is good.
