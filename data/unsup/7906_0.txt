I hate giving bad reviews, but this place keeps coming up with great reviews and I've almost come here again because of it!  I was so disappointed in my sandwich, the bread is not good, their idea of an Italian is off,  and the enthusiasm of others about their awesome sandwiches put me over the edge!  Maybe I'm just a fish out of water here in the desert, idk what I expect from a state who doesn't know what Italian salad dressing even is!  I miss my delis :(
