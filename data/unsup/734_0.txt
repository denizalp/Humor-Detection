I use to frequent this place when it was independently owned because of the it's proximity to what I needed to do and the price. Now that it's the Radisson, the service sucks. No rooms available until well after 4pm. They then give me a double room when I reserved a King. Still waiting to get switched to a King as I speak. The one star is for the remodel. The place looks refreshed but they need to get their shit together.
