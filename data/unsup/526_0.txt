Been back twice since first review and I have to say things have not gotten better. This is a slightly above average burger with terrible service and a high price. I do not think Guy Fieri has visit this restaurant, if so he would be very disappointed. Save your money go to McDonalds. But the bar across the walkway is awesome!
