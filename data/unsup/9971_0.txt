No wait!  Amazing service and incredible burger!!  I NEVER venture out when it comes to food,  I tend to play it safe (boring) but I decided to try the peanut butter and jelly burger (I forget the actual name) and it did not disappoint!  Oh my gosh, it was so good!  Def one of those burgers you will crave and never be able to duplicate!  Can't wait to go back!
