i ordered a make your own SALAD where you order five vegetable since i did not state LETTUCE on a make your own salad the \"manager\" ISABELLE sent a SALAD without any lettuce and said it was my fault that i didnt say lettuce for my salad she did NOT inform me that lettuce was a default.. i will never order from here again and i will spread the word to everyone at my establishment to stay away as well.
