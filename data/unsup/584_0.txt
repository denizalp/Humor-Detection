2 drinks comes out to less than $6 with the Yelp 20% check in.  Dude!  DOOD!  So hard to top!  That's almost the price of one freakin drink at Tea Station these days.  \n\nI like the watermelon slush with boba.  My wife only gets boba milk tea.  The staff is friendly.  Take out is the way to go.  There's absolutely no reason to hang out here.  No vibe whatsoever.  At least Tea Station has that going for them I guess.
