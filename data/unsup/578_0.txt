I'd never been to a Cirque Du Soleil show, so LOVE was my introduction.  My friend thinks KA was better.  We had good seats near the stage.  The show was definitely a visual feast.  The music, of course, was terrific.  I just didn't get the story... if there was one.  I wasn't sure what was going on with the creepy guy, the old woman, or what a bunch of skateboarders had to do with anything... but it was interesting.  A little short. The \"Something\" piece was beautiful.  Everything was nice... just a bit disjointed.
