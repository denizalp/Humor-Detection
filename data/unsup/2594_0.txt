This place is AWESOME! First, you can't miss the orange and green colored building. But if you notice it is only a drive thru so don't plan to stick around unless the picnic table is free. I got the fruit punch with a twist. It was DELICIOUS! The staff was very friendly and helpful when I asked questions! I wish they could franchise this closer to my house. So so so good!
