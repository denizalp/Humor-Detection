I like Palermo's pizza sauce and crust. They have this 7.99 carry out special that I usually get . This last time it was a bit short on the pepperoni but still tasted how I remembered it. The gentlemen that work there are nice. I've only had the pepperoni and cheese pizza here but they are always good.
