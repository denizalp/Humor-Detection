This place is fantastic, the food is exceptional and the service is just as good. This is our 5th time here in just the last 4 weeks and we'll keep coming back. \n\nWe've ordered the Tikka masala, the coconut chicken, the chicken korma, the chicken curry... so we've tried to mix it up to try everything but as far as the one that I feel is best, I have to give that award to the Tikka masala.\n\nI also highly recommend the garlic naan, it's worth it instead of just getting the standard naan bread. \n\nGreat spot!
