The wine and food pairings that are hosted at Ling & Louie's are the best I have ever been to.  The staff is knowledgeable especially the top managed John.  I have never liked sweet wines and reds that are too heavy but they got it so right. John even accommodated a vegetarian at our table without advance notice, I am impressed.
