Yum! I seriously love me some Raising Cane's. The drive-thru at this location is fast and efficient. And placing a large catering order is quick and easy. Everything we ordered was easily transportable and packaged nicely. Tip: Get an extra Cane's sauce with your order - it's delicious to dip the fries in.
