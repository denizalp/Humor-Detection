Glad it only comes around once a year\n\n\nSpirit Halloween store has great animatronics and displays of gory scenes everywhere. The selection of merchandise was ok, nothing you couldn't get from another store.  Their prices seemed higher than others as well.  I take my nephew  there as its more of a haunted house operation.\n\nThe service and staff are okay but needless to say they didn't go out of their way to give a lending hand.  Spirit Halloween serves its purpose however, I'm glad this store only comes around once a year.
