Don't waste your time. This winery is more of a wine bar with a cold atmosphere. The tasting alone is $10 but it will take almost an hour for you to complete. They don't have enough staff to handle the traffic that comes through. The wine is extremely dry and is a bit on the expensive side of things. Overall, a bad experience with just as bad of wine. Definitely a waste of time and money.
