They've got good specials now and then, but it's really forgettable. Pizzas are way too salty, toppings are barely there, and the standard dough is practically thin crust, meaning you aren't getting much food while paying $13 for a large with 3 toppings. It's not that I would reject this if someone gave it to me, it's just that for the same price, I can indulge myself in way better products around the valley and feel way more satisfied after a couple slices. Maybe it has staying power because there are barely any independent pizza joints around here?
