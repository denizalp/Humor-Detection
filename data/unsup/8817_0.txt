The English muffin of vintage stores. Nooks and crannies everywhere. So many, you make a wrong turn, you could be impaled by a broken Betty Boop lamp. Qcumber. I have to say. It's a Qcute name. But it's not Qcuite for  me. You see. When I enter a store. I think my shoes, upon leaving, shouldn't be dirtier than when I arrived at your store. So Qcumber. I just have two words for you...\n\nBuy a broom and start sweeping for Qcryin' out loud!
