Went to the concert last night in Gwinnett (Atlanta) show 12\/14\/2016. I had never attended was really excited but was utterly disappointed. The Christmas music was great but over 1\/2 of the concert was dark heavy metal noise. It was very dark with war, anger, demons. Totally not appropriate for a holiday concert or family entertainment. My brother in-law and son had attended previous years and said none of this was there. I will not recommend or attend again. Felt very mislead.
