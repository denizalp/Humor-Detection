OK, so Brazilian waxes suck. They are going to suck no matter HOW great the place is.\n\nBUT, that said, Ten Spot is the GREATEST place to go get the SCARIEST waxing done.\n\nWhen I went, I got to watch Will & Grace while my hoo-ha (and everything else) was being taken care of. The staff members seem to all have a great sense of humour, while at the same time being extremely professional. \n\nThe place itself is gorgeous. It's clean, modern, and stacked with great beauty products as well (they carry Cake and Lovefresh, two of my absolute necessities). Go!
