Kenny is awesome!! We have tried several places for my teenage sons thick, curly hair and he's always upset afterwards. Kenny took the time to ask him what he wanted, gave him ideas, and actually talked to him and at the end showed him how to style it. This was the first time my son has left happy with his hair and for a picky teen that says a lot! Thank you Kenny! You rock!!!
