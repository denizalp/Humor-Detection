Drove all the way here from Phoenix with two of my coworkers...\nI honestly LOVE this place! Sammy was super friendly and helpful and immediately offered us drinks. I got the ham and cheese Panini and it came with a salad. Both the salad and the Panini were delicious! I would recommend this place to ANYONE! It's a wonderful restaurant with great service and awesome food! Amy and Sammy were laughing and joking with us by the end of the night. I will definitely be coming back here!
