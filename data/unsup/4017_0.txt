Not so secret anymore, huh? \n\n3rd floor of the Cosmo, look for the hallway with the records lining the walls and people with drunchies standing outside. Bomb ass pizza: pepperoni and white are stand-out. May take a bit if you order a whole pie-- it'll be real fresh.\n\nWater cooler by the register. Minimal seating inside; some couches in the lobby outside. Great spot to people watch.\n\nBest post-game food in the classiest hotel-casino around. Plus, comes with a whole lot of character.
