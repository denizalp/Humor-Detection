I have to admit, my expectations were low for my two night- conference related stay @RioVegas . \n\nI was pleasantly surprised at the size and quality of the room.\n\nIt was nice having coffee just outside the elevators in the morning as well.  Starbucks right there.  Caffeinate me.\n\nThey did not do the greatest job on the conference lunches but if you're not having a conference here you're fine.\n\nOverall, I would stay here again...that's the bottom line.
