We knew it was time to let one of our cats go due to age and health issues and were stressed about the best way of handling it.  My wife found Dr. Christina Nutter at Gentle Journey and we are so glad we did.  It is never easy saying goodbye, but Dr. Nutter made the process much easier than anticipated.  Being able to do this in the comfort of home was priceless.  Thanks for all that you do.
