Their teriyaki burger is the best! They are even better than any hawaiian bbq place I've been to in the valley and that's kind of sad because their's is the closest to an actual teriyaki burger from the islands. I always order it minus the fancy smancy pineapple and onion. Blah. Fruit should not be on an type of food except dessert dishes. Drive thru workers are very friendly and cheerful which is nice to see especially during the lunch rush.
