Came here at 11:30 and was told the kitchen was closed for food orders. Decided to try something new and got the strawberry banana green tea and it tasted like medicine. My friends got hot almond tea and hot taro tea. I wish they offered sugar on the side because one of my friends didn't like it unsweetened. Prices here are also a bit more expensive because of the upkeep.
