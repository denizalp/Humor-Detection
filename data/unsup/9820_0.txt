Ok, it's early....Only 20 weeks but so far our experience has been very positive. The location is new and renovated and designed for children, so being a child I super appreciate it. The staff is friendly and helpful, they even stayed late to help us with our blood test because our echo appointment ran late. I'll update my review when the birth is over......If I have time. But I must say it has been the best hospital experience I have had in Montreal so far.
