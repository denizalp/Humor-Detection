Very friendly family run restaurant.  Family moved here form France - why I will never know - but thankfully they did as they have great food and just is a little gem out here to visit for lunch or a snack.  They omelet sandwich with coffee and juice for 6 bucks is a great breakfast too. Oh and the chocolate or apple tarts are fantastic by the way.
