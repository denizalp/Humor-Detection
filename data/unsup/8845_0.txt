Stopped in without a reservation on a Saturday night. Received service right away and was seated at the seating overlooking the kitchen. These turn out to be my favorite seats at restaurants. Where you get to watch all the action as it happens. The food was on point as always. Service was fast... In and out because we had tickets to the hockey game. Less than 40 minutes and we were on our way. As always recommend this spot.
