Well rounded menu, with many different options. I ventured in for lunch, based on their Yelp reviews and I wasn't disappointed. The portion size was nice, as one dish was plenty for lunch. I ordered the steak and mushroom kabobs...delicious!  This would've a great place to go with a big group. I can only rate the one dish I enjoyed, but I can't wait to try more.
