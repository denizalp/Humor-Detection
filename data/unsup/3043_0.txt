Hate to do this but very overpriced $20 for two large fresh juices? Overpriced yes quality no. I understand it's a business but don't rip people off. Did you switch I ordered was the green one and it was nothing but lemon very little taste of cucumber very disappointing. For nine dollars I could've made 5 gallons of juice
