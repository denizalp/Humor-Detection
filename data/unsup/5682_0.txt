Came here for dim sum with coworkers a few weeks back for lunch. We sat at the elevated portion of the restaurant next to the wall. After we finished our meal, I looked down and there was a brown cockroach sitting on my leg! Killed it (see picture) and then we reported it to the manager after who told us that they knew they had this issue and is \"working on it\". He then stepped on the dead cockroach and slid it under the table. Would never come back.
