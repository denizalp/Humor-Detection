The LINQ Promenade is one of my favorite places to take out-of-town friends\/family.  There's not a ton of shopping or dining to do here, but there is an IN-N-Out and a Sprinkles.  The LINQ Promenade is great for people watching and to park if you're planning to hit up the strip.  As for High Roller, I guess I can't knock it unless I try it.  But it's a grip and unless it's free, I don't see myself on it anytime soon.  Sorry for the long review.  ROTD!!!!
