The questions I had were ignored repeatedly so I withdrew my participation in the process and let my husband deal with them. Evidently interacting with women is not their strongpoint. There is a lack of communication.  The last straw is that they only have one machine to dig and it will not be available for a week and a half. So again, we are waiting on them. I wish we had gone with another company.  They are very unprofessional.  If I could rate negative stars I would.
