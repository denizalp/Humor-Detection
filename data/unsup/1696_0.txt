Did I purchase something from Harry Winston? No.  Did someone purchase something for me at Harry Winston?  No.  Did I go inside of Harry Winton?  No.  Why am I doing a review for Harry Winston you ask?  I stood outside staring, drooling at the fabulous window display.  I gazed at the most brilliant, clearest diamond I have ever laid eyes on.   The cut, color, and clarity were sheer perfection.   I write this review for selfish reasons.  I write this to affirm that I will one day own a Harry Winston diamond.\n\n\"Shine bright like a diamond.\"\n\n-Rihanna
