Wow talk about a hidden gem..I have been craving Laotian papaya salad and no Thai restaurant has satisfied that craving until now! It's not on the menu but I asked for it Lao style with preserved crab..omg it was like my Moms home cooking! I'm super happy! The pad Thai and Lad nah we're both good but they won my heart with the papaya salad :) Thx we will definitely order again!
