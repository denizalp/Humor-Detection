I'm obsessed with this place. Everything is so good. Their fresh squeeze orange juice is just amazing. My sister doesn't even like OJ and this she loved! Their coffee is good. Their cup-o-bread is BOMB!! Even their fruit plate sets them apart from other breakfast places. Pineapple, strawberries, bananas, blueberries, and melon! I mean YUM!! I haven't had something I didn't enjoy. I also love the atmosphere in here!
