If you like to please yourself and are a chocolate maniac, you gotta go there. \nLet the flavors convince you:\n- Pepper\n- Rose\n- Mapple\n- Balsamic vinegar\n- Fleur de sel\n- Chai\n- etc.\n\nThey also have the greatest hot chocolate of the universe. Not some sort of hot foamy milk cut with water and cheap cacao powder. No, CHOCOLATE!!! Thick and creamy and full of body. \n\nSo, the idea is to go to Fairmount Bagel, go to Chocolat Genevi√®ve Grandbois, dip your bagel IN the chocolate, and finish it with a latte at Olympico. Mmmm. Lucky you.
