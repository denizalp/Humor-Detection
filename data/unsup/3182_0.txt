BOULANGERIE!! Lindsay hit a home run when decorating my sons birthday cake, hands down the coolest cake I've ever seen, I have some ideas on paper and she RAN WITH IT! I had a million compliments from the restaurant we ate at and everyone was completely blown away. To say I was a happy customer is an understatement.
