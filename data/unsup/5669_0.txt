I ate here a couple years ago and the food was good, however, the past few months it has been terrible! The lo mein was bland, and some of the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was rock hard. And holy ginger, egg rolls! They were absolutely disgusting, I spit it out! I thought maybe they just had an off night and tried again, but same thing. Never again!
