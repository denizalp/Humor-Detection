My favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. Perfect ambience for families and dinner for two. Never fail to provide best quality meals and quantity is just right. Recommend the Jackpot and Heart Attack specialty roll, goyza, shrimp tempura and any teriyaki lunch \/dinner. We've only had to wait no longer than 5 minutes in the past three years. You will not be disappointed!
