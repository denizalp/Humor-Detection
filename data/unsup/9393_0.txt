A fast food place where I get to pick the multiple condiments on my burger?  awesome.  Watch them grill it?  awesome.  know that my fries are freshly cooked?  also awesome.\n\nWalking through the restaurant to see food scraps on the floor and a place that could use a good clean?  perhaps not so great.  Maybe the holiday Monday was a bad idea to go there, but there wasn't much else open.  Very very decent food though!
