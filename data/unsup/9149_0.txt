Decided to go here and mix it up a little since we had a gift card today.  They were pretty busy since it is Labor Day.  \n\nFirst I tried the Fried calamari that was  light and Crisp served with garlic sauce. Decided to go with glam burger. It was served with french fries and green salad sweet potatoes I wanted to try that Kobe burger which was a American-style Kobe be with saut√©ed mushrooms and spicy mayo and onions.\n\nThe food was great but the service declined as the place got busier.
