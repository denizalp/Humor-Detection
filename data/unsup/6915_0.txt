Only been here for breakfast so far. It was unique and delish!! We ordered a chicken fried steak burrito. It had a cut up chicken fried steak, eggs and cheese, and then it was smothered in a yummy gravy! Winner!!\n\nWe also ordered the pork green chili omelet, which was eggs, green chili and cheese, smothered in a light green chili pork gravy! Another winner!!\n\nVery good breakfast! Looking forward to going back to try other stuff!!
