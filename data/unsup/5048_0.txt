Sorry, Caplansky and Corned Beef House -- I gotta say, Pancer's has the both of you beat for Best Corned Beef in Toronto. Even though Pancer's is practically in BFE, it's worth the commute for their tasty, tasty meat. Even the coleslaw (which I generally hate) and the french fries are good. Best yet, the people that work there are awesome. Oh, believe me -- you'll get your food with a side of sass, and you're going to love every second of it.
