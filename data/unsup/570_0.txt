the only reason id shop here is if i absolutely need something. i remember asking one of the guys at the gun shop \n\n\"hey do you guys carry ar15's?\"\n\nhe replies loudly with attitude \"we do not sell tactical firearms!\"\n\nok first of all its just a question. second, then why is bass pro selling a H&K USP .45 with a threaded barrel for a suppressor?
