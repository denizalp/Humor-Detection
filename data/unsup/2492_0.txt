Last time I was there we had a table for four people. We ordered: one Reuben, one Sheldon (Reuben's vegetarian cousin) as is, two vegan Sheldons. What can I say, my friends and I like kraut. \n\nBut yeah. The Sheldon can be made vegan, and even without cheese (gasp) it's really delicious. Someone else mentioned that it was dry, but I order this almost every time and am never disappointed. \n\nThe fries are awesome. Good (but expensive) Bloody Marys. They have vegan pie slices and can make VEGAN MILKSHAKES. \n\n:)
