Karm\nThe \"venue\" as the people that work there call it. In order to intimidate you, Pretty much sucks. The staff is rude and un-tolerating. You ask them one question and they bark orders at u.If you don't have millions to spend on a table talk to Karm the guy who works on the steps, if ur cool he'll let u watch the show from the steps. He's pretty much the only polite & knowledgeable guy there.
