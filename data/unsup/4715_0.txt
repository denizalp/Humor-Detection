This was the worst meal I had my entire visit to Las Vegas. I ordered the caprese eggs Benedict and I couldn't even eat it. The eggs tasted sour, the English muffin wasn't cooked, and the hasbrowns were black from oxidation. My fianc√© got a burger with an egg and said the same thing- his eggs were rotten.
