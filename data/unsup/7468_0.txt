Definitely one of the prettiest\/most feminine coffee shops in Vegas! The menu serves unique lattes, light meals (avocado toasts, parfaits, croissants, cheese boards etc), teas, and even some alcoholic beverages. The space itself is huge, with many 4-seater tables, ok for studying but more suited for socializing. Prices are on the higher side, and taste-wise everything was good but nothing mind blowing. If you love the color pink, and want a super cute instagram picture, definitely go here!
