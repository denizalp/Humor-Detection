Great service! I went with a group of five girls, and we were given a royal treatment for a very good cost! The pedicures were $30, and came with a long soak, some great products, and a long-lasting finish. Plus, we got to drink wine and stay quite a while! I didn't feel rushed and I definitely got my money's worth. Highly recommended (though you should make a reservation because they're usually full!)
