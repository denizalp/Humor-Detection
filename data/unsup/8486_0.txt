Haji Babas is a great place for people who want to check out some of the hidden gems within Tempe. It's one of those places not too many people know about because most of the people that eat or shop there want to keep it a secret!! \n\nI love the beef shawarma plate. HUGE portions, which is nice because the leftovers are just as good the next day. \n\nNot the best dining atmosphere... Somewhat awkward experience last time I was there with people standing in the doorway due to lack of space in the actual restaurant area.
