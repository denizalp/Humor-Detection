I wish I could speak on the food. wanting to make a delivery order, i asked if they delivered. \"yes, but only before 2 pm\" (it's 330). ok, understandable. I asked to make a pick up order, and I was put on hold for 5 minutes. after the employee came back on, she then told me I couldn't order because they close in 20 minutes.\n\nagain, I don't know how the food is, but please train your staff to be a little more courteous.
