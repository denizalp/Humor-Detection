eh, wasn't impressed at all.\nwe tried what seemed like every item on the menu and nothing wow'd me. I came with a great group of friends, so a great time was had. No one seemed to love anything. No one said \"this is so great, let's get more, etc\". We left and I was hungry, even though we ordered a ton of food. I'd pass on this place and try something different downtown.
