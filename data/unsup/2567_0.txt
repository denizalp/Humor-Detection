Anthony and Matt did 6 rooms and a hallway prior to me moving in. I loved their work and their work ethic. They made sure that the job was finished meticulously. I have nothing bad to say about them. Any other paint job that I may need...like my kitchen cabinets..I will definitely call Premier Painting. Thank you so much!
