A bit out of the city center but close to the highway, which is all that we needed it for anyway. You have to drive through a short stretch of not-quite-trailer park neighborhood even though it's visible from the highway. I like it because it's brand new and therefore clean, but I'm sure in a year or two it'll be properly grotty.
