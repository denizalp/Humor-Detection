Seeing how good the reviews are, we've decided to give this place a try. We've ordered party tray. Worst decision ever. This place is not even comparable to an average Japanese restaurants in GTA. \nFish was not fresh and had no texture. Portions were small (ordered a 3 people party tray for 2 of us and we were still hungry by the end of it). What made it worse - FOOD POISONING!\nI'm very surprised how great reviews are for this place - price was average, food was bad, portion was small. Will I come back? That's definitely a no.
