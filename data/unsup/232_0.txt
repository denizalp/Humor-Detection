Took the Niagara Falls tour with Chariots Of Fire. The all day tour was great. Our driver was very nice, full of information, and spaced out all of our tour stops just right. \n\nWe saw the falls from two different parts of the Canada side (up at the tower and at the ground level by the falls), took a drive around the adjacent canyon and area, visited a local small city by lake Ontario for lunch, and visited a local winery that specializes in winter wine (free tasting included).  \n\nGood times and a great day.
