There's a scale outside of this restaurant that, if your weight exceeds 350lbs, you eat for free.\n\nDo I have your attention now?!\n\nThis place offers endless fries, single, double, triple & quadruple ole bypass burgers as well as, um, nurses to be sure that your dining experience here isn't killing you.\n\nAll kidding aside, this place is and should be treated as a satire to what you SHOULD be eating - this is a rare delicacy at best and should be kept that way.\n\nWorth the visit if you find yourself on Freemont Street...
