Specifically asked for FRESH chicken nuggets multiple times throughout the ordering process. When we paid, we immediately got the food, which we thought was weird because it takes time to cook. We asked if it was fresh, the guy said yes. He is a liar. The food was disgusting. Chicken nuggets tasted so gross we threw them away. Never coming here again, I never have an issue with Burger King
