This place is a shithole. They have the rudest staff and worst service. The front desk made me wait for more then 15 mins because she could not find my reservation. And she gave me a room which was not even get cleaned. Then she switched me to another room, however it is a smoking room which is not what I booked. I asked her to call the manager and she would not even try to call. After all of this, she didn't even say a sorry! Worst Las Vegas hotel ever!
