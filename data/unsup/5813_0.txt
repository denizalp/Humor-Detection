We've visited both locations multiple times as this is our go-to place for BBQ. The food has always been amazing at both locations. However, the customer service at this location ALWAYS sucks! I don't know if we have bad luck or if all the wait staff at this location just aren't very good. \n\nIf you visit this location, expect great food and poor service.
