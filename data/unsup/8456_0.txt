This place was on my \"must-try\" list for a while. I was only able to try two sandwiches:\n\nLe Pig (pork belly sandwich) - 5 stars. This stuff was bomb digs. \nReuben-ish - 4 stars.  I thought it was a bit too salty, otherwise, this would have been amazing. \n\nThough it's an outside establishment with chairs surrounding it, there's an option to take the sandwiches indoor to the bar immediately close-by without pressure to order anything. That was according to the guy who was selling the sandwiches.
