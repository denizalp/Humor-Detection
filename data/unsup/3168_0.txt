Do not waste your time with this place. Their products are horrible, and the customer service is even worse. FYI - if you have Christina apply a stain finish to your pot it is only good until the first rain comes along. You'll be left with a horrible looking pot, and everything underneath it will be stained and ruined. This place doesn't even deserve 1 star!
