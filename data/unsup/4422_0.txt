Hottie is a great source of costume clothing, jewelry and accessories.  This is where I buy my throw away dresses that are so cheap they are probably crafted of spun lead in some overseas sweat shop.  The prices are roughly equivalent to that of the anchor store it's located by--Target.  The most expensive dress I've bought here was $50 and was strictly for wearing in the clubs where it will get bitched up anyhow.  It's a great place to supplement your wardrobe if you're a chick who spends a lot of time in bars and\/ or night clubs.
