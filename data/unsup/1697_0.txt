I ordered miso soup and it was salty and could only eat the noodles not broth.  It was very salty.  I told the waitress that the soup was salty and she try to excuse it because it's a soy miso base.  I know it's a soy base as it is a miso soup but I was hoping she should take the feedback and let the cook know to so they can improve.   Feedback from customer is important instead of trying to excuse it.
