Mediocre fast food at cheap prices: sounds good.\n\nSame mediocre fast food at Vegas prices: WTF?\n\nBeer is available here, but it's 6 bucks a piece for the good stuff. Pizza, even with the coupons was still waaaaaay overpriced.\n\nBut, whatcha gonna do in Vegas? Run out to the desert and eat lizards?
