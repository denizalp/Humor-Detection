I guess you wouldn't expect great chinese food in Vegas but there's got to be something better. Some dishes were good but when it comes to more upscale dishes, this place fails miserably. There's not much authenticity to there dishes. I also sense a little bit of shadyness when someone orders Peking Duck and they keep the duck after slicing off the skin.
