This place is a Negative Star rating!  I thought the show \"Restaurant Stakeout\" fixed this place and corrected their horrible service.  \n\nThis place is bad! Worst service I have ever experienced and the food was nothing special.  The Chicken Waldorf salad says it has \"roasted chicken\", it's more like a fried chicken that's dry.  The manager was not very apologetic and it didn't seem like they cared one bit.  15 minutes to put our order in, followed by another 45 minutes to get our food.  I will never come back here.
