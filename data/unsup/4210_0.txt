I hardly write reviews for anything, especially McDonald's...\nBut a few days ago, my family went to this McDonald's solely for pies and sodas. Trisha was such a bubbly girl even at 10:30 at night & resolved our only issue (that there wasn't enough of one flavor pie ready). She was super sweet and very funny & I'll hope to see her working from now on!
