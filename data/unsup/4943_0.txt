I got this place on Priceline for $47\/night, stayed 4 nights. That being said I don't think I'd pay 2 cents over $50 a night. The beds were like sleeping on a rock (we were in two different rooms, the first was 2 double beds, the 2nd a king size). Who sleeps in a double bed anymore? Seriously?\n\nThey want to nickel and dime you for every little thing, which I guess isn't unlike other hotels. \n\nI didn't think the rooms were horribly out of date, but they weren't anything special.
