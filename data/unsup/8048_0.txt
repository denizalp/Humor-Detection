I've been coming to this target for a few years now - before I was Yelping, even - and it has remained consistently good despite solid grocery competition nearby from a really good Harris Teeter. The produce department is excellent, the meats are great, the place is always bright and clean, it's very rare that stuff is out of stock and the carts are always perfect. What's not to love? Why shop anywhere else?\n\nI have had some issues with the Pharmacy, so for that we go to Teeter.
