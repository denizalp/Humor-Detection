This place sucked. Great DJ lineup, but that's about it. It's the most over priced piece of crap on the strip!!\nSave your money and your time and head to XS or Marquee. I think the girls will struggle with all of those flights of stairs....assuming they get some in. The night we had a table, it was mostly guys ( those who had bottle service) looking around for the non-existent girls to talk to. No Bueno.
