I came by for a warehouse sale.  The location is convenient.  There are ample free parking on site.  The facility is big and functional.  The room in which the warehouse sale was held is spacious, clean but bare.  The building could use some renovation, such as upgrading the restrooms and floor, etc..  I don't know if it is possible, but painting the walls in trendier colour would be nice.
