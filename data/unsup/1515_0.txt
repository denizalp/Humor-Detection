I was working in the area, and it was lunchtime, the locals recommended this Thai restaurant for lunch. I ordered the flat noodles, Pad See Ew because I had been craving it for a month, well, they cooked it really well here! I enjoyed my lunch and if I work in the area again, I would definitely come back to try their other dishes!
