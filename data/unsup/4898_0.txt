Think I only went with 5 stars because we went on a Tuesday after 4th of July. I can imagine this place quickly getting out of hand. We rented a cabana and it was worth the $25! The waitress was nice and kept fresh ice water in our pitcher. Food was typical food court (but what would one expect) and ok. My kid loves that they had chicken and waffle on a stick.  Overall I'll probably come again, on another off peak day though. Not sure how I'd handle a full crowd.
