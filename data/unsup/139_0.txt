My girls went here after the pool to go eat.  \n\nUnfortunately I dont remember. \n\nI blacked out and asked to leave.  My friend was able to eat and then take me back to the hotel.  \n\nI know I ate something.. but I ended up getting sick from all the alcohol. LOL. \n\nI know, my fault for getting drunk, but I did pay to eat.. I deserve something if I invest money in someone's business.
