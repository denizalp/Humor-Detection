$25 bikini wax - clean everything, friendly service, relatively painless (3 gasps, one full body flinch - not bad!) and, as with the last review, Modern Family playing on the TV. She told me she loves this show and I wonder if it's all she plays...There is something comforting and yet disturbing about that concept.\n\nIn any case, I found the experience efficient, professional and pleasant. Would definitely start their \"monthly upkeep\" deals if I'd had more time to discuss it.
