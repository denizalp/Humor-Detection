Food is just ok. The pulled pork and pulled chicken came out cold. The pouting was ok. My husband's ribs were way way saucy (even for him who likes saucy). The sweet potato fries and cut fries are fresh soft and taste homemade.\n\nOther than that, I'd go elsewhere next time. The server was super nice but she ran around the dining room by herself the entire Saturday night and forgot some things (super nice and friendly though). But they need more staff in the front of the house and in the back. The food took forever and was cold.
