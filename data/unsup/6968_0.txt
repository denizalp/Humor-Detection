LIES! lured by fair priced beer and appealing looking pizza, my family and I were greeted with the horrid reality of this place. Save your money and buy a Digornio! It might be a bit better.\n\nWhile the beer was served cold, the pizza tasted like a microwaved lunchable. Toppings were over cooked, the cheese was rubbery and flavorless. \n\nIt says a lot about a place when a ten year old is in the back prepping food. \n\nSorry Zzeeks why don't you try again.
