We just walked into this location of Bonefish. \n\nBartender: Do you need a menu?\nMe: No, I'm looking for scotch. \n2 minutes later...\nBartender: Did you decide yet?\nMe: I was hoping you could tell me what kind of scotch you had.\nBartender: (eye roll) I'll get the other bartender. \nMe: Bye. We will never be back. \n\nI love attitude from bartenders that don't know how to do their job. \n\nThis Bonefish is awful. Poor management. Our 2nd negative experience here.
