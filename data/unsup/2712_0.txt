Surprise may be a bit of a drive from Phoenix or Scottsdale, but if you are in the West Valley and craving Asian food, Saigon Kitchen is the place to go.\n\nA clean, modern and somewhat trendy look\/feel, with an open bar in the middle of the restaurant.  Amazing appetizers, entres and service.  Order the Stir Fry and you won't regret it.\n\nThis hidden gem will be my new go-to.
