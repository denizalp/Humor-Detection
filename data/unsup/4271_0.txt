I was in town for training and someone recommended this place. I got an oreo milkshake and a quarter fried chicken dinner with waffle\/crisscut fries. The shake was perfect. The fries were so cripy and well seasoned. I would totally come back just for those. The fried chicken was tender and crispy. I did not like the roll that much. It reminded me of a popover. I would definitely come back when I'm in town.
