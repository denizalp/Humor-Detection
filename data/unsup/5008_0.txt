Great poutine. Rivals La Banquise, the traditional gold standard. I'd say La Banquise has slightly better fries, worse gravy, approximately equal cheese curds (smaller though, which I think is a minus), but has the advantage of atmosphere--but AA doesn't have crazy down-the-block lineups either, perhaps because with Greenspot and an especially cool LBP branch nearby, they aren't the only game in town. They put something crazy in that gravy, very distinctive...cinnamon maybe? Something mildly narcotic that just makes you feel a special something? Cheeseburger was awesome too.\n\nCash only, pay after you eat.
