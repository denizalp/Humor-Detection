I took my fianc√© here for his birthday.  The food and ambiance was incredible, but I have to say the best part about our night was our server, Will!  He recommended the Elk, which I would have never ordered on my own and it was amazing!  I would have given the restaurant a 4 star rating but because of Will's excellent service I decided Orange Sky deserved a 5!  Thank you, Will! :)
