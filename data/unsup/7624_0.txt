This place is amazing! I am more and more impressed every time I visit! I usually order the tropical with a little extra granola, my fav!! The girl who helped me out (Tara) was so incredibly nice and she seemed to take a genuine interested in how my day was going. The bowls take a little longer than you'd think but then again you can't rush good food! When I received my bowl tara dropped it off for me and was so courteous and kind! I will definitely recommend this place to my friends!
