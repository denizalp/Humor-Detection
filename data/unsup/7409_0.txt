OK, so I had to try the concept eventually.  It certainly isn't the only chain to work with a very limited menu.  The food was ok.  The service was pleasant.  Enough people must like the place as noon was approaching it got pretty full and there was also take out orders.  If chicken was what I had in mind and I was close I would go again.  But I would not drive across town.
