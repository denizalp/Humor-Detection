James was awesome, you can tell he truly cares about his clients. He listened to what I wanted and made my hair even better than I imagined. He took my nappy roots and made me a beautiful blonde again!! Plus the time in the chair flew by! I'm so thankful to have found a new stylist who puts forth the effort to make sure his clients are beyond satisfied.  I highly recommend him!!
