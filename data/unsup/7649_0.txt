Looks like yelpers are catching on to Sicili.\nThis is the best pizza at the best price.\n\nForget Metro, forget Napoli, forget Big Mamma and Big Papas, forget Joey's, forget Rocco's, forget Pop-Up, forget Familia....\nAnd stop overpaying for average pizza at Grimaldis, or Due Forni, or Dom DeMarco.\n\nSicili is the real deal in a world of fake advertising. \nDon't believe the nonsense. \nFind the truth.....it lives in a shabby strip mall on Twain, east of Paradise.\n(The truth often lives where you least expect it!)
