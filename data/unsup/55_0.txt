Wow, does this store lack space.  However, they really use every single inch to their advantage.  It is seriously like U-boat commanders dictated how to use the space - every inch is packed with stuff.  \n\nStore is well organized, even though it is crowded.  They carry all my favorite Giant Eagle standards.  Beer selection is good, considering the lack of space.  \n\nCheckout (a pain point for me in most stores), is usually pretty quick, and they usually have more than a couple registers open.  They also have plenty of self service checkouts.
