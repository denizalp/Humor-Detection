Ice cream flavours were unique and delicious and for $4 you get two scoops of the flavours of your choice! Staff was friendly and gave samples of ice cream in reusable spoons, adding the fresh waffles and the colour spoons made this a great treat. Came around 1 in the afternoon on a weekday so it was not busy and I would come back again.
