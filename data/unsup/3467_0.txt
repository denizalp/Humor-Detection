This is a very fun place to enjoy a nice dinner. We sat at the teppanyaki area and the food was prepared very well and we got some great entertainment as well. Our chef was a bit of a comedian (in a good way) and me made our experience a very pleasant one. This location is pretty empty during weekdays so I've never needed a reservation.
