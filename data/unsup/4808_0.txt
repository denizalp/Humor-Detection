Best Saturday ever.\nFarmers market in north side- free sample extravaganza on the south side.\ni love doing my grocery shopping here- so affordable and buying (mostly) local.\n\nDon't forget that on sundays there is the flea market aka, what I call the Junkyard.\nit's a great day out and an amazing date idea to boot.
