Good god! What is up with people in Las Vegas!? We rented from Avis again this past trip and it wasn't great. Seriously. Last time, the people wouldn't make eye contact if you paid them. This time, they were off crack and wouldn't stop staring you... even when you broke eye contact they'd bend down and try to continue to make eye contact. Sheesh!!\n\nIn the end, they added a whole bunch of taxes and fees that totally changed up the estimate. Strange... this is the first Avis that we've gone way over the estimate. BOOOO....
