I hate how when you go to one of the late movies, you can't get your free refills... I mean, I just paid $6 for soda and I want my one free refill. For me, the big soda is half the fun of the movies! You are clearly still open until the shows are over, you can't have one person who is mildly around to give a girl a refill?
