Despite the Union Jacks and other signage of British Origin, you will never lose yourself and think you're in a London pub. However, this is a fun lively place with an orgasmic selection of beers and a wonderful atmosphere. It will NEVER be London, but it's about as close as you'll get in The valley. HIGHLY recommend it!
