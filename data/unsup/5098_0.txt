Yet another reason to spend time in downtown Phoenix.  As a 20+ year Phoenix resident, I never thought I'd want to spend fun time in downtown, but that's changed.  Many great places to go, and Angels Trumpet is at the top of that list.  One of the best beer selections in the Phoenix area.  Funky vibe, good service.  Food is good, but not great - otherwise I'd give it a try.  Once you go - you'll come back often.
