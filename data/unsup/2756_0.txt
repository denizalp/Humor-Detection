The tickets are so cheap, I was skeptical to say the least.  I agreed to go with Yelp friends and I was dreading it.\n\nSo pleasantly surprised!  What a value!\n\nIt's just magic and comedy in simple form.\n\nI was entertained the whole time.  Simple is good.  Cheap is good.  Worth the price!\n\nHighly recommend.
