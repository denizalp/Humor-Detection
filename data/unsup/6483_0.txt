Staff were ok and the reno looks good, but Holy Moly, how can a restaurant charge $14 for SEVEN wings.....and they were some of the skinniest wings I have ever seen. In addition, the nachos were dry and really low on the toppings. My kids at home make better nachos. I hope the ownership finds some better kitchen staff, because we won't be coming back until they do. Quite disappointed.
