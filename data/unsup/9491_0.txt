Had a coupon for buy one whopper and get one free so I ordered a large fry also and it totaled $8.28. The fries were hot but not the best and the burger was pre- made.\nLuke warm at best. Service was ok at the drive thru. I guess $4.14 per person for a hamburger n fries is not bad but wished the hamburger was not sitting under a heat lamp but freshly made.
