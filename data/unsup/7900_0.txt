I always end up coming to Latea Era due to the ridiculous long line and slow service at Coco next door.\n\nOnce I got tricked by the Happy Hour Poster and ended up I did not read the smaller print as it is a student only special.\n\nI tried the Crown Top Rose Oolong which I enjoyed. And I like how they put real lime and lemon wedges in my Lime and Lemon Green Tea.\n\nThe interior is tastefully decorated. A \"rustic\" Taiwanese feel. \n\nMaybe I bring a student next time to get a student Happy Hour discount?
