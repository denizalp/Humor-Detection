Always good service.  Bagels are delicious but the cream cheese mixes are the best.  The roasted jalapeno cheddar cheese is spicy, but the chive is our favorite.  \n\nThe sandwiches are huge and they also offer coffee and smoothies as well as some pastries.  Great place for breakfast, but also great for lunch.\n\nhalf off after 1pm  I think
