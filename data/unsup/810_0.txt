This place is in my backyard, which makes for a delightful walk.  So, getting into the Spring Time in Paris mood, we decided to order the frenchiest of French dishes:  pomme frites.  They arrived in cone shaped paper, hot and seasoned perfectly.  We were given a choice of two dips.  The lemon-garlic aioli and goat cheese aioli begged to be chosen.  And, with good reason.  The dips were not wall flowers in the least.  Washed down with a couple glasses of wine, the pomme frites made for the yummiest of pre-bedtime snacks.
