Wu's Garden Buffet is the latest buffet to take over this location of revolving buffets.  In fact one of the signs outside still has the old name on it.\n\nWe came for a lunch birthday celebration.  There's not a lot of variety but the good thing is the containers are small so the turn over is fresher.  Nothing really stands out but the quality is more on the lower side.\n\nThe prices are pretty cheap so that's a plus, but then again you basically pay for what you get.  Service was adequate and polite.\n\n3\/5.
