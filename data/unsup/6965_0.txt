I came in and was immediately greeted. A gentleman took my pertinent information and had my car brakes diagnosed in less than 15 minutes. Best part? They were honest and told me my brakes didn't need to be changed. Granted this review is based on service and speed of only the diagnosis, not the actual repair (since my brakes didn't need changing). But I still left with a great impression.
