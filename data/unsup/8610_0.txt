Been going to this dentist group for 5 yrs or more.  Hygentist Laurie is great.  Dentists have come and gone so much there.  I have only needed fillings done 1-2x in 5 yrs but each time they messed it up with needing a returned visit.  I am finding a new dentist.  If you just need a cleaning- go see Laurie.  If you need dental work, find somewhere else.
