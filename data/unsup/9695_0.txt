Ordered to eat in didn't get a tray got a sack for a to go order. Be nice if they would read their ticket. Also wish there was a wall between the play area and the eating area. Hearing kids yelling and screaming while eating isn't good for eating. Floor is a miss. Someone got done with their tray of food and just left it on the table. Not the people who work here but it's been there for at least half an hour.
