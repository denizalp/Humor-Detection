HORRIBLE customer service. \n\nTHEY are supposed to be the graphic designers, and yet they can't tell me SQUAT about how to change the dpi, or image size to fit their specifications. I'm in the automotive business, and I know nothing about dpi or resolution or any of that crap.\n\nYou'd think that if you got the basic image over to them, they'd be able to take care of any minor adjustments. Nope. They're useless!\n\nNEVER USING THEM AGAIN.
