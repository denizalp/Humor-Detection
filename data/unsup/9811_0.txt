Whooo whoooo whoooo!!\nI finally found a decent ramen spot in Vegas!\nThat's what's up!!\nThey have a variety of soup base flavors and a good selection of add ons. \n\nWhat is going on?! I had the tonkotsu assari with extra sprouts and bok choy. This soup is hitting the spot and helping my tummy ache.\nAnd the pork chashu bowl is MmmmMmm good. Washed it down with some hot tea and I'm good to go.\n\nGreat for the rainy weather. Try it!
