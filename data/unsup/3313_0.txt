Pathetic. Unprofessional. Why am I waiting over 20 minutes just to pick up 2 cats that were supposed to be done at 3:30? It's 4:20. This place sucks. Don't expect much out of this place the staff does not seem like they are working together as a team they give each other weird looks and attitude. So... work on that.
