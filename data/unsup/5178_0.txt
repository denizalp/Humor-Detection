What a disappointment. The people who gave this place good reviews must've been super drunk. The \"secret\" thing about it is unique. But that was the only thing kind of cool about it. We waited in a long line for mediocre pizza and subpar service. There was nowhere to sit and two pinball machines taking up half the tiny pizza shop. In the end, our deal breaker was the NO RANCH policy.
