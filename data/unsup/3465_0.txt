I bought 2 sets of brake pads from Ramjet. When I installed the second set on my bike I found the screw and lock washer were missing. The package was open enough to get the screw and lock washer out.  I drove to Ramjet for the missing parts and they said I must have taken them out and lost them. For a $0.50 screw, they lost a customer with 3 Harleys who buys a lot of parts.In the future, I will buy my stuff from JPCYCLES.COM.
