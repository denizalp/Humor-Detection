Ordered my food at 9:26 pm. Was told about a 60-70 minute wait. Not cool, but \"Ok, fine, I'll play ball.\" Still waiting at 11:36pm, decided to call and I'm told they haven't even started my ****** order!!!!!!! See if I order from their asses again. Whoever claims delivery was fast is on their payroll or smoking crack. And I'm leaning more toward the latter (smoking crack) since everything's fast to them. You ever try catching a crackhead?  But, seriously, I'm pissed off. Wish I could give negative stars.
