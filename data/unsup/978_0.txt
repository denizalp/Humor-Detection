I love it :) we ordered on the phone, said we were going to PICK UP, and we get there and they say they don't have our order! Amazing! They find it, said it went out for delivery, funny because we didn't give them a delivery address! They forget 6 of our items as well that they charged us for and said they'd have to charge us again :) don't recommend
