I like coming here with my kids because it's usually pretty quiet-never packed and never had an issue, Until this particular visit. The two employees are having a very loud colorful conversation and every other word is f**k by this girl, to be followed by \"I gotta go smoke\" while I'm glad they wear gloves to make sandwiches.... Come on, I have young kids here. Thankfully it stopped as I was about to get up. Haven't seen these particular employees before tonight. Don't think I'll be bringing them back here again.
