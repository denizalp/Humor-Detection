We stopped in last night after hearing about this new place on Yelp!  It is a tiny spot, but cozy and lively atmosphere.  The beer and wine list are super extensive and they offer happy hour every day until 8pm - amazing!  I opted for the Ciderboys Strawberry cider and loved it - so delicious!  I can't wait to go back and try the Schilling Rhubarb Pear cider...we will definitely be back soon.
