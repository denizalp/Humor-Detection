***************************** 1429 ***************************\n\n  Located across the Bellagio pool, how convenient? The gelato is so good here.... I love the vanilla and the mint. Don't forget to try the latter too, only $10 but it's at the Bellagio right? They also offer coffee, sandwich, salad, and pastries... Service can be slowwwwwww on the weekend.\n\n  Cafe Gelato is a perfect spot to stop by before you hit the pool!
