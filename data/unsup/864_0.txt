We went here because it seemed to be one of the better Buffets in Downtown Las Vegas, and one of the few that served Coca Cola products (hard to find in  town ruled by Pepsi)\n\nIt turns out that this hotel (and I suspect all hotels owned by the same company) recently changed from Coke to Pepsi.\n\nBeyond that, while they had a decent variety of food the quality was poor.  Perhaps they are making cuts in the quality of their ingredients.
