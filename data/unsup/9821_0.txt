At first this place threw me off and i was quite confused but this place is a well hidden secret. Its good food fast at a great price. I usually order the lobster ravioli or the shrimp scampi with broccoli added and any kind of salad that catches my eye that night. It a great place for singles like myself to go to when you want the feel of a nice dinner out with out going a lone, I go here at least twice a month,
