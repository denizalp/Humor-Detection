My friend and I were inebriated this past weekend. Somehow, we wound up here to meet with a buddy of his. He misunderstood a few things. One, it was the wrong buddy he was messaging on his phone and two, it was the wrong bar.  Being as ridiculously drunk as we were, we stayed. Terrible place that smells funny.  But they serve alcohol.  It will do.
