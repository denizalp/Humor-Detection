We ordered a pizza from Spinato's.  we  were specific about the toppings.  When we went to pick it up, the pizza was wrong.  Spinato's said they would remake the pizza ( a good 30 minute wait) or take as is.  We took it as is, but were disappointed in such a response.  We should have been offered a discount.  \n\nThe pizza itself was fine, but not outstanding.  It was not greasy, and was rather tasty. \n\nHowever, I would think twice about Spinato's given they way they handled their error.
