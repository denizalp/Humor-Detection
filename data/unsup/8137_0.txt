Dr. Tsimerman is extremely knowledgeable and professional.  He takes the time to explain options and procedures to his patients.  His staff is very efficient and friendly.  They always keep appointment times, which is great for busy people.  I have been a patient there for the past 22 years, now traveling from Richmond Hill to get there.
