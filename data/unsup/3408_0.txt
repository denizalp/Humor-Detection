Gonna be honest, I left without drinking coffee.  The outside was gross... No problem I just will sit inside....I went inside. Umm what is that smell?  No clue.  A bar to sit at?  Interesting but... The bar top is cracked and broken, ok not sitting there.  A piano?  Ohh I like that, but oh it's really dirty in here.  Fairly busy but, really really dirty.  Ok I don't want to sit in here... Still no clue what that smell is... I'm leaving... Might be good coffee but are the cups clean?  Not risking it...
