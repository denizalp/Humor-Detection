Found this place on Facebook- it stated $995 down and $250 a month payment for any vehicle--oh noooo! You pay $1000 today and have 30 days to pay another $1000 and payments are almost $400 a month! Very disappointed! We drove from southwest Vegas clear to Nellis and wasted our Saturday to get deceived!  I guess if your credit isn't the best, you are bound to get screwed! Also, the good reviews on this company are workers! Hmmmm
