Well I've been back a good few times now, and Sabroso clearly also serves consistency. It's always great. The menu changes from time to time with new and interesting offerings.  The wine offerings are also a delight. \n\nNow that I'm thinking of it, I think I'll go there tonight. I've got that craving. Es muy bien.
