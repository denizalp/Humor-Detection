Darlene made my gorgeous wedding cake for my 7\/27\/17 reception. She was able to work within my budget, answered all my questions along the way, and then delivered a beautiful, floral cake (just like my husband and I wanted).  She even taught my husband how to cut the cake since we were celebrating in our home! Darlene really goes the extra mile. I highly recommend her business to any bride looking for a perfect and delicious wedding cake.
