Love coming to topgolf. Great service, helpful staff, and lots of fun. They even have a free shuttle to Talking Stick Resort which helps when the wait is long. Trey (our shuttle driver) was exceptional and gave us the inside scoop on good deals going at topgolf and how to use the shuttle. Always a great time!
