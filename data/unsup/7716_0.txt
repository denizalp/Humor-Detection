What happened?!\nThis place used to be amazing! Go in today and the menu has completely changed. Before there were sandwiches and potatoes and tacos, a whole variety of dishes. Now it's just meat and sides. Those changed too! Meat was undercooked and cold, sides weren't fresh. The portions also shrunk and the prices went up. They used to give half a pound of meat now it's 6.5oz for more money. They also changed to a chalk board for prices.\nSo disappointed! Bring back the old Dickies!
