Not sure what the heck happened to Wicked Spoon.  They SALT everything to death now.  I was excited to indulge in their bone marrow, which tasted just fine. The crustinis that came with it were too salty to eat.  Then I tried their manhattan clam chowder.  Too salty. Oxtail stew, too salty. I expected the crab legs to be naturally briney, which they were, but they were really small. I just didn't find the experience enjoyable as before.  Quality has really fallen off here, and I'll give a new buffet a shot before I come back here.
