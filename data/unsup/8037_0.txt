I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Tuesday's are also $1 PBR all day drink specials. We had the house special which was a \nAmazing!!! I would highly recommend this pizza to all meat lovers. \nThe ambiance was also very pleasant. There was a mix of college kids and families enjoying a pizza dinner. It wasn't too loud but there was a constant noise level. \nOverall I would recommend mellow mushroom to anyone and I would also go back.
