Their wings are huge which is a plus! The flavors are ok, it's kinda like Wing Stop knock off style. They do offer all you can eat wings for like $12.00. All you can eat fries are $2.00 extra. With the all you can eat wings, it starts off as a order of 10pc then goes to orders of 5 thereafter which was pointless for myself because I went thru wings like a granny on air supply.
