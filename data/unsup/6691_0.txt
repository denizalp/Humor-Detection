This was our first time to try a ballwich...We found them parked outside Khoury's WIne Store on Eastern whcih was pretty awesome as we live a couple of miles away!   My daughter loved sitting on the sidewalk to eat... My 7 yr old loved the Mac & Cheese and my hubby said it was the best meatball he has ever eaten (I am trying not to be offended) and my Zorba...seriously excellent!  However I have to say my favorite thing hands down were the Sweet Potato Tots!
