R.C. Willey is really not my thing, furniture-wise (eighties-looking couches with cupholders - no thanks!). BUT, but, they are pseudo-awesome for the following reasons:\n\n1.  Free hotdogs and soda on holidays.   Yes, I am one of those people that will do anything for free food.  This is especially great when hungover (awkward, however, because boyscouts serve the food...).\n\n2.  The R.C. Willey credit card gives you no APR for 12-18 months.  This was a very awesome thing when I put wood flooring in my house.    I am a cheapo!
