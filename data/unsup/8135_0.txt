This is probably the worst stocked Target that I have been to. The arrangement of merchandise seems to be different from other Targets. I also did not find things I was looking for. I needed some bath accessories and found awesome ones in other targets. This one had nothing. The kitchen accessories section was poor as well. Often times Target has good quality plastic serveware (My sweetie insists on drinking from plastic cups) and I could not find any here. Which was quite odd.\nI normally like Target, but this location is different from others I've been to.
