I chose this place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, the staff are super friendly and very nice. We had very good time. We ordered Jambalaya because of many pictures posted and looks like it is a famous dish at this restaurant. I hoped the food tastes better and that's why I gave 4 stars. I might be fine with one time trying this place.
