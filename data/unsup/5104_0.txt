Located inside the Asiana food court. Right next to Tous Le Jours Bakery! I am excited for all the brand new places that are popping up here :D\n\nThe day I went, they only had their noodles available, but I heard that their wings are delicious as well. \n\nI ordered the jajangmyeon (#5) on the menu. It was delicious! I recommend trying that for your first time and hen venturing to their other menu items. \n\nWill update my review once I get a chance to try the wings.
