Talk about good food!\n\nThe Charlotte Food Fight entry was a boneless pork chop cooked with 10 herbs\/spices, bourbon and  cloister honey. Also on the plate was an amazing Sweet Potato Casserole and bread Pudding - both just melted in your mouth. It was like an early Thanksgiving dinner! Great flavors and great textures.\n\nDefinitely one of my favorite trucks of the day!!!
