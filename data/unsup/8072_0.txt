This place blows\n\ncame by to some ridiculous system of VIP, regular line, lines for solos, lines for just women, and lines for groups that had more women than men\n\ncan you sexism? and how smart is it to have a club full of women with a ratio of 10-1 and thirsty guys jumping from one to the other?\n\nour group was thrown to the general line because we had one more girl than guy and said screw it because we were told we had to pay $30\/person\n\nhahaha that's funny y'all aint getting our money
