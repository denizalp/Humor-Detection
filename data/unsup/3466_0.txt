I have to drive 2 hours to shop at this store, I was very disappointed today. I was shopping for men's shorts and shirts. I could not find brands that I have previously purchased from this store, all I could find was MADE IN CHINA clothing. At previous visits I have purchased MADE IN USA  shorts and shirts. I'm not paying $200 for Chinese crap.
