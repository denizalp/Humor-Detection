Jackie is amazing! She has watched our kids for 6 1\/2 years! She is as much family as we are as parents. We started with one boy and grew to three boys. Jackie helped us grow as a family! Her ability not only to watch the kids but to help them in every aspect of growing up was outstanding!! We only wish she would of moved to Georgia with us!! Shamrock Sitters is the best!! Jessica who works for Jackie would be there from time to time and she was great as well!\n\nWe miss you Jackie!\nThe Gengs!
