I went to Planet Hollywood numerous times while visiting in Las Vegas. My hotel (Elara) was close by, so we always walked through.  I was here for restaurants, shops, and ambience. The atmosphere was always lively especially at night. There are a lot of food options to fulfill your hunger. There's a lot of eye candy here (ladies-expected in Vegas). People were always offering discounted show tickets. Even if you don't stay here, Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino is a cool place to visit. I give Planet Hollywood Las Vegas Resort & Casino a 3.5 rating.
