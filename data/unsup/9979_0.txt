I was so excited to try this place because of the 975 reviews, but it didn't quite do it for me. I got the Cha Cha Cha Ramen, my husband got the veggie. My ramen had a pile of raw white onions and green onions on top. Way too much onions!!! They did however get the \"katame\" correct. Broth more salty than rich. Veggie broth was not that impressive either. Brussels sprouts tempura was ok. Overall service was decent. Though the space could be a little cleaner.
