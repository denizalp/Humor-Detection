just plain AWFUL. First of all, the owner is rude and hates her life. Got an online coupon for a massage. They took me to a small room. The RMT was there (the person who I was supposed to get the massage from) but the owner sent me in with another random woman who wasn't even a masseuse! I asked for the RMT but the owner told me that I won't get her even though the coupon said so. The massage I got was pathetic as the woman had NO idea what she was doing.
