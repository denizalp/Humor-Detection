Just tried this place today, and it's my first time trying the sushi in Las Vegas. Thus far it is the worst sushi I ate in the U.S. And considering the reviews on this place, I'm hesitant to try sushi anywhere else in Vegas if this place is considered good.\nThe fish is not cut right or to the correct size, it's definitely not fresh, and all together it tastes poor. \nToday's was my first and last time at this place.
