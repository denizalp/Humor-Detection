Inexpensive, close to everything in Tempe living. Also not to far from anything in the valley. Live on the B side if u wanna save $money and your not a homebody like me. Plus they cut water off a lot! Hope your not in the shower when it happens! A side is cool and fancier but I heard the washer\/dryer machines suck! But things work perfect for them on the A side! Lots of pools and a hot tub! Massive dog park for pets!
