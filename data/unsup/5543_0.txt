Wow so disappointing.....got 3 meats over rice to go:\n-Ton of rice, very little meat, probably 4-6 pieces each\n-Roasted pork was almost all fat, not even thick crispy skin\n-Duck was not juicy or hot\n-Cha siu was ok, but thin, and very small portion\nSo much worse compared to Markham (ie. HKS BBQ in FMP)
