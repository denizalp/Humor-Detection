I met someone here for lunch and thought I would write a review upon entering the restaurant we were quickly greeted and were seated promptly I ordered a chicken stir fry egg plant dish and substituted the chicken for tofu and the egg roll for a spring roll without meat the portions were decent and the prices are reasonable but the food was bland . They are vegan\/ vegetarian friendly though and were more than happy to accommodate my dietary needs.
