I spent close to $18 to have my package shipped to me next day from Amazon.com.  If I'd known that I wouldn't get it until MONDAY, I would have gone with a much, much cheaper option.  I only forked over the extra money because I wanted to have my firewire cable over the weekend and begin editing some footage together.\n\nOh, well, that's not going to happen.  Seriously, stick with UPS or even the U.S. Postal Service.  This is the most expensive delivery option I've ever chosen to have come to me four days after I ordered it.
