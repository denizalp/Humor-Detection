I found E&S painters on Yelp and they just painted my home. They did a great job. They covered all surfaces that were not to be painted and cleaned up after themselves. Eduardo is great to work with. He explained everything  and provided options. I was out of town the day they finished and he called me to let me know then returned  to my home the next day for inspection  and payment. I recommend them.
