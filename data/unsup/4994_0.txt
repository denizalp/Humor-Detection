This is a clean place with a few TV's around. You order your food and they call your number when it's ready. They have a pretty diverse menu, so there's probably something for everyone.\n\nI had a late lunch and ordered one of the specials, Chicken Parmesan sandwich. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. I've been in there for breakfast as well. The breakfast sandwiches are good but can be a little pricey.
