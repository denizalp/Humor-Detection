What an awful airport!!!\n\nSo disorganized and poorly signed. I suppose it's fine if you already know where everything is but I do not and to me, this place blows.\n\nAlso, the FILTHY restrooms and rude customer service people do nothing to help the place. Big whoop for free wi-fi, it's just about everywhere these days.
