Cafe ZuZu has a Rock'in BREAKFAST !!!! First, the BEST bloodymary I have ever had!! niiiiiice and spicy. The eggwhite omelet and the cheesy grits are to die for !! I wanna go back soon!!! Or maybe It was just too much vino from the night before..........Either way.............it hit the spot perfectly :)
