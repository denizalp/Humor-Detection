I love Michaels! The employees have always been really helpful if I can't find what I'm looking for. They have an awesome section of adorable home decor. Not to mention the generous amount of DIY and craft supplies they offer. I also love the fact they always have coupons out and I don't ever have to pay full price. The only drawback is their checkout line usually takes a little too long, but they are always very nice.
