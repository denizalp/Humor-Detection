I am a big mongolian fan.  My trip to this location was very unenjoyable.  It was very hot inside which made us unable to enjoy sitting in the restaurant.  When we left we saw the thermostat was set to 84.  The cook also used a lot of water while cooking causing no flavor what so ever for either of our meals.  The hostess asked others around us how their meals were but avoided asking us (I was not eating my food).
