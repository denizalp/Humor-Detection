Great addition to the CityScape lineup!  This is a big place with TONS of beers on tap, sweet cushy leather seats and friendly employees.  So far I've only been for happy hour, which is great because they offer deep discounts on local beers.  I'm definitely looking forward to sampling some of the food options.  \nMy one complaint - most of the songs we heard here (I've yet to see a live band here) were horribly outdated top 40 hits that I wish I had forgotten about.  Clearly that's a matter of taste though ;)\nLooking forward to going back!
