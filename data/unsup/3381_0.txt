I have been coming to Park 51 cafe for 15 years. (Since I was a little girl.) Every time I get the same thing. PANCAKES! They have the best pancakes in Charlotte. They serve breakfast all day which is very convenient. I honestly prefer their breakfast food over their lunch or dinner food. (Which is still good) would definitely suggest this restaurant!
