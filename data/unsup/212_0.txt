Stay AWAY from the black dude at the shop! He literally cut me on my face and acted like all was okay. I'm not certain if it was deliberate or he's just that retarded and incompetent. Visiting this shop sincerely dampened Vegas as I wore my gash like a freaking face tat. My buddies were served from the other barbers and their cuts came out decent. I so should've followed their lead.
