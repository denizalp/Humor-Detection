Lovely dining room hidden in the back of a coffee shop. We had a 6 course tasting menu designed + prepared by chef David Bulman. \n\nJust like a good superhero, each course came with a great origin story. Almost every ingredient was sourced from western Pennsylvania (with the only outlier coming from western New York).\n\nThis was a really special dining experience. Can't wait to come back!
