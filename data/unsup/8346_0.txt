Wade Lagoon is absolutely beautiful in the spring time! The flowers all blossom, providing a great place for photo shoots and romantic picnics :) \n\nThe only downside about Wade Lagoon is that it may be unsafe at night or if you come here alone. Because this lagoon is inverted and not really visible on the main roads, some unfortunate incidents have occurred here in the past. There are two emergency booths with phones connected to UCPD if you do ever feel unsafe!
