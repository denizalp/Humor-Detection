We stayed Friday-Monday at planet hollywood. Checked in Friday at 5:30 pm ..no wait and I let front desk know I did not want charging privileges so that they would not hold a deposit on my credit card ..this was no problem \nOur room was on the 23rd floor ..it was clean and comfortable but no view, but we only paid 300 for the 3 nights so no biggie\nRoom service was great, fast and huge portions ..I recommend the prime rib! \nWould definitely stay here again.
