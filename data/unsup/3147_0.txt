They suck! The man that answers the phone cancelled my appointment I had scheduled for 2 weeks. He said, \"I thought you werent going to make it.\" WTF! Almost lost my job because I couldn't  get a letter stating I would be out of work from the nurse because he changed my appointment so I didn't even get to see the nurse to prescribe my meds and give me time off to finish outpatient treatment. He said, \"go to the emergancy room.\" That blew up my two weeks of cebrity. What an Asshole thing to say.
