We decided to come to California Pizza with some friends.  There pizza is pretty good for being a chain restaurant.  Our waitress was really sweet and hope us with pick out a pizza from their menu.  We decided to get the Meat Cravers. \n\nWe even had dessert, that normally does not happen,  but since there was four of us,  we split the new s'more dessert.  The s'mores desert was not all that great,  it was to salty and tasted like it came from a instant pudding box.
