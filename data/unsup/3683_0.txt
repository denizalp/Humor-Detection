I live right down the street from Papago, so I love its close proximity to my place. Driving up Galvin Parkway (which goes through Papago Park) is a refreshing drive and makes me forget that I'm in the middle of Phoenix (you also miss a lot of traffic going to Old Town or Mill). \n\nThere are some good, easy trails for fun hiking (nothing like Camelback or Squaw Peak). Also there are multiple rock formations you can climb up and see great views of Phoenix. It's especially fun to go there and watch the sunset!
