I have dined here both during lunch and dinner and always leave with clean plate no leftovers great filling meals . I suggest the lettuce wraps as a appetizer they are great and not so filling to ruin your appetite for main coarse. I would say during height of dinner rush service is slow but I'm sure they are doing there best and if out with friends and family allows a lot of time to talk . Also ordered the duck once and it was great nice and juicy not dry like you sometimes get when eating out
