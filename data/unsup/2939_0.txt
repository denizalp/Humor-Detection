I enjoy this gym and visit it 5-6 times a week. I have a trainer once a week, named Alex, who challenges me with new workouts and gives me encouragement every time. I appreciate the amount of equipment available. \n\nThere are only two things I wish were different. 1 - they don't offer towels but they have a pool. 2 - some of the equipment (in the training area especially) keeps getting moved. Maybe more kettle bells and a reminder \"We are a bring your own towel facility!\" sign would help.
