Haven't done a fun photo shoot in a long time. Yesenia the photographer did an excellent job. She was very patient and professional posing us to get just the right shot. The sets and props were very exciting which made it difficult to choose which scene to use. After the shoot was complete, it was time to choose best shot. Went in for 1 8x10 and walked out with 1 8x10 and 4 5x7's. They were just too good to pass up. Highly recommend this company. Will return when we next pass through town.
