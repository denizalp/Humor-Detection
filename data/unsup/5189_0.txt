First off ill start by saying ive given this place 3 tries!!! And it's sucked every time! Hands down the worst dispensary in town, terrible!!. Prices suck. Process sucks. There's limited product. Wait time sucks. Literally only went back because it's close to home. Defiantly will not be going back.... turned off.
