I just finished my six weeks boot camp. It was awesome and tough at the same time.  Trainers and staff were awesome throughout the six weeks. I managed to lose 30+lbs..those guys got me back in shape and definitely changed the way I'm gonna eat. I just wanna thank Dave and his staff for putting my confidence and health back on track..\n\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone ..!!\n\n                                                    Thank you \n\n                                               KIKO HOCOG
