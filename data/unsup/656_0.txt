I love this restaurant. It is close to our home. Delicious Italian food with some dishes that pay homage to some Filipino Fare. The Italian Flavors capture the essence of Italy with rich sauces and pasta cooked perfectly. The seafood is fresh fresh fresh! Le Especialita eran Molto deliciozo. The pasta mediterranea is my favorite.
