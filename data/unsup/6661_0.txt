I went for breakfast yesterday here! The cost is 21.95 pp there are a lot of food choices not just breakfast but brunch as well. They have a crepe station!!!! Amazing crepe , seriously!!!  Omelet station, which I didn't try and a huge dessert bar! They also offer all you drink bloody Mary's and mimosa's.. this is my complaint, you aren't informed by your waiter about the all you can drink I read it on the sign on my way out the door!!! Probably best since I had work to do!
