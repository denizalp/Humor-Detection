Great place for a date night, a group, they have outdoor seating for the summertime, and it's right in the middle of shops and the movie theater so convenience box is checked . My boyfriend and I have an M.O. - get delicious shakes, watch whatever game is on the tv by the bar, and then go see a movie. Service is fabulous here! Wouldn't go to any other burgatory!
