Super clean and excellent location around the corner from Notre Dame and less than a half a block from Rue Saint Paul, the Main Street in old Montreal. Service was also very friendly. Valet price was reasonable. I deducted a star because the mattress and pillows were extremely uncomfortable. The sides of the mattress offered no support. They had too much give. Maybe this was because the mattress was on a Murphy bed instead of a regular box spring? Pillows were lumpy.
