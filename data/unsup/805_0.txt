Preferred collision repaired my daughters car that had $4k in hail damage.  The day before we were to take it in my daughter backed into another vehicle, causing another $5k in damages. Preferred Collision took care of both claims and did excellent work.  The thing I like best is they did not cut corners and they called me with weekly updates.  I did not have to take my car back after they completed their work.  Everything was done correctly the FIRST time.  Quality is the work I would use to describe the body shop.
