Great food at a fair price.  First time trying seafood prepared this way and I must say the flavors are delicious!  Came in just before noon and there were plenty of seats available.  Looked over the menu and decided on the teriyaki fried fish with rice.  They brought out a sizzling hot plate along with a mixed bag of shellfish seasoned with cajun spices and butter.\n\nOverall a great dining experience and the food was great as well.  Will definitely come back to this location in the future.
