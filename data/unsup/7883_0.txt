Gawd i love this place.  Anyone wanna meet me for chicken and waffles???\n\nI got lost the first time i went looking for it, but the search was well worth it.  GREAT chicken and real homemade waffles that put eggos to shame.\n\nTry the mac and cheese too.  I'm sure that if Lolos was closer to my house, i would gain 20 pounds
