I've been her multiple times PRAYING that the food would knock me out and the service would at least treat you like it's important to have paying customers come in to this Overrated establishment \nWorkers all look like zombies with bad knees and hips SLOW and smug attitudes\nI stood her today for 10 minutes with no one asking if I wanted to order\nI finally caught the attention of a girl and she smuggly stayed we'll be right with you\nFogettaboutit ur dead to me we're walking somewhere else!!!
