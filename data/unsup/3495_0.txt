I just love Chick-n-Joy. I got 12 pieces of chicken, fries, gravy biscuits all for $23.00.  So affordable and the chicken taste like Kfc's old recipe. Even a day old the chicken and biscuits are still edible. This place deserves a five star, the food is great. Not a fancy type restaurant but a hang out quick meal type restaurant.
