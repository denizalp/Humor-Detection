1. Unprofessional\n2. Rude\n3. Incompetent.\nI rent a manufactured home and the owner of the property hired this company to take care of mold in the crawlspace caused by a leaky water heater. Instead of removing all the mold from the crawlspace they tore apart the kitchen and put the drying machine in there instead of the crawlspace where the mold was. After repeated request to come back and remove the rest of the mold I gave up they would not do it.
