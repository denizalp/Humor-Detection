We asked a random couple on the street for a kid and dog friendly recommendation - and Diego Pops delivered.  Plenty of outdoor seating and good tacos at reasonable prices.  The service was not great (appeared not want to take our order, forgot to bring water for dog, didn't quite understand how to serve with kids at table\/ not put glasses of water in front of grabby infant), and they only have 1-2 high chairs for the entire restaurant.\n\nVery relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere.   Food was good, but could have used something to punch it up a bit.
