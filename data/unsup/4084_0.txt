Extremely unprofessional office staff....specifically the Clinic Manager and the Appointment Coordinator.   You get the run around via email constantly.   They will never return a phone call.   Also, the student\/future doctor will not return an email or phone call message.   Yes it is a lot less expensive than a traditional office but that is really the only perk.   It is sad how they are preparing the future doctors for the real world where they will have to communicate with people.
