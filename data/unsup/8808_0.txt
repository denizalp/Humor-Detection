To quote another review, \"they trick you into thinking you got a good deal.\"\nAbsolutely true.\nBy the time you get done paying for EVERYTHING, your seat, bags, carry on's, you might as well have flown an airline you like, that you can log miles with.\nDon't let the advertised low airfares fool you, you will end up paying in the end and it will be just as much as a flight on a real airline.\nThey fooled me once, it will not happen again.
