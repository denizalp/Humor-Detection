This is a great place to get dog's teeth cleaned!  My Cooper was 12 when he had his done last year.  They kept me informed throughout the process of his progress and then after the Vet came out to tell me all about it and what to expect in the recovery process.  I was very worried because of Cooper's age. But all was great.  He lost a few teeth too.  This was also VERY affordable and worth the drive to save a lot of money. I highly recommend this place!!!
