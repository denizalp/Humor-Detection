Yardbird takes dining to a new level. Of course the food is great and can't go wrong with the fried chicken and biscuits. Surprised by the waffle with the bourbon maple syrup as that definitely topped our list. \n\nNow the way that they take it to another level is the staff. Everyone is so nice and courteous as they all have the southern charm. Christina is by far the best waitress as she brings a positive energy and has a good aura about her. \n\nWe definitely will be back.
