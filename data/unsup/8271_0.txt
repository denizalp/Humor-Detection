Lovely restaurant tucked away in the Seville shops. All wait staff and the chef (yes, the chef came to see how our food was!) was extremely friendly. House salad with homemade French dressing was superb, as were the frog legs and lamb medallions we ordered for entrees. The crepe belle-helene with pears, cinnamon and honey was a perfect ending to the meal. Will be back here more often for sure, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an authentic French experience. Also, beautiful pastries, especially if you come on the weekend :)
