This place looks so beat up and ghetto durning the daylight hours. Its very far from Vegas on the outskirts out North. Tons of parking but watch so your car don't get broken into or jacked. Tons of homeless people out front. The dance floors nice and the pool tables are back by the restroom. The stage where bands perform is a good size and the sounds decent.
