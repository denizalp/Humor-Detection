Nothing too special about this place. It's like a Taco Truck with an inside. The meal was average and was a little on the watery side for the meat. They had a good selection of sauces on the salsa bar and had good customer service. \n\nI saw some people get super big burritos and large portions of nachos. My dining companions enjoyed their meals. Has good late hours.
