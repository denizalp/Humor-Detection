This place is over priced and has poor quality products, even for a dollar store.  \n\nThe one added bonus is that they cut keys.  They don't really do that well though.  I'd say only about 80% of the keys they cut for me work.  \n\nIf a dollarama ever finds it's way into liberty village, this place will go out of business in no time.
