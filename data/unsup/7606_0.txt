I stay here for work sometimes.  Comfortable rooms, TV dish not so reliable, but who's in LAS to watch the tube?  Breakfast is the usual \"just add water\" eggs and turkey sausage, but a good choice of cereals and yoghurt, cantaloupe, and coffee.\nGreat thing here is the staff.  Some REALLY friendly and helpful folks here,, especially KT, and Wally!!!  Cool people!!
