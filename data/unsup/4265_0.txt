I hate giving a chain more than three stars. This one is always super-clean, super-fast and super-accurate. I can't believe how fast the line moves, during the weekday lunch rush. I always feel like I've spent a tad too much for such run-of-the-mill Chinese food, but since I'm pretty sure that the secret ingredient in the Beijing Beef is crack, I spend it anyway. \n\nYum.
