Danny Boy's is a fun, low-key restaurant. The menu is extensive with sandwiches, pizzas, pastas and salads. My favorite is the chopsticks and fingers salad which has chicken fingers, breadsticks and a delicious honey mustard dressing. The pizza is good too with many toppings to choose from. The restaurant walls are filled with Rat Pack memorabilia but the music playing is modern and doesn't match the decor. The one downside is the service that can be hit or miss-sometimes perfect, sometimes overbearing and sometimes nonexistent. Danny Boy's is a fun and delicious place for an easy meal.
