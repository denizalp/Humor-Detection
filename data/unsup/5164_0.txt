I loved Art of Flavors when Desyree was there, but thank god she's on her own now with Gelatology. The best thing is that it's less than 10 minutes from home now. \n\nDesyree still makes the best gelato and sorbetto! I can literally go here everyday without getting tired of their gelato. My favorites so far include the sweet corn, cinnamon toast crunch, rose petals, rice pudding, ugh I can't possible list them all. \n\nThe service is still 5 stars! I can't wait to see what else Desyree has in stock for us.
