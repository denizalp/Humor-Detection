I was walking in the Eaton Centre last Sunday and this was the first time that I had noticed Trinity Square (including this Anglican church) which is located right up against the mall (on the opposite side from Yonge). The square also includes a few separate buildings, a cafe, and a labyrinth path. \n\nWhat an interesting juxtaposition between spiritual solitude and capitalist worship! I very much enjoyed the tranquility of this old brick complex and the break from any further shopping for the day.
