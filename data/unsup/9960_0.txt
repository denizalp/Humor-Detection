This place has become my new home.  The trainers are willing to work with you, are engaging, and actually care about outcomes.  The staff celebrates your victories and helps you get over defeats.  I feel happy to go to the gym everyday, even on those days when you feel like its the last thing you want to do.  The classes are able to be adapted based upon your needs (I have the knees of a 90 year old), but with adaptations and modifications I am able to complete the entire workout!
