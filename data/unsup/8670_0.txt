You can obviously tell that the staff here hate their jobs. You get sassy attitude thrown at you as soon as you arrive. The seemingly simply task of getting a salad turns into a game of 1912 questions, end result = super fail. The prices are pretty high for the chintzy amounts of flavour they add in. \n\nOverall vibes: No bueno, go to L-eat around the corner for similar eats and better prices.
