One of the oldest still-running roller coasters in the world.Â Not only an amazing piece of nostalgia, but a really fun wooden roller coaster ride. The line is usually long, but be patient, it moves quickly enough and soon you are in for a real treat. \n\nDefinitely at the top of my Kennywood checklist, along with the Thunderbolt and the Racer.
