Okay, so me and my fellow alcoholic friends were roaming Mill Ave on a Satuday night looking for a place to have a great time. \n\nSo we hiked up the stairs, were let in for no cover (surprise, surprise) and we found only about 6 other people where in there. The bartender was awesome and extremely skilled. The drinks were two for one, hooray. It has a cool view of Mill Ave as well. \n\nGreat music, packed with people, and cheap drinks. Cannot go wrong with that! Fun.
