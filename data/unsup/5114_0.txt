Good, not great.  I could explain all the things that make this place merely so-so, but who really cares?  A lot of people will see this 3-star review and act like it's a 1-star review.  The place is fine.  I'll just never go back.  Typical Charlotte.  A bajillion 5-star reviews, leaving me scratching my head.  Again, place is ok, but people are acting like it's something special. It's not.  The humblest street crepe in Paris is 10x better and a third the cost.
