I recently had my vehicle repaired at Gerber after being hit in an empty parking lot by a distracted driver.  The entire staff made the experience pleasant.  Jordan did the estimate and handled the communication with the insurance company.  I was able to leave my stress at the door, and they handled the rest.  The women at the front desk were kind and respectful, and connected me with Enterprise for a rental.  I was kept up to date on all progress.  My car was repaired promptly, and it looks excellent!  I'm very relieved at how smoothly the process went.
