Not terribly impressed.  Yes, it is inexpensive, but it does not have all that many other merits.  The food is a sort of passable imitation of  Vietnamese and some other Asian cuisines.  The pho they rave about so much had kind of a weird tasting broth and other dishes were just so-so.  Get out of downtown and go to an ethnic Vietnamese conclave instead for better Vietnamense food.  Service was okay.   Atmosphere is nothing special either.
