I cant rave enough about this souvlaki place; having the desire for calamari one afternoon and not wanting to cook, I thought about Crete's.\n\nLo and behold they did have take out and if you order more than 20 dollars worth of food, delivery is free.\n\nNonetheless, you know I went and done it, delicious mouth watering calamari, the lamb souvlaki and two huge orders of bakalava, my food was ready and in less than thirty minutes was at my doorstop.\n\nThis place is a must have foodie for you foodies out there.
