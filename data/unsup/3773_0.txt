New business in town. \nI went to their free wash on first day and just loved the service. \nI was greeted by a polite young man who gave me directions for the wash. Then later greeted by a young lady who gave me  some car deodorizers and a cloth. \nMy car was spotless and smelled great at the end. \nI will be signing up for the 14.99 unlimited packet. \nWelcome to town guys.
