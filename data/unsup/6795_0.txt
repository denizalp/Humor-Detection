I booked Robin des Bois after an extensive search for something that would appeal to my 10 year old as well as 6 of our friends to celebrate my husbands birthday. Everyone was super nice and the food was delicious. Next time I'm in Montreal, I will be staying within walking distance so we can try out their brunch menu!
