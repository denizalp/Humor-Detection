I absolutely loved this place! The winter melon is a dream! I would greatly recommend dropping by place this to any tea lover! It has lovely clean environment with big screen TVs to relax with while sipping your delicious tea or eating one of their delicious puddings! I am definitely going back! Everything is made fresh and in a timely manner. The customer service was great as I could tell from my one visit. There were many people inside this place but it never had a line built up. Drop by and try it!
