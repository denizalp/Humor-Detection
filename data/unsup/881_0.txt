You would expect good service at a place like this when you reserve a bed and multiple bottles. Wynn management here's some feedback: \n\nIf you want to keep attracting clients that actually reserve a bed and add bottles on top of the minimum you should hire employees that meet quality service. Brushing off requests and long waiting periods are huge turn offs. Your establishment has high potential.  \n\nFirst time at a Wynn establishment.  Disappointed. Had very high expectations that were not met.
