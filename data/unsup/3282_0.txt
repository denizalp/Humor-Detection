When you're a gay man in a straight woman's body, you tend to check out gay bars. A lot of gay bars. \n\nIn a past life, I wandered in here and though I love drag shows, this one didn't have a good one. \n\nWhere are the divas?\n\nWhy do they have someone impersonating the creepy Johnny Depp Willy Wonka?\n\nHelp?!
