This is a FREE show inside the Forum Shops.  They play it about once an hour.  By far it is not something you should go out of your way to see, but if you are shopping and wander by, it's worth a few minutes to watch it.  Basically, just fire, smoke, water, loud music, and changing lights.  It might amaze children, so if you have them, it's a FREE show.
