First time at this place and I was blown away instantly. We ordered the French quarter and Chicago stuffed pizzas. They were not only delicious, but surprisingly healthy. Didn't feel bloated afterwards at all. \n\nThey also do a buy one get one free deal, so we ordered 4 specialty pizzas and it came out to be $36 total. What a deal. \n\nFrench quarters pizza had shrimp!! What an amazon pizza. Go and try it out for yourself and be amazed.
