Absolutely the worst dining experience possible. Rancid stale food at obnoxious prices. Obnoxious chef. No care for the customer. By the third of my five courses I was so disgusted that I didn't want to eat anymore, yet they charged me full price. The fish they served stank, literally stank. If you complain they won't listen, and if you decline the food, you will pay for it anyway. This is the worst dining experience I've had in my entire life.
