I didn't know it was possible to be disgusted and made to feel so little\/worthless by a DOCTORS OFFICE until I met Dr Gino and his staff. \n\nBeware, Dr Gino has good bedside manner AT FIRST but know he: is dishonest, overcharges and it takes multiple attempts to MAKE appointments. Avoid at all costs.
