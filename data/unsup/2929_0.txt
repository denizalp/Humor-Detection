CLOSED???  I'm somewhat confused because it's reported here by some that closed Nov. 2013 but there are posts dated after that date.\nSo - I went here (sporadic) ONLY because Gerry R. (Scottsdale stylist I've gone to off and on for wow, 30+ years) was here.     While I'm a huge fan of his, I wouldn't otherwise recommend this salon - and I found them the priciest of all the salons where Gerry hung his scissors.
