Another great experience and I didn't totally screw over my diet!\n\nI had a chili cheese dog, no bun and my man had a breakfast dog. Holy breakfast dog--get this thing, like now. A fried egg, bacon and cheese all on a dog? You bet your ass.The chili dog was great, even without the bun and the chili itself was very meaty with what I think were black beans. I also ordered a salad and skipped the fries. \n\nThe owner is awesome, the bartender was a peach and the drinks are cheap. \n\nLove this place!
