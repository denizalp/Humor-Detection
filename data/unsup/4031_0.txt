As far as dive bars go, this is a pretty good one. It's got everything that a little \"indie treasure\" like this should have: pretty good beer selection (including a fridge full of one-off craft beers), excellent music, and creepy washrooms. Wouldn't say the drinks were cheap though.\n\nIt's a bit dark, and there really isn't any decent seating to be had in the winter. It's got the usual blend of hipsters, and sad old drunks, but that's okay. I sort of like drinking alongside ironic, and unironic beards.
