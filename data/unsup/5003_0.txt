Came in on a Friday night with no customers in the restaurant except the workers mother and daughter. Two people working here and both on their cell phones and yes he was cooking our food while on it. Not once did we get a smile from either worker. The 3 stars is for the food it was good but with that kind of customer service they have they will be closing faster than Johnny Rockets did the second time.
