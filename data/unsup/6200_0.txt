This place is fun. Good music. The nurses spank you if you do not finish your food, which drew an audience from people passing by outside. Food portions are oversized. The food is not great, but it is something you should try at least once.\n\nI ordered the 1\/2 pound chilli dog with fries, a jello shot and vanilla butterfat milkshake. I sure felt like dying later, but really did not want to be spanked.
