Starbucks has a great location. It's perfect to take a break from shopping or to fill up some new energy with an iced latte or tea before exploring Downtown Summerlin. The people are very nice and I got always satisfied with the Drinks. When you come in Starbucks is sometimes fully crowded or almost empty. Keep the opening hours of Macys in mind, because Starbucks is in the mall and closes every day 30 minutes before the mall does. Customer service is excellent and store clean. In total I am happy with this place and hope you too!
