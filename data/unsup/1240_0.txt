This Thrift Store reminds me of HOW Thrift Stores used to be...cheap and full of random findings (before Savers and other various Thrift stores that are overpriced!)\n\nYou never know what treasures you'll find. They have really great prices too! I found an Ann Taylor cardigan for $3.00!\n\nNo PUBLIC RESTROOMS...so if you just chugged down a Venti Latte from Starbucks, you better hold it or find a potty across the street.
