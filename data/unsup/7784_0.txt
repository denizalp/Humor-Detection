Very good. Met all the expectations I had. It was a solid poutine with salty gravy, hardy cut fries, and melty stringy cheese curds. I got the chicken inferno. It was very good and had just the right amount of heat so that it didn't mask the poutine flavor. Definitely want to come back and try them all !!
