2.51 stars.\n\nWhat can I say?  The highlight of this buffet for me was the mashed potatoes with whole cloves of roasted garlic mixed in.  Yum.\n\nThe peel and eat shrimp was better than other buffets.  Crab legs were a fail.  The carving station meats were ok.  This buffet had pad thai...labeled as stuffed shells or something.  Strange.\n\nThe service was unimpressive bordering on rude and hurried.\n\nOverpriced.
