By far the best Mexican restaurant on this side of town. I've never had a bad experience. The team here is friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable. The inside decor is up to date and down right cute. With an open kitchen concept, you can see that everything is made fresh. It lacks a functioning drive through but if you call ahead they will walk your food to you. EAT HERE!
