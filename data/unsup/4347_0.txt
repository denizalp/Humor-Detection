Always a good experience and great deals when I come here. Parking can be a little tough during some hours because of the super market next door but cvs has extra parking on the side. Other than that the customer service here is really good and they're friendly. I go in for some lipsticks I like to get and essentials. There's always deals going on and some one around asking if you need any assistance which sometimes I do because I want something specific hehe.
