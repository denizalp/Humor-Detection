In my opinion this is the best Mexican place in town. Yes I've been to Lindo Michoacan and yes I've been to Viva Zapata. My favorite is the Enchiladas Guadalajara and the Fried Ice Cream when it is fresh. Hole in the wall and not that big. They only have one waitress for the whole restaurant so when it's busy it's crazy but very much worth everything.
