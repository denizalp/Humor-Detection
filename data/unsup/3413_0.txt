Everything I've had is great and they're flexible with accommodating orders! Loved my tuna nicoise salad today - roasted tomatoes and good olives were on point, as was the delicious mustard vinaigrette. All the lunch sides are great, too. I REALLY appreciate that they mark what is dairy free\/vegan\/gluten free.\n\nI've had coffee several times as well and it never disappoints!
