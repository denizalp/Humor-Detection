Lots of fun things to do at Planet Hollywood!\n\nThis property is great because of its location and all the fun things inside of it! From the mall with so many great stores & restaurants to all the different shows, the central location, the clean casino & nice rooms this property is great all the way around. \n\nThere's also tons of parking spaces & it's convenient to get in & out of. \n\nIf you're checking in it's worth upgrading to a strip view because you'll see the amazing Bellagio fountains!
