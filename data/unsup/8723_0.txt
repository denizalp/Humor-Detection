I love this man like he is my father! What an epic and delicious meal- thank you- we are honored!! We got treated to herring roe (a seasonal delicacy) as well as the most delightfully fresh salmon, yellowtail, uni- even the ginger and wasabi are FRESH and vibrant. Hot and cold sake and a down to earth atmosphere make this place just the best. Love your art and colorful decor. This is my happy place!!!!!!!!!!
