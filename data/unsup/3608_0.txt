I'm a little ashamed to admit this, but I came here strictly due to the crazy publicity. I was surprised at how nice the owners were to us.   However, Sami said three times to us to come back for dinner as it's delicious.  Owners shouldn't have to try to convince customers that many times in the five minutes there.   I actually enjoyed the chocolate macaroon.  The apple pie was the worst I have ever had.  Excessively sweet and way too much cinnamon.   Way too expensive for what we bought.  Seems more of a tourist trap than anything.  Guilty!
