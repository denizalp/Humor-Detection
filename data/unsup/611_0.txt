First experience with The Chopping Block will be the last.  My girlfriend was treated with contempt by an unfriendly and dismissive server who seemed to be \"put out\" by having to help a customer.  The meat we purchased was among the worst I've ever had, laden with gristly fat, over spiced (probably to mask the low quality meat) and over priced.  Avoid at all costs.
