We found this patisserie a few steps away from where we were staying in Montr√©al, and is basically the most amazing pastries I've ever had. The pistachio and cherry eclair is not to be missed, but anything from here is sure to delight! Even the coffee is amazing and I'm not a coffee lover. Do yourself a favor and try it, simply incredible
