I visit this location hoping to run into my Yelp husband, boo, Marc. Lol Ok, I kid.\n\nThis is the closest full size S&S near my home. The other one near me is extremely small with a very limited selection of everything. \n\nWhile this is not my fave location, the employees here are helpful and I always find what I'm looking for. There is ample parking too.
