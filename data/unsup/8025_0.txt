My first time and sadly last time here was in 2007. \nI'm very heart broken that this shut down. The food there was amazing and so was the service. I really really loved the Warp Core Breach and I was hoping to go back again this year. I only found out it shut down today. \nOh the staff was absolutely amazing also! The Borg, Ferengi and Klingon. I was more impressed with the Klingon! Hilarious character. \nBRING IT BACK!!!! I so want to go back! And I know I'm not the only one too.
