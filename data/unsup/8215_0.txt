There are so many hipster places opening up left and right.   Looks pretty but not so tasty.   Not this place.   Everything is so tasty!!  Like give me 2 of them tasty.   Only downfall.   Small portions.  I really need 2 portions to feel satisfied . Hence the 4 stars.  But the food is still really good! So I'll be back
