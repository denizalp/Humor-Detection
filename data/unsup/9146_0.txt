Last day in Montreal and I wish I came here sooner! Olive & Gourmando has awesome selection of pastries. We had chocolate croissant, almond croissant, and a brioche. The brioche had apple, chai, and caramel. The brioche reminded me of a cinnamon roll but with apples in it. Both croissant was crunch on the outside and soft in the inside. I enjoyed the chocolate croissant the most. I also ordered a Flat white and a latte. The drinks were okay. They also have breakfast but I only got takeout on their pastries and loved it!
