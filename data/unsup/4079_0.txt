So I decided to try this place out last night and I had a horrible experience, the staff was rude and inattentive they didn't bother to check on my party or offer refills had to flag down employees several times even though restaurant was not busy. The food was bland and left me with an upset stomach after I had left. If you want to try a place to get good Indian food go to Ambar India because sitara was just not up to par.
