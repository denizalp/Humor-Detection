I waited an hour, for Ubereats delivery (which was originally supposed to take less than 40 minutes) only for the restaurant to cancel my order, 12 minutes before they close at 8:48pm. This also made it more difficult to find something else that was open. They shouldn't accept an order, then cancel it an hour later. NOT OKAY.
