You know you're in for trouble when the guy keeps calling you \"buddy\". I know when I'm doing business, I often find it's totally acceptable to refer to someone as \"buddy\", who says you need to be polite?! (Sarcasm jic). \nTotal jerks from word 1. Do yourself a favor and look for a company with more than a handful of obviously fake positive reviews.
