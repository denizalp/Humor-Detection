Horrible service. Store is unorganized. Some items were dusty on the shelves. Everyone has an attitude and is less than helpful. They have no idea what customer service is. Also, found a hair in my cheese pita which was what made me realize what a joke the employees and management are when I called to complain. They just hung up. Never got to tell them what happened. Just said I wanted to speak to a manager to complain and got hung up on.
