After speaking to Patty at some length about how good they are at what they do and how long they've been doing it, I decided to go with them. I even gave them a code to go inspect my house to determine estimate. I week later, a day before my move, I call to confirm. She just said 'oh shit' blamed someone on vacation for not locking in the crew for my move the next day. I scrambled to find another mover and am now paying double because of the Sunday rates. Wouldn't recommend.
