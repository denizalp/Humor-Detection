Wow. The tisane l'apaisente is very soothing and relaxing after a long working day. With a lot happening around me I decided to take sometime for myself and go have tea. I saw earlier their cheesecake and it looked sooo delicious. This time i ordered it. Really mouth tangling and goes well with the relaxing tisane I ordered. Highly recommended.
