Pros: Decent rooms, fairly clean, nice pool and got the job done for short term stay\n\nCons: sorry if i offend anyone but everyone staying in these apartments is ghetto or trailer park trash. EVERY night I would hear people cursing outside, getting into fights, and domestic disputes. Bottom line = shady a$$ ppl and if you are a business professional coming to phoenix for a short stay, this is not your type of place. Get a hotel instead.
