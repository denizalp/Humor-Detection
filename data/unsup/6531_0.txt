I have had a membership here for well over one year. The business is getting more and more popular, with what appears to be more and more members. Unfortunately staffing levels remain the same. Very disapponted on a recent Saturday to wait 90 minutes. Only two stylists working. They would call out names and add \" are you still here\" indicating that they knew staffing levels were inadequate. Will most likely cancel my membership. Great business concept, but becoming very poorly executed.
