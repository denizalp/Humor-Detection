This review is simple to write. I have been sending clients here for the past couple of years for a reason. Any lawyer can close a real estate transaction but if something goes wrong, then you don't want just any lawyer, you want Mitch Korman on your side. I have never met such a dedicate group of lawyers that can handle anything without letting it get out of control. These people know their stuff. I give them 4 stars because if I give them 5, they may get too comfortable. Need to keep them on their toes.
