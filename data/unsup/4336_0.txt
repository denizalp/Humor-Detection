A place to go in a casino and NOT spend a lot of money!\n\nStrike Zone Bowling Center is located in the Sunset Casino.  We walked into very very clean lanes.  There are an abundance of lanes with a modern bar and snack bar on the opposite side.  \n\nLuckily with our schedule, we can take advantage of their specials.   Monday through Friday from 8am-Noon, they offer $1 games.  Talk about cheap entertainment! I'm not sure if this is offered at the other Station Casinos but it's definitely worth checking out.
