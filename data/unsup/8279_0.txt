Stopped by on a busy Saturday morning. Placed was packed! We waited about 10 minutes for our table for two. We had some pancakes and omelettes. Good stuff. Made to order and fresh. We topped off our meal with a huge cinnamon roll that was piping hot and tasty. Service was great as the staff was friendly and accommodating. Restaurant is also kept clean.
