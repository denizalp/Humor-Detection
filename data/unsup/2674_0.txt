This is my go-to Thai place. I get takeout usually a few times a month.  The service is really fast - usually done within 15 minutes of ordering.  All of the dishes I've tried are great though I usually get the spicy tofu eggplant .  The only reason I put four instead of five stars is because occasionally the food is not as good- maybe they have a different cook sometimes?
