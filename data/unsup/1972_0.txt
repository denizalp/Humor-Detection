Yes.... I am an Eggslut !\nOur first morning we were still on Detroit time so we hit the new Eggslut location just after opening, no wait for some excellent breakfast dining. \nWe shared a Fairfax with bacon and the Egg and Turkey sausage sandwich. Both excellent. \nFilled us for the day.\nWe were going to repeat on our last morning, a little later wake up time and the line was way way long. \nExcellent addition to the resort
