Service is bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Especially the cashier!!!!!!!!!!! The girl gave bad looks while I was ordering, and she purposely\/intentionally took the orders of 3 customers who werent there yet when I arrived... She constantly interrupts my ordering while continuously prioritizing other customers who just got in. Very rude!!!!!!!!!!!!!
