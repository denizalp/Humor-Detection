Extremely convenient and perfect place to brunch if your staying at Wynn Encore hotel. The steak and eggs with the skillet potatoes is absolutely delicious. I normally don't ever finish my plate and I simply devoured it. The skillet potatoes have a Cajun seasoning to it and they taste perfect with the steak which is also extremely good quality. Do visit this place for their breakfast if you have the time!
