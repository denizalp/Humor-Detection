I work in the same plaza where magoos is located. our staff visits this place a couple times a week. Everything is delicious. My colleague loves the chicken wraps(she doesn't eat red meat). The burgers are amazing! Great food and super friendly staff. Cash only(would eat here more if they accepted credit).
