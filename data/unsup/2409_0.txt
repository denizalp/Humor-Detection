Cannot say enough good things about this spot!  We came here for happy hour, which had cheap caiprinhas and small plates at the bar!  We ordered some steak skewers, a shrimp appetizer, and an umeshisho roll.  The apps were awesome (as ere the $6 caiprinhas and cucumber martini!), but they were out of umeshisho rolls.  The manager and bartender went way out of their way to make up for it, comping our martini, offering a free set of kobe beef tacos (to DIE for) and another pair of free drinks made with muddled strawberries.  Girly?  Undoubtedly.  Delicious?  Ohhh yeah!
