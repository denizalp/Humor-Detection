This is gonna sound snobby, but I knew to expect barely edible food inside Circus Circus so I ordered something that I thought was impossible to F up: Nachos. \n\nWell, for starters there's no guacamole, no sour cream, just some dry af pico, gigantic pickled jalepenos and COLD PRE PACKAGED CHEESE (ya know the cheap kind that comes covered in some weird white powder?).\n\nLiterally the only two things you need to make nachos is chips and MELTED CHEESE...this place couldn't even pull that off.
