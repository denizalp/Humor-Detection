I ate at Lo-Lo's today.\nI ordered chicken, waffles, and grits\nand lemonade in a mason jar\nfrom friendly, attentive waitress.\nI was all prepared with Lactaid pills,\nand still bracing for the worst for\nthere was butter on everything.\nEverything?\nEverything.\nBut I found out that somehow the heavens shine on Lo-Lo's.\nFor it's now 4 hours later.\nBelly still content.\nNo adverse reaction\nto delicious crispy fried chicken,\nbuttery waffles,\nand even more buttery grits with Louisiana hot sauce.\nNothing going on down there in belly-land.\nNada.\nTo which I say, \"Kickass.\"\nSo take that, Denny's.\nLo-Lo's is where it's at (just maybe not everyday).
