The service is really good here and the place is really crowded. My meal was unimpressive.  Chef Ramsay once said don't make it if your customers can do a better job at home.   I ordered Waynes favorite shrimp and the Fire fried salmon. Served up with your common-place fish sauce taken right out of the jar, the shrimp were dry and tasteless.  The salmon had a nice woody flavour but apart from that, was also very ordinary. Overpriced in my opinion.  Don't bother dressing up.  Wear any old thing even if it's your coveralls from work.
