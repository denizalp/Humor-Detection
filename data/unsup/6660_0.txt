Mister moon comes to the rescue on a Friday night after a busy week. I called a head to place my order and true to their word food was ready for pick up. Food is hot and freshly made. \nFamily favourite Cantonese Chow Mein and General Tao Chicken.\nPay cash save 10%. Spend $45-$50 get free box of chicken wings. Good food, generous portions and best part I got a night off from cooking......... Yeh!
