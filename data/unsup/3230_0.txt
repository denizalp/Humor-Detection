This location is now closed. \n\nNo business seems to make it on Liberty Avenue. Big Mama's House of Soul is gone, Chick Boutique is gone, The Cordon Bleu Culinary School is closing, The August Wilson Center is having money issues and now Dozen is gone. If Sweetlix closes next I will be pissed!\n\nI wasn't a fan of their dry, stale cupcakes, but I never like to see a downtown business fail. We don't have much there now.
