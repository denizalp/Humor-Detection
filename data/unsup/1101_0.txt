I took both S-63 Mercedes Benz to them for 3 years now and I will not allow anyone to work on them but Tony. I have taken them to three other places and other than expensive talk nothing happened. If you care for your German car or car in general you will not go wrong with this guys. They are the best in their field not to mention honest as well.
