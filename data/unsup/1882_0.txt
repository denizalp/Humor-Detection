You have to check out Pin Ups salon. I get my hair done by Kristen and have been going to her for years. She is very knowledgeable in her trade and will give you exactly what you want. This is an upscale salon and spa. They offer microdermabrasion, facials and waxing as well. The environment is comfortable and welcoming. \n\nGo check it out and you'll keep going back. This is a great Salon!
