Was there Friday night and I ordered all the meat tacos including steak, pulled pork, chicken and beef. All were amazing and very delicious I should say that I was extremely high prior to ordering and was very satisfied with my ordering decisions. I would highly recommend this joint and will be back friday to try all the fishy type tacos.
