I did not have a good experience at all with this nail salon. I went here, because my usual salon was not able to get me in. My nail tech was not friendly at all. She did not want to speak to me the entire time she did not nails. I have liquid gel nails and needed a fill. My nails look like blobs....  Not impressed not satisfied at all
