PRICEY. \n\nI came her because ever since I was in college everyone raved about how good this place was. It's been 8 years since and I have to say the price definitely outweighs the flavor here. It's tapas style where everything is a appetizer and you order a bunch to share. We order about 7 dishes and really only enjoyed 2:\n\nMushroom Tart\nLemon Butter Cod \n\nThe rest just wasn't worth the $8 price point. For example, the chorizo mushroom cap was literally 4 small BUTTON mushrooms. \n\nExtra star because service was good.
