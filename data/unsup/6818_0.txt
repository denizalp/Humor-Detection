Is it suppose to be sweet?\n\nI got the curry and the spicy chicken.\nIt's my first time trying it, So I don't know what to expect.\n\nThe curry taste like sweet doughnut.\nWhile the spicy one is a bit spicy from the outside but sweet from the inside. (The taste is confusing me).\nBoth chicken has bones in it too. \n\n\nIf it taste sweet then they're doing it right. \nIf not then I'm not sure what else to say.\n\nIts good to try though. \nThanks for the experience.
