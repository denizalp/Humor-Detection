The ramen here simply put is fantastic, I almost rated this place at 4 stars just because they're always busy because of the small seating space, but you can't blame them for that. The ramen is always filling and for an insanely cheap price, the place shuts any other noodle house down. Staff is usually fast also, never had a problem with my drink being refilled or my server asking if I needed anything.
