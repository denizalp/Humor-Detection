Been here about three times in the last week with my boyfriend. Each time is great. Good atmosphere. Small chill spot for no drama drinks and beers. \n\nWe come here all the time to the point where the bartenders remember we look even bloody Mary's. It's a place I always take friends who are visiting me.
