BEST BBQ EVER. Staff is always super friendly and the service is fast. As long as I live in Phoenix I refuse to get my BBQ fix anywhere else. I have tried almost everything on the menu and it's never dried out and is always flavorful - I would recommend everything but my first choice is always the pulled pork sandwich. Yum!
