Mmmhmmm...  This is my favorite quick spot for a sushi roll and I only spend 20$ at the most on myself they have amazing prices,  and the service is always fast and friendly.  Its kinda small inside but it makes for an at home feeling.  Spicy tuna roll with a side if there super spicy sauce is sooo good. The burn your ass roll is another favorite.  If you like spicy try it. Yummmmm sushi..
