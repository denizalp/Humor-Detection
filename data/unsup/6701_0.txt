Tonight my husband and I chose to eat at Flemings Steakhouse in Summerlin. What a nice evening we had. The food tonite was excellent. Every course was excellent. Not only was the food good but the quality was excellent. We have felt it was always good but the menu has changed a little and the server was top notch. Fun, knowledgeable, and was on top of everything. We like to eat early because it's quieter and more relaxed.  We will be back soon!
