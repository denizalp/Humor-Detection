Their Pupusas Revueltas rock, especially when you got extra burnt cheesey bits from the flat top.\n\nI also love their version of Horchata which is made with toasted\/burnt rice powder...The masa in their tamales are much softer than Mexican tamales\nand their Casamiento is also very good but does not come with chorizo like\nRincon Catratcho does.\n\ngood food overall, and no, you won't hear microwaves, the food is done right before your eyes, they have a see through glass at this location...ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(36\/365) \"Pass The Pupusas, Please!\"
