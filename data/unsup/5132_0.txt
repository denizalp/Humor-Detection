I called for a problem with my home lock, so I called for an an estimate. I was quoted a price, and when they came to fix the issue there was a misunderstanding on the price. I called and talked to Joey and he went out of his way to make it right. EXCELLENT customer service!! I like to have a trustworthy locksmith\/mechanic\/plumber....Etc, and I've found one. Thank you again, and I'll be using your services and recommending you guys to my friends and anybody I know who ask for a locksmith.
