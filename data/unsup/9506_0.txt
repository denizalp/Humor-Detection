Great food and menu but service was terrible. Quality sashimi. The grilled baby octopus was great. Would come back to try other menu items. Sat at the sushi bar and food came out timely. Getting my check took a bit long then I had to ask for an itemized receipt waited and waited and the server forgot my request.
