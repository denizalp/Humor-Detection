Tried Cabo for the first time a few years back, and wasn't very impressed. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was a Sunday, and it was slammed. Finally went back on a Tuesday night and the food was great, server was knowledgeable about the menu, and food was quick. Would make the 25 min drive again from huntersville to get the carne asada tacos.
