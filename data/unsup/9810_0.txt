Glad to have this pizza \"to go\" joint in the neighborhood.  They just opened in May 2012, and I got one of their grand opening special prices for a large pepperoni.\nThey got one of the most important things right: excellent quality cheese and plenty of it!  The sauce was very good, but just a little too spicy.  The regular crust I had was very nice.  Next time, I might try the thin crust, but I will definitely be a regular as long as the quality is there.
