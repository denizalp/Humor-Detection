We wanted cheap drinks and to enjoy the summer weather.\n\nCheap drinks were successfully received. $2 Mimosas on Sunday.\n\nEnjoying the weather was difficult. With no fans, not ceiling nor standing, the patio was a humid prison of sunlight and heat. \n\nThe patio speakers were not working, so it was like a library. Whomever spoke, everyone heard.\n\nAlexis was a server worthy of accolades.
