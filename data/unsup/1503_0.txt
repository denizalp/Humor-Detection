Lots of flavor and choices make this my new favorite. The addition of fried soft shell crab and fried alligator gives this place just a little something extra. And sweet potato fries are the icing on the cake. Can't resist those. \n\nOur waiter, Phil, had some pointers and options for us including a dry rub and  fresh lime juice dip to add even more flavor to my shrimp. Good suggestions all around. \n\nI definitely recommend this over some of the competition!
