If you're looking for a snack try the Naturally Bare cinnamon apple chips. They're dehydrated crunchy thick sliced apples. On the other hand, Cheddar Moon Cheese is weird. It's crunchy-hard cheese balls. Not a go-to, but it was something to try. Another thing that's always good are the That's It bars made from only fruit.
