This is a pretty cool little spot. A bar\/restaurant reminds me of places I would frequent in SoHo when I lived in New York. I came during the day and had a few drinks and apps with a friend. Pretty good drink menu and yummy apps. The second floor is more like a inside patio and overlooks the bottom floor. Pretty cool place that I'd like to frequent more. We all can use a little therapy here and there...
