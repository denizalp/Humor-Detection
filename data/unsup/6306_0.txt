THE FLOOR IS MADE OF OLD RECORD ALBUM COVERS!  HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG BUYING RECORDS FROM HERE?!\nSeriously though, I've popped in here a handful of times before going to shows at the Beachland and I almost always leave with something.  A nice selection of older stuff at very reasonable prices.  One thing I got there for like $5 that was a total steal was a copy of Bauhaus's \"Single 1981-1983\" on vinyl.
