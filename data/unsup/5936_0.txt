Buck and Honey's is very consistent with their food, drinks, and the service! The patio is a great place to enjoy lunch, dinner, or drinks. They are very kid friendly. In the summer, they often have a live band, fire, bag tossing area, and much more on the patio. Hey, they even have Elvis!\n\nAlso, Suzette was super awesome, as were the other servers!
