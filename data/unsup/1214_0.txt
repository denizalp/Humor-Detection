Crowded ~ like a NY subway. Greasy, sweaty, and stinks. Staff standing around visiting and \"checking out\" their guests who are currently trying to workout. This may be the only gym in S. Highlands at the moment, but St Rose Parkway to Eastern is a short drive for actual gym options. \n\nInterestingly enough, the Fitness 19 on Eastern Ave is very clean, smells clean, much larger, has newer equipment, the staff are busy cleaning or helping guests during their shifts, and did I mention it was clean? You might want to try this one out.
