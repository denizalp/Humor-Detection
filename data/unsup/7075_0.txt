The first morning after a night in Vegas feels like a blur. Also, you're likely jet lagged, so you need to make quick decisions about food and caffeine. I knew I didn't want to travel too far for breakfast. \n\nCorner Cakes to the rescue! The coffee and pastries are ok; better is their prime location right off the Grand Tower elevators.\n\nCoffee, pastry, and water for 2 people ended up being a bit steep, so I swore I wouldn't be as lazy next morning. However, if you're desperate, this is not a bad option.
