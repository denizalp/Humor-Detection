Not a good experience at Urbana! W\/D appliances would not fit into place in $25K kitchen cabinetry job, and they have not offered any reasonable solutions which would be workable. There are cracked cabinets, flush finishing doors, and the island is out of plumb. Very poor customer service and they seem to just not care or are in retirement mode. The case is public before the BBB of Vancouver Islands. Would not recommend Urbana! Kitchen is still not finished and has major discrepancies. Wish I went with Home Depot where customer satisfaction is assured 100%.
