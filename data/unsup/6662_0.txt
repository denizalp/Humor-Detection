RoCo as the locals call it offers some delicious roasted chicken and other Southern specialties.  The day my coworkers and I visited was chicken pot pie day.  Naturally, we opted for the special and it was definitely delicious.  It is piping hot, so use caution when eating.  Nice large chunks of chicken breast, peas, carrots, and potatoes are baked into a medium sized aluminum take out container with a crispy crust topping everything.\nSuper delicious, especially, with their habanero hot sauce.\n\nWill return to try their roast chicken next time!
