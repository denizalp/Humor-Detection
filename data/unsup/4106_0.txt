Looking for a cigar shop in Las Vegas is tough. You want a place that you won't get ripped off. En Fuego is like the Cheers of the cigar industry. I never met a place with such friendly customers. Mike, the owner is one of the friendliest proprietors you will ever meet. The prices are are great. The chairs are awesome. I won't visit Las Vegas with out a trip to En Fuego!
