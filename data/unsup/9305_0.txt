David Guetta. Ok, here comes the body guards, 2 hours late into showing, and still, ppl were packed in and starry eyed like sardines. XS was banking on star power to rake in the $, but this was borderline dangerous. Zero access to water, super super fire marshall crowded, grossed out drunk out of control, zero room to move pool area. umm..Classiness is a standard that starts classy and has to end classy. Overrated. \n\nOn a quieter weekend, perhaps, though nothing to write home about. Pricey drinks, over-commoditized offerings, and a predictable crowd\n\nClassy clubs unite!
