The food is ok. It's on par with TGI Fridays or something like that. I ordered the veggie burger. My wife ordered the barbecue sandwich. The barbecue sandwich is by no means worth $20. The service was not good. The server didn't seem like she wanted to be there, only asked how my wife's food was, and never asked if we needed anything. Don't waste your time.
