we had a private party on the 2nd floor & the staff was great!! 3.5 stars\n\n----FROZEN MARGARITAS! of course.. its MARGARITAVILLE!! you can get them w\/ flavors & even mix flavors! (guava's not bad but a bit sweet) ORIGINAL is the way to go!\n---Fried chicken wings w\/ honey mustard sauce were nice & crispy!\n---spring rolls: not bad for a \"mexican\" joint\n---mini cheeseburgers: the buns weren't the best, but the patties were cooked well\n\nhad a blast!! wouldn't mind coming back for some finger foods & margaritas
