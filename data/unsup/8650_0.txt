This place is not as bad as people say.  I am a big burger guy and this burger is good.  The fried onions they put on it will never make one of my burgers again.  The fries suck, very salty and maybe, just maybe, they were re-fried when ordered.\n\nBut...........due to the \"nurses\" serving the food we go from a 3 to 4 stars.  The entertainment is great and they take the time to talk to you.\n\nI will be back!
