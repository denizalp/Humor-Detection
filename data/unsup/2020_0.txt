I'm bumping them up to 5 starts because I have probably been back half a dozen times since my last review, and have never been disappointed. It has absolutely become one of my favorite bars for 3 reasons..\n\nA.) I once took a nap on the corner couch, and no one cared.\nB.) They leave out my favorite lifesavers mints in the bathroom.\nC.) Absinthe and Black & White movies with dancing midgets from the 60's playing.\n\nOrder the White Rabbit and see what happens to you. #mouthgasm
