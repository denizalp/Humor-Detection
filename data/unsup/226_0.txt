This place is stuck on stupid. No one knows when the store manager works. Really? Attitude when you complain about poor quality products? Oh, I get it. You got my $4,000.00 bucks, so I'm screwed. I'll pay, not because I'm worried about my credit rating, but because I am a person of integrity. Maybe you should hire people like me. Rest assured you will not get another dime from me after this transaction.
