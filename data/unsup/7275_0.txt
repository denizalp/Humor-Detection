I couldn't be happier!  My son forgot to pick up his prom date's corsage and not only did they call me to tell me he hadn't shown up yet (they were getting ready to close for the day) but they stayed open until he got there to pick it up. It was beautiful and looked just like the picture we ordered it from. Thanks Cactus Flowers!  I will spread the word about your awesome customer service!
