This is my new favorite spot for higher end casual dining.  The decor is unassuming with plenty of functional art.  Very pleasing; easy on the eye.  Now onto the food.  My lovely Cindy and I split the Menage Aux Trois.  A dream come true!!  Delicious! I enjoyed the tomato soup which tasted like it was made just for me.  Heavenly!  As my main course I had the Farmhouse Burger with fries.  This burger is OFF THE CHART!  We will be back FOR SURE!!
