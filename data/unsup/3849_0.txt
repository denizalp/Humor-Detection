OMG B(  .  )(  .  )IES EVERYWHERE.\n\n\nI have some pretty rad friends and for my first trip to a strip club, it was not only a Vegas strip club, it was Hustler's One Year Anniversary Party. \n\nTalk about babes galore!\n\nWe got bottle service, saw Outkast preform a few songs, and closed the place down at after sunrise. \n\nAn awesome first strip club experience!  So what if the strippers didn't believe it was my first time!
