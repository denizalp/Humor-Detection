I really dont understand how people like this place. I didnt like it the first time i went, but my friends really wanted to check this place out, so i went again... and ARGH i just dont get it! \n\nMusic: house \nCrowd: short uglies\nDrink: super pricey\n\nThe only good thing was that we got in for free. but other than that, yuck yuck yuckity yuck
