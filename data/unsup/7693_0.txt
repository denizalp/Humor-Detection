Six of us came here on a Wednesday night around 7:30. We got seated right away since the place was pretty empty. The \"happy hour\" is from 4pm to midnight... so they might as well say that's the regular price. On top of that, there is always a 10% discount for some of the rolls. The drinks were cheap too. Good service. Decent sushi.
