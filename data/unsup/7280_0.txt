small bowl of jjajjiangmyun was good, as was the tang su yuk, the sushi rolls were of poor quality and the rice tasted completely unseasoned.  My husband said his bibimbap was gross and barely ate any of it.  I tried it and it was pretty bad, it was covered in a sweet teriyaki type sauce and the meat was very gristley and poor quality.  It did not have the vibrant variety and textures that bibimbap should have, but instead was a mushy greasy sweet blah.
