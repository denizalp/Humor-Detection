As a former BuffX employee, I can no longer pay retail for my favorite labels. And, as a former BuffX employee, I always felt weird going back into the store to shop. Hence my love for Sunset Clothing. Thumbs up for their clean, roomy store, their impeccable selection, the bitchin art on the wall, and the fact that they are locally owned.
