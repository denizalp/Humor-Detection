Yesterday I took my little shih-tzu Spanky to get groomed by Chris and this is by far the best he's ever looked!!!  He was groomed like a king, everything was perfect! My family and I can't stop looking at him, he's 4-1\/2 years old but looks like a little puppy again, and I especially love the trimming of the ears, last time he had them that way was when we picked him up at the breeder.  Thank you Chris so much, look forward to seeing you again soon! \nThe Hare Family
