DELICIOUS!!! Hands down great restaurant. Very clean and modern establishment. The owner is SUPER cool. He served us, would check on us, joke, and even converse with us... Just made us feel extremely welcome. He would do that with everyone that came in. They have stickers on the front door welcoming Yelpers. I HIGHLY recommend this location!
