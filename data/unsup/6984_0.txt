The food was good.  A bit higher priced than some of the other pho and chinese restaurants on Spadina, but in this location - it's not too bad. \n\nBut, I cannot stand this strange lighting. Full of hearts, the lights abruptly change colour form soft pink, to a harsh blue, to a light yellow every 15 or so minutes. It was light and dark and very distracting. \n\nThe service wasn't amazing either, but if you flag them down, they will come to you. \n\nFickle in love, was just fickle.
