Worst McDonalds restaurant I've ever been to. ALWAYS check the bag before leaving this location and save the receipt! I'd say atleast 6 times out of 10 they forget some item you ordered, including sauces. There's been numerous times where I've came home disappointed that they forgot to include my sweet n sour sauce. The staff are very moody and don't even apologize when they forget something. Worst McDonalds location but yet it's closest to my house, go to the one on Gilbert Road! Much better!
