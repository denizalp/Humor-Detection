Utopia and I have gone straight from second base to home plate - yesterday they kicked things up several notches with the ultimate: GOURMET POUTINE.\n\nSeriously - the most solid poutine (meat or otherwise) I've ever had. Mushrooms (how they managed to make ME like mushrooms is still a mystery) and goat cheese on top of a mountain of veggie gravy, cheese curds and perfectly crispy fries for only $6.95. The appetizer portion is enough food for four people. The kitchen is open till 1am, so go here after a College Street crawl and satisfy your poutine craving!
