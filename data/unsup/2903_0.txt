The service is a 5 star restaurant, I could not believe that my drink would be free for only checking in. My personal favorite dish is their beef pho, with an exquisite flavor that really delivers a unique and enjoyable experience. I been a customer for a year now and will continue to be one. Thank you to the servers this morning of 05\/11\/17
