I called about a very mature tree (over 40 feet) leaning over and asked about supporting it.  I was upsold for extensive other work and told the tree should not be supported, but just some branches thinned for its \"sail.\"  I paid for all the extra work and that on the particular tree.  My mature tree fell over today. I will not be calling them back.
