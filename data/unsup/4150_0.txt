I came here for a lunch a few weeks ago with a co-worker.  We both ordered bento boxes and iced teas.  \n\nThe food was prompt and delicious and the service was friendly and unobtrusive.  Lunch for two was about $25 before gratuity. \n\nI was pleased to see how nicely they had converted this restaurant into a Japanese eatery from its former incarnation; the d√©cor is simple and elegant. \n\nI'd like to see this restaurant succeed, as this part of the Valley needs more Asian eateries.  I'll be returning soon to sample their ramen bowls!
