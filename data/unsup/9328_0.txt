Taps don't work so no drafts...Ordered hot garlic wings with ff and got garlic butter wings instead with curly fries that were hard!!!!\nI'd say to the kitchen...\nGo buy a ff cutter and do handcut ff cause those things you buy in a bag suck....\nOh and fix the taps...\nAnd kill the fruit flies....\nThen I'd prolly give you a 3...\nSorry LOL but you need to cross T's and dot I's
