I've wondered for a long time why restaurants serve such mediocre breakfasts when it is so simple to make really good ones. Here's the place I've been waiting for! Locally sourced, high quality and delish food! We had the pancakes, with REAL maple syrup no less, bacon and sausages. Yummy cakes! I consider myself to be a bacon aficionado and this bacon did not disappoint. Piggy perfection. As were the sausages....plump pork goodness.\nThe wait staff were cheery and helpful and it's clean as a whistle. We will be back often for breakfast AND lunch.
