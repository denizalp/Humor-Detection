Always friendly service. Always great pizza and fresh toppings. I LOVE that they have gluten free crust! It's drive thru, which is very convenient. They do not take call ahead orders, which is not so convenient. You do have to wait an average of 9 minutes for your order, but they are making you fresh pizza so a wait is expected. There are a ton of unique ingredients and fun combinations that you can make.
