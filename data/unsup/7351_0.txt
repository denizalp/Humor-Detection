Its a nice place, newer beds, radios don't work. Front desk girls are nice..however, management is horrible. Called 3x and even went in for someone to answer a question about being charged a certain amount. Left a message on the main phone for the owner and the girls at the front desk even took my information down twice. It's been a month and a half and no one called. Not a company who I will do business with any longer. Such a shame because it is a nice place.
