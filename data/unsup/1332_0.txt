This Dunkin is horrible. After waiting 15 minutes, when there was only 1 person ahead of me, I am given a broken straw, the wrong lid(it was so flimsy it came off when picking up the bottom of the coffee) HALF a glazed donut, and missing a donut.\n\nNow I normally would not get mad, but it's not the first time this has happened. It shouldn't be hard to remember to grab a donut especially if you're going to charge me for it.\n\nOh and the drive through speakers have needed to be replaced for over 6 months.
