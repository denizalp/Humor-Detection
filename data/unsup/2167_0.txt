I started to write a review about another restaurant, and realized that no middle eastern restaurant can hold a candle to Pomegranate.  This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto.  Reason being - I love variety and complexities in my food.  The use of different spices, meats, fruit - it is foodgasm over and over.\n\nThe decor - amazing.  I just *sigh* can't even express how beautiful this spot is and how I have only been there once (shame on me!!!).  \n\nPomegranate, I will be back soon, I promise!!
