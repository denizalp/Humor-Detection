Ordered a coffee and a caramel blended drink. I expected the coffees to be pricey (most in Vegas are). However, I was disappointed that the price point did not match the flavor. The coffee was ok, it tasted a little burnt. The caramel blended drink had no flavor at all. It tasted like icy milk, I ended up throwing it away. However, the staff is great. They were super nice and got the drinks out pretty quick considering how crowded it was.
