I sat at the bar for a quick late dinner by myself. The bartenders were all friendly and gave great recommendations.  I ordered the seared albacore sushi specialty roll which was delicious!  I couldn't decide on which sashimi to order so they made a combo plate for me of Yellowtail Jalapeno, Salmon Wasabi, and Tuna Special.  Although the 2 appetizers were very expensive, it was completely worth it.  Delicious and great presentation!
