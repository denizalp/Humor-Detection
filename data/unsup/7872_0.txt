I wish I could visit more often! Inside Mandalay, this restaurant selection was from a friend's referral.  So glad we followed her suggestion for our lunch! EVERYTHING we tasted was just amazingly flavorful! I have NO complaints.  My son even enjoyed the miso ramen.  Absolutely try the pop rocks sushi!!  For a party of two-and-a-half, our bill did arrive to $150 or so, NO cocktails either, but the sushi dining experience was so unique and definitely worth (and understandably so) the quality and taste!
