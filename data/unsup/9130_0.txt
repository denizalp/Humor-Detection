This review was really tough for me because everything about this place sucks except for one sandwich.\n\nAnd here's the thing about that.\n\nTHIS SANDWICH IS LIKE JESUS.\n\nIt could be the most amazing thing I've ever tasted. I crave it fortnightly, no joke. \n\nDon't try the pizza and stay awaaaaaaay from the calzones. Try the Bronx Bomber. I swear to god you will probably scream some incredibly inappropriate exaltation after your first bite, that is, if you don't just lose all faculties and crap your pants right there in the shop.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty crazy about it.
