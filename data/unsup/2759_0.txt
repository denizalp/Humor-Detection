Anti customer service. No stock on fabric we need, they want to charge me Fedex to ship fabric to store and asked me to drive back to store 30 miles each way again to pick up fabric. Won't even ship direct to my home. Sales staff is generally rude and not helpful. \"We've always done it that way\" is a sure formula for failure.
