Last weekend a friend made an extremely large purchase.  A 3-D television and a bunch of other crap to go with it.  The salesman, I think his name was Mike, was awesome and very knowledgable about everything we asked about.  \nJust a word of advice...don't make huge purchases after 7 hours of drinking.  You'll most likely regret it in the morning ;)
