Love this place! Keith and Patty are crushing the #phxwine scene! Tons of great wines and craft beers. The new food menu absolutely rocks and the staff is always on point. Our 'go to' person is the wonderful, purple haired Sarah. Always friendly and knowledgeable... hasn't hand picked a drink I haven't liked. Looking forward to your next location opening in Roosevelt Row! Keep doing awesome things, guys... we're rooting for you!
