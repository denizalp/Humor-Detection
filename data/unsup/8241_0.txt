Sat at sushi bar and talked with friendly, Japanese chef.  He prepared imaginative variations of nigiri and rolls.  Also had seasonal shishamo.  Food is authentic and good quality.  Sapporo on tap was nice extra benefit.  Compared with NY, very reasonably priced.  This is my new go-to for sushi in Montreal.
