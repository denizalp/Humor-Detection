If you are a fan of history, fan of Googie, funky architecture, or of old Neon Signage, you have to stop by this place.\n\nIt's such a shame that the Museum has to exist, wish Vegas could find it in their heart to restore\/repurpose instead of destroy the old. So in reality, thank goodness the Museum does exist!
