I think that most Calgarians have heard of Kinjo sushi. I now live in Vancouver, and although its packed with Sushi places, I haven't found one that's as fun as Kinjos!\n\nIf this is your first time, try to go on a weekend. You might have to wait a while for a table, but the energy of the place is worth it! The sushi is great and there is enough choices to keep it interesting.
