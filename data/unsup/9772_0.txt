I love this place. They have a broad selection, and their staff is always helpful and eager to please with great advice. It is a bit annoying sometimes to find prices but I haven't been disappointed with a purchase yet. They are right down the road from me and it's becoming a habit for me to stop in just to pick up a plant for my yard. Their prices are average and fair and in many cases better than the hardware stores.
