Yummm! Delicious raspberry and pumpkin scones! And just like Grainne said, super nice and friendly staff. They make buying bread and other butt fattening stuff that much better! \n\nThe bakery is full of delicious looking baked goods, including artisan breads, croissants, chocolate croissants,cookies, etc...Everything looks good. I got the pumpkin loaf and a few scones. Everything is yummy! \n\nThey will slice your bread as thick or thin as you want it. 4 scones plus the loaf was $9.00 tax included :)
