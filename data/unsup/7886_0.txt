Always treat like an MVP when i go here. I get my 2007 c280 serviced here. Robert is always helpful and doest BS you. Right to the point. Just like it should be. The even try and save you money. Who doesn't like that. Wife just leased a 2015 c300 back in June. From the sevice department to the sells personal way to run a company. Stop complaining about prices, own a toyota if you want 30$ services.
