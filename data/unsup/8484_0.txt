I like the Swizzle stick  as my Dad used to call it.  It's a local bar with no frills except pool table, bar, and friendly people...what more can u ask for?  I'm not a huge bar guy but this place is like Phoenix's Cheers...eventually everyone will know your name.    The sliding glass door with the little beach is what makes this place AWESOME!!!  After TexAz...Swizzle Inn to this Bar  (Wow that was bad!!) for some good times.
