To tell you the truth, I prefer this free show to many paid shows in Vegas. I must've seen it more than 10 times and it still amazes me.\n\nThe coordination of music, water and light is spectacular. I've only seen it from street level and might try to catch it from higher ground next time.\n\nIf they only served free food during the show, I would give it 6 stars.
