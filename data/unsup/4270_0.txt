pretty impressed  4.5 surprised there isnt as many reviews as this is a popular lunch spot in yhe biz district.  i ordered the salmon witj oniom or ginger not sure what it was but absolutely delicious.  highly recommend for a healthy meal.  prices was alright nothing to scream and shout about.  but good eats none the less.
