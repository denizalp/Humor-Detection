Never go here. Harold the manager is a total self centered prick! Seriously you do realize you are in the customer service business right? He encourages potential customers to walk out.  He does not work with people whatsoever! It's his way or the highway! Just look at all the bad reviews. They need to fire this manager! He is going to get that place shut down. It's unfortunate because the sales people are so nice and Harold talks to them like second class citizens.
