This office is good for very basic stuff - very basic.  I brought my pet in because  something was not right and the doctor said it was just a reaction to something (and basically didn't know anything else to do).  I don't know why I didn't get a second opinion.  Two months later my pet died.  I really liked this office at first, but after the lack of action and knowledge (or even suggesting they didn't know what to do to see someone else) I won't be returning.
