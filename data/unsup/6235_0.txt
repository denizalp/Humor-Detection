I've been to quite a few zoos and this one has made the top five. It is a rather big park with a vast amount of different types of animals. You can expect to see a wide range of bird species along with zebras, money's out of their cages, giraffes, vivid fish, snakes, and much more. They have multiple concession areas for which come in handy for those warmer days and you're in need for a beverage. The admission price to get in is steep at $42 after tax. Sometimes there are coupons at frys or online.
