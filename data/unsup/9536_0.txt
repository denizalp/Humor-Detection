Chicken in a Waffle ($13): Country gravy and fries. Great waffles and delicious fried chicken strips.\n\nHen House ($11): Wrap w\/ lettuce, organic chicken, roasted tomato, avocado, Caesar dressing, tomato-basil tortilla, and fries.\n\nThe Bob ($12): Sandwich w\/ organic chicken, arugula, roasted tomato, jack and cheddar, pecan honey mustard, grilled wheat bread, and fries.\n\nEverything I've had is delicious and hearty without being heavy. The ingredients are fresh and the portions are perfect. It's good food that isn't too healthy (love my fries!) for an easy and fulfilling lunch. When the weather is nice, the patio is beautiful to dine.
