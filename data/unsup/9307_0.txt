The best effing gelato I have ever had. Period.\n\nAnyone who tells you it tastes like Gelato Spot is high.  Arlecchino will never use artificial flavors in their gelato.\n\nParking is a bit of a PITA, but Arlecchino's gelato is well worth it.\n\nAnd if you like chocolate, you must try Arlecchino's chocolate gelato.  It's one of the best chocolate anythings you will ever have.\n\nIn addition to having the best gelato, Arlecchino also has the best, super-friendly and very cool owners and staff.
