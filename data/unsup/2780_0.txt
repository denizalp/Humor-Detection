The owner is a cute, older hispanic woman.  My favorite line was, \"Who is this Mr. Yelp that keeps sending people here?\"\n\nIt's a one-woman shop.  She was running back and forth between the register, kitchen and patrons serving food and taking orders.\n\nMaybe the best tacos I've ever had.  Very fresh ingredients.  Everything is homemade.
