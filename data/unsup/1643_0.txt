Had the bacon omelet bacon in Every bite cooked to perfection, with a toasted blue berry bagel and plain cream cheese, pastrami sandwich, eggs Benedict were amazing!! Everything is super delicious. The staff was really friendly and quick with service. Also, stopped at the bakery to grab some cookies super delicious! Will be going back to try their lunch and dinner food items.
