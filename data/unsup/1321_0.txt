This place was awesome! A good variety of local beers in a cool industrial building with basketball courts, corn hole, big Jenga, and other games. The staff was very friendly and we were able to try the beer & wine before ordering one. Great atmosphere, cool name, and different than any other bar in downtown Chandler. No food here but eat dinner at one of the great places around the area and then finish the night here or order to-go food and eat it there. I highly recommend trying this place!
