My favorite Taiwanese place in Mississauga! Delicious Taiwanese popcorn chicken and other small eats. Good quantity for reasonable prices. I liked their mini koo koo chicken bites $4.40, Taiwanese pork sandwiches $6.50 for 2,  soy ginger chicken with basil on rice $7.95, which came with some sides. Very tasty and filling. Casual environment, which is great since no tip and quick for eating. \n\nBubble tea was a bit disappointing however. Better off having it at Chatime or Bubble Republic. This is the place to go for Taiwanese and will definitely leave impressed.
