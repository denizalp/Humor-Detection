I found this business after the shoe repair that I was intending to go to had moved.  I noticed the sign that said jewelry repair. Upon entering the store, the staff was friendly and welcoming. James was extremely polite and helpful in fixing a purse strap that came apart from its metal bracket. I am extremely impressed with the quality of work and atmosphere.  The jewelry is so fun to swoon over too. I highly recommend this store.
