What can I say? Been here over a handful of times and... \n\nAwesome food...check\nAwesome service...check.\n\nCurrently serving Japanese food and they have the freshest and softest steam rice!\n\nThe decor is dim and romantic. There is a dining area which you can tell every detail was well thought out and custom made. Which includes karaoke!\n\nIf karaoke is your poison, they offer 3 private rooms which vary in size and each room is decorated with its own theme.\n\nThey serve everything on the menu in these private rooms. So bring your friends, sit down, sing and enjoy yourself!\n\nFYI , they have high chairs!
