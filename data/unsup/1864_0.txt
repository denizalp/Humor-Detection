I'm just waited 30 minutes for a Hawaiian pizza and a grilled chicken sandwich. And the place is empty. As soon as I walked up and asked for refund the pizza and chicken sandwich was ready. The person that ordered after me got their food before me and ordered a lot more. Ridiculous. Order at 11:04 am was brought out at 11:32 Am
