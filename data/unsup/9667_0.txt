Moved into a new place last month. When I picked up the keys Sunday night it was ewww icky. The landlord and I agreed to split the cleaning fee because I wanted it really clean. In a rush? Finding someone in a Sunday night for Monday morning? What? Impossible! Nope. I was able to book online, they confirmed and we're here on time. We had a mother daughter team from Russia and they were funny and friendly and cleaned like...well, like I can only do on speed. Truth! \nSo instead of rehab, I left it to the professionals.
