Cutest baby stuff!  \n\nActually, \"cool stuff for small humans,\" is probably more accurate as it is their tagline...\n\nI have yet to make a purchase at Little Artika, but I see some some of my paycheck headed in Little Artika's direction real soon...\n\nFrom toys, strollers, furniture including chairs for the nursery, baby and kids' clothes, all kinds of fun accessories, Little Artika has it all.  Plus, they are friendly, knowledgeable, and locally owned!
