Insane burger and you get a ton of good food for what you pay for. Exactly what I would expect from a hole in the wall type place. Not going to have ambience or anything else that you get from an actual restaurant so don't go with that expectation. It's more than a fast food place but less than a sit down restaurant. Classic burger joint (that happens to also have a bunch of other options as well) Had the King Kong burger and added avocado. It was great.
