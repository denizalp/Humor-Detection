We came with a party of 8 and they let split with some who did AYCE and others order from the lunch menu. I ordered from the lunch menu - sushi lunch which came with some nigiri and a few pieces of cali roll. It was just ok, not great. \n\nI watched my friends eat the AYCE and it didn't look good. They also said it wasn't the freshest and the slices of fish were small.\n\nThere are many other AYCE options in Vegas for consideration.
