We were very pleased with our experience from start to finish.  The consultant was friendly, listened to our needs and really made a stressful time less stressful with this process being so easy.  Paper shades were installed in our home the day we were moving in and we lived with light but privacy for five weeks while the shutters were being made.  The installer came and worked efficiently and cleaned up after himself without any issues.  Highly recommend.
