Complaint update. Their customer service is still horrible. They only seem to respond after my poor reviews and claim they will help resolve the matter but then nothing. On Tuesday, June 13 I gave them the order number to reference and now it is Friday and still no resolution. Buyer beware. If you buy something from this vendor and you have an issue with their product there is zero chance you will get your money back. Without a doubt the worst customer service experience to date in my life.
