The Venetian is definitely my go to Hotel and Casino when I'm in Las Vegas! The hotel is always spotless, I mean spotless. The staff takes great care of this property. The Hotel rooms are very spacious and clean as well. They have Deep Soaking Tubs with separate Showers, Remote controlled Curtains, a separate sitting area and more. The Casinos are not as smoky as the other Casinos on the strip. \n\nAs for the food they have some of the best food Las Vegas has to offer! 20 Restaurants within the hotel!
