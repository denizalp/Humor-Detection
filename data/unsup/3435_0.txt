Thank you Arriviste Coffee Bar for actually having free WiFi!!!  Feeling spoiled as it's everywhere in California but a rare find in my hometown. \n\nSuper Industrial design and cleanliness, barista is a kind and articulate bearded guy. Cool chill music at a chill volume level. I appreciate that it's unfamiliar and modern, has a new sound to it Connan Mockasin. Funky. \n\nGreat smelling coffee, some bars, well done pastries and I'm having a Savory 'Pierogi' turn over.
