Updating my review to admit that I have converted my loyalty to Jinya. \n\nThe Tonkotsu Spicy is now my go to and highly recommended. With the seasoned egg it's close to perfection.\n\nThe service never disappoints and food always comes out quick. The ramen comes in these awesome bowls too, my roommate and I always joke about how we want to accidentally take one or two home...
