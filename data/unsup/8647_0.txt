I go here for Trivia Night sometimes, and we usually get drinks and food while we're there. The menu is hit or miss. Some stuff is delicious, some is not so good, and some is okay. It might depend on who's cooking. Usually, though, the food is decent, and I really appreciate that all the arcade games are playable without needing coins or credits. It's a solid place.
