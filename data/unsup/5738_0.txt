I typically buy 2 bags of sonic ice each week. Multiple times I've been told @this location they don't have enough ice to sell. So....They suggested making a phone call to see if they have enough to sell. Ridiculous, in my opinion, considering they advertise bags of Sonic Ice on every menu. The reason for my review today, I decided to make the call re: ice inventory and the phone number listed is incorrect! #typical
