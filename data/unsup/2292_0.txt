I do miss larger Whole Foods locations, but this one is pretty good.  There are some the 365 Everyday products here that I just love (like Sangria).\n\nWe like the cheese selection at this store, we would love it if they carried cheese from Iceland.\n\nTheir prepared foods are pretty good and they have decent selection given the size of the store.  They make a great latte at this location as well.
