I ate meals at this Mexican restaurant two times. I like the chips, salsa, guacamole, chicken quesadilla, and steak fajita. The ceviche was very large and tasted OK but was not as good as ceviches that I have eaten at other restaurants. I did not care for the taste of the soft tacos and did not finish them. Beans are beans, rice is rice, and corn is corn, so nothing special there. The waitress was nice, but she incorrectly ordered my husband's lunch, so he had to wait for another entree to be brought out while I ate mine.
