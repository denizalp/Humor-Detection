lot i don,t like about the place....is boring place, hard seats, just not much money put into the seats, etc...no boths, at least in n out have boths, but they are plastic...still better than none....\n\nokay , the food...the fries are not bad, but the burger just did not taste that good...only ate about half of it...expensive, but portions are big..........probably will not return
