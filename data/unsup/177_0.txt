It's your typical sports bar with tvs everywhere.  \n\nThe back room is pretty cool with the tri-level fireplace.  Prime rib with fried onion quesadilla was really good.  However, the prime rib was a lil dry.\n\nService was average.  Probably wouldn't come back unless for the late night specials or if someone really wanted to come.
