Jimmy John's is to die for! I will never return to Subway after discovering this sandwich shop. I'm not even a Vegetarian but their #6 Veggie Sandwich is all I crave when I think about sandwiches. This is a great location with a convenient drive thru, I've never had a problem with the customer service. Yeah some employees don't seem to be happy to be working but everyone has a bad day or two especially in the fast food industry. Thanks Jimmy John's for being delicious and way better than subway!
