We recently had lunch here trying the fried pickles, burgers and shared\/sampled various shakes.  The food overall is average with the Oreo shake being the standout of all the things we tried.  The service was good as the guy working the dining room was engaging and helpful.  I like IN N Out, Five Guys and Bachi Burger better but this is close to my work so I will be back.
