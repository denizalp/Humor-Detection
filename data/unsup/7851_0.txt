Mandalay bay just doesn't have the food or restaurants that compete with the other newer spots on the strip. \n\nThis sushi place has good decor but lacks service and the freshness in food. \n\nService was sub par with us flagging down the waitress a hundred times. Food was mediocre at best. Sushi rice was tough and stale and edamame lacked seasoning. Fish was okay. Their tempura veggies were soggy. Bright side, they have tamari sauce for gluten free folk and they have vegetable rolls. Other than that, this place was just okay.
