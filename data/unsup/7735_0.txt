Stopped by for breakfast at this little European style cafe!! Was in a rush and the female server was amazing!! She was so accommodating and got us a full meal in less than 30 minutes with hot warm delicious food!! Started with expresso and British breakfast tea!! Both clean and tasty!! Had the florentine omelette which had a very nice taste especially with the fresh Mariana sauce...really good!! The hash brown is a must!! It is so crispy and delicious!! Literally made perfectly!!\nAlso got the chocolate chip pan cake which was super soft!! Excellent place!!
