Nice little franchise to grab a bite between flights. I caught them at a 'off peak' time, so there wasn't much stock, but my drink was made to order & my wrap was heated. Both were as expected and I was not disappointed. I would go back again. Service was quick because the line was short, but it took the staff a moment to recognize that I was good to go. With that, I still had a bit of time with a little less than an hour connection.
