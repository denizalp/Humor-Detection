My boyfriend took me here for my birthday last summer. I was thankful for the experience, but let's just say not enough to come back. The service, as expected, was good. I don't expect much sincerity because I know they are trained a certain way, to me it just felt too rehearsed. Not my kind of atmosphere.\nThe food was unremarkable. I really can't say anything stood out. They weren't bad, but just didn't blow my tastebuds away. We had: nodini, olives, salumi di mare, and polipo e vongole to share.
