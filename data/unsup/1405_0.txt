Get the Pig & Grits with an egg sunny side up. Yes. Just do it. \n\nThe Brisket Stack left something to be desired, but the mac and cheese has the perfect amount of flavor and crunch. \n\nI know everyone says it, but I still think it's so bizarre how such good food is served in a gas station. We enjoyed walking around seeing all the farmer-chic tables throughout the gift shop area available to sit at. But it was pretty cluttered otherwise, so we sat on the super quaint and adorably lit patio.
