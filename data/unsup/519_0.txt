I happened to be in Vermont and thought \"what's 2 hours to Montreal?\" So I showed up at the border and the agent was like \"where are you going?\" And I told her I was going to a pastry shop called \"Au Kouign Amann\" and she smiled that smile like \"you silly American, driving all this way for pastry.\" But she let me in and I ate the hell out of those pastries, I still love you Au Kouign Amann. I'd give you six stars if I could!
