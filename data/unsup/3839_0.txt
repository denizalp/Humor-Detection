Been here several times and used to have a membership. For lack of use i did not renew membership. Last 3 times here I has to deal with employee Heather who with her rude attitude made sure I didnt renew membership. I honestly live 2 minutes away from this range but because of the rude attitude, i will be driving half hour to another range. A lot cheaper at the other range and always a good attitude there. Heather rocks at loosing customers. The guy that was there before me said the same thing.
