Ummm...Me and Jen M. were killing time before a Yelp event and uhhh decided to take a look see.  \n\nIt's uhhh.. a big space?\n\nIt had lots of dildos.\n\nIt had clothes that came in little boxes (which costs more than $40 might I add).\n\nTo my surprise, not that I knew what to really expect from a sex boutique, was the products were more geared for females.  \n\nI guess if you ever wanted products to insert into orifices, ummm this'd be the place?\n\nThe good news is I guess I didn't feel like I needed hand sanitizer while I was there?
