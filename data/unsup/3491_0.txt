I used to know this place as great Italian restaurant, one you would go on a date night - great food - great ambience - great service with Italian music\n\nI am not sure what happened, my last experience was just awful, it's now a 24-hours gaming bar, microwave food, loud music - poor dinning experience \n\nJust terrible - seems business needs may have made it lose its traditional appeal
