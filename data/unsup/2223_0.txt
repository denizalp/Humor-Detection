Right in the heart of Mandalay Bay. \n\nGreat atmosphere. Excellent service. \n\nParty of three work colleagues. We ordered three sushi rolls: spicy tuna, rainbow roll, and tempura crab. All expertly prepared with outstanding presentation. \n\nThe spicy Edamame was awesome. \n\nWe finished with a perfect fried calamari with a light chipotle mayo.  Excellent. \n\nGreat experience.
