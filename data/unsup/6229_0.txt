I am not a sushi expert by any means, but I loooove this restaurant. Both their sushi and non-sushi items are delicious. Since discovering this restaurant my husband and I go here at least a couple of times per month. The happy hour prices are sooo reasonable and we have yet to try anything we didn't like. It's close to home, yummy and inexpensive. This has become our go to week night dinner spot.
