I'm not sure what all these people are talking about, maybe I'm a fluke, maybe she's better at coloring.  I've had short cuts before, and they never looked this crappy.  I even went back to her to fix and got my 2nd worst hair cut ever.  Its a shame because she seems so nice and I really wanted to like it.  But seriously, worst
