This doctor (Furo Oruene) has to be the worst!  Unprofessional beyond comprehension!!  Constantly bragging about his house, the money spent on his girlfriends shoes and the air condition bill.  Extremely unpleasant and ego driven.  Injecting the knee with a minimum amount of medication; then claiming the knee is healed.  Unfortunately, the orthopedic specialist; whom I went too would completely disagree with this quack!!  I definitely would not recommend this quack to my enemy!!   What do doctors do with their mistakes???  They bury them!!!!
