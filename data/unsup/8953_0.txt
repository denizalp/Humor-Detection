Sourdough is a true hidden gem. I've been coming here since I was a kid and will still make the drive out all the way from Scottsdale when I need a delicious pizza. A lot has changed in the plaza around but sourdough pizza is still as amazing as it was 20 years ago. Love love love!! Nothing compares. I recommend this place to everyone I know. \n\nPlease don't ever go out of business I would be heart broken.
