My opinion of this mall is slightly biased because I met my girlfriend here! Scarborough Town has everything you'd want with stores like: Walmart, The Bay, Sears, Dollarama, Shoppers Drug Mart, HMV. Great Cineplex theater upstairs with tons of games.\n\nThe mall tends to get pretty jammed on Fridays, you've been warned! Food court is currently undergoing a major overhaul so stay tuned.
