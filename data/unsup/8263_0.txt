Same. This is the office the Medicare patients come to. Dentist is great. Hygienist is good. Office staff adequate. Difference in drive time is 18 miles vs 2.6 miles. It's big deal on a school day. \nOffice isn't nearly as nice and done if the \"niceties\" are lacking. \nUpdate - faster teeth cleaning my kids have ever had! I'm thinking this isn't a good thing .
