Had a great time here last week with my daughters. It's good to go soon after they get set-up (less stinky). The rides were fun, the food AWESOME, and the games were the same old trickery - though now you pay for them with a pre-paid game card instead of cash which helps keep them legit.\n\nYou HAVE to try feeding the baby Giraffe and Camel in the petting area!\n\nGoing to Weezer concert here tonight - hoping to avoid a stabbing.
