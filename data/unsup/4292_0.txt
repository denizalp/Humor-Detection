Management is the problem. Staff seems to have hands tied and have no latitude.  Our server was great and extremely overworked.  Food was mediocre at best.  People waiting were allowed to wait next to tables being served.   Chaulk this up to the managers and poor planning.   Back to the one on Gilbert and Mckellips.
