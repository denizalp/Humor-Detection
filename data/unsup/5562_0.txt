I really can't be bothered with this place anymore. I'm tired of the bitchy attitude from their wait staff, and one waiter in particular, who is a bit too familiar. And do NOT show me that attitude and get pissy with me when I bring in a group of 8 for dinner. I don't care if you're busy  You should be jumping through hoops for a large party, not giving me attitude.\n\nIt's really too bad because the food isn't bad.
