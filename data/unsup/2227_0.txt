Wow and yes! What a special evening at a fantastic place. Met some great people, ate some delicious food, and had an awesome experience. Service is top notch. Food was prepared extremely well. The ambiance is straight out of Europe...think a barn in the middle of Germany. Michael, the proprietor, is a stand-up gentleman and really has something special here.
