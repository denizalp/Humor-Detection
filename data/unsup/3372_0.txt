Had a great time when I visited La Rockette earlier this year. Great music and vibes on a Saturday night! Would like to visit on a Friday night since I hear the music is more rock\/grunge. There's an upstairs area which is cool to chill when it gets too crowded downstairs. Don't like paying for entrance but I guess I can handle $5. Will visit again soon!!
