The subs here are top notch and made fresh as soon as you order them. Great alternative to Subway as Get Go has better meat and prices. You can typically get good 2 for $5 deals on small subs or a meal for $5. Plus they have all the other typical convenient store fare along with an amazing selection of fresh coffee. All while filling your tank up with Fuel Perks. I feel like I am in heaven with all these perks!
