Place is definitely out dated and quite frankly I feel like 75% of people here have the ability to shank me at any moment. Its still a fun place for mini golf. They try to stick it to you for rides, probably because they realize there are only 3 rides people would get on. Place needs a face lift for sure. Name is a little misleading, \"Castles & Coasters\"... more like \"semi castle on hole 8 and one coaster\"
