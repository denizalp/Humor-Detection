I don't know if I was in on a bad day or not but the entire store had a nasty odor and all the smaller reptile cages were filthy. The snake cages weren't bad beside a few having shed still left in there. Also the variety wasn't what I expected. I went last year to this store and it was fine so I don't know what has changed since then. \nI think I will visit twice more to see if I was just in on a bad day or if they have really gotten that bad.
