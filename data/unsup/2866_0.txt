Never actually got to eat here. We came with our 14 year old daughter and wanted to use Happy hour menu. They said this is only for people sitting at the bar and refused to give us any other opportunity. We felt it was completely unfair, especially because other upscale and nice restaurants actually accommodated us , by giving us alternative table. It's just either you are nice to your customers or you are not!!!
