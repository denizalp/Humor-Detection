If you are ever in this area or in Canada by any chance, you HAVE to stop somewhere to try some poutine! \nA poutine is basically fries drenched in gravyand some sprinkles of curds? And it can come with other goodies on top. \nThis place is a perfect place to try it because that's basically they're whole menu. Plus, they are very generous with their servings. A large can be split up by my 2 friends and me.
