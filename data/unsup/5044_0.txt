London Cleaners is great!  It's like having my own personal laundry gnomes.  They pick up and drop off my dry-cleaning, which I appreciate.  I'm just too lazy to go out of my way for clean clothes.  I have never had any problem with their work.  Even if they are closed, I can leave a voicemail and they will pick up on schedule.  They are so efficient, it's like having little sprites whose only job is to keep me well stocked with clean clothes.  Now if they could just take care of my dishes...
