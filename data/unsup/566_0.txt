My name is Hitt, I'm from Pittsburgh PA.  I do many things but one of the things I like to do is experience everything I humanly can from foods to places plus people and things.  Rather than write a long review and clutter the reviews with anymore long reviews (no knock, you guys are great) I'm just gonna get right to the point...\n\nThis place? \n\nworth a try.\n\nThe bowl dish with purple rice, eat it. Bimbim maybe?\nScallion pancakes, eat them!\nClean environment, a huge plus.\nA little expensive but not really.\nKaraoke in the room over.\nAwesome K Pop on the TV.
