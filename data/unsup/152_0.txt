Mary Ann is such a sweetheart and very nice to work with! She will listen to what you want and will give suggestions. I am very satisfied with her work. So glad she didn't have to bleach my hair. \n\nI brought a picture of what color I wanted to achieve and I think that what she did to my hair is better than the picture! Super love it! I'll definitely recommend her to family and friends!
