After a movie, we discovered your cute cafe at the end of the sidewalk. I had a mocha latte with almond milk (awesome!!) and we left with several slices of carrot cake. Not every slice made it home!!! Thank you for the quick reply to my message - and the gal at the front was very polite and friendly. Amazing prices for healthy food options!  Wish I could grab a coffee there every morning. Any plans for a drive-thru? \nHighly recommend the carrot cake. Perfect spice level and the icing is super smooth.
