I was here last year when the place was under renovation. The mall now looks fab! Huge hallways, more store are now open. Some stores to open soon. I like the high ceiling food court. It gives a feeling of space and vastness. The glass walls and ceiling has a zen feeling with the blue sky as back drop. They food choices are pretty much the same as other mall food courts.  \nParking is huge at the plaza around the mall.
