*Estiatorio Milos* is a great option for fine dining with delicious seafood inside \"The Cosmopolitan\". This place is modern and has a nice atmosphere along with excellent service. The whole menu is rather on the expensive side, however the food is super fresh! I highly recommend \"Monks in Mexico\" cocktail (Patron Reposado Tequila, Green Chartreuse, St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, grapefruit juice, agave nectar) paired with some fish and veggies. 4 Stars for the ambiance, food, and service. =)
