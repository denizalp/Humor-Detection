Pretty close to perfect. Upscale, sleek, very cosmopolitan (reminds me of Toronto). Great menu, and could easily bury the competition with an extensive selection of beer. Too bad I hate beer, because they seem to have everything, with good bartenders to boot. Can't find fault with anyone that can do REALLY good wings...and boy, they are: meaty, juicy, really great flavors.  Just try to keep me from coming back, even though a bit pricey.
