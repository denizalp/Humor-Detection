If you want a lot of like on your IG post, this is the place. If you like hard taiyaki, this is def the best place.\n\nI ordered a taiyaki with green tea ice cream, vanilla custard and pocky topping. Okay the pocky was the best part. Green tea ice cream was next but vanilla custard was a total mediocre. The worst part, the actual taiyaki, hard like cardboard. \n\nWould rather eat a dead fish.\n\nWould I come back? Maybe for their boba. Taiyaki? No.
