We were pleasantly surprised by our experience here. Everyone was super friendly from the moment we stepped in. The associate who helped us was great,  not pushy for us to get insurance or upgrade. We got to pick the car we wanted from the lot under the size car we were going for, which I loved and have never experienced before with other car rental companies. The process to get the car was fast and easy.  Thanks Alamo!
