I come here pretty often and I am usually satisfied with the food and service. Always a huge wild wings fan due to their variety of flavour choices. The waitresses never really followed up with us, and it's always a mission to get her attention. They have daily specials, so check it out before you come.\nThis place is pretty busy during NBA season!!! Let's go raptors!
