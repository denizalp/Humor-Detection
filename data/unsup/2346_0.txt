Very friendly staff. Appointment scheduling and communication was great. Pricing was as quoted and I was told about additional costs for removal\nof special items, such as TVs or tires, in advance. The guys gave me a call notifying me when they were on their way and were prompt, fast and friendly during the cleanup. Very happy with the service.
