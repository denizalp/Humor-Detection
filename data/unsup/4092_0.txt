This place was ok. \nThe food wasn't great. \nI was mostly surprised at the lack of water on tap. \n3$ for a small Fiji bottle. \nWe ended up getting forced to buy a coke product cause that was on tap and had refills. \nThey forgot to bring out the au jus sauce with my sandwich. \nAnd didn't bring us utensils and napkins until we asked.
