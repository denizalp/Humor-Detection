Buy one get one free coupons are the only reason my husband and I go to Mimi's, but after tonight, I doubt that we will return.  Slow, nonexistent server, barely warm French dip sandwich and fries (even the au jus was lukewarm) and flat soda.  Slow service is forgivable, but top it off with cold food and flat soda, and your buy one, get one free meal is ruined.
