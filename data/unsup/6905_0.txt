I know a girl who Spencer time in this store, and nowhere else.\n\nWell not really, but we both really though this was a cool store with lots of stuff we wanted to buy. The only problem is that you could go broke shopping here. She did get me a pretty nice, comfortable, cute grey t-shirt here and about 3 things for herself. I wasn't a fan of the prices, but other than that it's a great store to find cool clothes and gifts in.
