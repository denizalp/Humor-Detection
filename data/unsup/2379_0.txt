Have been there at the Sunday brunch last year. Ended up in hospital in Page with food poison. I barely survived, because we were in the middle of nowhere, when that started. The doctor said the food poison was from pork - the only pork I had (the only meat at all in days) was the cured ham at the Mirage buffet. So in the end the buffet has cost a few thousand dollars and it took weeks to recover, thank you Mirage!
