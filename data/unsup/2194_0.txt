Meh - i don't get it.\n\nMy colleagues love coming here. I don't. \n\nThe truth is:\n-Food could potentially be left overs in the buffet (doesn't taste fresh)\n- Meat options are limited \n- Appetizers are limited\n- Service is a little too much but this may not be something to complain about  \n- Dessert choices is only between two things.\n\nWhy do people love this lunch buffet? It's cheap, but if i'm doing a dirty buffet, i'd do the mandarin over this. And i really don't want to go to the mandarin either.
