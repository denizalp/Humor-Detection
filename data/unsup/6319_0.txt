I've been addicted to food delivery apps but have a hard time swallowing the frequent delivery (albeit, minimal and fairly priced) delivery fees. Its nice that you can see the weekly menu ahead of time so you can plan your week. Everything I've tried has tasted fresh, delicious and satisfying. I've ordered frequently from here and have tried the fruit, sandwiches, soups, pita sandwiches, and salads, all of which I would order again.
