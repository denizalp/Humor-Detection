read all the reviews of local hotels and this by far was the best.\nCheck-in was great, great service.\nI booked 3 nights but only needed to stay one after deciding to stay with family after the 1st night. no problems, no cancel fee. \nthe room was clean and they made sure it had extra towels and pillows like we asked. \ngreat service
