The service was awesome. The food portions are crazy large! Definitely shareable foods! I didn't even finish a quarter of my plate. I got the plate with two main items and two sides. The kalbi beef and the furikake chicken. Our group also got the oxtail soup. My buddy got the roast pork which was my favorite. Reminded me of comfort food I ate as a kid. Hawaiian dishes in Vegas and they did a great job. If you're hungry then I definitely recommend this.\n\nRecommendation: Roast pork, furikake chicken, and oxtail soup
