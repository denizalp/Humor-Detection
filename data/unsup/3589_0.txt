Maybe I went on a bad day?  I went with a group of friends here and got the rotisserie chicken with rice along with some fried plantains.  I love plantains, and there is nothing you can do wrong with them, but the chicken on the other hand... Man, talk about dry, dry, dry, dry, dry, and dry.  It was dry and flavorless.  It was the worst.  Also, my friend got sick after eating here.
