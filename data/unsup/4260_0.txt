Momofuku Noodle Bar... I have a word for you.  A made up word that sounds like other words.\n\nFuku.\n\nFuku to the hour wait.\nFuku to the overcooked mediorcre ramen with bland luke-warm broth.\nFuku to the flavourless pork belly bao with soggy skinned pork.\nFuku to cramped seating with nowhere to put my jacket and purse.\nChicken wings.. not bad! Spicy and saucy...You're alright.\n\nWe came here on a Friday night, expecting an overpriced bowl of average ramen.\nAnd that's what we got!\n\nF.u.k.u.\n\nIf you want to talk about it, I'll be at another ramen joint.
