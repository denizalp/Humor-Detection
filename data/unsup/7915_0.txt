Gotta love chanel!! I find this one to be especially nice because not only is it in Vegas (best shopping ever), but it's in the Wynn, which I find to be a particularly pretty hotel. The people who work there are very very friendly, but overly friendly where they're 2 inches behind you asking if you need help every second. The lady who helped me was very nice, and I love how they wrap your purchases up all pretty :)
