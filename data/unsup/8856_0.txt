A very good, all beef hot dog!  \n\nSurprisingly good, but a hell of a long wait to get it unless you come early and miss the lunch crowd, and a slightly intimidating ordering process if you are a first timer.  I need to come try other things here, but so far I can vouch for the all beef hot dog.\n\nOh, and a free piece of salt water taffy at the register for dessert!  (Yas!!)
