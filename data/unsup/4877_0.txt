Glendale Glitters has blown up since I was last there 16 years ago.  It was a mad house of people, cars, stroller and pets.  \n\nI do wish people wouldn't subject their dogs and pets to a crush of people like that.  Even some children were getting overwhelmed.  But the venue was great and well planned.  My favorite discovery was Hey Joe! food truck. Check them out!  good stuff.
