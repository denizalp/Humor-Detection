Based on the reviews here in Yelp, I have given this place a try  and I would say I am frustrated with the level of service I got. I was completely dismissed by a waiter when I asked for water and I had to wait between 35 minutes for each order to come. I don't normally post reviews here but it was so terrible that it would be a disservice not to inform the community. Also I had to pay $65.00 for two people for a lousy dinner pfft.
