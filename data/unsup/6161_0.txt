We got a groupon coupon for Osteria De Medici. And, honestly, the food was very good. The pairings with the wine were delectable, and the food itself rich, self-indulgent, and all kinds of delicious. We had a great time.\n\nAll of that to say, I'm not sure I will be back. It's not that the food and wine weren't awesome, it's that the regular price is very high. Furthermore, there is little vegetarian fare on the menu, which means I'm not really able to eat much anyways.\n\nRegardless, the atmosphere can't really be beat, and the service was top-notch.
