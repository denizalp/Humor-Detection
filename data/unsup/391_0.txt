The food was super delicious!! I got the chickpea and cauliflower tacos, phenomenal. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because a piece of trash made it into my to go bag, thankfully not in my food because it was super gross. I won't share what it was, but it shouldn't be anywhere near food. It's really a bummer as it tainted my experience because it made me nauseous when I found it. I am not giving up on this place though, they just need to double check their packaging\/bags.
