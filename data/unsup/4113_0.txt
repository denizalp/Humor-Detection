They say chocolate is an aphrodisiac, well SOMA is the sex guru. Who needs marriage counselling when the magic ticket is wrapped in chocolate. I've been married for 25 years, but only been faithful for 1 and a half. Well, SOMA always came in for the win. \n\nP.S: they also have ice cream (the chocolates are better though).
