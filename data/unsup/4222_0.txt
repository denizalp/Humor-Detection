In terms of buffet quality, this has to be one of the best I've been to. For about 82 dollars for two people, you gain entry for dinner here located in The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. \n\nThe food seems more upscale with choices like bone marrow, crab legs and even sirloin meats. Needless to say, it's still coming from a buffet and wouldn't compare to a restaurant specializing in these dishes. They also have happy hour on drinks from 5-7pm which is a brilliant idea!\n\nWorth a visit even if you're not staying at The Cosmo.
