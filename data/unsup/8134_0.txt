I agree with previous reviews that this park is small and not well kept up.  On the other hand, being close to Shadyside hospital it can serve as a repose for those visiting or accompanying family there.  It has the potential for being more than it is if we'll kept.  The many benches and sign welcoming to Bloomfield, cry for better care.
