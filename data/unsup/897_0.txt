This Starbucks is located inside the Vdara Hotel. It is your only option for coffee besides the Market Cafe next door. The rooms don't have a coffee maker, but I was ok with that since I like Starbucks.\n\nThis location is small so plan on going back to your room or sitting in the tables near the Market Cafe. It can get awkward if there is a line of people waiting on drinks since it is a small space.
