Well, not much to say here besides their pizza sucks. I live less than 2 miles away and it took an hour and a half to get here. Received a text 30 min before it got here saying the driver was on the way. When it arrived, it was completely cold and lacked toppings. Also, asked for crushed red peppers and received two packages of grated cheese. Stay clear of this location. The pudgy fat delivery guy was a prick too.
