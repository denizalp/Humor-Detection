Was a solid meal!!! Service on a Sunday was beyond world-class. They were attentive and accommodating (brought our kid even though it's not a \"kid kind of place\") - the food was tasty and omg, THAT bread..... I'd suggest passing on the escargot, but filets with pre-cracked king crab legs was downright delicious!!!! YUM. Definitely a fan of the hot apple pie with the scoop of homemade cinnamon ice cream. The bill was hefty, but definitely one of the better steaks I've found in Charlotte. Don't be deterred by the exterior - this place is worth the occasional visit!
