There is a reason that this food stall inside Assembly Chef's Hall is called Shari.\n\nThe shari rice was fluffy with a bite and well seasoned! I personally will be just happy to roll that up in roasted seaweed and eat that as a snack everyday!\n\nBara Charashi ($19.50) a little small for a large! I would have ate that all by myself and more. Fish though was chopped up but still tasted fresh.\n\nNot recommended if you are really hungry, you would not have enjoyed this.
