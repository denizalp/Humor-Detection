After my last horrific experience buying a new car, I swore to myself that I would never step in a new car dealership again.  I was really interested in  GLS300, so broke down and visited these guys.  Told them I was not ready to buy just yet.  They could not have been nicer.  Explained everything about the car and took a test drive.  No pressure, just asked that I give them a chance when I'm ready to buy, which I certainly will.
