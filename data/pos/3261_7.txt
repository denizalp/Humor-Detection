It's a beautiful and historic Basilica loacted in Downtown Phoenix right across from the convention center. It is smaller than I thought, but beautiful nonetheless. \n\nNamed a historic site by Pope John Paul II his statue is right outside. There is also a pretty fountain in the courtyard. There is a small parking lot with posted signs that you have to be registered with the parish to park there. \n\nThe first time I went was in the early evening and it was closed, so please check the hours accordingly before your visit.
