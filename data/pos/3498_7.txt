You can never go wrong here! My usual is a protein burger with two patties and whole grilled onion. The whole grilled onion is way better than the chopped filled with grease onion.\n\nFor fries, I usually get cheese on the top. Yes ladies and gents, it's cheese fries LOL\n\n99% of the time they get it right. Then there's that 1% the patty is super dry and YUCK!
