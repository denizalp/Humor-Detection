STAY AWAY\n\nDAS shipped my Audi from NYC to Berkeley and caused several thousands of dollars of damage.\n\nAlthough I have the proper documentation to prove that damage was caused during transport (loading and unloading papers signed by the drivers) they are refusing to pay for the damage.\n\nIf your car is worth more than 10 dollars stay away from these guys.\nSimply terrible customer service and business practice
