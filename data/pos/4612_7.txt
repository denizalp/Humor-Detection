Absolutely love this place. Fantastic take out service, fast, friendly and the order is always spot on. General Tso's chicken is my fave, the wife loves their Beef Broccoli and this has quickly supplanted the artist formerly known as Panda Express down the street.\n\nSkip the Panda and wok your wei to this wonderful chinese cuisine!
