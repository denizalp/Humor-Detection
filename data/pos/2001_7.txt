I come here for one thing and one thing only.  It is the luxurious thing called mango pudding.  Now the food here is also outstanding and happy hour prices are amazing.  Sunday lunch has some great specials and you can sit at the bar and watch a game and have a glass of wine or sake.  But mango pudding with crystallized ginger, diced mango pieces and a biscotti cookie.  Yay!!!
