Great building. Great views . Great atmosphere. Great location. The only reason its a 1 star is because of the management in this building. Its horrible. Very rude and not polite. I have been living here for a year now and cant wait to leave. Other high rises you should check out is Turnberry towers and Panorama. Stay away.
