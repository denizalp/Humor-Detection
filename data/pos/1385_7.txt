In preparation for a 35 mile walk, I stopped in for some accoutrements to make life a little bit easier during the journey.  After making entry the GF and I proceeded straight to the shoe section in search of socks and stuff to prevent chaffing.  Scott was quick to assist making recommendations on all sorts of different socks and offered up some suggestions to prevent a possible \"rubbing raw\" situation.  After a shake of the hand, I bounced out with everything I had come retrieve.
