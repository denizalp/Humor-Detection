This place isn't worth even one star. The owner\/receptionist is shady. Was quoted over the phone exactly what I wanted. How did just a blow out double in price over the phone to after I was done? The guy who did it was great. But the owner is a money hungry LIAR!!!!!! I will NEVER come back. U should be ashamed of yourself. And the girl who did my moms hair was even worse. Bad day! Bad experience. The reason he couldn't find me in the data base is cuz I don't want you knowing who I am.
