I was first introduced to the Earl In Orlando at Downtown Disney and have been a fan ever since. Glad to see them in Az. Sandwiches are delish and pretty cheap. I always get the turkey dinner sandwich which is yummy! Today I had a few cookies too. I tried the Sugar and a Chocolate Chip. They were pretty good for non bakery treaties.
