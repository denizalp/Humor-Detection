Not much to choose from at the RIO. If you are exhausted, tired and lazy. That's me. I am here.\n\nNothing like any restaurants in Chinatown here or LA, but late in the evening and in the casino, this is it.  Food was pretty average. Pork Chop was a little on the thick side, fish sauce was straight out of container but pretty bland. Pho was just okay. Pretty plain dish.   Wifey says it is meh. Double the price from outside restaurants. Oh well, we are in Vegas.
