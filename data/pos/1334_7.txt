Most Fedex places don't receive great reviews for their customer service, but I had such a great experience with their service I just had to leave a 5 star review. \n\nI was having trouble with the printer and without me having to ask Nancy came up and offered to help me. Thank you!\n\nI came to use their laminator, printer, and fax machine. They also have plenty of pens, glue stick, rubber bands, post it's, scotch tape, stapler remover, staplers, and three hole punchers. Work stations are to the left of the room, full service printing, and shipping services.
