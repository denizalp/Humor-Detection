I usually see Maureen Parker, who I am grateful to for practically saving my life! I've only seen Dr Sparks once but I like her too. This has been the best doctors office I've ever been too. The waits can be a bit long but I expect they are giving other people the detail care they are giving me so I don't mind waiting.
