Yes, it's fast food.  But if I had a choice between McD's and Del Taco, I would choose Del Taco every time.  They have a special of some sort.  This location is clean and I've always had good service weather it's in the drive thru or inside. If you are on a tight budget you can eat here for just a few dollars.  Not too shabby.
