One star for THIS location's complete disregard for customer service! Getting an order right is like rocket science for the employees! \n\n5 stars for Dunkin Donuts food and prices though.  You just have to make sure to walk the employees through the steps of putting a two item order in a bag and giving a napkin with an order.
