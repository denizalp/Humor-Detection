Stopped in here last night before the Krampusnacht festivities began in Market Square.  I was so shocked when I entered the door, that I immediately, and momentarily forgot that the outside world existed.  I was so stupefied that I forgot to check in, or even take a photo.  It was like someone vomited X-mas decorations all along the walls and ceiling . . . I couldn't take it . . . I hurried back out the door . . .
