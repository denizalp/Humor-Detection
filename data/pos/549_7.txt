HOW DOES THIS STILL EXIST AS A MONOPOLISTIC SYSTEM IN SO MANY AREAS?!?!?! \n\nUGGHH absolutely terrible. I think Theon Greyjoy might have been better off in the dungeon than the poor souls having to call COX customer service. \n\nI've had to call multiple times in the past few months (all longer than 45 minutes) after they kept raising my bill by ~30% with no notification, justification or explanation. Always lowered back because they had no valid reason to raise it but such a pain. WHO DOES THAT?!?!
