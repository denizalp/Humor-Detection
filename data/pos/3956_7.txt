sorry...just cannot gush over a breakfast, something I can easily make at home.\n\nPlace is nice, waits were not interminable but it seemed longer than average breakfast wait for food.\n\nEggs, we're talking about eggs...either you make them right or you don't. Heck, I've done just as well at Waffle House for much less.\n\nAnyone who gives this (or any) breakfast place 5 stars must be seriously cooking challenged.
