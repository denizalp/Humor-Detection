This place is terrible.  The manager aka owners son is rude and very disrespectful.  Went there with a large group and he refused to seat us.  Told us it would be better if we left .  The waitress was trying to seat us when manager made a rude comment to my wife.  Instead of beating his ass we left.  Drive the extra 5 miles to the Fiesta great Mexican restaurant just inside:
