Excellent sushi, best price in the area. What I like about this place is the competitive price and the fact that I've been there 3 times since the grand opening in Jan 2012, and they keep getting better everytime. If they continue on this track, they'll really be on top of the game in the area. Changed my rating to a five star after the most recent visit.
