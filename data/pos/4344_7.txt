Awesome playground! This park is so nice to walk around...\n\nThis is where I typically do my jogging and it has amazing trails for light jogs and long walks! Everything is nicely maintained and kept up by the city! All of the lights work, the playground equipment is clean and the walkways are clear. \n\nThe location is easily accessible from multiple places. \n\nIf you have a family and you want to go to a very nice park...this is your place! \nIf you are looking for a place to exercise with awesome scenery...then this is your place! \n\nEnjoy
