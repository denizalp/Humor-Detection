such a beautiful experience whether its night or day! ive never stayed at the bellagio so im not sure how the view is but im sure its even more amazing being right in front\/above it. you can get a great view from Paris which is right across, but being right in front is nice and you can sometimes feel the mist if its a little breezy that day. great place to take pictures or recuperate after walking around in heels.
