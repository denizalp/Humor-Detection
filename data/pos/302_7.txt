I saw this shop while out on lunch yesterday and did a little yelp search and found out they just opened last week. I bought a few to try out- the Red Velvet with Cream Cheese, Classic Glaze, Nutty Professor and Strawberry Shortcake. My favorite was the Strawberry shortcake- not overly sweet and tasted fresh. The plain glaze was also good, simple yet delicious. Least favorite was the Red velvet, didn't taste as fresh.
