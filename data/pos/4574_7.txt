This club is comparable to most united clubs. There is ample space, limited snacks, and it is quiet. The outlets are a disaster with very poorly designed placement. Beware of ranch dressing tubs - they will explode upon opening, and may result in the unfortunate placement of white sauce in areas that may cause embarrassment.
