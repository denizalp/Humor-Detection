I love their boba tea.  I get the black milk tea with large boba.  Almost all the time, the boba are fresh.  A lot of these places mess up the boba, and when it's messed up it's nastyy!  They have lots of weird and different flavors, but I always get the same thing...I'm boring, I guess :)\n\nWatch out for crazy asians who can't drive in the parking lot! Waaaaleeee!
