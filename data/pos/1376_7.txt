Skip this shop all together.  The pricing is ridiculous and the candy I purchased (gummy coke bottles) was so stale I had to throw it away.\n\nThis establishment has pictures displayed all over town of celebs licking their suckers. The true suckers are the shoppers paying a fortune for Walmart quality candy.  Save your money.
