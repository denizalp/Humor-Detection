I feel like I complain a lot about the foods that I don't like... but I'm doing it again. I don't like hot dogs. My sister, though, convinced me one day to be adventurous and get a hot dog from Dazzo's. I will admit, it wasn't bad. If I had an idea of a great hotdog, that would be it, but as I said before, I'm not a hotdog fan. The fries were fantastic, but greasy, which is fine because I'm already blowing a weeks worth of calories by thinking about eating here.
