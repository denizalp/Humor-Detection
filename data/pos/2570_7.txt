By far the best Pho place for miles! Amazing Thai tea (which we got for free by checking in), I got the meat pho which is awesome and my boyfriend got the fried chicken wings which were BOMB.com! Service so so friendly and very clean restaurant. Super cute (or if your a guy reading this: super awesome) environment. Definitely recommend- definitely will be back- and definitely satisfied!
