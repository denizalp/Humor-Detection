Halo,\n\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the gauge. Or the piercings. Or the number of stunning jewelry pieces I have purchased over the years.\n\nI have recommended that so many people go here, and many have, only to leave as satisfied customers. Halo knows its business. They are detail-oriented, obsessed with cleanliness, and with impeccable taste--in short, everything you want when you are about to put metal, wood, bone, etc., into your body.\n\nThe variety of jewelry is amazing. No, it's not cheap. If you want cheap (i.e.,  low-quality, tacky pieces), go to Hot Topic.
