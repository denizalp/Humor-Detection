***This is a nice library inside-and-out; the exterior design is good and I really like the interior (it has a great classical and historical look, but they have also done a really good job updating this library to make it contemporary and comfortable); their collection is also good though the central public library in Downtown Los Angeles is more impressive***\n\nThere are a few nearby paid lots and structures; since this library is located right in Downtown Cleveland, parking is expensive.
