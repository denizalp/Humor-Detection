liked the location around the San tan mall and this one is just as awesome. definitely more geriatrics at this one but way better seating and much shorter wait times. I guess to offset the blue hairs they hire exclusively high school girls to serve, but the visual drama this schism creates (the ravenous dead being served by the vitality of youth) only enhances your dining experience.  also they have a ton of local microbrews all on draft
