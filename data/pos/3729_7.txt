Hoping this would be one of the top cafeterias in the nation as it is the top program for Hospitality but boy was I wrong! They have the most minimal choices for food and also the no brand food from cereal, fruits, drinks. Other campus have so much more variety and the many of the good schools usually have name brand cereals! I guess they want you to eat out and explore Vegas food instead of vegetating in the dorms and studying.
