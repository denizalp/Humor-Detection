I was here at the opening bell on a Saturday with a group that took over about 1\/2 the seating inside, and it was hot outside. The food was good. The folks working there were pleasant and knowledgeable.  I don't think I care for the assembly line in this case. It gets all bunched up because halfway through the process your meal goes in the oven but you can't just walk away because in a few minutes you have some more choices to make.  It does have parking which is a plus downtown.
