I have been going here for years , place is pretty clean and most of the nail techs are nice .. The owner isn't very friendly , luckily she is not there often, but you can tell the staff is scared of her . I am normally very happy with my nails - only thing I cannot stand , is their constant Vietnamese music . When they first started playing it last year , the owner told me that the customers request it .. Uh ok , doubt that since nobody can understand it .
