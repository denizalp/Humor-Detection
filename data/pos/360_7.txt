Probably the worst Sephora I have ever visited. Walked by not one, two, three, but four employees and not a single one greeted or offered me any help. What's the point of having so much staff if all they do is walk around looking like they enjoy the smell of their own farts? The store is also so small and awkwardly cramped that they have to fit the register on small ledges on the sides on the store.
