Oh Costco, how I love thee.  Except for the annoying habit of causing me to somehow lose $300 each time I walk in, I love Costcos generally.  Love their prices, Kirkland brand products.  Love their return policy.  Rotisseries are big and somewhat underflavored.  This one is less crowded than most, which I appreciate.  Treat yourself to a froyo at the end of your shopping spree and look at your receipt and wonder again how you managed to blow so much money so quickly.
