I used to LOVE Burrito Boyz and go there once or twice a week for lunch, but unfortunately I had a particularly vicious (and confirmed) case of food poisoning from and haven't returned since. \n\nTheir burritos are tasty and affordable but unfortunately the indigestion you suffer from afterwards isn't worth the trouble.
