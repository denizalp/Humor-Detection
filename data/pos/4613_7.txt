Welcome Tesla to North Scottsdale. Tonight was the grand opening celebration of Tesla's Kierland Commons location. Free drinks, food and desserts. Of course, its invite only and entry with name on the guest list. It was a huge turnout. Meeting some of the employees and fellow Tesla owners was fun and exciting. Hope this location does as well as their fashion square location. Stop by and take a look and maybe get on the waitlist for their more affordable model 3.
