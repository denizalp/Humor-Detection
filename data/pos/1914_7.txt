I attended their grand opening and thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The beer selection is excellent. There were lots of food trucks to choose from.\n\nThere's plenty of parking. The park is well situated along the Allegheny River, the river trail, and a kayak launch. \n\nThere are lots of picnic tables and a few Adirondack chairs. \n\nOverall a fun scene, I can see this will be even more popular as the weather warms up.
