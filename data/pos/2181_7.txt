Their used casino card decks start at $1.25 (Mandalay Bay, El Cortez, The Palms, Downtown Grand, Harrah's, and more). The people working here are helpful and friendly, and there's plenty of parking right outside the shop so you can get in and out really quickly. I wouldn't get playing cards anywhere else, as long as I'm in town!
