Great bar. This is my favorite downtown bar. It's a small piano bar.\nDre is the absolute best. Her voice is amazing. I love bringing people in here, because she always exceeds expectation. \nBartenders are friendly and drinks aren't too expensive. The venue is small, so if you don't get there early... it becomes standing room only.\n\nDoor security was personable and friendly.
