Monty's, Monty's......I love you Monty's. I love your grilled chicken salad. I love all your sandwiches. I love the coffee and fountain drinks. I get frustrated when the wait is long....and I'm sorry..the pies are beautiful and the fillings are delicious, but the pie crusts are NOT flaky. You can't have a pie without a flaky crust. It aint fitting! I wish you would open up a Monty's in Fitchburg! I love you Monty's!
