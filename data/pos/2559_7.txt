Very mediocre. \n\nThis place is so close to my house, and I wish it had the potential to be a regular happy hour spot, but sadly it does not. \n\nI went roughly 6 months ago, so hopefully some things have changed. \n\nThey had no beer on tap... really? Shocking. The food and decor were average. The prices were reasonable. \n\nUntil they have beer on tap we will not return.
