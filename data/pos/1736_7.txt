If you're interested in wasting a lovely Saturday afternoon with a LARGE group of skeeze-bags, then this is definitely the place for you. \nNot only will you be gawked at by the mouth-breathing salesmen, but you'll have the treat of being run in circles, hassled and treated like a complete f*cking moron. \nI just spent 4 hours in the god forsaken pit of doom with my family and will NEVER return. \nYou couldn't pay me to shop there. \n What a f***ing nightmare. \nthats my review.\nNever. Again. Period.
