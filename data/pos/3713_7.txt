The club is clean and spacious. The available snack selection is on par with other united clubs, but keep in mind the united snack menu is already an epic disaster. We gave it 3 stars primarily because the power outlets are underneath the coffee tables and largely inaccessible and there were no bananas. 2 stalls in the men's bathroom - insufficient and inadequate  - there are many travelers accessing this club after excessive alcohol consumption.
