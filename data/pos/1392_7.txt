This is a nice Thai restaurant in Regent Square.  I like Thai food spicy and they are glad to oblige.  Their soups are all good, but I'm partial to those with coconut milk.  The staff is friendly and efficient. The curries are all excellent, red, green, yellow and traditional Massaman are all tasty.  Chicken is thin cut and delicious in curries and soups.  Summertime is nice to eat hear because of the outdoor seating allowing for enjoying lunchtime sun and for people watching in the Square.  Many other places to stop near by.  I recommend the restaurant.
