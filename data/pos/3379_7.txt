It's a must see or stay hotel. \nThis is a wonderful nice big hotel with great fine dining (tao is my favorite) and a huge casino. It also offers fine shopping and the grand canal for gondola rides. It's the mini version of Venice. \nIt also shares the palazzo hotel next to it. \nThe Venetian is an expensive hotel to stay specially on weekends and or if any big conventions going on in Vegas. But sometimes you got a say wth and do it. Yolo!!
