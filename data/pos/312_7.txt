Hash house a go go.? \nWhat an interesting name. \n\nSteak n eggs are decent with a glob of potatoes glued together in one heap. \nSteak is decent, not great, but not bad either and comes with two tiny baby eggs.\nCoffee was great and the service was outstanding.   Seemed like every employee got involved in bringing all the food plates to our group and they were excellent on the refills. \nMake sure and have Greg as your waiter.   He's excellent about explaining the menu to you and is a crack up.\n\nOne of the better eating places in this nightmare hotel.
