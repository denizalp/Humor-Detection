Maaaannn !!! Lefty been cutting my hair for about 8 years now. And I'm proud to see that he has created the classiest and most professional black barbershop in the country. From the entrance to the atmosphere, its no wonder that it's the best barbershop in town and always packed. I drive all the way from N. Scottsdale and even when I lived in Vegas whenever I came back to Phoenix I made my way out to Chandler to get my cut. You playing yourself if you go to another barbershop. This ain't no game! This Lefty's !
