I haven't been to Earl of Sandwich since my daughter lived in Florida. I forgot what a reasonable great sandwich they have! I had the bbq pineapple and it was delicious. The bread is always great and fresh. The restaurant was clean and bright despite the small space. The service was quick and friendly and the sandwich was hot and fresh! Can't ask for more than that! There is also a check in offer for 10% off which is always a great bonus from Yelp!
