The LOVE Cirque du Soleil show..is magical and colorful.  This was one of the best birthday gifts I have received and I totally enjoyed the show.  I was transported to Beatle's era and everything was lovely and perfect from the music, performers, awesome acrobats.  I didn't know all the Beatles music but I still loved the show and was super impressed from start to finish.
