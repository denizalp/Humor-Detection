It's a decent spot to get breakfast type foods. I made a take-away order this last Saturday.\n\nWaffle - Strawberry\/Nutella: Nutella was not used, it seemed more like a chocolate syrup.\nPotato Scramble: Enjoyed it, was pretty good.\nTornado Fries (Flame Grill BBQ): I can't really comment on this one because when I got home, they hadn't packed it with the rest of the food.\n\nDisappointed that I didn't get the entire meal nor was Nutella used.
