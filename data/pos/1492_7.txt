This has to be the worst hospital around. The emergency room had a 7 hour wait...I came in by ambulance.....had to have a family member  take me to another hospital....never ever again! I had high fever and stomach pain..shakes and chest pain.The nurse probably still thinks I'm in the hallway where she left me to die.
