It's a dive bar, with a kitchen, with very limited smokiness. Unclear whether smoking is disallowed indoors, or if they just have a great ventilation system. They also have pool tables, and booths for dine-in seating. Staff was polite, service was perfunctory, prices were cheap, built-in gaming at the bar.
