Things I love about Las Vegas:\n  My hair dries in record time\n  You can drink all day long\n  No one looks a you strangely if you dress up\n  So much to see and do\n  You can sit by the pool anytime of year\n\nThings I hate about Las Vegas:\n  Immune system is shot after three days\n  Can only stay here for about 72 hours before you go insane from slot music\n  Taxis are outrageously expensive\n  People walk slower than normal\n  Buffet desserts aren't nearly as good as the buffet entrees
