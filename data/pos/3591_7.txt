Munching on crazy spicy buffalo wings and soggy french fries at 2am after a long night of drinking foot long margaritas out of cheesy cups with tambourines attached is NEVER a good idea. It's particularly a bad idea to indulge yourself in this kind of behavior at the All American Bar and Grille. It will give you heartburn.
