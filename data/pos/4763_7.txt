Bathroom stinks.  Juke box is like crack - fun, but it gets expensive FAST.  $1 pool?  BOO.  My entire body can attest that the $4 mini-pitchers (which works out to about two and a half glasses) do what they were made to do.  Heather is awesome, though.  She kinda reminded me of my sister, maybe in a few years.
