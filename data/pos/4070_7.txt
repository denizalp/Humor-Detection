This place is a hoarders paradise!\n\nIt's a good thing this place is so huge because these items are NOT priced to sell.  They are priced to sit and collect dust.  \n\nI liked walking around and looking at everything but it was pretty overwhelming because its so large and every nook and cranny is packed with craperola.  I did enjoy looking around but there aren't enough hours in the day to see everything.
