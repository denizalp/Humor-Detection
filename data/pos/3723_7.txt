Great food and atmosphere. Came after work with about 8 ppl and got a nice Center room table. We were tempted to order the whole menu (which they have an option on the menu that is pretty well priced). We opted for about 8 appetizers and drinks. The only one we all agreed was blah was the Mac and cheese. It didn't have any seasoning. Other than that, everything was delicious.
