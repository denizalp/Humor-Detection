I've been coming to this park for some early evening runs as the weather begins to cool down.  There are enough hills to add a bit of a challenge, and like Marian said there is plenty of signage to guide you where you need to go.  My only complaints are the lack of lighting as the sun begins to go down earlier, and there are sections where a questionable smell with hit you in the face here and there.  Still beats running at the gym with a sweaty tread-neighbor!
