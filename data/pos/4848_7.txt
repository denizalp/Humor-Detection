Two words Don't bother. \n\nTed's is bland tasteless food. I asked for easy rice and still got a large handful on my burrito, it was also dry AF maybe they forgot to add sauce then asked if I wanted fresh or packaged ginger on the side I of course opted for the fresh which turned out to be the pink pickled variety which in my opinion is HORRIBLE. \n\nThe best part of the meal was the Hawaiian chips.
