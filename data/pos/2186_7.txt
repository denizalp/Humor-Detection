A good place for a pint. Basic food. Love the patio upstairs. Great atmosphere. Great place to watch \"the game\". Service is awful though - you could sit there for 20-30 minutes without even being noticed. Don't be afraid to flag someone down! But at least dining and dashing here is a viable option...?
