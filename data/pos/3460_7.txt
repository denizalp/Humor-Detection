Our group reserved a cabana and a friend was not allowed in WHATSOEVER, and threatened with an arrest for trespassing for possession of a joint without having her medical card on her. \n\nMeanwhile, we all watched the group next to us do lines without a slap on the wrist. \n\nHey security, don't worry. We won't be returning to any Wynn property, by choice. GFY
