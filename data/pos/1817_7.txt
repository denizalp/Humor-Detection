The meal I had here was 'ok' at best, used to be Tony's a greasy spoon that made a damn good greasy spoon breakfast for like $5. \nIt seems to be some sort of hipster idiot attempt at a greasy spoon, meaning the food was bland and lower than my expectations and at the end of it I paid through my anus.\n\nEggs bene and a glass of OJ ran me more than $20 with a tip. \nI have never gone back nor would I.
