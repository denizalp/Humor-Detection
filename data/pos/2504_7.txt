St. Mary's is conveniently located in downtown Phoenix and warmly welcomes everyone who enters.  My only complaint is the heavy smell of incense before we even entered the church (it wasn't a bad scent, just REALLY heavy).  \n\nWe stepped inside en route to the convention center one day and it was beautiful and inviting inside.  Not sure what services they offer, but stop by and check 'em out!
