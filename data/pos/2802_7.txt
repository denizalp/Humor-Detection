I should have tried the subs, according to the other reviews those are good. We got 4 pizzas and not one of them was even edible. They were tasteless and the toppings were blah. I would never get the pizza again. Had it not been the Tuesday night special where the 2nd pizza was 99 cents, I would have felt completely ripped off.
