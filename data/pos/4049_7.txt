I've been devirginized from the glory that is Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup.\n\nThis meal was everything I had hoped for and more. IT'S THE ISH! After getting a beating from Tao and XS, all I needed was some fresh, chewy noodles, soft, tender chunks of beef, and piping hot, spicy\/sweet broth down my throat.\n\nYes, my friends, it was like a euphoric version of Pho after a bad night of drinking in K-Town. 4 stars, only because I have to give the other items on the menu a taste.
