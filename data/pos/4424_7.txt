No wonder, the rating has\/is going down for this restaurant.  My second time to this place was for a to-go pick up and it wasn't a feel good experience, importantly because of their hospitality.  They don't greet you, they keep talking over the phone and show hand gestures to you so you don't know if they ask you to wait, sit somewhere, talk to someone or get out or whatever.  \nPLEASE greet your customers and be professional.  From other reviews, I understand the taste and quality has gone down a lot.  That's sad!!
