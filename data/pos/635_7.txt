I had a great experience here at petland . I loved the staff . They were friendly\nKnowledgeable and caring . No pushy tactics just good sales staff period! I got a baby beagle here while I was just brousing missing mine who had\nJust passed at 17 years 2 weeks prior  . They offer a full puppy for life guarantee and full coverage of vet bills for the first 2\nWeeks should your baby contract anything. I love this place !
