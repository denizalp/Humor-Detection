Laguna fixed some waterfall rock and rock work that had been cracking off and rusting. Once they started the project they worked right through and if they had days off, they notified us. They did a great job after all was said and done (had to fix a few more cracks after painted, but they immediately came back to fix them and repaint).  The owner and foreman were always responsive.  They also resurfaced and stained new spray deck which looks great.
