Not bad, not bad at all.\n\n24 hour delivery? Word.\n\nOrdered at about quarter past three in the morning during a snowstorm in Montreal after watching Goodfellas with my cousin and a few beers and a couple of cigarettes of this kind and that. 40 minutes later buddy shows up at the door with a large all dressed, hot off the oven. Traditional Montreal style with the pepperoni under the cheese. Hit the spot.\n\nAngela's is definitely on the radar for future latenight munchies in MTL.
