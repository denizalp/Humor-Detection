I love Las Vegas but of late, I'm completely annoyed by the hudreds of porno-card-flicking illegal immigrants that harass everyone trying to walk on the street.  There are also thousands of these cards littered all over the place - actually making it quite slippery, as I watched 2 different people slip and fall because of them... \n\nMessage to Vegas:  Clean up this grotesque mess. There's a place for this thing (and I have zero moral issue with it), except when it's forced in my face on every single block on the strip.
