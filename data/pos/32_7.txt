Wow, hit the spot ribs for a hungry crew.  The ribs are tasty, tender and moist and the sauce was good.  Had the sweet Sweet Potatoes and cheesy Mac & Cheese as sides...all very good.  The cornbread is some of the best I have every tasted...very moist and filling.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and helpful.   If you are looking for a good rib dinner you won't be disappointed.  There are two small tables outside and a couple of tables inside...we did take out.
