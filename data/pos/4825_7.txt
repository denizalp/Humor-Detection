It is what it is, kitschy.  While Buca Di Beppo has the market on that keyword, there something nostalgic about coming to the real McCoy.\n\nIt's not really a \"hole in the wall\".  It's pretty large with varies rooms.  A block off the strip, its great for a large party get-together (wedding rehearsal, sweet 16, etc), because it won't set you back.  Reasonable prices, huge food, and somewhat delish.\n\nSpecials rule the nest, but there is a 25 item list will get your mouth watering.  Slurp.\n\nIt's fun.
