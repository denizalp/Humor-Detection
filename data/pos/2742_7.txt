'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies. And I never been to Mexico. I imagine Mexico would be a lot more like Villa Y Zapata and a lot less like the restaurants that use the super bright paint and all look the same (El Jalapenos, Cozumel etc...). The exterior paint job is impressive as the food itself. The pricing is pretty standard for Mexican ($10-$13). The guacamole add on for $2 is well worth it.
