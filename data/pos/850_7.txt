Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember.\n\nI'll always remember lunch at Chino Bandido. I got the carnitas burrito, you got the Chinese BBQ pork quesadilla. We shared a fountain drink with no ice. The whole experience was really nice.\n\nThen we stood at your car door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it.
