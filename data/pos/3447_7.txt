This place is ridiculous. After waiting for almost an hour for food in a restaurant that wasnt that busy, breakfast was inedible. The pancakes were burned, the bacon like charcoal, and my husband took maybe 2 bites of his bitzee skillet. How hard is it to make breakfast? After waiting that long it should have been perfect or at least edible. Blech. Run in the other direction people. Oh and the bathroom plunger with dried toilet paper all over it was a nice touch in the bathroom.
