Have been to Kaya many times and have always enjoyed our meals.  Surprised that I have not written a review until now. Have had many items on the menu including brunch.  We stopped in on a Thursday because one in our group really loves the Fried Chicken Thursday.  The chicken is really good and comes with a very tart slaw and it had a very good homemade ranch dipping sauce.  \nThe drinks are good.  Our waiter was very good.  Refills when needed, helpful with the menu and with a nice personality!
