Oysters and beer! We enjoyed half a dozen clams and a dozen of oysters with beer. The food was delicious and fresh. It is an open, casino oyster bar\/restaurant with minimal service. After we were done with our drinks the waitress never came by asking us if we need another drink or anything else for that matter. She took our order and that was that. So -1 star for minimal service, but the quality of the oysters makes up for the rest. It is not cheap but won't break your bank..I think around $20 for a dozen of oysters.
