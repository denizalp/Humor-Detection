Part diner and part lounge, it's 24 hours of fun and games with a mixed crowd sure to give you characters for stories.  It's doesn't look like it's been remodeled since the 70's, or at least, it's been made to look like it so that part of it's charm.\n\nFood prices run a bit high but it's HUGE portions, 3-4 star in quality, and has a wide menu.\n\nI like it for various reasons; food is only partial.  Good for late night.
