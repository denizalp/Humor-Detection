I moved here from Iowa 6 months ago, and places like Sports Clips have never been an option for me. Luckily I got turned on to this place by a coworker, and couldn't be happier. I've been 4 times, and due to some staffing changes and my busy schedule, I've seen 4 different stylists. I can honestly say I've been truly happy with each of them. Everyone here really knows what they are doing. They are are friendly and professional. Also, I don't know what kind of magic shampoo they use, but it tingles and feels amazing!
