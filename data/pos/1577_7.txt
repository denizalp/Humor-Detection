Haven't been here in years and decided to try again. The service was superb. Food came out very, very quickly. We had Nellie chips as an appetizer. Straight out those were cold and weird. I wouldn't order again and I ate them, but only because I was starving. \nThe fish & chips were pretty good. The fish was delicious, flavorful (I guess for fish), and flaky. The french fires were good, not the best french fries ever, but good. We would definitely go back and this visit was better than we remember it all those years ago!
