Apple clearly showed its anti-Constitutional colors last night. Greg the head honcho said that Apple does not allow customers to wear firearm in any of their stores. Apple does not believe in nor does it support th 2nd Amendment. I so hate Apple now. I love my iPhone and was about to purchase an iPad 3. When I was asked to leave the store and never return.
