What an amazing view! They can serve me turds on a plate and would still give it 5 stars base soley on the view!\n\nThe prices aren't cheap, but not over expensive either. They could charge much more based on location in my book.\n\nThe steaks are awesome, and the salads are super yum!  I would say it's a great date spot!
