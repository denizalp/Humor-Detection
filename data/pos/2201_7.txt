BBQ Pulled Pork sliders with a side of slaw.  OMG - so good.  Not too tangy.  Perfect with not too creamy cole slaw.  Hubby had an amazing chicken wrap.  I should have ordered that. \n\nSnacks is a perfect little stop for a 'cheaper' meal in Vegas, or just a, well, snack.  Soups, chili, burgers, salads - lots of business goes to the folks stopping by for a little something before heading back to the Sports Book next door.\n\nGreat little place.
