I cant believe people still use dsl for their internet! \nAcanac's cable is awesome! \n-No setup fee's\n-Steady download speed of ~3MB per second(speedtest.net says my speed is about 30mb)\n-No limits\n-100 gb of Ftp storage for free\n-Forum with aswers to any question, works better than any customer service\n-Customer service is fine, open up a support ticket under ur profile online and someone will get back to you fast, mark it Urgent if u'd like to make it faster. Unless it an emergency then give them a call.
