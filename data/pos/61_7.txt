I was convinced to go here by some girlfriends.\n\nHoly gawd, it was the lamest show ever.\n\nFor the $50 ticket admission price, I'd rather get a lap dance at the Spearmint Rhino.\n\nBad choreography, desperate screaming women, cheesy Firemen costumes and short Steroided Australian men bored me to tears.\n\nBut then again, you might like it . Not my type.\n\nWhere's my drink?
