I had my hair colored and cut here a while back and forgot to write a review! The salon first of all, was dirty and dusty; everywhere I looked needed a dusting. The girl who colored my hair did not do a good job and they charged a ridiculous amount. At the register I remember the lady she was older black hair, she looked maybe from India, sold me shampoo and conditioner for blonde hair--when I am brunette! I am not sure how this place even operates but I would NOT recommend it.
