No thank you.\n\nThe service at po'boys is nice, but the food was just...hideous.  I went on a Sunday afternoon with a friend and we managed to choke down al the food in front of us and immediately regret it.  The barbecue was just absolutely gross and the location itself was entirely lackluster.  While I know it has its fans, I just can't do it, PB.  I'm sorry.
