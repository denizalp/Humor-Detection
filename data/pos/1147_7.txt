The restaurant is on the corner of a shopping center and is kind of hidden. The atmosphere is good and it felt authentic. My biggest complaint was the service. I think they were short a server but it took some time for our waitress to come back to take our order. Also, where was the Italian music? \n\nThe important thing though.. It's the food. Deeeeeeelicous!\n\nLasagna 5\/5- great taste! Cooked just right and isn't too crazy with the cheese \n\nItalian wedding soup 5\/5\n\nGarlic bread 3.5\/5\n\nBaked ziti 4\/5
