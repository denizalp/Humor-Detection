So today I went in (as I do about 5 days a week). I was having trouble finding the perfect butt exercise. Sean \"Shawny Sean\", the trainer, helped me out by showing me the Brazilian butt lift. OUCHIE! I will have problems sitting down later. I just keep telling myself that swimsuit season is just around the corner.
