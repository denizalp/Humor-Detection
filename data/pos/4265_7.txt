What a great find.  I love places like this,  casual and very chill.  The decor was neat,  the tables weren't all packed together,  nice bar and very friendly service.  We came late on a Saturday night and decided to split a pizza and salad.  We got the large sized salad and it was a good amount for 2 people.  The Hog Wild pizza was delish as well.  Very pleasant experience and will be one of my go to places next time I visit the wonderful city of Toronto!
