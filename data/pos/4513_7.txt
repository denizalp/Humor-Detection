Came here with the BF in the middle of the day. Didn't see any gangsters but I did see some shady people that were hanging around the door that looks like they're on something.  We were just picking up some food and the selection and price was okay. We bought our groceries and got outta there. I can totally understand why it'd be a bad place to go to after dark.
