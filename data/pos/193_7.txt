It's impossible to go wrong on Mondays.  $3 burger and fries?  It's true.  Super props to the Bistro Burger for it's use of ciabatta bread, angus beef, and perfectly delectable fries.  If you come between 3-6 on Monday, you can also take advantage of the Happy Hour menu.  Of course my favorite is the $5 Wingless Dip that is served with pita bread and tortilla chips.  Add a $3 glass of red sangria and I'm set.  \nNow's a great time to sit and enjoy the outdoor patio on the cheap!
