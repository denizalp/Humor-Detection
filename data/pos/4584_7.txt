Manager working today, girl named Tony (July 12 @ 130pm) is SO LOUD yelling in the kitchen...which unfortunately is basically IN the dining area. Sounds like I'm on kitchen nightmares with Gordon Ramsey. She's belittling her co-workers and barking out orders. She's also singing really annoying songs as well.  Can't stand it.  What an unpleasant experience to eat here. I am SO glad I don't work with this lady. Now that would suck. :)
