Checking out this am after three days of PURE HELL. This is the most rednecked, ghetto hotel  inCleveland, How the hell did the yget 1 star .  SMOKE FREE????\nGimme a BREAK!  The stupid empoyees  don't even undstand the concept of smoke free . The front end manager made frcking feeble attempt  to address the issue by saying use another  door. I hope this  place  BURNS down  immediately.\nMeanwhile,  I will be calling the Ohio Health Department every week when I get back to LA.\n                    death to the crowne plaza \n\n\nHATE THE CROWNE PLAZA!  BURN,  HOTEL BURN!!!
