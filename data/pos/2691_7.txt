One of my favorite restaurants in the world. A mix of Japanese and Brazilian fusion cuisines. Take your great sushi and Japanese seafood, and throw in unique Brazilian flavors. Everything here tastes amazing. It's also pricey ($25-75 per person depending on what you order), but worth it.\n\nThe cod is dipped in unique sauces that even the most seasoned palates can't distinguish.\n\nThe sushi rolls have some sort of flair that make me want to watch Dragon Ball Z while doing the samba during Carnival.\n\nThe Chilean sea bass is basically an orgasm in your mouth. Lord almighty! Get it.
