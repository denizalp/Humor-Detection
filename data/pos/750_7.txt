Gorgonzola and pear sounds like the WORST gelato flavor ever to exist.  That is, until you try it.\n\nHoly crap, it's now my favorite flavor!  The moldy-cheese flavor paired with the sweetness of the pear is fabulous.  I've never seen this flavor anywhere else -- so unique.  I can't wait to try their other random flavors.\n\nBut, if cheese-flavored gelato isn't your thing, they also have more traditional flavors like pistachio, chocolate-chip, strawberry, etc.\n\nThis is a definite must try if you're in the neighborhood!
