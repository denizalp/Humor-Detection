I never have written a yelp review before but after my experience here I had to sign up. The place is basically fine, the pries are good, but I have had multiple run-ins with a tall, balding and surly manager whose behaviour is consistently aggressive and unprofessional. If you absolutely have to print something at this place, get in someone else's line. Other employees are very helpful.
