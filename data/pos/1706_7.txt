Bring out the stretchy pants!!! \nI love seafood! Loved their salmon and tuna poke. King crab legs that they will steam for you. SEA BASS was Badass. Grilled veggies. Shrimp fajitias!!! I didn't get to sample everything but we went there two nights in a row and I stuck to my favs. Had the banana cake and chocolate covered strawberries. Tasted a few other deserts but wasn't worth a second bite. Creme brûlé  was also good.
