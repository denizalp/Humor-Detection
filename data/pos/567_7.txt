Tea and coffee were complimentary for hotel guest but limited to 2 and can use as credits. \n\nThe cashier guy didn't seem too enthusiastic or customer service eccentric when we arrived. He really didn't care, which was fine with us because we just wanted the free coffee and tea. \n\nTea was tea, nothing crazy.m or special. Coffee you get the regular one but can use the second drink credit if you wanted to update to like a espresso shot. \n\nOther store items were obviously marked up aka Vegas pricing. Go to Walgreens next door for your shopping needs!
