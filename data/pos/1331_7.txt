This is really not a bad Walmart as they go. There really is a huge selection of everything here. The prices are killer. Though THis time of year is not the best time to shop.\nYou just have to make sure that you get here early before things get crazy.\nIf you do come early , you have more to choose from and there are better parking spots.\nThe deli is quite impressive as well. A t for the workers here they really try to make everyone happy. Which is a tough job.
