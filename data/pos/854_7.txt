Rumor. Hm. Well, honestly- At first glance inside I did like the decor. It lives up to the term \"boutique hotel\". What threw me off about it is the kind of people that hang out there. I say there is a 10-3 ratio, 10 being ghetto folks and 3 being non-ghetto folks. It seemed the later it got in the night, the people looked more and more sketch. Trust me, I'm a little rough around the edges. But this was a little too hood for me. \n\nIt's too bad. I was hoping for a different crowd.
