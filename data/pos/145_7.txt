Fun place to go.  Consistent food, friendly service, and cheap prices.  Huge selection as well for a restaurant of this size.\n\nI am hesitant to write reviews of my favorite spots as I fear they will 'blow up,' become too crowded and in turn the quality will go down.  But this place has already been discovered on the internet so I feel there is no harm done.\n\nPlease be polite, quiet, and tip well to keep this place as good as it has been.
