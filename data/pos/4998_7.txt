Not your ordinary sandwich shop!  Good homemade soups, too!  Have a long list of specialty sandwiches, quesadillas and Pretzel sandwiches.  \n\nThe sign said,  \"Stokes is Soooo BYOB.  And we did.  It is so nice to be able to have a nice bottle of wine with our meal!\n\nThe Crab Bisque was very good with lots of crabmeat. Yum!  The Widow Maker sandwich was good, a grilled Italian deli meats, turkey and provolone cheese with town eggs on top, served on French Bread.  Delicious!\n\nF had Green Fries that disappeared before I could steal a couple.  Guess they were good.
