It's BBQ meets Pygmalion!  They've taken the venerable Southern country store concept, think Rudy's in Austin, and dressed it up a notch or two.  I got the tacos so that I sample three meats.  I wound up discarding the tortillas so I could focus on the flavor.  All three had a great smoky char that was moist and tender without being too fatty or gristlly.  I haven't fully penetrated the sauce bar but I'm pretty sure that I will explore its depths on future visits.
