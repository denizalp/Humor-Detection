Whose **** do I need to suck to get a drink around here ?\n\nOh joy. The owner's.\n\nThe tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed. When they aren't being molested by their boss they may have time to service you.\n\nThis is too painful a scene, which could very well lead to more drinking..\n\nFortunately, I have money to purchase a drink, so Ill be at Hideaway West.
