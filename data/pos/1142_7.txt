There are more weird statues in here than in Norton Furniture. You must let your eyes adjust if coming in from the sun because you just may think that some of the figures are real. The food was pretty good. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. If you ever decide to drive out to the Headlands beach, you may as well stop here, eat some food and drink a beer in a very unique environment.
