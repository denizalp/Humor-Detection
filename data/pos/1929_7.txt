Long lines everywhere ! Started with wanton soup n find the wanton overcooked.next tried the wok.put almost all ingredients and chose tempura sauce which I like. Next teppanyaki,had to wait half an hour for one steak, hot items another 15 to 20 minutes from the line then desserts,maybe another 15 to 20 minutes that I have to eat the dessert while on the line.when we finished its already 3 pm which is their closing time for lunch.
