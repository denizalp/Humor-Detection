I got the Hong Kong milk tea ice cream and it was delicious. Strong flavours and it hit the spot. Satisfying on a hot day or after a full meal. We also got Thai iced tea soft serve but that fell short for us. It was a little bland but I feel like that's what usually happens with soft serve ice cream in general. Would like to try the cookies and cream Cookie Monster special (they dye the ice cream blue!)
