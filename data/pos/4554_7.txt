I had Chris Bennett (owner) come to the house to discuss an estate sale.  2 days later I contacted him to \"get the ball rolling\".  No response.  Another 2 days later, I again contacted him.  No response.  When I finally was able to communicate with him, he acted incredulous ... you mean you didn't get the contract?  I had never given him my address or e-mail, so he clearly was LYING.    Gut instinct was \"he's arrogant\" and that was right on.  Not giving him my money!
