ridiculous.i spent 150.00 for 4 people for this whole in the wall dump.with a guy who did not even know how to put on a show.although even if he was not there why on Gods green earth would anyone charge that much.i paid about 60.00 for a boat that had barely no food on it.believe me this is not worth it.i don't care how good the food is.the amount of money you pay for it is not worth it.hell i could have bought two tickets to disneyland for that amount of money .
