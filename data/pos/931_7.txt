Spicey Pei Wei\nBy The Rue\n\nI had Pei Wei for lunch today,\nIt wasn't the best dish,\nNext time I think I'll say,\nI prefer somewhere with fish.\n\nI got the spicey chicken Pei Wei plate,\nWith brown rice, not white,\nAfter ordering it wasn't a long wait,\nI drank Mello Yellow not Sprite.\n\nThe menu said this dish was spicey,\nBut I had to disagree,\nI added hot mustard to entice me,\nOh such a calamity. \n\nBok chow (The End)
