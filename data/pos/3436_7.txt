I have a love-hate relationship with this place.\n\nPros: Tasty burger, pretty consistent, cheap beer, hot waitresses, close to home.\n\nCons: Loud (i.e., LOUD), and tables are too close together.\n\nMy order: turkey burger - dijon mustard, horseradish, alfalfa sprouts, mixed greens, tomatoes, pickles, relish, sauteed onions. Delicious. If you want to try new condiments, ask for them on the side.\n\nGood for groups (they'll take large reservations), but the noise makes conversation difficult. Better if you want to be rowdy and shout at the hockey game.
