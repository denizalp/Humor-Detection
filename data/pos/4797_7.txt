The room was not stocked with blankets. Called front desk and the lady would not accommodate me. She asked for me to walk across the bridge to get the blanket myself. I am a local and for the amount of money I paid for the suite you would think a blanket wouldn't be a problem. \nWill never stay here again. The hotel staff I've encountered today have been very rude.
