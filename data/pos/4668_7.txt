Seafood buffet on Fridays is pretty awesome. Less than $20\/person! \n\nLocated in DTLV. Got there a little pass 5PM and the line was already longggggggggggg -_______- we waited for about an hour. Ugh.\n\nThe food was pretty damn good. Lots of snow crab leg. Oysters were okay, not the freshest of course, but not too bad (just put lots of lemon juice on it) Clams were a bit overcooked. Dessert selection was meh. Overall, I think it's a good deal for less than $20.
