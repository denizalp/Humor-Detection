Miniskirts and objectification are never out of style in Vegas.  Hooray!\n\nOne of our cabbies mentioned something like \"Yeah.  Forget about eating on the strip anywhere other than Peppermill.  Everyone local eats there.\"\n\nIt's marginally better than the $15 slop you get in most of the dives on the strip and well worth the trip.\n\nOpen 24\/7 like everything else, so feel free to drop in shitfaced.
