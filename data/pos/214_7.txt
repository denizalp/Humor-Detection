This is the second time we've been to Gadzooks however this was the first time to this location. Like the other location, our lunch was amazing.  My wife and I both had cheese Enchiladas. She had pickeled cabbage, habanero sauce and pico de gallo on top of hers and mine was just smothered with the habanero sauce. It had quite a bit of kick and lots of flavor. If you've never been there you have too, you won't be disappointed.
