Hakuna Matata!  I can't believe that this is their last year playing in Vegas!  This is a must see experience if you have never seen The Lion King.  The best part about this show is that it overcomes the language barriers!  If you can understand visual nonverbal communication, then it is very hard to miss the narratives that are taking place here!  Beautiful performance!
