I came here on a business dinner. I ordered the seafood classico, which was quite tasty and probably worth the $33. One co-worker mentioned that the rabbit two ways wasn't as good as he expected. All in all, a good place for a business dinner or possibly a romantic dinner if you want to impress. All of the dishes will be in upwards of $30. The wine list is larger than a dictionary. Make sure you have time to spare because service is very slow.
