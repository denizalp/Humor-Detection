I have found that French toast is either very good or a big dry piece of failure.  Fortunately this place got it beyond right!  Small family owned restaurant opened up by former restaurant employees - I believe they're all immigrants so GO USA!  They're making it happen. And they're getting it right with the service and the food and the prices.  \n\nWoot!  We will return.
