As far as United clubs go this one is pretty good. I don't know that it's worth $59 (day fee) but if you are already a member, then it's a ok. The food selection is limited but they do have a pretty good selection for drinks. It's not usually too crowded so it's a nice place to get away if you have additional time waiting for your flight. The staff is very nice though. The best thing about the lounge. They really go above and beyond. The only reason I added an extra star - staff is awesome!
