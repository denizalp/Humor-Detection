Plenty of haters. I don't get it.\n\nCheap food. Cheap drinks. Daily specials. No cover charge ($5 on game nights and events). Live DJ playing sickest beats. Spacey dancefloor. Huge patio with comfy seats if you want to take a break from dancing and the loud music. Great crowd (mainly Desi). Staff are awesome especially the security guy.
