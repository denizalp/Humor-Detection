I just dropped in here to grab some wireless so I could jump online and handle a fire drill from corporate.  Got my yummy iced mocha, fired up the laptop and After The Gold Rush comes on the radio.  Haven't heard that on the radio in years.  It just lent itself to the relaxed vibe I like here and made my fire drill task so much easier to handle without stressing out.\n\nThanks Coffee Rush!
