I didn't dine in the actual seated dining area; I was looking for some sushi as a quick bite with a drink so I was seated at the bar.  The bartendar \/ server was quick, helpful on explaining the restuarant and menu, and courteous.  The sushi was excellent, and it was a great place to grab something quick to eat that was healthy.  The decor is modern and well done.  It's located back in the shopping area, so you gotta kinda look for it, but it's worth taking the time.
