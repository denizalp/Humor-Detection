I went here yesterday to purchase a bag.  After searching the internet for styles that I like, I came in armed with the names of about 10 bags.  Stacy was so awesome, she took each and every bag I wrote down for me to try on.  She knew that this was my first LV purchase and she made the \"experience\" so nice.  I wish buying something was always this pleasant.  I will be back to round off the purchase with a new wallet, with no money to put in there, since I spent it all in the store.
