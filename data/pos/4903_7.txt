I really like this place. It can get busy after people get off work, but the butchers do a good job and the fish is brought in fresh weekly. Best to buy then, of course. All the fish is domestically fished or farmed. The grocery has Asian and Latin foods and spices. There is an alcohol selection and they proudly take EBT.
