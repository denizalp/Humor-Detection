This location is the OG IKEA for me. I've been many times and quite enjoy their fish and chips plate. I like their soups and garlic bread and veggie potato pancake thing. I also love their DAIM chocolate and cake - everything is affordable. The only gross thing I've tried there is their vegetarian meatball plate. \n\nApart from that, the layout can be a little confusing at times, especially if you're trying to back-track without having to do the full loop again.\n\nThis place gets really crowded so I avoid weekends like the plague.
