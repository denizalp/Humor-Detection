Some colleagues and I stopped by here for lunch recently.  After browsing the menu, I decided on the Kobe Sliders, $10.95 that came with a side of Onion Strings.  The food came out pretty fast.  The Sliders were very good....and the Onion Strings were delish!\n\nOur server was very friendly and attentive to our table.  Our Iced Teas and Water glasses were never empty.\n\nOverall, it was a great lunch.\n\nReturn Factor - 85%
