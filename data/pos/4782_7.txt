Below average tacos at best. Each one was about $1.79. You might think that's a good price until you try them. The carne asada was bland, dry and the quality of the meat was poor. The al pastor was better, but also dry. My expectations for the pork were high when I say the meat on a spit, but it doesn't come close to al pastor at other places around town.
