It's a great show. It's simple, short, and romantic. It's what makes you realize why you came to Vegas. Vegas is a freaking cesspool. No joke, but things like this make it seem a little better. That's the Bellagio for you!\n\nThey show it almost every thirty minutes and 15 minutes later in the night. It's truly something to behold and watch with loved ones, but make sure you find a space as it gets crowed. \n\nYou will probably see it go off multiple times while walking in the strip, but enjoy it if you can.
