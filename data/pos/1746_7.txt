It was very badly smelled, staff was very rude. I have ordered food for to-go and initially I was told to wait 25 minutes and then another 10 minutes. I have waited for 45 minutes, and guess what food is still not ready. I lost my appetite and  when asked to cancel the order, to my surprise he cancelled my order and didn't refund my money. The guy goes next time when you come in just tell my name and you will be served food. I lost $25. What a rip off!!!!
