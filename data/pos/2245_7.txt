For a place with the name \"party\" in it, most of the workers are not in a party spirit. We came here to get my little one's costume and everyone was semi-helpful but lacked any social skills. We got the costume we needed and left ASAP. The store itself was stocked well and kept well. They have a plethora of party and costume goods. The prices are not crazy insane and if you get their online ad\/newsletter there are always savings to be had.
