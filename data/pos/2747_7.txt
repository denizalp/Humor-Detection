Tried Pho 602 yesterday and had a great lunch. Service was good, the staff was really nice. \nI got the chicken breast pho soup and it was really good. My husband got the number 15, he said the pork was delicious. The eggrolls were possibly one of the best I've ever had. \nThe milk tea bolba was amazing. The milk tea is a blend of green, black and red tea and is beyond tasty. Their fresh squeezed sparkling lemonade was refreshing and the perfect amount of sweet and tart. I will definitely be back!
