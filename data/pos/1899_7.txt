I am a big fan of Brio and make a visit any time I'm craving some lobster bisque. Brio has the best lobster bisque I have ever had and I am a huge fan of their bruschetta sampler. I find that it's a great place to order a bunch of appetizers and share them with the table. I rarely ever get my own meal here because the apps are just too good!
