I only came here because it's Tuesday and Nazareth is closed. It started out promising with an $11 price tag on the vegetarian platter but when we got the bill, the server charged us $11 each for the smallest portions imaginable. Also, (even ignoring the country's prestige in the matter) the coffee was the worst I've ever had. \n\nI had to award one star, but thats not the reality. No stars. I hate my life now.
