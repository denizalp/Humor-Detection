Wife bought this for my Birthday. Exactly as I expected to be . One big promotion for the company and we are just along for the ride . 5 hours of my life gone . Landing was the best part . Biggest waste of time . The ride is 20 min . Setting up balloon 1 hour , putting away the balloon 1 hour . Champagne picture to promote there company another hour . No way for Ã¼ber to pick you up . Land in the middle of nowhere. Thanks wife .
