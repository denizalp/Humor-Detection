Best cheese steaks I've ever had. \n\nThe Spaghetti and meatballs are an amazing duo as well.\n\nTry the Pizza. Its Fantastic.\n\n\"But what about Philadelphia and New York?!?!\" \nShut up, homers. Go back and sniff your own pretentious farts.\n\nFinally, the chicken parm sandwich is out of this world. An ideal situation is to bring a friend and get one whole chicken parm and one cheese steak with everything, so you can get the best of both worlds. Every time I have someone in town, I force them to go to Defalco's, and I have never seen a disappointed face.
