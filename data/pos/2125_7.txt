horrible customer service\nI ordered business cards from them and will never go back again! \nI was told I had made too many changes (which included their typo on a phone number)\npolicy is 24-48 hrs to get a proof. It has been 6 days and still no proof. \nI tried to cancel my order and they refused to refund my money.\nDon't waste your time or money here.
