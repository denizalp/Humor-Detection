Kelly is such an awesome bartender!\n\nI got an order of 44 magnum, which consists of their two strongest drinks: Cat 5 hurricane and 190 octane. And of course, an extra shot of vodka. \n\nI really like this location probably 'cause it's in the same area as Earl of Sandwich :D\n\nI just wish they'd have an extra bartender when the line gets 10 person deep. Ugh! But really, it's cheap and worth the wait ;)
