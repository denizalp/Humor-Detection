The music was so loud it made my teeth vibrate. Never ever going back. I'll be deaf for a week! Couldn't hear myself think, never mind have a conversation with anyone. Its not a night club! I don't care how good the food is or isn't - in fact it hasn't even arrived yet! We checked the decibels with an app on an iphone and it was over 90dB which is in the range of hearing damage. The staff need to be wearing hearing protection.
