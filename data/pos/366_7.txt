This is what the Akron area is known for! I was happy with my order of potato teasers and a cheeseburger but I honestly might prefer to go to Five Guys. I mean, it's cheaper and I get more food there... this place is definitely more creative though. Ohhh and I ordered a Mint Whip. Never have had something quite like that before. Frothy and carbonated... dare I say milky? It wasn't a milkshake but it wasn't a pop. Definitely worth ordering again. \n\nAs always the service was good. Don't forget: lights on for service!!!!
