Despite maybe a not-stellar season in 2009, I finally got the chance to see these guys live at Heinz against the Ravens....and they won!  So. much. team. spirit.\n\nWhat I Love, and what made a strong first impression:\n-the terrible towel...everybody's got one\n-the steel curtain\n-6 superbowl championships\n-they beat out the seahawks and I'm glad they did...even though I live in Seattle
