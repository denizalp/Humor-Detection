I have been going to this mall since it opened.  It has reinvented itself and modified its store multiple times.  It still is clean and safe.  Stores seem a bit small and cramped, but there is a good selection.  Nice food court and cinema area.  I am not a big mall fan, but this one is still successful and worth a stop.
