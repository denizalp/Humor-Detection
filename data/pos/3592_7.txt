Used Rhino Maid today. They were ok...would I use them again, NO. The women were nice enough, however one seemed to be on her cell phone a lot. There were missed areas. They were here about 2 hrs and 10 minutes...short of the $149.00 3 hr cleaning I paid for. I will try someone else.  Not impressed at all.
