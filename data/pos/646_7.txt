went here on a saturday, if your looking for a pool party similar to Rehab Sundays, GO HERE! this place was so nice and pretty! I overheard them charging 30 for girls and 40 for guys and if you were \"trying to find a place to sit\" its 50, my friend and I were lucky enough to just walk in, so I suggest you try to get on a guestlist or something..
