NO BUENO!\n\nThis is honestly the saddest Burlington I have seen in a long time.  The clothing appeared  dated and reminded me of what you would have  leftover after your garage sale, and after your neighbors picked over everything and after Goodwill said No thanks! \n\n It was really that bad and there is simply nothing more I can say so I won't.
