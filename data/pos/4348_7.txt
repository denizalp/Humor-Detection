We went to Jared! My husband purchased my engagement ring here and then we got our wedding bands here, as well.  The service has always been top-notch. I've been back for several ring cleanings and just recently had my wedding band re-sized.  Every employee that I've been in contact with has been friendly and professional.  After several visits here, I'm confident that our purchases will always be well taken care of.  If you're in the market for jewelry, definitely consider a stop here.
