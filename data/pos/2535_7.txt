This is why you're fat. \n\nYou've got huge fairgrounds and plenty of walking to do inside the fair (work those legs), plenty of sprinting to get to your car safely at night in the sketch neighborhood (increases heart rate) and plenty of laughing at those less fashionable than the rest of us (work those abs!) and the ratio of places to buy overpriced, deep-fried, tasteless food dripping with grease vs. RIDES and ATTRACTIONS, what the fair was originally developed for (not to mention the animals and 4-H projects) is about 4:1. \n\nPeople... come on, now.
