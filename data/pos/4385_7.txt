Ate with a friend at the sushi bar. \n\n...To be continued.\n\nIt's not the best Sushi in the area, but it's good for State-Road Sushi.  The owner is just as friendly as any of the good animal characters in several Disney movies.  I stuck with the usual spicy tuna, but also had some of the large rolls.  Good atmosphere for friends going out for fun or a date.  Moreover, the vestibule smells good.
