Anyone looking for a real range should look elsewhere. This is simply a tourist trap!! I went to another local range and paid $10 and they rent guns for $6. This is a rip joint where someone who doesn't know better gets screwed!! They won't let you bring in ammo that you can get at Walmart for $11. They want $30 a box!! Your gonna walk out with a $150 bill. Most other places your paying under $30 for a rental, range ammo etc.
