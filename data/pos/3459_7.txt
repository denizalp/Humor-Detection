CDC remodeled our 11 year old pool last July, mainly adding a baja step for the doggies. We were very happy with the upgraded Baja Mini Pebble surface finish and color they suggested, as well as the tile chips that really made the pool pop.  The total rehab surprisingly only took about 7 working days and the price was right.
