I much prefer this place to Whole Foods.\n\nI just fell in love with the rosemary biscuits baked by Il Fornaio.\nI'm lazy. I pop one in the micro for about 15 seconds, make a small slice, spread some butter inside, watch it melt...and MMMMM they are so delicious.\n\nI don't really like the whole special hybrid parking space idea.\nYou're not any more important than I am, I promise.
