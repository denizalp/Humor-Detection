I went in there was a few people ahead of me as other yelpers remarked there was only one person behind the counter so the line moved very slow.\nI had a acai tropical bowl.\nThe acai bowl was very good and the price was ok.\nThe service was slow but the person was very friendly and worked as fast as she could.\nDefinitely they need more staff there to help out, and move the line quicker.
