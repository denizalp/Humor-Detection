A mellow location of the beaten path so to speak at the corner of Tenaya and Azure.  Small is the location, but the brobdingnagian coffee house provides all to mentally lubricate you.  Sit inside or enjoy the weather outside. Nothing else can be said. It's Starbucks in all of it's corporate finest.
