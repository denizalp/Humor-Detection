Pros: very large, clean rooms (great for groups!) full kitchen etc.; 5-7 min walk to center of strip; affordable; non smoking; friendly staff\n\nCons: 5-7 min walk is dirty and ghetto passing speeding cars and homeless people; hotel very boring in decor and look.\n\nOverall i would only stay here again if we were traveling with a group on a budget or with a family with kids.
