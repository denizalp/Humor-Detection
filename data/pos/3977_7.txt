When I get a document notarized at the credit union for free, then take it to my office, stupidly fax it to the wrong number by not adding a \"9\" at the start only to get a call an hour later from the bank employee who notarized it telling me that the person who received it in error had called her to let her know some numbskull was faxing important-looking legal documents to him by mistake, and does it all with a maximum of cheerfulness and forbearance. . . that's service.
