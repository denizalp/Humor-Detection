Awesome spot for breakfast with all homemade goodies. Plus they have incredible lunch as well which is very underrated. Have had the breakfast fried chicken topped with a delicious sausage gravy two eggs, hash browns and toast, which was amazing. Today had the Joynt burger (sirloin and brisket mix) which is topped with a fried egg, bacon and cheese. Delicious. Check this place out. It also has a Chicago theme to it.
