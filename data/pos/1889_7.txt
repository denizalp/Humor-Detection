Beware of having automotive window tint film installed by Huff European Automotive. Upon arriving for tinting of the windows on my vehicle, it was determined that they did not have sufficient film to cover my vehicle. It was suggested that someone be sent to the local 3M warehouse to obtain additional film but the shop manager said no. This is o way to treat your customer and is certainly no way to earn repeat business.
