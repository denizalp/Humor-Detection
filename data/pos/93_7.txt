Don't snooze on their 24-hour tavern! We stopped in the other night, and I was reminded that this is a solid option for late night dines. It is smoke-free, and as usual, we received A-plus service despite a pizza crust mishap. They have several TVs that are always on sports. They have a couple of new items on the menu, and while I stuck to my trusty Pear Arugula Pizza (holy arugula!), the husband got a new item, a white tuna salad sandwich. It came on beautiful bread, and he loved it. A 24-hour winner.
