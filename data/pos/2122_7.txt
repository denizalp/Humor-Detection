I lived at Cambria for a year and had the best experience! The property is maintained extremely well and it's actually very quiet (I even lived right next to the second pool). \n\nThe staff is amazing! Kristen, the property manager is so friendly and always willing to help with any questions. Darcy, the leasing agent is incredibly nice and remembers the name of everyone who lives there. \n\nI moved out of state, otherwise I would have been renewing my lease with Cambria in a heartbeat. \n\nTrust me, you will love living here!
