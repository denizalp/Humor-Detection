So no problem paying for the better food\/ingredients\/experience but 2 large pizzas with 2 toppings $45, I just don't see it for the level of pizza it is. It's really average, right there with metro. Nothing special,  not bad, not great.  Summerlin has a lot better pizza restaurants to offer so try one of them.
