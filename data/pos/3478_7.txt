Great service from the cashier. Pleasant and professional.\n\nNot a fan, my personal opinion is that a Big Mac has more flavor than this burger.\n\nOnion rings were average don't think they are homemade. Fries standard and somewhat undercooked. The green beans were tasty and are freshly dipped in tempura batter before fried . Crispy, light and good dipped in their ranch.\n\nI'm sorry to say it was a bland burger and sides not up to par. I can say I've tried it, but won't be back.
