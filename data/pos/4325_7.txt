The 1 star is not for styling; their blowouts are wonderful and last a long time. I'm giving them 1 star because of their service. I'm natural and my hair is 4a\/3c. Every time I walked in, they acted as if they didn't want to do my hair. And they also assumed I didn't know Spanish. I understood the jokes they were making. They will NEVER get another cent from me!
