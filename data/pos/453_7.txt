After waiting an hour in a half for my order every second of that was well worth it. Although we have an Egg slut here in LA I've never really had the chance to try it. This was the best breakfast I've had in Vegas. You will definitely be full for the entire day. My boyfriend had the egg, bacon with cheese sandwich and I had the bacon sausage cheese and egg sandwich. I will for sure go to the LA location.
