Finding great deals is always a positive in my book.  All the savings helps fund our traveling.  With that being said Neiman Marcus Last Call at Las Vegas Premium Outlets North is a good place to check out.\n\nThis shop is mostly neat and organized.  Staff is polite and helpful.  Definitely, check them out.  Fair chance that you find what you like at an affordable price tag.
