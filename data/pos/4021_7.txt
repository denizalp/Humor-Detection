Worst service ever....and I travel to alot of spas!  No one seems to know what is going on....like they just opened today??  No. They did not. No service for food or drinks at spa pool; and when asked for a manager, ironically he was at lunch!!  Will not return here....and I am a local that can walk here.  Go somewhere else.
