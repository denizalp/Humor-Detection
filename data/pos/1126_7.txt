This place is overrated. I still don't know why they changed the name but what I do know is that the quality of their products changed as well and not in a good way. There needs to be a larger variety of goods. The cupcakes are smaller and cost more. Wtf?? Additionally the cupcakes were stale and dense. Dunno if they were from the day before? \n\nDisappointed with the quality of the confections. Hopefully things improve...
