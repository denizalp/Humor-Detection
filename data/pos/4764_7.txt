We buy our home Poke here weekly.  Notably the avacado poke, crab and tuna poke, the wasabi poke and the poke taco(octopus) are the ones we always get.  Everything is fresh and has that Hawaiian taste.  This is because the owners get their fish shipped overnight from Hawaii.  I know because we actually talked with the owner and cut a deal to order a number of whole fish a few times that were shipped with his stores order at an amazing price too!  It doesn't get more Authentic or fresh than that.
