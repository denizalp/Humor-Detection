We had CDC bid on redoing our pool.  Cassie was great and suggested some travertine pavers on a patio that we had not considered doing.  Their bid was better than others and it turned out beautiful!  We love the completed redesign.  All of the workers who showed up were nice and did a great job.  They cleaned up after they completed a days work and we love our pool!  The timeliness could have been a bit better as the overall job took longer than we expected.
