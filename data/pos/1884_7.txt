Booked through the site, received a confirmation, yet when we arrived at the airport there was no-one waiting. Called to ask & they said nothing was confirmed, even after I sent them the email confirmation.\n\nDon't bother to pre-book through these guys - just head out to the limo stand at the airport & they have some great rates..
