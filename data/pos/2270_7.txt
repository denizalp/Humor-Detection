Dammmmn, I'm so glad I'm in Vegas right now cause I shot off some machine guns today and tomorrow, I get to go to DJ Bibigkahan for lunch!  \n\nIt's my birthday and I'm in Vegas... now I get to have the best Filipino food at the most amazing prices ever!  This place is SO much better than the other Filipino options, I only tried the others 1 time and never went back.  It isn't a 'nice' restaurant but it's quick, cheap and DELISH!\n\nSee ya there!
