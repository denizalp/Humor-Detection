if you love dropping large amounts of cash and getting appetizer sized portions, then this is your place.  very cool artsy asian-fusion decor, the owners are very attractive and welcoming.  food tastes great and you won't be stuffed to the gills or bored with eating the same thing all night.  it reminds me of the sample carts at costco haha.\n\ngo there if you want to look cool in a stylish place ;)
