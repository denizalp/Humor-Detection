I hate going here. The lighting is terrible and the vendors try to stop you at every turn. \n\nThere's a vans shoe store here. Great deals always empty.\n\nAs seen on TV store.\n\nDiscount Hot Topic\nDidn't really seem that cheap\n\nThe kitchen itemy store is ok really cluttered. \n\nSome designers like Sean Jean \nCalvin Klein, I think I saw Armani exchange.\n\nNot that cheap though :\/ \n\nSkip this one and go downtown. \nYou'll be pleased if you do.
