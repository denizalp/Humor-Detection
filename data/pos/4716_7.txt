Poor service from the host. My husband and I wanted a nice meal but the only thing the host could say is\" we have a dress code\" too bad.... ( too bad because we have dinner attire but wanted to check the menu 1st) \n\nThe menu looked great. But 1st impressions say everything... \n\nWe drove  to the strip for dinner...
