I feel completely taken advantage of.  I was sent there to pick up some tights.  The wife called before hand to see if they were in stock. They said they were. I show up, and they aren't in stock.  I was talked into another size of tights saying they would work. They didn't work. I can not exchange nor return the tights. I knew they wouldn't work, but as an aloof father of a dancer daughter, I relied on these people to help me. They took my money and now I have tights I cannot use. Thanks for nothing.
