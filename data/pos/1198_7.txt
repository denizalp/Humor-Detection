Update. Went back here and ordered a crispy chicken sandwich. Got home and after biting into it realized it was RAW. They also messed up my other order. I called and spoke to Robert and his resolution was to remake the food.\n\nUNACCEPTABLE resolution. I paid for this food. Simply doing what you should have done to begin with is not good enough.\n\nGoing above and beyond is.
