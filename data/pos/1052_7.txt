I've quickly become hooked on this tiny sandwich shop. Maybe it's the way it makes me feel like I'm in a small town, not a strip mall in Scottsdale. Maybe it's the delicious, huge sandwiches and salads. I hope it doesn't get too popular, cuz then I won't have anywhere to sit and eat lunch! I love it.
