Cool little place, it only takes about 30 people to fill this place up, so keep that in mind if you have a group of people.  \n\nNice addition to central phoenix drinking establishments.  \n\nAlmost upscale but not quite. It's one of those trendy contemporary interiors.\n\nIt's above a Pei Wei, so that simple fact keeps it from getting the fifth star.  Sorry but true.\n\nThey give all you smokers a big \"screw you\" by making you smoke on the tiny fire escape.  Ha Ha suckers.
