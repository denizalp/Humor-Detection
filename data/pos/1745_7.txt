The Buffet at Bellagio  was good and worth the lunch price of $21.00. Most buffets offer the same types of foods and desserts with a few new ones added or just on special occasions. Most of the selections at the Bellagio Buffet are unique. The pastas, pizza, meats and desserts were very good and could not be found in any other buffets.
