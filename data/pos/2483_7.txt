I called in a cookie cake order and my instructions were...\"no words just do frosting around the rim and random squiggly lines and dots, just the basic brown and white frosting is good\"  I then had my assistant pick it up for me and I about died when I saw it! This was supposed to be a treat to a local church but needless to say the staff ate it instead, I will NEVER order from this location again!  Picture is posted...
