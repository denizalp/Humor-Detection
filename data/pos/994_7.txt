This is a pretty complete pet store. The will let you bring your pet in and give him a treat when you check out. They have trusted name brand and high quality products. When we were there the store clerk was hard to find, but we eventually found what we were looking for. The prices are what you would expect. We will continue to shop here for our pet's needs.
