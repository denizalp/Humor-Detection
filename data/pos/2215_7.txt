I don't come to this side of the shopping center much...or ever really... but one of my sister's wanted to hit up Nordstrom Rack and we made a few stops along the way. \n\nThis is a super cute store - I love shopping at resale shops and reducing the \"hey I know where you got that\" phenomenon whenever possible. Everyone but my Mom found something worthy of buying - they had some great clothes\/shoes\/bags and even better prices!
