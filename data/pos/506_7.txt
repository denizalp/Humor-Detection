I seriously want to cry right now. I told the barber I wanted a disconnected undercut and tapered the back.   What I got was 5month of my hair shaved off.  How hard is it to follow the fucking line? It's long hair seperated by short hair.  Don't tell me you were following the line, liar. I saw part of my lengthy hair on your cover sheet.\n\nI didn't even bother to inspect the back because at this point nothing really matter anymore.
