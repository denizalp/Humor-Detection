This place is simply not worth it. I came for restaurant week and was only impressed by the shrimp tacos (the fig salad was also good.) The ravioli was average and the salmon was alright, but nothing to write home about. The sorbet tasted like it had been melted and then refrozen. The cake, while good, was again nothing special. \n\nThe one saving grace was that service was phenomenal. \n\nOverall, this place is simply not worth the money. There are plenty of better options that don't have a group of loud grandmas discussing their boyfriends that went to 'nam.
