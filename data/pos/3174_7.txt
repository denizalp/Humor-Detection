Good coffee and decent ambiance. Crappy music they'd be better without.\n\nThey have a weird rule. I was enjoying my coffee and trying to write something ticky on my tablet. Closed my eyes for a moment to concentrate and when I opened them a waiter was walking toward me. He told me I was not allowed to sit with my eyes closed.\n\nFirst time for everything but this is surely a first. So intrusive.
