The customer service department at this location is horrendous!  I was treated very poorly by a disgruntled young girl named Alyssa but surprisingly worse by self identified store manager Joan. She refused to search for an out of stock product at another store.  Neither one of these people would be employed by my company if they treated a customer the way I was treated.
