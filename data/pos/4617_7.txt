So it's late and you are craving tacos and beans. You hit the drive thru, request double beans in place of rice and beans (because you love lard AND dislike Mexican rice). You pay, drive home, lay your purchase on the coffee table.  The table strains to hold all of the goodness contained in that styrofoam clamshell.  You open it up and ... find no beans and about three pounds of rice. Fail Filibertos, double rice fail.
