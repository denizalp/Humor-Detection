I think I should mention that I don't eat burgers often so I'm no expert when it comes to buns or beef patties. That being said, I sure did love my burger at L'Anecdote, it was a perfect mix of spices in meat patty and it sure looked tasty,  definitely a nice looking burger. I like the whole idea seating in the booth with a friend or your date, enjoying a sophisticated mix of ingredients in such a simple dish. My burger had blue cheese, mushrooms with a perfectly combined lamb patty. Definitely worth a try!
