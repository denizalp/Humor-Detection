Food was really good. Unfortunately I took my family and we had to sit next to a young lady and a much older gentleman who she continually \"serviced\" with her hand. Long story short, management didn't care because \"they come in all the time\". I had to explain what backpage dot com was to my teenage daughter. Restaurant is a great location to take your hooker before going to the motel across the parking lot.
