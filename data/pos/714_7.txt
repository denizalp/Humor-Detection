Great foot Massage!!\n\nI travel a lot get massage all around the US so I know a great massage when I get one and this is AS Good As It Gets.   Ben was professional and helpful without many knots in my neck and shoulder. He's foot massage is the BEST that I appreciate.  Warm stone on my feet, a soothing my feet not hard and painful like you usually get at the cheaper places, and good quality organic products used.\n\nMaster Spa delivers that experience and then some! I will request he service again and I recommend to anyone.
