This place was delicious & very reasonably priced. I got the Thai Eggplant, which had A LOT of veggies (YUM!) and my boyfriend got the avocado curry. As an appetizer, we got the Spring Rolls and the side salad it came with had the tastiest peanut sauce dressing. Must try if you're in Tempe! Only negative: they use biodegradable plates & bowls, but it goes straight into a plastic bag, which then serves ultimately no good for the environment. For those eating in, real plates and utensils ADDS to the experience.
