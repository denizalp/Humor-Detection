The place is very clean and spacious, I felt comfortable in the restaurant. Service was excellent. The portions are generous, however the the food is not flavorful. I had carne asada, rice and bears. I didn't feel like anything was seasoned, and I did not find myself wanting to take another bite which is very usual for me and Mexican food. \n\nThe place is ok if you're very hungry and you like bland food. Personally, I'd rather wait in line at Maize.
