When S. said he was a boy, first the proprietor sneered \"No you're not. That's stupid.\" and the looked at me repeatedly demanded \"what is it? what is it?\"  - meaning my child. It was a truly horrible experience which made us both cry. \n\nIt's overpriced anyhow, there are much better places where people are actually nice to children. This guy doesn't deserve anyone's business.
