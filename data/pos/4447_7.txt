I ain't much of a soda (or Pop if y'all call it that) drinker but ever once in awhile, generally when it's hotter'n hot, I get me a hankerin' fer a big 'ole drank a soda pop.\n\nThat's when you can find me sidled on up to the wall o' carbonated glory at this here Circle K. 'Round these parts a small is 32 ounces and that's just fer lily-livered city weasels.\n\nThe only other sizes are 44 ounces and 64 ounces. That's how we roll in these here dusty corners of the Valley of the Sun.
