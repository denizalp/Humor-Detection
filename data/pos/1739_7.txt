Wait, what?  Pittsburgh has a football team?\n\nI hadn't noticed.  Maybe if this whole town showed some pride for their team, perhaps by displaying the team's colors, they could come to be enthusiastic about them.\n\nJust a thought.\n\nAlso: I am entertained that I was able to check into an inanimate object.  More of a concept, really.
