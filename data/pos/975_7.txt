My family of 6 have been going here for over 10 years.  We have had minor cleanings to major dental work and have always been well taken care of.  Dr. Is professional and knowledgable.  They always explain everything and take the time to answer all our questions.  The 2 hygienist that we usually see are personable and take the time needed to make sure we get a thorough cleaning. Rarely do I ever have to wait more than 10 minutes past my appointment time.  The ladies who run the front office have always been professional and friendly.
