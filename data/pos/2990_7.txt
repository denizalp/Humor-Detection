Met a friend here for lunch recently and definitely enjoyed it. I don't eat a lot of sushi, so I'm not a good one to compare the quality of the fish or different rolls, but everything was tasty and the lunch special provided enough food for both of us at a reasonable price. If you're in the mood for sushi, this is a good, quick, place to go with fast service and good prices.
