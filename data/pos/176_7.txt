Seriously...you are out of whole wheat baguettes and then give me a bowl of chicken noodle soup with 2 noodles and all broth (really, not kidding!) ?!?! If I hadn't already been at home, I would've gone back for a refund. Maybe it's time to move on from Panera...especially in a city where there are many other choices and locally owned delis. Even at other locations, I have found Panera's quality has gone downhill while their prices have increased.
