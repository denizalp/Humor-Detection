I am eating right now at Canters Las Vegas and thoroughly enjoyed it! The knish was excellent, the latkes were delicious and the pastrami and corned beef a \"10\"! \nAs far as the $20 Sandwiches they are absolutely worth it and huge, so for all you cheap bellyachers go on back to your little hole in the wall sandwich shops and keep eating traife! \nTim our server was xlnt along with the rest of the staff. I have to say for being open only a few days the place was running great! See y'all next time!\nLee
