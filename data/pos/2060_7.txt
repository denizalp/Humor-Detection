This diner was absolutely atrocious. The service was extremely rude and when I attempted to get the waitresses attention she lashed out at me and refused to serve my fiancé and I. I will no longer be going to Steve's greenhouse Grill for breakfast which was a tradition for my fiancé and to go on Sundays because this woman was so rude and treated us this way. The food was cold on multiple occasions. Don't waste your time and money.
