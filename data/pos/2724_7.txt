Go ahead. You go there.  So mediocre. And that's being nice. \n\nI did go there and you can take my word for it: his place is as ordinary and unsatisfying as any dump suffixed: \"...berto's\", as in Rollaberto's, Filiberto's...etc.\n\nI ordered the \"Asada Fries\".  Anybody got a waaaaaaay too salty beef chunks, mixed with 7-11-style nacho cheese sauce (-and that's NOT a recommendation) for $5. Really?  Oh yeah, really.  HORRRRRRIBLE. \n\nI should add it was a big portion...but who cares?  As It was horrible quality, why would you want more of it?\n\nBad. Stay away.
