I accept the fact that the Yelp community will punish me for eating at Outback when in Vegas but - their value is just right. You can expect a decent steak without emptying your wallet - the night is young and who knows where I'll end up. \n\nOutback rarely disappoints. Have I eaten better steaks in my life? Likely (but I also spend much more on it). Would I bring a date here? Probably not. Is it good for pre-gaming with a couple of friends? Absolutely.
