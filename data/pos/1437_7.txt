Food was terrible and the waitress was annoying. She kept telling us that bruschetta was pronounced some weird way \"because he great grandfather was Italian\" she was just dumb. I spent many years in Italy and she was wrong. Also the food was either horribly prepared or it was frozen and microwaved. I'm never going back!
