Yum, yum, and yum.  After a week+ in the desert, we were in need of of some serious fancypants food and drink.  RM Seafood fit the bill quite nicely.  \n\nThe craft cocktails are a treat.  The sushi rolls are out of this world.  Don't miss the lobster mac n' cheese.  My companion very much enjoyed the oyster sampler.  \n\nMy only critique is about the hostess.  She is clearly unhappy with her job and\/or her station in life.  Smiling now and then would be a vast improvement.
