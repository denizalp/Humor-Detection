I hate fusion.\nNot that the food is bad.  it is just severely overrated and whitewashed.\nI MUST say though that they make it PRETTY unintimidating to eat asian food.  I can understand how white people like going here- it can be weird for you when you walk into a chinese restaurant, can't read the menu and get handed a fork right away.\nBut really... you can get better food elsewhere.\nBe more adventurous and try to stay away from this place.
