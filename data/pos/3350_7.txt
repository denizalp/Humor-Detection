We are attempting to buy a house in Trilogy at Vistancia.  So far, we've given Shea everything for which they've asked, including a very large deposit.  A month ago we asked via email a simple question.  After several more emails and phone calls, they have yet to answer the question.  In fact, they haven't returned calls or responded to emails at all.  We were actually told by someone from sales that our question was \"not a priority\" for them.  I guess getting our money was their priority.
