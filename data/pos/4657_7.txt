This Gap Outlet was a okay with me the service was okay and the pricing seem to be decent. They had some summer or after summer specials that looked nice and I checked out some of the pants and activewear and that was good. they won't have a whole lot of people helping or there were very helpful and the selection was a little messy in some places. Bad options inside of the mall are plenty and so I'm not sure that this is the best place to go shopping inside of the mall since there's so many options.
