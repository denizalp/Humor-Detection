Not the best but also not the worst. However, if you can make it to a better Indian restaurant, go there and not here! The only reason I would go here instead of other Indian restaurants would be its nearness to my place...and the price for the dinner buffet is pretty good as well. The service was quite good as well; they were friend and attentive.
