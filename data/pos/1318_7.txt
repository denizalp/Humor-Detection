Just Sports is a store in Scottsdale Fashion Square, and easy to spot due to the graphic entrance -- baseball bats, balls, etc.  The guys who work here were really nice and helpful. They have lots of sports gear, from t-shirts to jerseys, caps to visors, collectibles, mugs, cups, etc. \n\nThe place is covered from floor to ceiling with stuff. Obviously, you'll find a lot of Cardinals, D-backs, Suns, and Arizona State gear here, but you'll see other teams and schools here. \n\nSome of the prices are a bit steep, so just be prepared for that.
