A very cool museum in downtown Phoenix.  I was surprised and pleased to see them host an exhibit on race.  It was fairly well done and very interesting.  I was mostly surprised because in a state full of bullshit racist policies against Latinos, there was discussion of institutional racism, white privilege, and the costs of both issues on a society.\nThe other exhibits were fun, but large parts of the museum were closed for renovation, which was disappointing.  I'd be interested to see what exhibits they have next time I'm in town.
