I purchased a deal from Living Social from Mr. Hensel. When I called to schedule an appointment he was very rude. The ad on Living Social was very misleading. Turns out, I bought a deal for a one hour photo shoot that just includes head shots of one person. My bad, I should have read the fine print. However, I asked if  I could use the value of my deal towards a couples photo shoot and he refused. Not a very good business decision.
