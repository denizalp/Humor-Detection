Security is pretty strict here, even strict if you are a guest for the weekend. That being said, this place is fantastic on so many levels--- right ON the strip, luxurious living, and even has complimentary valet service for their residents. \n\nNo shortage of high-end big shots walking through this joint and their respective entourages. Makes for some interesting\/awkward elevator rides.\n\n\nADIOS!
