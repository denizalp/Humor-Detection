LOVE LOVE LOVE\n\nWhen in Vegas, get tickets to Love. It is so much fun.\n\nThe past two times I was in Vegas I went to Love. Now I have the CD playing in my car. My daughter rocks out to it in the back seat. I see her dancing and singing to the Beatles tunes and it makes me smile.\n\nThere is so much going on in the show that it can be hard to take it all in. Sit back, relax and sing. It is a good time.\n\nSplurge and go to Love. No one can get enough.
