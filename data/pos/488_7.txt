After about a month of being vegetarian, I was starting to feel sad about my lack of options at restaurants.  Enter Green.  Heaven, I can eat anything on the menu!!  An amazing feeling, I must say.\n\nI've enjoyed the crab puffs, and the Mexican themed burger as well as some of the bowls.  It is reasonably priced, has a great mission (in my opinion) and not pretentious at all.  Love it- and I think it is a great place for veggies and non-veggies alike!
