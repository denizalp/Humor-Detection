I am very impressed with how attentive and helpful the workers here are. I came to vegas after christmas but before new years and everywhere was completely busy! I was still able to receive help and they took their time accommodating my needs and concerns. \n\nI purchased oatifix and a facial moisturizer as well as several soap bombs. Everything felt fresh and amazing and there were many items that were sold out but i will check my local store in Anaheim to try them. I am definitely hooked on Lush products!
