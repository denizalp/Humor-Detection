Great option for an affordable meal on the strip. Their bread is very good and the highlight here, the meats were just average.\nService was nice, food made quickly.\nPortions aren't very big and the toppings kind of skimpy.\nPrices are decent, especially considering the area.\nNot bad, but also not something I would need to have again.
