A good friend of mine once said, \"Pssh, I never come to Pepe's Tacos when I'm sober!\"\n\nI should have listened.\n\nThis joint boasts a long wait time for simple to-go orders, bland ingredients, and sub-par salsas. Asking them to hold the sour cream is a good way to ensure you're getting sour cream. Also, be sure to count your change back because I guess math isn't an exact science in this wizard's den.
