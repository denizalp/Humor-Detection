This is one of the best shows I've seen in Vegas. The magic itself was spectacular. Mac King was very engaging and have lots of audience participation. The show was focused on magic, but he constantly did funny things to make us laugh the entire time. I had a great time and really enjoyed it. He seems like a very sincere person and really appreciated that we chose to watch his show. He even took photos with us after the show. I definitely would support him in the future.
