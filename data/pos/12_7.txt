We came here twice during our stay. \n\nWhy? Because of the beef noodle soup. Tired, hungry, slightly hungover, and wanting something to satisfy the need of something homey that American food cannot, Noodle Asia was the most appropriate dining opportunity. Plus it was just downstairs in the lobby at the Venetian.\n\nShitty service, but it didn't matter when we got our bowls. The waitress took our orders and requests, but that was it . We had to ask other waitresses.
