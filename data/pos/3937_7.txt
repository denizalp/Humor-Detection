I'll never understand why Sheetz food is so delicious. It is a gas station people - A GAS STATION. Paradoxical to the core. I can't stop eating their $4 footlongs and 2 for $0.99 hot dogs, and those touch-screen ordering machines are almost as satisfying as the food. I love you, Sheetz... but that doesn't erase the fact that I hate myself for eating at a gas station and bragging about it to my friends.
