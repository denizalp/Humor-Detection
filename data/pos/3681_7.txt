This hotel is quite elegant. Very spacious, shiny, vavoom. I enjoyed the pool, there are waves and lots of people trying to look their best. Eh, you gotta love Vegas. \n\nThe rooms are huge -- but then, it all depends on how many people you can fit in them. I went with a huge group for the weekend, and we didn't do much sleeping at the time. Still, it's worth checking out. :)
