I had a dream that I won over $200,000 on a slot machine and I took to the Silverton to try to make my dream come true. It didn't happen, if you want to know. But this place is beautifully decorated and the fishtank with the real mermaids makes me so happy in a \"Goddamn, I still wish I was Ariel 15 years after that wish was age-appropriate\" sort of way. \n\nWelp, that pretty much sums it up. I could give an explanation of why else I like this place but really, those mermaids are enough.
