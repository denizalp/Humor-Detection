I'm not a large burger fan but when I feel like a burger, in and out is the spot. So fresh tasting, not oily or full grease. The fries are even better, they aren't salty or soaked in oil.\n\nThis place is always busy, drive thru line had to be at least 10-12 cars deep. \n\nThey have tons of workers which is why I feel thier wait really isn't that long. They are all friendly too, so thats a plus especially for a fast food joint. Good service is rare.
