For a United lounge, its pretty standard and clean. It has a clear view of the strip.\n\nNo meats\/protein. Salad buffet selections, veggie soup, full bar and cookies\/brownies for a sweet treat. Selections were maintained full. Standard drinks at the bar are complimentary, but the name brand or specialty wines and cocktails are billed.\n\nCharging stations at practically every seat. Clean 3 person restroom. Friendly staff all around.\n\nIf there were mini sandwiches or slices of protein it would've added a star.
