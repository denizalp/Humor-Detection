A pretty impressive selection of gourmet cheeses and meats, as well as various pre-cooked meals and pastries. I, for one, would not know a good cheese if it were growing on me, but I am told that everything is delicious, always. Prices are surprisingly reasonable - your monocle may pop out of your eye and fall into your cocktail, you fancy-cheese-eater you.
