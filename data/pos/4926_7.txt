Went to the soft opening and had a very good time. Not your typical sandwich shop. Interesting eclectic selection of sandwiches with their own twist. Open seating and an interesting crowd. Staff was friendly and attentive and there to assist with any questions. The owner Michael was present and was very nice. Definitely will be going back.
