Stopped by to pickup some cards for Mother's Day and some other random stuff.  The selection of greeting cards was decent.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jgTjppAwWr7rpd0FCquChQ?select=znaW3t4fpo8e1vy9JwEYcA\nCandy selection is also very good too.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jgTjppAwWr7rpd0FCquChQ?select=cU6ZHp3jSbx6O00Xyud92Q\nWas able to get what I needed for Mother's Day.....score!\n\nThe other notable thing about this store is that the cashiers are very friendly.  One welcomed most of the customers by name and the other made some small talk when I was checking out.....genuinely nice people here.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
