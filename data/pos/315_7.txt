We went to the nightclub on a beautiful June evening and had a fantastic time.  What an incredible view of the strip--I could soak it in for hours.  I absolutely loved dancing (the music was awesome), people-watching (there's lots to take in) and soaking in the incredible ambience (did I mention the view?).  The service was great and I can see why this is one of Vegas' hotspots.
