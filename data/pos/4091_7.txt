What a fun little shop!\n\nMe and my 6 year old son have a ritual of hitting the comic book shop next door and then getting a root beer here.  It's our \"Happy Hour\".  I love the nostalgia of this little soda and candy shop.  Takes me back to the penny candy store we used to visit when I was a kid.a\n\nGreat selection of just about every soda you had when you were a kid in some other part of the country.
