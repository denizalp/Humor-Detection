Came highly recommended by the locals.  Nestled in old town.\n\nHighlights:\nHuge outdoor patio with dim lighting, lots of space for people to mingle.  \nComfy seating that makes you want to lounge around while chatting with friends. \nCreative cocktails like the pumpkin martini.  \nMoscow mule served proper, in a tin cup to keep it freezing cold.\n\nThey have good happy hour specials like 1\/2 price wine bottles and girls night out.\n\nWe had a good time playing drinking games and catching up. \nMaybe next time, we'll have more than just drinks.
