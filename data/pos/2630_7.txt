Bought my very first Speedy bag here. I will always have my Speedy and she will remain a timeless classic, as would any Chanel piece, etc.\n\nFelt very welcome in their store and sales associates were all very friendly and helpful.\n\nYes, I am a bit of an LV fanatical. Once you buy one, you're hooked for life. *sigh*
