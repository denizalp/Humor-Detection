Great experience. I was in and out. I walked in and told them the price I wanted to pay and they can within $150.00 of what I wanted. It was still $500.00 cheaper that Ridenow Honda. The finance guy was quick too. They did not waste my time. They got me what I wanted. I would definitely recommend coming here if you want to purchase a bike. Great salesman and great finance manager. They even delivered the bike to my house.
