Guest set after U.S. Received food before us. Guest who came in after got set first. What food we received was good. When questioned server about it. She was snarky and unhelpful. When asked to speak to manager was informed there was not one. I then spoke to the owner. He told me the server was a manager and there was not anything that could be done. I will not be returning
