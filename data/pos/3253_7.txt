Giving 1 star to leave a review is as pathetic as the money hungry CEO act. You push the minimum and how fast to play at the bar for comp drinks? How about you appreciate the fact people sit at your bar and take the lazy service applied. How rude you insist on not only a minimum, but how fast I must play it? Wow. What a way to make your employees bust their as to keep your funds secure. Screw you and the establishment  you chose to become. I miss Bills Gamblin Hall!!!!
