RUDE! I dropped off some textbooks, gave them my number, and left to run errands. I got lectured by a young girl with blonde hair and glasses that I was not ALLOWED to leave the store. Excuse me? She said I was gone for HOURS. I was gone an hour. Deal with it.  These people need to learn some customer service skills!!!!!   \n\nI actually was the manager of a book store a few years ago. I would never dream of speaking to customers that way!!!! I will not be back.
