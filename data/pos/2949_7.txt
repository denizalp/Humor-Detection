I really wish I could like this place. We went and gave it another shot last night. At the door, the guys I was with were told that next time they can't wear jeans and flip-flops because they were trying to make it more of a \"dance club.\" They then proceeded to charge us a $1 cover, which is a joke. I will admit, the drinks are cheap ($3.50 for a screwdriver) and strong and both times the bartenders I have gotten were smokin'. Besides that, this place seems to be going downhill fast.
