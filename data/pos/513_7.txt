This is a review by a vegetarian.\nThis is a review of Brunch.\n\nFinal score:\n\nScott, after a week in Utah with few vegetarian options: 1\nBellagio Breakfast Buffet: 0\n\nBoy it's tough to breakeven without going for a plate of Scottish smoked salmon but I may have eaten $16 worth of french toast, waffles, fresh fruit, fruit sauce, fruit juice chocolate croissant, yogurt, granola, and PIZZA!! there is pizza for breakfast!! (the only thing better would be if they had cold pizza as well).\n\nThe wait staff that handles drinks is attentive and seemed to remember everyone who had decaf and who had leaded.
