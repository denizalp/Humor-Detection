Went here for a week and dont like it. Its clean and staffed with friendly people but its too much for a 17 year old like me. I either see people trying extremely hard to stay fit or big muscular huge people lifting weights. \n\nIm never going back to a gym (Any gym) because of this. And + the money you pay for membership is ridiculous! All they want from you is $$$\n\nJuly 4 Update: Personal Trainer cost a lot. Not the membership.
