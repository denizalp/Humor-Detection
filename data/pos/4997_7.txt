eh - it was OK. the bed was comfy, the suite was nice & spacious.\nbut there's this crazy thing - whenever the room can't sense motion, the thermostat resets to 76 degrees. aka whenever you are sleeping. i'm with them that they should save energy wherever possible, but this is just plain DUMB.\nway overpriced, and they'll get you with fees every which way.
