Can't say its the worst place I've been to, hence the two stars however it is definately has a weird atmosphere.  Been there twice now (my husband likes it) and I found the place really old and dirty along with some of the regulars...lol.  \nThe wait staff act like they are doing you a favour by taking your order and bringing your food.\nA fight broke out last time we were there so that was enough for me, that along with the gangs of drunk old guys...yuck.
