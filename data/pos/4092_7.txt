Rude\/slow service, bland food and when I was served the wrong coffee I was publicly humiliated by the bartender\/drink maker behind the bar. How it was my fault I took a sip of a drink that was served to me is beyond my comprehension. I will never go back. I can find better places to spend my money, thank you.
