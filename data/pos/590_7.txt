Paul is a true professional (committed to his clients and the real estate business) and he knows the local market well. He was very helpful and creative is his ideas for preparing our house for sale and with helping us understand how and what we should look for in a new home. We liked that he was independent and the owner of his own business. Perhaps most important, he was a good listener and was truly interested in learning and knowing what was important to us.\" ~ Marty Moore
