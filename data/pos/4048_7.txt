Good Comfort Food\n\nI don't frequent Boston Market often but when I do the food is always good. Your greeted the moment you walk in the door.  \n\n The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and even came to check on us during our meal - like we were eating at a full-service restaurant.\n\nThe chicken and meatloaf were flavorful and the mashed potatoes reminded me of the kind we make at home.\n\nUsually a good inexpensive choice when you're hungry.
