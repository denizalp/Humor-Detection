Probably the nicest Capriotti's I have ever been to. Newly opened on Blue Diamond and has lots of patio seating. \n\nWe popped in to pick up dinner and walked out with 4 sandwiches: large Philly cheesesteak with extra peppers, Italian sub, meatball sub and a capistrami with extra hot peppers. \n\nAll delicious and made perfectly. On the wall they have a pic of meatball subs that makes your mouth water (also the reason I got a meatball sub). \n\nThank you for a nice visit, will be back again!
