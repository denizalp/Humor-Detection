People love to hate on the chains.  I remember an old school yelper used to say that a BBQ restaurant automatically sucks if all the chairs match in there.  Funny but not true.\n\nI got the facebook coupon they were offering in the beginning of July and the ribs were great.  I think a lot of people automatically prejudge because its a chain.  Everyone would be loving this if these ribs were served on a garbage can top in someone's backyard.
