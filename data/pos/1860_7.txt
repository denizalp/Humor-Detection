I was excited about the possibility of good BBQ in NoSco.  My excitement was immediately tamed.  The meat? eh, almost tasted like liquid smoke.  The sauce? watered down, the regional stuff(carolina, texas, etc.) didnt even come close.  The price? $30 for 2 sandwiches, sides, and tea?  no thank you.  wont be back.
