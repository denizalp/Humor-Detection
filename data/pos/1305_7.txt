Very \"neat\" place.  My neighbor\/friend Melissa works there ... she's a cute little neo-hippy and an obsessive organic farmer. So I assure you that the food is locally grown and organic.  \n\nShe a vegan and sometimes she has to chase chickens (that cracks me up).\n\nNothing here is deep fried or drenched in grease, so it's not really my kinda place.  Then again I'm certainly not your typical diner.  No doubt, NORMAL people would LOVE this place
