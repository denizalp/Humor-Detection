Really bland food, really overpriced.  Menu has your mouth watering, but you should eat the menu because all the preparations are dull.  No bread, edamame,  I like it but others don't.  Asked for salt and got it half way through the meal.  Fish was good quality but really for the price it ought to be.  Tempura was very oily, I have had much better in no frills ethnic places in Chicago a million times.  $220 for 2 of us, and the wine was not that pricey.  Save the money, go to Red Lobster....
