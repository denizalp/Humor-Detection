We bought a box of 20 macarons, ate some of them in the restaurant together with an eclair and flan. The place is pretty old and clean but smells like cheap cleaning material. When we got home, we tried to eat our leftover macarons but to our disappointment they all tasted \"cheap cleaning materials\". The smell of the cleaning products was in the box of macarons! We have to throw them all away coz it was so disgusting! Not recommended!
