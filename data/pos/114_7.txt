Probably the largest Asian grocery store in the area:  They have a huge supply of ramen (no, not maruchan *shakes fist*) and ingredients.  Though not as produce-centric as Far East, they have much more in terms of sauces, frozen food, and even cooking untensils.\n\nDon't miss out on grabbing some cuttle fish chips, crushed pear juice, and some frozen man doo, among the many things you can find here, but nowhere else.
