Listen a Buffet is a Buffet unless you want to go to Caesars or Wynn! I have to say I thought it was good because I am a huge fan of crablegs and back in the DMV you can't get 4 clusters for $45 so I was all in, plus once I found the hot garlic butter I was winning. I did like the Shrimp and Grits rendition and the desserts were awesome. \n\nSo grab your Total Rewards card get your discount, pull up a seat and get it how you live!
