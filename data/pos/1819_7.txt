I Got my iphone repaired at this place in Mississauga called Space Electronics They fixed it within 30 mins. Amazing service and the rest of the staff there was very professional and knowledgeable and knew what they were talking about. I have gone to other places where they didn't seem to know any answers to my questions ! if you want your phone done right and proper I recommend these guys! Great Job and thanks again guys. \nEric Peters from Brampton .
