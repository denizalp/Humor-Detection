Fresh taro smoothies? Yes, please. I am conflicted in believing it. On one hand, there were taro pieces being soaked on the counter. On the other hand, my drink still came out purple. Eh, in the end, my drink was not overly sweet and the boba was just the right amount of chewy. Another plus, their drinks are only $3.75 with tapioca.
