i just like this place. i like the feeling i have when i'm there. it's so happy and calming and sunshiney. \n\ni like the guy with the darth vader voice, i think he's the owner. but i like him. he adds a certain charm, you know? \"would you like a diet coke\" suddenly seems new and fresh when he asks you. \n\ni love our servers everytime we go in. i love their patio. i like whatever marinade they use on their chicken. \n\ni like it all. i like the prices, too. \n\nand deep fried avocado? genius. purely genius.
