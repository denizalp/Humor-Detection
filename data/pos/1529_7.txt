Staff was rude, juice is nasty and not safe to vape, prices are over priced. Wouldn't sell to me because they saw me get out of my girlfriends car and was afraid I was going to be buying for her (she's over 18). Fucking idiots with narcissistic attitudes. Won't ever ever ever return. Not even if it was the last vape shop ever. Wish I could give this shit hole a lower rating.
