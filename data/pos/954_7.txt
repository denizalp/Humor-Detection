Pretty decent alternative (for grocery and household stuff) to Superstore. Same brand stuff.. (Good ole PC) similar or better prices and definitely shorter lines ... :)\nGood customer service, fresh produce and yes they still have the 50% off veggie shelf unlike superstore, that only has 30% now. \nOnly downside (like someone else mentioned before) is slow restocking.. Often the bread section is empty. Also, the more popular items like Maggie noodles are hard to get. \nThe variety is pretty limited, its like your local grocery store, but not as niche.  \n\nOverall glad to have this store in the neighbourhood.
