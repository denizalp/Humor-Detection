I feel compelled to update again.\n\nYES, THE HAIR IS STILL COMPLETELY OBLITERATED.  Some people wonder if electrology works for permanent hair removal, and it certainly does!  I almost was tempted to post a picture of my eyebrow area, but then I felt it'd be weird to have a Yelp cover page of a random swath of hairless brow.
