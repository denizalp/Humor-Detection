I still love this place. Got a chance and was in the area the other day. Nazy did another great job and I gave her plenty to work with in my negligence. She is so friendly and actually remembered me from last time. My friend was with me but chickened out, so now she shall be known as the one with the furry brows because mine are gorgeously human again. I wish the shop was closer!
