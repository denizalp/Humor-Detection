ummm knife tears and bodily fluids on the pool table... when my group left (RIGHT after we walked in) on Friday night, there were exactly 46 cockroaches left in the bar to keep each other company... HORRIBLE would be a compliment. At least they (I mean HE) were showing Jim Rose circus tricks on the tv. somebody was puking up milk and re drinking it... I think he was on location at Rogue from the night before.
