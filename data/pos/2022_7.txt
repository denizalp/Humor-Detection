Great place for a Beer lover. Artisan beer with a great selection. I love the tasting option so I did it. I did it 4 times. It was great, some I loved, some I like less but overall I like being a \"beer swinger\" all night. The service took long because it was so busy! Will go back again with friends, met some great ppl my last visit.
