I will not shop here again.  I, too, was excited to see a Spencers closer to my home as I had shopped in Mesa previously.  Yes, they were quick to help when I walked in but service after the sale has been poor.  I was misled on when my product would come in and now have to wait several more days.  I am not a happy customer!
