This shopping plaza is decent when it's not the really busy time of the year, other than the design makes it hard to see more than a few shops at a time. It's layers and layers and between those layers, it's a very narrow driving alley with not much parking.\n\nAnd at lunch time on New Year's Eve Eve (12\/30), the place was packed, most spaces were filled and a few people were even double-parking which made it ten times worse.\n\nIf you're shopping Blakeney, bring a trunk load of patience.
