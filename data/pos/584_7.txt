The delicious corn soup, bbq tofu and other healthful items have already been praised ad nauseam and so I'm here to shout about the coconut \"cream\" cupcake.\n\nI LOVE THE COCONUT CREAM CUPCAKE.\n\nForget vegan, this is just a great treat. These are made by Sweets from the Earth and praise Jah, I had a transcendental cupcake experience. I only meant to taste a bit of the icing as I was saving it for my afternoon teatime. Suddenly the entire thing was gone in seconds. \n\nLadies and gentlemen, a magician named Nat *cue final countdown*
