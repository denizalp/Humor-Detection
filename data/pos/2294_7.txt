Oh my gosh! After an hour wait, our cookies arrived! We ordered a dozen mixed peanut butter, oatmeal and chocolate chip.  So happy to finally get them, our jaws dropped in disappointment as we opened the box!  They were raw.  First the oatmeal, then the second layer with peanut butter and lastly even the chocolate chip cookies.  We were staying in a  hotel so we had no oven to finish cooking them.  They looked like they would be good, but left us disappointed.  We had the driver return to give us our money back. Flop.
