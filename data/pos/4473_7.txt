Not worth it, very bland food, delivery people are rude, not worth your time, much better places around!\n\nThis is not a one time visit, I order here every few weeks and has downhill for a while now.  Everything gets to me hot, but that's about the extent of the taste, HOT (as in temp).  No taste, no flavor, tried different dishes, and it just continues.\n\nI'll try elsewhere and try not to go back.
