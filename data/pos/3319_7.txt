Wanted to give this place a try. Had been to all it's predecessors and wanted to get here before it closed for good! Once seated, no one came back to take drink or food order. Ever. Only people walking around were chefs (white coats?) Plus, it's an \"American\" tavern,and every worker was Asian. Not a problem. After 30 minutes of being ignored, we walked out, with staff saying thank you as we left, as if we'd been served! Horrendous. This place won't make it! Don't go! You'll be disappointed!
