I'll continue the broken record (get it?  BROKEN RECORD.  MUSIC STORE.  I suck.) and shamelessly laud this place.  Being consistently behind the times, I only found Stinkweeds last week (and that was only due to Yelp- Thanks Yelp!).  I'd been quite frustrated going into big box stores only to find copy after copy of Fergalicious, but no indie rock to speak of.  Stinkweeds is a fresh breath of musical air.  Lesser known bands, discount used copies, workers with great suggestions.  \n\nI'll drive the 30 minutes to go here.
