As a previous reviewer mentioned they look nice but the area is surrounded by trailer parks and a very loud highway and a bunch of street racers both cars & bikes this area turns into a Zoo at time with all the parties it's hard for the family to get parking one time I had my car towed and it had the sticker right on the windshield I think they are running some type of scam here glad I didn't pay my rent and just moved the fuck out of this trashy ass area
