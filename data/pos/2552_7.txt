I don't really get Farmer Boys. I've been to several locations over the years and have always been confused by the popularity of this place.\n\nFor what you get, they seem a little overpriced. If I do end up here I usually order a BLT or an omelette. \n\nService at this particular location was a little lackluster but they just recently opened so they seem like they are still working on getting everything organized. \n\nI don't see myself coming here often but it's a good option for the area.
