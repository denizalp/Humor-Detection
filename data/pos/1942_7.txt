Wow, so many memories! I lived in a town where there's a Malley's Chocolate store....with a huge carousel inside! Yup, inside! EF this! I know your tricks, Malley's! Don't hypnotize me with the giant carousel so I can spend a crap load of money on literally pounds of chocolate you know my family and I will never eat! \n\n.........fuck, too late! Damn you magical voodoo carousel of awesomeness!!!!
