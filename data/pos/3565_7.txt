The decor is charming, that's the only positive thing I can say about my experience here. \n\nThe food is grossly over priced for food that is... just plain gross. The pasta sauces were bland to say the least, and the meat and vegetables were overcooked. The staff were inattentive and to top it off, I had originally made a reservation, but when I attempted to make a change to it they wound up cancelling it altogether \"by accident\". Luckily, the restaurant was empty - this does not come as a surprise. \n\nDo not waste your time or your money.
