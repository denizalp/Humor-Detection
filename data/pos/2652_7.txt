I spent all of 5 minutes in this store.  I didn't browse and I didn't need to look around.  My wife wanted some special face cream (Tata Harper) that she had J & S order in.  I had spoken to Joel over the phone and this thing was on hold for her but I was in the hood so I told her I'd pick it up.\n\nWow this thing whatever it is was pretty expensive (over 400 bucks).  Still the place is kept quite neat and it has a nice feeling to the place.  \n\nYes, I am a great husband.
