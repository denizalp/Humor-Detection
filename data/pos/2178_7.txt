My husband and I were waiting at the bar for family to arrive who were staying here, & the bartender, Beau, was a total douche bag. He complained to another customer right in front of me about someone who just tipped him poorly. He had a cocky attitude the entire time we were there and was standing around on his phone, just a totally poor attitude. Looks like they tried to revamp an old hotel. Maybe they should revamp their staff.
