Made the drive from Raleigh with the fam, worth it all the way!\nThey have added many modern and contemporary items to their inventory.\nThe overall shopping experience was pleasant.\nEven though the weekend is heavy in foot traffic, the design helps it flow quickly and efficiently.\nEvery time we come by, the options just keep growing and impressing.\nFor the quality, price is perfect.\nIt's always a plus the different food options they have, the kids love it.\nWish they did open a location a little closer to home though..
