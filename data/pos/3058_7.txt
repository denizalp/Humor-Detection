Meh...\n\nThis place is to bars what Ke$ha is to singing. It leaves you a feeling violated and cheap.\n\nThe beers = unimaginative\nThe cocktails = revolting bar mix\nThe food = microwaved \n\nThere's no real reason to go here ... ever.\nTake 10 steps in any direction and go to any one of the other bars nearby. Hell, even sharing a bottle with a hobo would be better than this.
