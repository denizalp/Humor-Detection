I'm a huge fan of Fox Restaurants, so whenever I'm in the area for a Suns game or for business, I try to stop here for a bite or drink.  My favorite item on the menu is the Turkey Pastrami Sandwich (Coleslaw, Swiss, Pretzel Bun), $12....it is soooo good!\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-arrogant-butcher-phoenix?select=oALX-Epc5ncGx6Aa93_DfQ#oALX-Epc5ncGx6Aa93_DfQ\n\nThe atmosphere is very casual and fun.  It's across the street from US Airways Arena, so it will be extremely busy on nights when the Suns play.  Awesome place to meetup for a pre-game drink though.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%
