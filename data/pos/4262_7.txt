Good selection of DVD's, arcade, theatre and private viewing booths.\nLots of magazines, pretty good selection of toys and lubes.\nThe arcade can be a bit cruisy but manageable.\nLate night's are pretty bad though. They seem to be having trouble controlling the homeless, druggies and hookers.\nDay time to evening are okay.
