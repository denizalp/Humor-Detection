I still love this place, but the hours aren't great on the weekend. \n\nAlso, the music they play in the main weight room sounds like the Disney Channel and Taylor Swift had an illegitimate child after many nights of sordid rendezvous. \n\nI don't wanna listen to that shit while I'm lifting; I wanna get pumped up!\n\nThey could take a hint from 24 Hour Fitness (which usually plays some pretty bad-ass house music)... or even the music their own group exercise classes play upstairs.
