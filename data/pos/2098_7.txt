Terrible. Quoted me $1000+ for a job I eventually got done with another company for $200. Everything is working great now! \n\nI was told by the company I eventually hired that their technicians are commissioned, which would explain their sleaziness.\n\nToo bad for Penguin. I own multiple rental properties in Arizona, and am always in need of good service people....
