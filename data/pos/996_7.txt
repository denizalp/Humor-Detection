Ten years ago, this was the place everyone went in uptown to buy cheap cigarettes. How crazy is that to think about now?\n\nThis CVS shares a small parking lot with Dunkin Donuts, so be warned that there might not be a spot. If you just need to pick up a prescription, there is a drive thru. Other than that, it's a CVS. You know what you're getting here. This location does have a photo center.\n\nNote: if you pull out of the lot to get on 6th, it is a one way street and you must turn right.
