Worst place ever. Homeless live behind the dumpsters. I had an ant problem and several leaks; one case my whole apartment flooded when I was washing my clothes and I woke up to the washer overflowing. I was kicked out of my apartment for 4 days, it was that bad.  Cheap inside and out. Look elsewhere. Only good thing about this place is they give away free rattler tickets. \n\nI feel sorry for the next person who moves Into my old apartment, nothing but trouble. \n\nKEEP LOOKING.
