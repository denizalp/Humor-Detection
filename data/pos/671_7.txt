Beach pool party for the win during the summer days!\n\nYou can't go wrong with their pool area here!  It is nice and spacious with plenty of people to make it super fun!  They have a good dance section on the ground floor and Lil Jon was DJ-ing that day!  It was great!\n\nThere is a podium located in the middle, where you can dance, get cray cray and let loose!\n\nEncore, encore, I want me some more!\n\n500th review!
