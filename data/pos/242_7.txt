We all decided to go here for lunch the food wasn't that great for the price. The spaghetti just tasted like tomato sauce very plain like cafe food. I like Italian salad just not this salad the way they made it I didn't like it. I only liked the tomato bisque soup that tasted the best. Maybe order other pasta is a good idea if you dine here. The Shirley Temple had a lot of cherry flavor in it and was good just I prefer a little less cherry flavor.
