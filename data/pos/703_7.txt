Everything about this place was great!!\n\nMade a reservation through yelp (via opentable) and they had a seat saved for me....the place was pretty empty but they sat me near the front...not the most intimate table in the house but whatever..... did many of the recommendations from the server - who was on point about every dish.  They had a special there - Collar of a yellow-tail...which the server described as buttery air...and that was exactly how it tasted...perfection.  Drinks were good and ambiance was nice.  I wish I could have one starred my date...she was horrible
