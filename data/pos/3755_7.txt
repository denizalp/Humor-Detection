This place is dangerous. Seriously dangerous. You can't just have one shortbread cookie. You need a sleeve of 6. A mix of chocolate, mint chocolate, espresso, crunchy, and traditional. They're obnoxiously delicious. Every time I go in, they give me a free one \"for the road\" and oh man...I could just move in. The smell is divine. \n\nThe downfall? They're too close to me. They are way too close to me. This is bad for my waistline and my wallet. ;)
