Based on the size of this place I can see why Betty would be sweaty when this place is packed.  There's a front area which looks like a traditional bar, a rear area that's more of a lounging place packed with furniture that looks like it was picked up off the side of the road, and a patio that is partially covered by foliage.  \n\nEnjoy the pints at $1 off before 7:00 and don't forget to check out CD #48 on the jukebox, The Cure's Greatest Hits, I'm sure you'll love it.
