It's a shame I don't even know the name of the Dr. Who took care of us but he is a pro! I thought gingivectomy was supposed to be painful but no! He numbed 1\/2 of my mouth in less than a minute. I've received local anesthesia from several dentists before, but no one was never this good. The procedure was smooth and quick. I usually fear to go back to the dentist but I can't wait for my next appointment. On the other note, they are running 1800\/implant which I think is reasonable.
