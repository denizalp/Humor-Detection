I rent from these guys every month and have never had a problem. This last time they refused me because my insurance card showed a Nevada address, but my license is from California. So he assumes I am lying about being out of state and won't let me rent the car unless he rents it to me as a local renter, which has limited miles. I ask him why I have never had a problem renting before and he says they cracked down and are more strict. Well, you lost a customer. They get 1 star for low prices.
