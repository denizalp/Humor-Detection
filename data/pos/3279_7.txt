This is the first time I came to this store. I had a coupon for a buy one get one free Blizzard good only at this store. This is your average DQ. it is clean and the service is good. The server we had was polite and quite perky. It's nice to see someone who enjoys their job. The blizzards were out to us quickly and were perfect. No problem returning for another one someday.
