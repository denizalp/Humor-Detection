I still love Dr Jianu, but someone in her office has issues. Every fax she sends doesn't make it, forgotten messages, I've ended up in Urgent Care TWICE because she forgot to pass on info!\n I've been patient, but I really think I have to look for a new Dr, this is crazy.\n An appointment that shod have been a quick in and out took over 2 hours today because they didn't gave the info she said she had sent.\n Bummer. I really loved this Dr.
