Should have read the reviews before I booked. I had an appointment and when they were 30 mins late I called. I was advised my appointment was cancelled because they had been unable to get ahold of me to confirm. \n\nThey had called once, two days prior and didn't leave a message so I didn't think much of it. When I told her I had only received one phone call and no message was left she ignored me and asked if I wanted to reschedule :s
