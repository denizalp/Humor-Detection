Jr's has very recently been rechristened as Egghead's Saloon complete with a swanky new neon sign. Let's hope this guy doesn't show up to make trouble...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.marvunapp.com\/Appendix4\/eggheadstarr.htm\n\nBefore becoming Jr's somewhere in the low 90's, this bar was known for many, many years as Denmark's.
