Whoever said bigger is better clearly has not been to this Forever 21.\n\nThis place is too damn ginormous for its own good.\n\nTWO stories of endless shirts, pants, dresses, you name it. By the time you're done with the first floor, you don't even want to go upstairs to the sale section!\n\nIf you decide to come here; equip yourself with the following: moral support, caffeine, money, a goal to get in and get out. If not, don't bother or you'll walk out with nothing but a bad overwhelming headache.
