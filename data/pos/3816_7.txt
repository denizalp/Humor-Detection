MMMMMM SHORTBREAD!\n\nWhat more is there to say? (:\n\nMary MacLeod's Shortbread is a very cute little shop that offers delicious little treats!\n\nI love the mini chocolate crunch! Just thinking about them while yelping about them really makes me wish I had some sitting beside me right now!\n\nThey come in a cute little package, that makes you feel guilty when you open them because it feels like you destroyed the perfect piece of perfection. \n\nThe only downfall for me is the location and they are pricey too. I will pay the price to treat myself to these babies though! \n\n.
