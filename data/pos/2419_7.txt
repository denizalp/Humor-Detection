If I could give zero stars, I would. The room was dirty, hair on the floor and smelled of cigarettes. We had a $40 \"deal\" and asked for connected rooms for our 84 year old mom so agreed to $15 extra per room. They \"upgraded\" us but neglected to say that would be $45 more per room. Unbelievable.  When my husband called, the billing department was extremely rude. Will NEVER book a room again without checking Yelp reviews first.
