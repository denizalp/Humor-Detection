My dad likes them, so I do too.  I recently got some work done and they seemed honest and fair in their pricing.  They did however leave an air bubble in one of the lines going to my heater.  That is no fun for the winter.  My dad brought it back up to them (as I fear mechanics) and they fixed it immediately free of charge.  Good customer service there.
