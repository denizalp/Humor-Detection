Just grabbed some take-out for my company...\n\nBrought it all the way back.... Only to find out there are no chopsticks no spoons no forks but yet they remembered to put the spare chilli oil & green chilli sauce containers\n\nP.S our company is not near any restaurants so its not like we can just go ask our neighbors... we ended up wasting a lot of time driving around trying to look for plastic or even metal spoons
