We came here for the Brunch buffet and you get the best of both worlds, breakfast items like hot oatmeal, scrambled eggs, omelettes made to order, different breads to toast, bacon, hash browns, corned beef hash and an array of lunch entrees, broccolini, salads, fresh fruit, croissants, ice cream, sushi, and beverages like coffee and tea and juice are self serve.  Brunch is a bit on the high side and is a-ok for a meal.
