Pizza was OK; ordered two slices and the pesto with cheese was very dry.\n\nOne thing that ticks me off is the fact that I simply do not understand the 1.00$ additional \"non-tax\" item that is also taxed in the transaction. If you advertise your slices at 3.26$ +tx why add this fee without advising your clientele?! The issue here is not the dollar value but rather, the principle behind this scheme that is completely dishonest in my opinion. Considering that I tipped the cashier and took it to go, I am a little disappointed. \n\nPlease explain...
