The repairs Rich did on his last visit didn't repair the original issue. Which he told me which again was very honest. Another service call was made & quoted. He showed up on time was very professional, clean & communicative again. He even went above & beyond & didn't do any additional unnecessary repairs. Instead he put some serious elbow grease in & got the job done for almost 1\/2. Now the repair is complete & the first visit fixed issues I didn't even know I had. I'd recommend Rich. He's a great & honest plumber.
