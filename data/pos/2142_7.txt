Holy junk! I am a fan of this place. On our second trip here I tried to branch out and order some different things. We got the TMI toast (yum... and almost too much food for a starter), the mac and cheese (praise Jebus) and the BLT (you can't find that thick cut bacon anywhere.... yes.... that's what she said). \n\nService was great and we had a great bottle of red (Paso Robles something). \n\nWe'll be back fo sho.
