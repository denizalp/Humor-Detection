Teeny Farmer's Market, but nonetheless, very friendly vendors and an opportunity to take the kiddos SOMEWHERE!  On Wednesday's you can find this market at Angel Park and its nice because you can stop by after school since its open in the afternoons I think like 1-5 or 6 pm.  Great to stop by for a hotdog, some fabulous kettle corn,homemade breads and produce.  The best part is the kids can run around the park and play on in the playground just adjacent to the market. Check it out!
