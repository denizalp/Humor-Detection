We came here July 4th after we found out Firefly had closed due to some electrical problems.  The place was pretty dead.  Staff was funny in a weird way.  They would all say \"You should just get the grill.  Its what we're famous for.\"  We must've heard that from 5 different staff people b4 we ordered.  Funny as it was..I was the only one to go for the grill...cuz that was what they're famous for!  Nothing was very memorable about the place.  It was just ok.  I don't plan on going back.
