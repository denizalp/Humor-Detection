One of my favorite first-class hotels in Las Vegas!\n\nGORGEOUS Italian art, sky ceilings and ambiance, exceptionally spacious luxury suites with a designated living room and bedroom area, indoor hot tub and awesome views.\nWalking through the hotel and casino itself you feel like you are walking in Europe. There are plenty of fine dining and shopping options here.\n\nLOVE LAS VEGAS! LOVE THE VENETIAN!
