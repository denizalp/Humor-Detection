With the mystery user Paul having deleted his \"review\" ... and with a return visit I'm adding a star to my previous review.\n\nThe coffee is still nothing to crow about (try Conspire for the best coffee in town IMHO) but my sandwich was pretty good (but over priced). \n\nI just SOOOO want to love this place it almost hurts.\n\nWell the interior is stunningly beautiful and it's much improved from what was in the venue before (the dirty hippy coffee shop).
