Lots & lots of shops & restaurants + a movie theatre. The parking situation is horrible though. However, when you do luck up on a spot, you're able to walk the entire area without feeling super winded. \n\nThere are lots of options from super high end to budget friendly. Popular spot for families, but also for teenagers - which may or may not be super annoying.
