This SB is located in the Golden Nugget downtown Las Vegas it's very small just like your typical stand in a Casino to get a quick drink. So happy that now you can use your SB card before you couldn't use it. They don't have the phone scanner don't know when that will happen. But I forgot the Golden Nugget has 2 SB the other one is located in the newer redone section. I'm just glad now they accept the SB cards.
