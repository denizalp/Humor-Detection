02.07.10\n\nI'm not going to lie, extra star cuz I like saying the name.  Chino Bandido!  Say it with me now.  Chino Bandido.\n\nThis is a great place for first timers.  They treat you to an array of samples and then hold your hand the rest of the way through your order.\n\nWe finally decided to split a combo with jerk chicken fried rice, jerk chicken quesadilla and a milder version (#6) [http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A?select=CYvTr9FyNWmnyn4Fqud0QA].\n\nSutter Home wine for $3 to go with your meal.\n\nThe jerk chicken fried rice haunts my dreams.\n\nSeriously, who would have thought to put Chinese food in a quesadilla?
