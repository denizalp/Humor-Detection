Well dang. I gave this business a 4 star review originally (4 stars is pretty darn awesome) but when the owner Averie read my review and the feedback about the cookie inconsistency, she reached out to me personally to apologize! Apologize for a 4 star rating?! That's some damn good customer service if I've ever seen it. Changing my review to 5 stars because cookies delivered at 12am + a solid business owner who cares about her customers = 5 freaking stars any day of the week.
