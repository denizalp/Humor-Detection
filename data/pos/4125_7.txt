Spinettis has supplanted the gaming supply store that was where I visited for years!  Spinettis has the same used decks from your favorite casinos in town, as well as some other cool memorabilia from the same casinos!  I've picked up some really cool retired chips here from imploded casinos, as well as old room keys from historical hotels in town!  I even found a \"Pit Boss\" name tag from a retired worker from Circus Circus.  There's some really cool items here for those nostalgic Vegas purists such as myself!
