This is, consistantly, one of the slowest fast-food restaurants I've ever been to.  Every time I go they take forever.  I love Taco Bell.  This restaurant happens to be a Taco Bell-KFC combo store.  I have to admit that the food seems to up to par most of the time.  However, this is a restaurant that is a part of the FAST-FOOD industry and no part of the process of eating here is FAST.
