I had the #3 Steak Kebab sans lettuce for $9.13. They gave me a drink and a few fries along with the kebab in the pita. They pile in a massive amount  of the steak cubes garnished with onions, tomatoes and this sauce. I didn't really care for the sauce and will have to try this without the sauce. This is a comfortable place indoors with nice wooden tables and chairs. There is limited outdoor seating.
