Went here to meet up with one of my dearest friends. Decided to split Salmon Kabob (half rice & half salad) and an order of freshly made baklava. Baklava was good but too sweet for my personal taste. The Salmon Kabob was good, needed a bit of salt. Available sumac powder remedied the much needed salt. Will be back to try their lamb dish next time.
