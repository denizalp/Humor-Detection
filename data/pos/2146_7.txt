Same as the other reviewers: literally the worst service I've ever experienced, anywhere. Note to owner who screamed at me for absolutely no reason: If you're going to mix racks of 'high quality' gowns with racks of overpriced, torn and dirty 'regular vintage', don't blame the customers for simply wanting to look at your merchandise. If you're worried about things falling off of hangers, either move all your special clothes to a separate area, install a sign saying do not touch, or, oh, i dunno, maybe just invest in some proper hangers? WORST STORE EVER. DON'T GO THERE.
