I went to the one on Warm Springs and Durango.  There are so many Sushi Bars in town they are all beginning to be the same to me.  \n\nIs the fish fresh? Yes. Is the service good? Yes.  Typical Japanese greeting when you walk in and cute over-eager Japanese waitress to serve you? Yes.\n\nIt's right across the street from my apt. and they have late hours so that's a plus. Now they just need to do something about that rap music...it was a little distracting to listen to Chingy while trying to enjoy my sushi.
