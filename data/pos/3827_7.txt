This furniture consignment store is a mix of consigned and new furniture. The staff is very helpful. I was looking for some side tables of a specific size and with drawers to put a few odds and ends in. They helped me measure the end tables and find what I needed. \nThe store is located behind the Walgreens on the SW corner of Southern and McClintock. Parking is plentiful and close to the door. Prices are very competitive. The consigned furniture is in very good shape. I would personally consider consigning furniture here.
