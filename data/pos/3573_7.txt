Worst service.\nThe lady likes to teach nonsense to her customers.\nPlease don't even try to call them to reschedule the appointment because they will just cancel it without confirming. Then she will teach you that reschedule means cancelation in her store. Boo~~\nNot professional at all!!  I rather go to Petsmart!!!
