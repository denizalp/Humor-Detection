This place is everything but deserving of it's name:\n\nmetro(politan)- densely populated around an urban core\ncenter- something of major concern\nmall- a series of shops or retail businesses linked together in one connected building\n\nMetrocenter Mall is anything but, it is 50% empty and consists of closed down or unrented store fronts. The existing store fronts are small unknown named shops selling wholesale type clothing and a handful of stores anchoring this mall like; Sears, Macy's and Bath & Body Works.\n\nOther than the lack of shops, the people, just pass on this mall- don't worry you're not missing anything!
