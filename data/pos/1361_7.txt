This is just for the casino.\n\nThe Quad has improved quite a bit with their very open environment and friendly dealers.  The dealertainers are still around and the place just looks a lot cleaner.\n\nYou can find machine roulette tables from $3 minimum ( they let you bet $0.50 on black\/red, etc), just the total needs to add up to $3.\n\nYou can still find blackjack and craps for $5 (as long as it's not crowded).
