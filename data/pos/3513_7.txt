Not a fan.  The Scotsman and I stopped in here for a late lunch one afternoon that we were in Vegas. We got their special which was 2 slices and a drink.. \n\nSadly those two slices were dripping grease and virtually tasteless.  \n\nThe seating is compact, as in, not enough for the amount of folks that show up to eat here, even with the outter court offered, it is quite often overflowing.  I would not eat here again.
