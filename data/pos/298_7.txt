I'm not a local, which means I don't really understand the appeal of the Harmony. \n\nHot chips and dip? I'll eat 'em, but they're not the stuff dreams are made of. \n\nOld-school cafeteria-style tables? Dim lighting, rickety tables and chairs? Kids (like, aged 6 and under) running wild and telling my group of adults to stop swearing? Guess I'm just a snob. \n\nOn the plus side, gin & tonics were $3 each on a Friday night.
