I come to this Fry's about once or twice every month.\n\nI love that they have drop off childcare for while you shop.  That makes \"boring\" grocery trips more tolerable for my kiddo.  \n\nI am always pleasantly surprised by the level of customer service the employees here provide.  Everyone seems so chipper and friendly.  \n\nI am glad it is tucked away and not too busy here! \n\nIf you live in the Ahwatukee Foothills, you should shop here!
