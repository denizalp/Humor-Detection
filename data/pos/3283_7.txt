Imagine if you took all the best Chinese chefs from all your favorite holes in the wall and put them into one restaurant. You've got Red 8. This is Panda Express on steroids, and it is noticeably better.\n\nDown the hall, at Wing Lei, they have a much more pretentious Chinese dining experience that will cost you four-fold. If your taste buds know and enjoy the taste of money, then feel free to take your champagne glass and handerkchief-in-pocket down the hall.\n\nBut if you want some food that tastes better, plain and simple, then stop by Red 8.
