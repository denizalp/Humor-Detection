This is thee spot for matcha soft serve in Vegas!\nI've tried the matcha soft serve on their home-made waffle cone, the Maiko parfait with the green tea and vanilla swirl, the shaved ice, and the matcha kokuko gelatin float, and all were fantastic! \nThe matcha soft serve is rich and flavorful and not too sweet. I also love how smooth its texture is. \nI'm literally addicted to this place. I've been here five times in the last ten days. Take my money!
