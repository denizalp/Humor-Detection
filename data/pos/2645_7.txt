I had the ooey gooey cupcake, very very impressed. For one the ingredients in this are all natural which is hard to find. The cake was super moist the frosting was very good. The only thing I would change is maybe add a tad less sugar and a tad more butter to the frosting. But seriously it was the 2nd best cupcake I ve ever had. (that says alot)
