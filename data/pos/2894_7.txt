Went here with my girl last night . Although I'm use to security at many other places , wasn't prepared to be stopped at door here and asked to remove ID from wallet and submit for inspection then given the once over by \"security\" . If your looking for your first DWI here's the place to be as Chandler P.D. circled the premises not once , twice but 3 X in the 25 mins we were there . Never again ! Adios  Dos Gringos ! \nOnly rate one star ....Because I have to .
