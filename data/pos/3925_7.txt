I haven't given out very many one stars, but this place is a HORRIBLE excuse for sushi or japanese. You should be able to tell by the plethora of NON-asian people that run this place.\n\nDon't get anything raw - it tastes like crap. The cooked shrimp is too chewy. The pieces of fried tempura are like stale bits of bread crumbs. When I eat this, I feel like i'm biting into one of those cute erasers that look like sushi but is actually rubber.\n\nEven the RICE on these things is horrid. Avoid sushi shop!!!!!
