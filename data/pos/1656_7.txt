Public School 702 is located in downtown Summerlin. The restaurant is huge. The ambience had school related stuff from books around the restaurant and their menus resembled composition books.  We ordered the calamari and macaroni and cheese for appetizers. The calamari was pretty good but not life changing but the Mac and cheese was worth remembering! It had chips on top as a garnish. I found that interesting. We also ordered tacos, a breakfast burrito and an egg hash. \nEverything had great flavor. Their presentation was really nice!
