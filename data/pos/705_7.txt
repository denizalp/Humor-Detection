Brewery Pub! I was so excited to have some beers at Butcher & The Brewer.\n\nWalked in and the hostess advice me that all their terminals are down and they not sure when it would be back up running. I just want some beers and can pay cash for them. But apparently they cannot take even drink orders when the terminals are not working.\n\nShe suggested I come back tomorrow... and it was just 6 pm in the evening?!
