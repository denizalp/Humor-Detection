The chocoholic in me was on vacation and I was paying my friend Yogurtland a visit. I am a fan of the tart flavors so I decided to go that route and then I spotted the Macai flavor. Apparently it's an antioxidant out of the jungles of Chile? Who knew...but for me it was the combination of blackberry, raspberry and pomegranate that won my heart. I don't know what it is, but there is something addicting about the tart flavors so now I want to go back and get this flavor again before it goes away!
