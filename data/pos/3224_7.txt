Virtual Reality\n\n     My daughter and her friend did the virtual reality twice, they enjoyed it so much.  I also enjoyed watching on the computer and hearing them scream when the robots got too close.  Cost is $50 per person and could last up to 30 minutes.  The game only has a few levels, so when you killed off everything, you are done, regardless of the time spent.\n     Lastly, after getting home, I asked what they liked best on their trip.  Both said this.
