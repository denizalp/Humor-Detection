This place has the best Middle Eastern food I had while I lived in Cleveland.  That's not necessarily saying much, although I wouldn't be afraid to pit food from Nate's against food from any Middle Eastern place in the US.  The hummus is especially good.\n\nIf you don't like smoking, do yourself a favor and order takeout.  I probably took six minutes off my life by actually eating at this place four times.  (Secondhand smoke kills.)
