Q: \"Why do women buy so much make-up and perfume?\" \nA: \"Because they're ugly and they smell bad.\"\n\nJoke never gets old. \n\nI love Ulta, and this is my favorite location. I love that I can get my favorite high-end brands (they finally had UD Naked 3 in stock today!) and drugstore staples (huge selection of Rimmel products) in one place. Staff is super friendly and helpful, and they all have great eyebrows.\n\nI still prefer Sephora's loyalty program to Ulta's, but it's cool that Ulta accepts coupons.
