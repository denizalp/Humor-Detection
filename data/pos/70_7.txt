Average cleanliness; messy, somewhat new facilities; mani\/pedi is $35. The men here are great- one of the best pedis I've received in Vegas. Best paint jobs, no heal shaving unless you ask, they go to fucking town with that cuticle cutter like you wouldn't believe. My only complaint is that they always take a little bit longer than other places.
