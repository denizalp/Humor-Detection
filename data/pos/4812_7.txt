This is a default corporate watering hole for the nearby offices. I struggle to imagine this place like something I could call \"my place\", or where I would like to invite friends, etc.\n\nEssentially a faceless, tasteless, dark bar. There is a pool table there, oh yes, fun!\n\nNo value in ordering food, and the drinks selection is next to nonexistent. You can get Sapporo, or Keith's, or Stella, or Sapporo, or Keith's, or...\n\n\"See you at Charlotte's after the meeting, let's chat about that!\"
