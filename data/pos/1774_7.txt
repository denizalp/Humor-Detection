I'm not sure what people are thinking when they say this place is good and deserves 5 stars, but AVOID IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.\n\nThe fried rice was greasy and had no vegetables or egg in it to start.  We ordered sweet & sour chicken.  It also came with no vegetables and the sauce was clearly watered down because it was so runny.\n\nThe egg rolls were not very good and the lo mein was off in terms of flavor and odor.  Overall, we spent $34 and it wasn't worth $4.  Never again.
