My friend and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner here. The service was excellent. The wine list is pretty good. The menu has numerous choices from salads to We both had pasta dishes that were delicious and perfectly prepared. I also loved the homemade truffle potato chips with blue cheese sauce. They're so delicious! Whether for a snack or a full meal, this restaurant in the MGM is a good choice.
