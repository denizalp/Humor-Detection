Recent visit for Taco Monday's where a selection of the tacos are offered at a discount from the standard menu pricing.   I had the skirt steak and pork taco which were both excellent and filling, these aren't the street size snack tacos, those two were enough to qualify as a light dinner, add a side of rice or an app\/salad and you have a full meal.
