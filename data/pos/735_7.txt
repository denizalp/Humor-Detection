Signature Consultants is a useless recruiting agency. So far I have been contacted by 3 people. They sent me an e-mail with no information whatsoever about a job that they have expecting me to call them. Why should I waste my time if I don't even know what it's about? Where is the job? What is the job? Where is the description? I have no intention to reply to them anymore because, even if I do, they do not reply back. There goes my 1 star review for a 100% useless employment agency.
