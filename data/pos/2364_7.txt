The worst hotel you can stay in. As soon as you enter the property. Ghetto all around. As soon as you walk, the smell weed hits your face. The staff is iffy and unprofessional (saying our room number out loud) The halls reeked with the smell of weed and floors covered in trash. Got into the room to find french fries on the side of the bed, stains ON the bed, hairs on the couch, and unpleasant smells. The environment is unsafe. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.
