Usually I prefer to visit most of spots without any guides or tours or something like that. But I was really interested in the history of that huuuuge Dam! It is amazing! Just try to remember in how many films did you see this unbelievable construction? So I liked this tour. I didn't like only that I have to pay for it :) and also there are too many people sometimes.\nMouse will definitely go to this Hoover Dam one more time ;)
