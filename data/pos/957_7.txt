I cannot speak to their repair work. Their est on a $1200 lens was $500. They suggested I send it to the manufacturer and I did. Amazing that it turned out to be a free, under warranty repair.  I could never trust CRIS to provide an honest quote ever again. I'd always feel as though I over paid. Beware.
