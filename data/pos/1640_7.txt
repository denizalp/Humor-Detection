This place seems to be a really well kept secret.  I've driven past it a ton of times and never really noticed it.  Well I finally stopped in and I have to say that it is a really nice place, although it's kind of small.  The staff is super friendly and the service is really good for only having two people to run both the grocery store and restaurant.  The food is great and you can't beat the price.  I loved the lamb and rice, it was just so tender and perfect.
