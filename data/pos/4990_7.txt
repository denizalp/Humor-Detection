Authentic Taiwanese snow ice I finally found a place!!!! $6.99 for any of the snow ice and they have a variety of flavorus like taro, green tea, mango and more....the snow ice also come with individual toppings depending on which one you ordered\nLoved the green tea, 1 filled both of us and we barely finished, perfect for a hot summer day\nWe also got milk tea with pudding which was mehhhh, nothing special\n\nGotta come back to try out the other flavors of snow ice
