Got sick from the food, as did my family. General Tso's Chicken was disgusting and didn't look cooked, also had horrible texture.\n\nThe rice was mushy and tasted bland. Ordered steamed rice and fried rice.\n\nDelivery itself took over an hour to come. If you're looking for a date with your face in a toilet bowl all night, Asian Garden is your place.
