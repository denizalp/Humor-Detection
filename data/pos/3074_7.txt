If u r spice lover then stay away from this restaurant. \nFood was pretty stale.\nAs far as deserts are concerned, i tried \"Rasgulla\", not sure why they made it so hard... worst part was after i paid the bill and was coming out, i saw the server ( waiter ) picking up glasses with all the fingers inside it.
