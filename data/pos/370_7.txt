Fantastic service! I am so happy places like this one still exists, and it's great to support small businesses. Took my vaccum in for a quick repair, and it was well done, fast and affordable at $50. Great service from Ian and excellent all around-experience. I was tempted to just throw the thing away and get a new one for $100 or so, but it would end up in a landfill. This way, my old vacuum will last a few more years and I've supported a small business. Thanks for the great service!
