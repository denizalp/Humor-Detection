Ok, so I finally found this place!  Tucked away in a little strip mall across from some car dealerships, its a great little find.  I noticed that they have great hours here, open early and late at night as well.\n\nThe seating here is great.  Could accomidate a group as long as its not super busy, and they seem to have a decent menu of sorts.  I really like this place, and the guy at the counter who helped me was nice and funny.  Worth a stop to grab some coffee, read the paper, or surf the internet.
