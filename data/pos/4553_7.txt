I rather not eat here again..i pre paid and pre tipped and only asked for chopsticks,spicy sauce,and No Onions or garlic.which I didn't get any request satisfied...onions,no utensils at all,forget chopsticks,not even a fork,no sauce. \n\nThe food didn't make up for that either. It wasn't puke pie,but it was too salty,watery,and should be called and complained,but whatever man...you win,you lose.
