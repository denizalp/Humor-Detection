The buffet at TI is ok. My favorite part of the buffet was the cotton candy they make fresh for desert. I like how they have the build your own salad bar and an alcohol bar inside. Food kind of looked like it was sitting out for awhile as we were there at 2pm and not very many people were in there. For the price, I would say spend the extra money and go to the Wynn Buffet. It is more expensive but they have so many more options.
