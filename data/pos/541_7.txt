OMG this hotel is horrible, it's under construction and personally I think you should finish the hotel prior to opening. The hotel looks like its going to fall apart at any moment. The casino was a joke, there was still table that weren't even in use under plastic in a corner, the slots were scattered around to take up space in the \"casino\" the check in counters were in this small hallway. \n\nIt's was just bad all around.
