Went last Friday with a Tru Car quite of 24,000. Lauren had us drive what we thought was the car we specifically wanted. After 90 min we finally get around to the price and it is 33,000. We would have walked out and left but we had to track down the key to our vehicle. It was a waste of time. She finally said the car with the options we wanted did not exist ( that is what she thought at least). We did find the car and price we wanted. Go to Camelback Kia and see Nathan Alexander.
