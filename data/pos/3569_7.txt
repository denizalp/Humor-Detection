Yes, Guy featured it on Food Network. \nHis poster, prominantly displayed at the entrance, reminds you of the eatery's 15 minutes of fame.\n\nAnd yes, guys love this place for some reason. \nI'm not a guy, and I don't love this place. \n\nThe place is dirty. Literally. Look at the floors if you dare.\nOn top of that, my meatless dinner was bland, and mostly lettuce. I couldn't get out of there quickly enough.
