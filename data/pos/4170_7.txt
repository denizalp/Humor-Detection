To get here you either take the shuttle or a cab. It's abt 5-10mins away from the airport. They have about 7 different rental car companies in the facility. All of them claim to have the best prices! Then of course it's Vegas so it's slot machines everywhere. If you don't have a reservation most times you still get good deals last min.
