We came here for lunch the other day.  For a place that is so well known for seafood I have to say it was a bit of a disappointment.  I had the Mahi tacos which were tiny and the fish was dry.  The wife had the lobster poor boy and there was a lot more \"salad\" than lobster.\n\nOur waiter was heavily in the weeds so we had the manager serving us and he was very nice and helpful.\n\nAll in all just not very good food.  Maybe we caught them on an off day.
