I freaking love this place!  It is really l close to my house and it have $1 jello shots!!!  Need I say more.  They are open for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and nightlife.  The food isn't that good but the nightlife is really why people go.  They have a small dance floor and have karaoke and a DJ on certain nights.  Outside there is volleyball, basketball, life size beer pong, horseshoe, live bands, and corn-hole.  The drinks are all reasonably prized.  Most of the bar staff are really friendly and really want you to have a good time.
