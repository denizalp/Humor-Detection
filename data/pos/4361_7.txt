How does this place have no reviews? Next time you think about going to Giant Eagle for your next grill-off, punch yourself and then come here. Actually, just come here even if you aren't going to grill...they have other stuff for you. \n\nI could write a book, but the short version is that this place is awesome, the people running it are awesome, and it makes me sad that the next generation to come probably won't have a place like this to visit (they will have...Giant Eagle). Be brave, be bold, be awesome. Come here.
