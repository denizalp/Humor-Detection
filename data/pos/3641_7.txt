Okay.\nBarely okay.\n\nFrozen crawfish....not exactly smokin'.\nShrimp was okay.\nMussels okay.\n\nThe wait-staff were terrific: attentive and engaging, but the food is no better or worse than all the other Crustacea Commercial Endeavors in town. \n\nSmokin' Crawfish should be SmOKin' Crawfish.\n\nOkay?
