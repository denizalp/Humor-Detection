No longer offering any gluten free options says the manager today. \nA sushi place that can not do gluten free. This is a first for me. \n\" you can order rice\" is the quote I will end this review with. \nBye Ru Sans, you once showed me a great gluten free meal, now you are not willing to accommodate. \n\nBest of luck in the future.
