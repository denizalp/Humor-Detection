Tried for the first time recently. I like the place! I'll get right to it,the Blackened Wings are great ! Maybe the best wings I've had in Nevada!\nLike the setup with TVs all over,also like the idea of a Make your own Bloody Mary area except,you gotta have Worcestershire Sauce and Horseradish ! They were out! No Bueno my friends! Also had a Pizza and it was the low light of the experience , almost zero sauce and bland. I'll return,but stick with the wings!
