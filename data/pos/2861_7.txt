Thank you, Maya, for making a girl feel good about her brows!\n\nCame in on a Friday afternoon as a walk-in client and there was absolutely no wait. Maya did a great job reshaping and cleaning my eyebrows for me. She was more thorough than most ladies I go to back home. She took the time to clean in between my brows as well as a bit of my forehead fuzz. Plus it was painless. Two thumbs up!!!\n\nFast and solid service. Recommended if you're around the area :)
