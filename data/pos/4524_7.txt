FYI, it's a little heavier on the dancing but it was a fantastic show. \n\nIt is A MUST for any fan, ABSOLUTE MUST. For those that are not huge fans of the Beatles, you'll have a great time as well. I know several people that fall in that category and still thought it was wonderful.\n\nI'd definitely see it again.
