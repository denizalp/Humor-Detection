THE good:\n\n- Sleek, modern, upscale rooms with great amenities \n- Stylish, modern architecture and interior design\n- No buffet\n- No screaming kids\n- No fat white trash people from the mid-west with pastel stretch pants & fanny packs, walking around like zombies from one buffet to the next, sucking down 3 ft tall daiquiris\n- Great views of the strip & the mountains\n- Excellent customer service \n\nTHE bad:\n\n- No coffee makers in the rooms. What? When did this happen? Cheap stinking bastards. \n\n- An omelette from room service the size of a deck of cards that costs $27
