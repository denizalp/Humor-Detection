We should of known when we walked in on a Saturday night and it was nearly empty.  But seeing so many positive Yelp reviews we had to try it... what a mistake.. ugh.  So the question is?.. \"How do you ruin Mexican food?!\"\n\nI'll tell you how...\n\nstore bought chips\nstore bought tortillas\nstore bought re-fried beans\nstore bought rice\nstore bought pre-mixed margaritas\npico de gallo so old it looks grey\nbland fajitas\nawful atmosphere\nluke warm service\n\nNow I know why the place was nearly empty.  Don't eat here.
