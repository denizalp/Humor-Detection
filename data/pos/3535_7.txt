I dinned at Black and Bleu last week and I can honestly say it was the best burger I have ever eaten. The service was quick and friendly. The order was brought to use exactly as asked for and cooked to perfection. My entire party thoroughly enjoyed their meals and we agreed it was not only the most delicious food we had enjoyed in a long time, but the service and price were amazing We cannot wait to go back.
