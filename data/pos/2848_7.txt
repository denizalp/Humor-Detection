They recently opened and already this is my favorite location- it's clean and fairly spacious, there's a huge community bookshelf, and patio area. In addition to coffee drinks, menu has a few pastries, bagels, and sandwiches for light bites. Go when you can stay awhile, the dine-in ceramic mugs are enormous and your drink size is practically double!
