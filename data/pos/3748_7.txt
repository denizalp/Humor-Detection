Omg this place .....we ate and ate and ate\n\nHonestly the non veg items were much better than the veg ones...\nSo here is what we ordered and I will rate them on 5\n\n1. Veg rolls 2\/5\n2. Flatbread 2\/5\n3. Artichoke dip 4\/5 ( I dint like the fried chips)\n4. Black bean sliders 5\/5\n5. Hummus platter 3\/5\n6. Turkey meatballs 4\/5\n7. Lamp chops 5\/5\n7. Veg pasta ( was more like saut√©ed veggies) 3\/5
