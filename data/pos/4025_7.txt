Bad Room Design - Bella Suite\n The bathrooms cant be locked ! The toilet room did not have a fan ! People can see inside of the bathrooms through a space between the two doors of the bathroom. VERY bad design NOT RECOMMENDED for family\/business reservations\n\nThe fridge was packed with hotel stuff , so we cannot put anything of our own . the fridge had a sensor items so if we move them it would be charged on out bill.
