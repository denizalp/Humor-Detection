Great customer service, but food was just average.  Can't expect much from an airport restaurant, but it was food in the belly before a long flight home.  \n\nThe trend I saw at all the dining establishments I went to in the south were... friendly, southern hospitality service from waiters and staff and bitching and rude customers.  Apparently the people who sat down before we did at the same table were total jerks.  I guess what they say is true about the south... \"there's nothing like it\".
