Limo connect is the worst company I have ever dealt with. They cancelled our pre paid KGB deals Christmas light tour 5 hours before we were supposed to be picked up. The woman who originally booked us was also extremely rude and now we have three very disappointed children to deal with. This company is very unprofessional do not use them.
