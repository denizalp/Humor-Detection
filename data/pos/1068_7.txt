This new Southend spot has great craft cocktails, some with great stories behind them (like the ground botanicals from the local gin being blow torch seared into your glass with great fanfare). If you like an old fashioned try the delicious and smoky Edison. \n\nWe hung out at the bar and had drinks and apps. Calamari was great. Crispy and served with a delightful Asian sweet pepper drizzle. Charcuterie board was good but not great.
