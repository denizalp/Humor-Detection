I waited in line to get in Momofuku in NYC for what I thought was the best Ramen out side of Tokyo. Then I came home and found this incredible place and I think the Morris Ramen deserves the crown. \n\nOutstanding. It warms my soul. Better then a hug from your Grandmother. Tastes like an umami ocean and with a dash of ninja tears of joy. I go here when I'm sad and wanna feel like rainbows are running through my veins.
