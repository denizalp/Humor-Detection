Suki suki nowwww... Time for some Pho!\n\nCan you say delicious in Vietnamese?  WHO CARES?!  This place has got the best soup in town and unlike its neighbor, LoLo's Chicken and Waffles, this is healthy stuff!  \n\nI have ordered the Chicken, Broccoli, and Bok Choy Pho twice now and have no complaints.  They bring out all the fixins too... Bean sprouts, basil leaves, cilantro and lime mmm.  Rice noodles, chicken, broccoli, and Bok Choy are simmered in a mouthwatering broth sprinkled with herbs to boot!  If you haven't gone yet, you better put that fried chicken down and check yourself!
