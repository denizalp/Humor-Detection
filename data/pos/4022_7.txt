Rules. Rules. And more Rules! \nNo cell phones.\nNo incomplete parties.\nNo credit cards. (cash only)\nNo firearms.\nNo outside drinks allowed in.\nNo to go orders on weekends & holidays.\nNo smoking. (which is a city law)\nSo if you can handle all of this, the food is pretty good.\noh yeah... btw.. if you would like to try the blueberry syrup then be prepared to pay $1.75 for a 2 Tbsp. serving of smashed blueberries mixed with pancake syrup... They didn't tell me it was extra and I found it quite disappointing to pay so much for so little.
