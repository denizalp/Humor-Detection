This place is worth the drive and risk of a sketchy area.  A hidden gem in vegas.  Im not sure they realize how successful they would be on a nicer side of town.  My wife said she likes this place better than her seven hills location, even though I had to beg her to get out of the car at first.  Very clean place, quiet and no pushy emoloyees.  They are amazing in everyway I could think of.
