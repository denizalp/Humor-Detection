When i arrived I was excited because this place is packed!! However, I left feeling like the food quality and taste was similar to Denny's.  This is a great place to cure a hangover but not the kind of place to go if you like a healthy breakfast. I typically go to Tryst in dessert ridge. Its more organic and fresh.  This place is busy though so to each their own!
