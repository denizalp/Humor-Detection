If you fear flavor...this is the fare for you! The nice thing is you don't even have to request no flavor....they omit it automatically. \n\nI had some high hopes reading the menu as there are were some very creative and outlandish combinations of ingredients in their entrees. \n\nEven the ranch dressing was flavorless and had I had some hidden valley nearby, I would have substituted it out.
