If you were to cut me, I would bleed fried chicken.\n\nPoulet Bronzé is hands down my favourite chicken place in Montreal. I love everything about it. Slightly spicy, crispy, golden brown goodness in a brick building bathed in golden light. The place is reassuringly cozy in a way only places in the Concordia district seem to be.\n\nThe feeling of biting into a crispy fried chicken leg cannot be described in words adequately. It's a state of mind and body rivalled only by orgasm.\n\nGod bless Poulet Bronzé you guys are the proof that a better world is possible.
