The Peppermill is such an awesome diner, one that encapsulates Las Vegas. The poker machines at the entrance are just the start - it's the chain smoking patrons, neon lighting and artificial trees that really give it its charm.\n\nFood here comes in large portions and is big enough to feed two people. Omelettes run a little, but the hash browns are just crispy enough and cooked to perfection. And as a bonus, there's an attached bar!
