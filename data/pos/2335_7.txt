How do you screw up a friggen burger? Ate here while attending a work conference, so we ate here for lunch. Here I'm thinking.... Order a burger. That's safe... \n\nSurvey says.... BUZZZZZZZZZZ\n\nHorribly dry and flavorless. Bun was made of depleted uranium. \n\nIf you ever attend this hotel....SKIP THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!
