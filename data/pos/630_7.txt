My review is for the breakfast buffet, and only the breakfast buffet.  This is hands down the BEST place at the MGM Grand to get an egg white omelette from the omelette station.  They have a nice selection of fruit, too.  \n\nAnd for those of you who want to clog your arteries, they have bacon, sausage, pancakes and other crap.
