So terrible.....disappointing..borderline A JOKE!!!  \n\nIt is sad.  We waited for canters to open.  These comments, as negative as they sound,  are even worse than they wrote.  I Will NOT return.  Pastrami and corned beef good....but at what price???  The management needs to print out these comnents and use them as a Learning and Training tool..sad  sad  sad!!
