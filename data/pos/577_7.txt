Oh my word ... I have to remind myself to be really hungry when I come here. So much food, and very good food at that. Lightweight eaters, don't be deterred - you can always take leftovers home for continued feasting. Abdul has removed the little bazaar portion but that's a plus because that expands the dining area. Take note - this restaurant closes at 6 PM, so if you're thinking dinner, better be there 5:30 or earlier.
