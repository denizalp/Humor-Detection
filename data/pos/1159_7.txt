The best Whole Foods in Vegas hands down! The salad bar\/hot food bar area has a great selection. I don't know if I've just been oblivious to the other locations but to me this one knocks it out of the park.\n\nBurrito station = my new crazy obsession. I've been 3 or 4 times this week alone. Guilty pleasure and it's healthy ;) I think.\n\nStaff is super friendly and everything looks as fresh as it tastes!
