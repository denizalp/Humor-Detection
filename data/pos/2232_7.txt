I went in with my girlfriend as she was referred to them a little while ago and took her car to be serviced. \n\nGeorge is an insanely nice and professional guy and does not overcharge like oh so many mechanics out there. \n\nI think I have found a new place to take my car. Too bad it is a little out of the way for me but I think it is worth a shot from the looks of it.
