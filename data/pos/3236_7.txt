What a surprise. Did not expect the food to be this good walking in but my god this might have been the best thing I've had all weekend. \n\nGET THE SWEET HOME ALABAMA. It is the best thing they have here and you will not be disappointed. You will feel full and feel like you hate yourself, which isn't a bad thing. \n\nJust if you have a night and can't decide what to eat, come here and let this man bless you with some rockin noodles.
