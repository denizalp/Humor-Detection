I had Arouch for a business lunch. The team had ordered different types of Armenian pizza and an assortment of salads. I had the spinach\/cheese Armenian pizza but it was a bit dry since the team didn't order any extra toppings. The salads were super convenient as they were individually packaged. I had the Armenian couscous, that had a lemon tomato base with a melange of lovely Armenian spices. I would be curious to try this place out in person. Reminded me of a fancy Al-tayab wrap!
