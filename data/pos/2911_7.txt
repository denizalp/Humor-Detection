Good place for a workout, equipment is new, and facility is clean and well-maintained.  Apparently, the women's locker room is newly redone and quite nice... the Men's locker room area is looking a bit, well, dowdy, but remains quite serviceable.  Good size steam room.\n\nVERY busy at 5-6 pm and especially in January with the resolution crowd like every other gym on the planet.  We should have the suckers weeded out by March or so.
