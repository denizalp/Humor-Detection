Union Social Eatery is my lunch spot for the Mississauga Rd\/401 area.  The burgers are made with real beef no fillers and the fries are wonderful.  Union is tucked away in the food mall as I call it where many corporate offices are located in North Mississauga.\n\nThis place gets busy during lunch and after work; reservations are recommended.\n\nThe rest of their menu is decently priced as well tasty!\n\nCheck this place out if you are in the area!
