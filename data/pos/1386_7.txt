Vegas in December is cold! And this is coming from someone from the east coast! currently there is construction going on in front of the fountain. I didn't understand the wow factor about these fountains. They go on every 15 mins with random music. I only enjoyed seeing them from on top of the eiffel tower restaurant- to really get a feel for the patterns of shooting water.\n\nFree is good, but this was overrated.
