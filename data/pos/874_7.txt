Took the kids here to jump and slide. Tickets were like .89 cents each and of course the kids wanted to slide like 50 times...so this did not make sense for us! This Pumpkin Patch had other \"activities\" like a petting zoo, some bungie bouncing, electric swings and some bouncy like houses. Good for little kids under five.\n\nIt closed early...5 p.m.  Workers were very nice here but I actually took my kids down a few blocks at another pumpkin patch where it was only $10 to jump \"all day\"!  Now that's what I'm talking about!
