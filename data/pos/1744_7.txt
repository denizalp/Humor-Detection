I'm sure changing brakes is supposed to take its time but not almost FIVE hours, how can a place like this have only 2 guys working on cars and have their garage just about full? Not only that, their waiting area is horrible, the best they can do is tell you to go eat at Popeye's. Don't care if these brakes are insured for a lifetime or not I will most DEFINITELY not be going back to there.
