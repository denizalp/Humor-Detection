This was my first visit to rise and I totally made a rookie mistake! \n\nI went when they were pretty much out of everything for the day. Ugh. \n\nAnyhoo...I opted to sample what was left and got a sprinkle donut with vanilla icing. \n\nDon't get me wrong it was good...but it would be better if it was a little fresher. \n\nI'm looking forward to giving them another try and perhaps even sampling some of their other breakfast options.
