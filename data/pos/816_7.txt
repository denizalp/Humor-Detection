Do not go here. This Walmart is disgusting. The clientele is pretty questionable and most employees do not care at all. The first time I came here there was a crumpled up porn magazine in one of the bathroom stalls. So there's that. Then there's your typical Walmart line time which could be as long as your shopping if you bought groceries for the whole family. Clean this place up.
