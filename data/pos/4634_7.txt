Jacob & Sebastian has a great selection of body, bath, skincare and beauty products for men and women. Very well curated to ensure J&S is a one-stop shop for all your hard-to-find, high-end beauty needs. \n\nAlso, the customer service here is excellent -- Joel is helpful without being intrusive, and always willing to offer samples and go the extra mile to ensure that everyone leaves the store happy and satisfied. It should also be noted that his skin and hair are always eerily perfect, which I think reflects well on the quality of the product he stocks.
