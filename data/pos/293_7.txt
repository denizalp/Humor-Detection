I was pretty hesitant bringing my 10 month old 3.5lb teacup Yorkie here... Just because as a parent, you should always feel hesitant bringing your child in to a doctor you've never met, but Dr. Roach quickly made me feel comfortable. \n\nHe was extremely polite, very humorous, and handled my little pup so well. There was no additional cost for the exam, I only had to pay for the vaccines, which were $10 each. Extremely affordable and the office was very clean and welcoming. I'm taking my little Brutus here whenever something comes up again :)
