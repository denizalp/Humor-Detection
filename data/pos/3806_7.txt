After sampling several brews at the International Beer Fest yesterday afternoon, I was left heavily intoxicated and ridiculously hungry.\n\nThankfully for me, the perfect comfort food awaited at strEat Mobile Bistro.\n\nBlurry-eyed, I still managed to make out the words \"Mac & Cheese\" for a price of $6 on their menu and ordered immediately. Service was super friendly and fast - plus, they take credit card. \n\nAs for that Mac & Cheese. . .it was absolutely everything I ever wanted at that very moment.  Ooh, and the panko was a very nice touch. Basically, I devoured within minutes, maybe seconds even.
