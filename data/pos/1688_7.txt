Small cute little place. I was a guest at a wedding. At first when I heard it was on the strip I was like oh oh this will be tacky but it was. It tacky at all. It's a small place. Parking in the back. Cute little places in the front that has a photo opportunity places. Little swing, bridge, etc. wedding was fast and to the point. Small little area but cute.
