Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.\n\nIf you love smoke, you will love the Venetian.  Cigarette smoke smells permeate this hotel from top to bottom.  You cannot escape it.  Everywhere you walk in this massive hotel stinks of stale (and fresh!) cigarette smoke.\n\nWe stayed here for two nights in a \"non-smoking\" suite.  It was a premium Bella suite that cost us ~$250\/night.  It stunk of smoke, as did the rest of the hotel.  Everywhere stunk of smoke.  We couldn't wait to get outside.\n\nNice concept.  Horrible execution.
