Still going strong.  \n\nStopped in here last Sunday for lunch\/brunch.  Selection is still good, quality still there and the place is still clean.  For $22.95 it's a deal with all you can drink champagne or mimosas.  \n\nI still straight for the crab legs and shrimps and pass up all that carb noise that fills you up quick.\n\nEnjoy
