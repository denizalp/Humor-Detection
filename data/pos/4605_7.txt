Even though thrift prices have gone up significantly over the years, at least you know you money is going to a good cause!\n\nFor me the rectangular shape of the store interior makes it easier to shop. One of my favorite places to browse for cool T-shirts, books and CDs. Scored a brand new NPR Nerd shirt and a Sia CD - $5 all together.\n\nThe sales associates are super nice, polite and patient. You can use credit cards and debit cards now. Believe it or not they even have a rewards program for frequent shoppers!
