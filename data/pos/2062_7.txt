Not feeling so Luckee here. Not enough dim sum choices. Our server wasn't attentive or knowledgeable about their menu. For a half empty restaurant we had to wait a significant amount of time for our food. \n\nWhat we had:\n- siu mai (can get better in Chinatown)\n- shrimp cheun feng (delicious)\n- sweet and sour cod (don't order)\n\nI was very disappointed since we specifically went to try their xiao long bao and beef bao but they were both sold out!! On top of that we weren't blown away with what we had. \n\nGo to Crown Princess instead!!
