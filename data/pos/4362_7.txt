The arena is great except for why do the guests prefer to standup blocking the view and no ushers were in site to do anything about it. Also Nicki Minja and Ariane Grande were an hour and 35 minutes late starting the concert which is ridiculous. It's ashamed that the entertainers don't respect the audience's time. If a regular working person is 3 minutes late they get a warning.
