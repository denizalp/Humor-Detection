Hard Rock Cafe is two blocks from the strip on Paradise Rd. It is easily identifyable by the enormous, topographically-incorrect neon Les Paul bolted to the front. \n\nThe place is loud and full of tourists, yet the service is friendly and efficient. They make a good avocado and pepperjack burger, however the steak fries were a bit underfried and very salty. Hard Rock has some nice tunes and rock memorabilia strewn across the walls, they also have a gift shop where you can another Hard Rock shirt for future painting days.
