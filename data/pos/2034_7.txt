Extremely nice furnishing. Classy seats and tables, utensils, and decor. There was also small TV screens in each room, which was quite nice.\n\nIn terms of food, the dim sum was pretty tasty as well, with a decent price. The variety is decent, pretty much what'd you expect at a good dim sum restaurant. The location was a little hard to find (you have to go up the stairs), but not a big deal.\n\nOverall, a decent dim sum place to go to for groups. Not a bad place to go if you'd like to impress your friends.
