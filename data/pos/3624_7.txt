Friendly staff. Solid lunch.\n\nI'm reviewing Subway because I'm bored. If you really need to read a review to decide whether or not to go to a place that makes generic sandwiches, you need to re-evaluate your life.\n\nI like Subway. If you've never heard of Subway and you're deciding to go because of my review, I just want you to know that the sound you just heard is my palm hitting my forehead.
