A quaint little library out on the east end of Tropicana.  No slot machines, but it's got plenty of comfortable chairs for if you just want some place quiet to get a little reading or work done, outside of the distractions at your place.  \n\nThe hawkish security guard looks like he's about ready to bichslap anyone who crosses his path, which helps keep things nice and quiet.
