A less than friendly middle-aged woman \"helped\" us with our to go order. She was argumentative and just plain rude. \n\nOne of the bags started leaking. She curtly says, \"What you want?! What you want?!\". I pointed at the bag and told her, \"I want another bag. That is what I want. This one is leaking. Look.\". She fiercely puts our bag in another bag. Disgusted, I left. \n\n$130 order. $0 tip.
