While in Las Vegas for my brother's bachelor party, we were waited on by Byron in the private dining room.  Absolutely, without a doubt, in the top 3 best meals I've ever had in my entire life.  Ever ever.  \n\nCourse after course of fresh sashimi, with some kobe beef sliders at the end.  Words cannot describe how incredible this meal was, and I have recommended Social House to every friend of mine going to Las Vegas since.\n\nIn a town chock full of incredible restaurants, this one really stands alone.
