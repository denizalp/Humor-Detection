This Starbucks location at the Cleveland Airport has some pretty bad reviews, but my experience here was near perfect. \n\nThe line was not too long and moved quickly. The employees were friendly and helpful. They made the drinks in a timely manner. The store was neat and clean.\n\nI'm sure when the airport is busier that it might take longer to get a drink, but on this day, the service was great.
