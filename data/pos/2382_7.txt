I have no clue what people are talking about. I hated this place, I mean its sad for the owners.. but that aside, this place was fucking gross. \nEverything tasted like nasty bean water, apparently only chain smokers ate here who burnt off their taste buds. My friend raved about this place. So I came here 2 times the first time I threw it out after about 3 bites. My friend begged me to give it a second chance\n\nI did\n\nsame thing\n\nIm sorry but I seriously question the freshness of these ingredients. \nand it was overpriced\n\nP.S.Sorry owners..no offense
