I have spent a lot of time at RC Willey in the past few months.\n\nI've had all different experiences during each visit but for the most part I enjoy shopping here. The high pressure sales gets to me sometimes but overall I usually enjoy my browsing experience and can find a couple of sales people who are attentive without being stalkers. My favorite area to shop is the clearance center. There are usually plenty of discounted items to be found in this area.
