I really didn't enjoy my experience here.\n\nOur server was pleasant and seated us promptly. \n\nThe food absolutely lacked flavour. I ordered the pasta with eggplant and my eggplant was not even cooked! I couldn't eat it at all. The sweet potato fries were not even fully cooked either. How could you mess up fries? It was just overall a horrible experience. My friends and I were very disappointed with the food
