We are furious. Half an hour of our day was wasted just waiting for one ferry to be ready!!!!!\nIt was sitting in the water doing nothing while we just stood there!\nVery disappointed!!! Never ever take this ferry to wards island unless you want to waste your day standing there!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HUMPH!!!!!!\nAnd even when we got on the ferry it didn't even decide to move for a long time!!!! Rawr!!!!!!!!! Do not, whatever u do, do not go to wards island by ferry!!!! Listen to me!!! Swim instead
