Sat in the bar area for a light dinner of small plates and drinks. The waiter\/bartender was super friendly and attentive. The hamachi tartare was great. You can never go wrong with shishito peppers. The rock shrimp tempura was pretty good with the dipping sauces. The chili seared scallops were very hefty and filling. Good experience with service, food, and drinks. A good alternative to restaurants in the hotels.
