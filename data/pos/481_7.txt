I ate there a few days ago during lunch and the food was ok, it was the customer service that sucked. I asked this waiter named Anthony for a simple request and he responded, \"hey you do know I have other customers right?\" I could have fainted!!! I could not believe he said that.... Extremely sub par customer service, will not be returning!!!
