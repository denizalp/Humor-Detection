Pho Lien is the best Vietnamese Beef Noodle (Pho Bo) restaurant in Montreal. Don't take my word for it, that is from the Vietnamese locals who know food. \n\nThe owner used to run a factory locally, but when those opportunities went to China for cheaper costs, he had to shut down the Factory and try something different. So he went and hired the best Pho cook he could find, employed him for a year, and learned how to make good Pho. \n\nIt isn't to California standards, but here in Montreal, C'est Magnifique!
