We decided to stop in here on a Friday night because we had a Groupon.  We ordered a couple of margaritas and an appetizer platter to share.  We were served chips, salsa, and water shortly after being seated.  The salsa was pretty tasty.  Everything on our visit was decent.  As others have stated, nothing was particularly memorable.  The appetizer was served hot but each item on the platter contained the same meat so pretty much tasted the same. Margaritas were pretty good as was the service.
