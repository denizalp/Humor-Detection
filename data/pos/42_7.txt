We came across Gelato Messina when were were walking around the stores looking for a place to have lunch.\n\nWe were greeted by a nice young man who offered us a tastings and gave us some descriptions of some of the flavors. \n\nThey had some of the usual flavors and some unique ones as well.\n\nThey tasted fresh and very creamy as what gelato should taste like. I am not a huge gelato fan and I am more old school ice cream or soft serve but my husband is a self appointed gelato snob. lol!
