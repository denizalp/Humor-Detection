I guess I'm in the minority here. To me, the pizza tastes like a glorified version of Domino's. There is definitely a similarity in taste between the two. \n\nIf you're looking for New York pizza (real NY pizza, not the places that call themselves \"NY Pizza\"), then you will probably be disappointed. If you're not a pizza snob (as in from NY), then you should be good to go. \n\nIt's also a little on the expensive side in regards to value.\n\nFortunately, this experience led to the discovery of Cloud 9.
