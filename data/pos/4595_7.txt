Came here with a buddy and all of here co workers and I have to say:  This place is a lot of fun.  Very upscale but a fun atmosphere.  The sushi was pretty good, not excellent but the ambience and reasonably priced drinks\/saki made up for that.  \n\nI would definitely come back and enjoyed my experience at Sushi Samba.
