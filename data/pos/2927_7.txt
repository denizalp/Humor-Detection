This place is such a jewel. Located in a strip mall in the Parma area, you would never expect to find great sushi around. \n\nMy friends, the sushi was great... Certainly comparable to what you get in downtown Cleveland.  The Christmas roll was my personal favorite. I honestly don't remember what was in it but it was spectacular. \n\nI will say that it is certainly Americanized sushi, but let's face it- the stuff is delicious.  (No complaints from this girl.) \n\nFinally, the wait staff was pleasant and attentive!
