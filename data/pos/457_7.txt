Meh..... Nice atmosphere. Cool vibes.... However, food is not up to price point. This was intended for these 20 \"something\" hipsters that feel cool for spending too much money for overpriced food. \nAnyone with half a brain will not make this a regular stop. \n$1.00 for a SINGLE PIECE Of SWISS. \n$1.00 for about 7 PIECES of MUSHROOM. \nWha????????\nIf ya'll wanna pay for this stuff. Go right ahead. Their CEO is laughing all the way to the bank. Period.
