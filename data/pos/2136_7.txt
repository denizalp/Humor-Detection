And in conclusion.....\nI don't see how anyone could say this shop is overpriced. Where do you usually eat? Subway? \nSure I can make this sandwich for cheaper than $6.75 but I can also make a steak better than Ruth's Chris and save $40 on that. \nBottom line, the food is pretty good and the staff is friendly.  \n\nAnd Darlene H, don't you feel pretty ratchet getting $20 of food for $10 and then giving a terrible review that states the decor is horrible? Its a sandwich shop, not some fake Fendi bag filled nightclub.
