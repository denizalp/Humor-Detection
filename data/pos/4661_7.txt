All i wanted was a Margherita pizza.\nThis is the description: \nCrushed tomato, fresh mozzarella, parmigiano reggiano, olive oil, basil.\nI got my pizza and opened it and NO basil! Isn't that like a third of the pizza??? I brought it back to the counter and asked them about it. Oh. They were OUT OF BASIL. Perhaps something they could have mentioned when I ORDERED! \nPlus the middle of the pizza was SO soggy you couldn't even hold the slice. \nPathetic excuse for pizza!
