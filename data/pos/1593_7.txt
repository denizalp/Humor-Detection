Absolutely awful phone customer service. I was asking if I could pay for a camera battery charger online and then have an agent in the store bring it out to me in the car because my baby was asleep in the car. But they said no and hung up on me. Office Depot let me do this. I don't understand why frys couldn't do this for me. They have a large inventory and good pricing but I recommend going to any other place for your electronic needs.
