Just your typical Best Buy just like all the rest. Good selection of electronics and can usually find an associate to help you but sometimes not. I do like the fact that they price match these days. I also read they are not going to be carrying audio CDs anymore. The true digital age is upon us so if you like CDs he can probably pick them up pretty cheap while they're closing them out.
