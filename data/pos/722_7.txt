We recently had CDC Pools resurface our pool and they did an excellent job! Jerry Herzog did an excellent job in helping us to identify a new surface, tile, and adding a Baja shelf. Anytime we had questions he was quick to respond and was very knowledgable. \n\nOne of the best qualities in Jerry is that he has a great attention to detail and works to ensure all jobs are done with the highest quality.\n\nThe pool looks awesome and can't wait until the weather warms up so we can use it!
