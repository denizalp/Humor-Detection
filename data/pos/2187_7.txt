This establishment serves typical breakfast\/brunch standards such as fluffy pancakes, thick cut bacon, and omelets large enough for two meals. I appreciate the fact that they offer fresh fruit skewers as an alternative to the usual starch staples that accompany your main entrée. Food quality is good, service is very friendly, location is convenient with ample parking behind the building (where the entrance is). The bright interior has cool, contemporary décor but seating is a tad crowded and I found the background music to be a tad loud.
