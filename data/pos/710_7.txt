I hate being a dissenter but...\n\nIt was only okay. The food was all right although the service was fantastic and the dessert was really great. I just thought the sushi was overdone. Too many things in it so it was hard to identify a single defining flavor. \n\nI would definitely return for drinks and maybe if I order the simpler sushi.
