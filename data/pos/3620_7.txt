These folks are really nice, the Dr is patient and intelligent.the staff is  extremely helpful , attentive,personable,kind , thorough,   and very likeable. I recommend them. The only reason they did not get 5 stars is their selection of glasses was not enough for me. That have a lot of very recognizable  brands but the very high end ,Cartier, Mont blanc, chopard were missing. They do have Oakley, Channel, Tom Ford, ECT. I highly recommend them  they treat their customers great!!!!for eye exams and glasses give them a shot you will like them.....
