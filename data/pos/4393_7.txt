I was very excited to see this place. It looked so great with many options but I wanted to start off simple so i ordered just a regular strawberry waffle. Sure the waffle was crispy but it had no flavor. I had the whip cream on the side and I had to eat it with each bite. So I didn't even eat thecwhole waffle. They had many different flavors and options though like fruits and nuts. Candy toppings and waffle sandwiches. But I'm not rushing back to try them.
