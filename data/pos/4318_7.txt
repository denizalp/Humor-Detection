I really wanted to give them a better rating because they have great toppings. Service was great, cute little restaurant, beer flights and wine flights, but the pizza dough was just ok.  Wasn't expecting the dough to be so \"doughy\". I was looking for that crisp dough you get at a wood fire oven place.  \nI've been searching long and hard for that pizza place with an egg pizza to remind me of the pizza's I had in Italy.  \nJust have to say great toppings, but work on the dough.
