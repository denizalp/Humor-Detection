Avoid! The shop sold me & installed fenders that were way too small for my wheel size.  They handed me the bike as \"finished\" with the tires rubbing against both the fenders and a bolt they used to install!\n\nI had to take it home an modify them to fit properly since I couldn't wait the 4-5 days they needed to fix their ridiculous mistake. I know it gets busy in the spring but it was total incompetence!\n\nThere are so many other repair places... don't waste your money here.
