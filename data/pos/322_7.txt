Went there for dinner.  My children ordered chicken nuggets, they were burnt.  My wife ordered a chicken sandwich and asked that the sauce be on the side.  She had to send it back.  I ordered the Italian panini.  I had to send I back twice, as they left the plastic casing on the meat each time.  They removed the price of my sandwich, since I asked them not to replace it.  Service was slow.
