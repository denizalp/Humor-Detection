At 2 cents a gram, you can't go wrong with a bulk of candy (any variation, combination or brand)  which ROCKS!\n\nHowever the inside of the store - is soooo sterile and bright - it kinda makes it unfun or just plain weird.\nBut who cares! 2cents a gram!! for candy!!! Wheeee sugar high where we come
