Mahalo Daren C. For the awesome recommendation! Without you I would have never found this killer spot. And yes, I was sure to mention your name to the lovely owners. ;)\n\nThe food was fresh & ONO. The service was personable, interior was clean and the prices were decent. Every single bite of my garlic shrimp, egg rolls, shrimp katsu & chocolate mousse pie was worth the 24 mile drive over (in traffic too). I can not wait to go back.
