On a less serious note, I want to thank all the bitches who keep saying Sixburgh got lucky. I waited six days to post this, one for each Super Bowl the Steelers have won. One for each Super Bowl we've exceeded the Cardinals by. One for each Super Bowl we've won that make the Steelers the best of the best.\n\nSo ya. Thanks, suckas! You're funny.
