I have been to most of the gentlemen's clubs in Las Vegas, and I feel like this is the best of the best.  The place is clean and classy.  The girls are always stellar, and I was happily surprised to find a lot of them o'natural.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  I have been to Club Paradise eight times now over the last three years, and I've been impressed each and every time.\n\nTrust me!  Forget all the other's!  Club Paradise is the best!  So good, it was even featured in \"Vegas Vacation!\"
