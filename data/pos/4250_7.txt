Their cancellation policy is ridiculous! We had a family emergency and weren't able to attend the class and before we could even explain our situation the lady in the office that we were speaking to on the phone  talked over us saying there is a 48 hour cancellation policy and there was nothing she could do. Not even let us move our spot to another night. I mean it's a little ridiculous when airlines have a better cancellation policy than a freaking paint store.
