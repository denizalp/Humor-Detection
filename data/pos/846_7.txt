I promise that you will not find better Mexican food in Las Vegas than at Viva Mercado's.  (Though you'll find MANY more expensive and pretentious Mexican places.)\n\nThey start you off right with an amazing free bean dip, along with your choice from a list of very good salsas.  They also give you a suprisingly flavorful cup of tomato soup with most entrees.  The entrees I've gotten have all been hot, fresh, delicious, and large.  And the service is great.  If you're visiting Las Vegas, it's worth getting access to a car just so you can eat here.
