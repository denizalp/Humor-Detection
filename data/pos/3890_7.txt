I have eaten at this Toast over a dozen times, it is delicious! It's perfect in this great, quiet college town. On a nice day i love sitting at a sidewalk table and enjoying breakfast and coffee while chatting with a friend or by myself. The food is always good. The seasonal pancakes are my favorite...pumpkin pancakes are delicious! The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  I look forward to some of the fall seasonal pancakes soon!
