Hot dogs are my favorite food. Yes, out of everything in the world, nothing quite does it for me like a delicious old-fashioned hot dog. So naturally Happy Dog would be the ultimate place for me. Not only do I drool over even the possibility of going to Happy Dog, I very often dream about it.\n\nBelieve it or not, but I even went to Happy Dog for my college graduation \"celebratory dinner\" back in May. Our outfits may have been a tad overkill, but that didn't stop us from stuffing our faces with delicious hot dogs.
