Yet another one of my favourite bubble tea joints! I came here with my friend to get bubble tea on the go. Upon arrival, the servers greeted us, however the service was somewhat slow, even though there were only two people ahead of us and three servers.\n\nThis bubble tea joint is really clean compared to other ones and it is really spacious. It's a nice place to catch up with your friends. Also, the price range here is really good, not pricey at all.\n\nI got the pearl milk tea in large and I loved it!! It was really satisfying.
