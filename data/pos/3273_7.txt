This is one of my backup locations for Smiths.  If I'm in the area and need something quick, they will have it. \n\nThe Smith's grocery store chain is one I tend to frequent.  This store isn't set up like my usual store but it's not hard to find what I need.  Produce seems fresh and items I shop for are well stocked.  Even though their health food\/organic section is limited, it's just enough for what i need. \n\nSo when in need...
