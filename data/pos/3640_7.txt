I'm a sucker for any type of good marketing campaign and given that this place has advertisements in the metro and on TV I was dying to try their Philly Steak Sandwich.\n\nThe drawing point was their \"Canadian beef\" which I bought hook, line, and sinker.\n\nAverage tasting sandwich.\n\nPersonally I prefer the USA's philly wannabe sandwich any day over this one.\n\nBut all in all, not bad.
