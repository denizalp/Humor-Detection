I would give this place 5 stars but I was a little frustrated when I ordered food and they asked me about what kind of rice or chow mein etc. I wanted and didn't tell me that one of them was an increase in price.\n\nThe food is usually very good and the service is good\n\nChow mein is extra if they don't specify.
