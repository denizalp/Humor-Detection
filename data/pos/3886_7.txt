Pizza arrived promptly. Found hair in my pizza, which triggered a gag reaction and caused me to vomit profusely. Disgusting and unacceptable. Needless to say, I lost my appetite and immediately discarded the pizza. Called the restaurant and the manager offered me another pizza -- OH HELL NO. Ended up asking for the charges to be credited back to my credit card (thank God I didn't pay with cash)\n\nEat there at your own risk.
