High, drunk, sober, 5, 55, man, woman, a combination of the two... no matter who or what you are, this water show will grab you by the soul and pump you full of amazement, wonder, awe, and love. And if it doesn't, you are a soulless son of a bitch.\n\nNo, but really. A different playlist each day. The water dancing with enchantment to each song. The silence that captivates you as you watch in wonderment. Genius.
