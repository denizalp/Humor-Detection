This isn't a chain, is it? It feels like a chain... it tastes like a chain... the food is just too prefab. Prefab is OK for cheap housing and fast food, but not for a place that charges about $10- $12 per person for breakfast. \n\nFood is OK... nothing special. They have a well rounded menu with lots of options, but none are so special or so delicious that I would write home about it. \n\nFor me, it's close, convenient and fast... other than that, I would choose someplace else.
