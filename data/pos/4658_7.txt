. I was recently sent an owners loyalty offer which seemed like a great deal. Any enthusiasm changed when I was told the extra $1900 in add on fees know as the \"Coulter package\".  My wife and I now use it as a term, when a company is trying to squeeze us. Husband: Hey whats this extra fee from Verizon? Wife: Their just trying to Coulter Package us.
