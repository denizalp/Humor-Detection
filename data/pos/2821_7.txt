We have lived here for two years now and just signed another year due to the customer service that we receive while living here.  The maintenance crew are very professional, prompt and understanding of your needs.  Brandy and Yathaly are amazing.  They've always been there when we've need anything answered or support of a situation.  \n\nThe property is a smaller property than others which makes it a nicer home setting.  The grounds and pool\/Jacuzzi area are well maintained at all times.\n\nGreat Property!  Great Staff!
