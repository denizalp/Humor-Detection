Ordered delivery....\nOrdered a turkey sub.  The menu didn't say what came on it, so I wrote in  Special instructions what I wanted on the sub.  Well...i open it up and 1, yes 1 slice of turkey.  Are you freaking kidding me?  And onions...i did not ask for onions.  Such a disappointment.  Not ordering from them anymore.   Though my husband ordered a small pizza and he liked it, but that's not saying much, the man will eat anything.
