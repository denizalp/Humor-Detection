NOT GOOD RAMEN.  Just go to Yuma Izakaya on Plaza Midwood (12 minutes away from this place).  Spent $80 on 4 bowls & 1 appetizer.\n\nThe broth was NOT good.  The miso broth was baddddddd (way too salty).  Waited 1 hour & 30 minutes to be seated.  30 minutes for our food to come out.  I had such high hope but I was soooooo disappointed.
