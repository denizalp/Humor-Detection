This place smells wonderful. When I went I ordered a cappuccino and an Ã©clair. It was delicious. It also looks like they have some options for lunch and they have coolers where you can grab your wine.\n\nYou order at the counter and the  staff was patient, friendly, and fast. We were able to find a table and sit and talk for a while without anyone bothering us. The only thing is that I wish they had more seating and more comfortable seating. Other than that our experience was great. I'm definitely coming back for a baguette.
