I had a stupid smile on my face the whole time. I was in awe. How could something as simple as water and music be so beautiful? There's just something so exciting about the way the water shoots into the sky and softly falls into the pool of revolving water... Very simple, the fountains are beautiful, the music is beautiful,  life is beautiful! ......and it's free.
