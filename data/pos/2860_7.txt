Stephanie was our waitress and she was fantastic. She had such a warm bubbly personality. And she hit the perfect balance of being friendly yet leaving us alone. \n\nDinner for 3 was under $30. $33 with tip. \n\nThe BBQ chicken pizza was fabulous. Thin crust that could hold up the toppings. \n\nThe house garlic fries had just the right amount of salt and garlic. \n\nThe sriracha burger was delicious but a total mess to eat. \n\nI wasn't thrilled with the decor - Formica tables and TVs everywhere. But the food and service makes up for the decor.
