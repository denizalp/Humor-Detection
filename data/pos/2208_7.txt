Found Flict on Yelp about 6 months back.  It's been great ever since.  The staff is really nice.\n\nI come here every two weeks to get a haircut from Brandi.  She somehow got me a hipster haircut that was okay for my corporate job.\n\nFinally decided to put in a review.  I was stuck in Austria for work for over 6 weeks.  I love my hair and trying to get a haircut and only knowing enough German to order food was daunting.\n\nFirst thing I did after coming back was seeing Brandi for a cut!
