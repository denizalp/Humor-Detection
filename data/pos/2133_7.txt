No menu substitutions. Poor customer satisfaction. After waiting in line for 15 minutes while deciphering the non-descriptive menu, we get to the front of the line to ask some questions about substituting a regular crepe with a buckwheat crepe. We also wanted to add some turkey to our meal. We were told no for any substitutions and were met with no solution for someone who wanted a gluten free option. Unacceptable! We left frustrated and hungry. What ever happened to satisfying your customers. No substitutions?!?! Really!?
