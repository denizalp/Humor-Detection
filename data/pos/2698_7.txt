If I had a buck every time someone mentioned their fries, this lunch would have paid for itself. This is a straight-forward 50's inspired diner. Nothing more, nothing less. Surprisingly, the place was pretty empty at lunch hour and I was assigned my own table near the back of the place. I had a cheeseburger, which was large and filling, but..nothing earth-shattering. Full disclosure: I'm not a burger connoiseur. The bread was regular store-bought bread, and the patty was.. round? How do I deal with that? The helping of Suzy Q. fries was generous, but they were soggy! Meh.
