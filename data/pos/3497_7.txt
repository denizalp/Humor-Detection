The fish was very fishy. The orders were thrown together. The rice was a mushy paste. Our Japanese lasagna was cold.\n\nI will not come back here ever again. The quality was just horrible. The servers just did not care what they presented us. \n\nBad service, bad food, bad quality. \n\nYou will never get me to return.\n\nUpdate: I have diarrhea and tummy pains.
