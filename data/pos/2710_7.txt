Definitely can skip this place. There are far better restaurants at the Wynn.\n\nWe ended up here because Wazuzu was full for the night. Options were limited this late so we settled on Red 8.\n\n Nothing was terrible but nothing memorable either.\nThe soup dumplings were a hard pass and made me long for din tai fung.\n\nThe soup was passable but again, nothing I'm longing for.\n\n\nI would recommend trying Wazuzu or Wing Lei.
