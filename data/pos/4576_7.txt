Not sure why this has such great ratings.\n\nI don't see people inside at all whenever I pass by and when I went to try it out, it was my friend, me and 1 other customer. The portion for the salmon was so little and when I went, I had to wait an extra 15 minutes... and for what? Just for someone to chop up little pieces of my salmon? It doesn't take 15 minutes. I was late for work lol.\n\nIt's great for when it's your last choice... but save your money and go to rolltation.
