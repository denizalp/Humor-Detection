This is a lovely place. It's clean and the atmosphere is inviting. They have a good customer service. There is a huge selection of drinks (juices and smoothies).Their juices are very fresh and delicious. You can try different kinds and listen to the explanation of the health benefits of each ingredient. And then you can buy the one you prefer.\nThe only \"bad\" thing is that it's a little expensive and you can't afford it very often...
