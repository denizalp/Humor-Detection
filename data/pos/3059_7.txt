Five words: Milk Chocolate Pretzel Crunch Bar.\n\nTwo more words: Yes, please.\n\nExplosion of happiness in my mouth... err um. Okay awkward.\n\nJust imagine that Pharrell, \"Happy\" song in an edible chocolate bar form. \n\nThe other chocolates I've tried here are yummy too but the milk chocolate pretzel crunch bar is everything. \n\nThey also have it in a mega size which I would recommend if you want, as Wilford Brimley calls it, diabeetus. \n\nWorth it.
