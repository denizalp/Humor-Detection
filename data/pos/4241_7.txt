I thought this show was OK. I think there were a little too many disappearing from a box acts, made it kind of repetitive. Nathan Burton's show is better in my opinion. Dirk Arthur's has tigers though, if that's your interest. Worth checking out if you got nothing better to do during the afternoon.
