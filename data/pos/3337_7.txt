Love their Kitchen and Food, Bed & Bath, & Decorating & Accessories items, ok maybe everything they offer.  I love my redish with black accents dinner set.  Had to get all the serving dishes too.  Love the stainless steel pots, I need to get another one soon.  And the cast iron dutchoven.  Love my Marimekko bath towels (blue\/green circles).  Their reversible green bath towels are my favorite.  Wish my backyard is done soon, so I can add patio furniture.  Yes, the prices are a bit high but just love their stuff.
