What a great find! It was a snowy Sunday afternoon and we haven't had lunch. Yelp correctly told us that this Peruvian place is open throughout the afternoon. The place is cozy with lots of Incan decorations. We tried the Jalea, which is a dish of lightly battered and fried calamari\/shrimps\/fish, topped with some fresh onions. Squeeze some lim√≥n on top and it was so delicious. The stuffed potato was filled with ground beef, olives and an egg yolk, tasty as well. I would definitively come back to try some of their other dishes in the future.
