Very clean place and has a ton of different options to get. The first time I was there I got gnocchi and pound cake. The lady I talked to must have been new because she told me to bake them in the oven? Yeah...no. The next time I went I asked the lady (different) one and she said that you boil them,which was what I assumed. Very nice helpful staff. And tasty food!
