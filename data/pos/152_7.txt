The service call was because neither remote control was working.  This fixed, the technician suggested he install new nylon rollers to replace the metal ones, that these new ones would last much longer and the metal ones were wearing out.  I wondered outloud whether this was the reason the operation of the door is always so loud (even when properly lubricated).  The technician told me, yes, the door would be quieter after the new installation.  $119.40 later the door sounds exactly the same.  \n\nI was up-sold unnecessarily and, therefore, have been taken.
