Unfortunately, this place is closed because the shopping center has been sold, who were also the owners of the theaters.  The place was always great to go to, the concessions were always cheap, and there was always a radio station in the waiting room as well.  The theater is also in a great location and for a night of fun, you could go next door to the Pinball Museum.  I hope they reopen soon, as they really knew how to run the place.
