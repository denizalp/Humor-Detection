Jalapeno pale ale....maybe a little crazy....but so good. I have been going to Birdsong since they first opened. I have always enjoyed their Free Will. They have made a couple new brews as of late that I sampled and all are really good. I love that they are right across the way from Noda Brewery and tend to always go to both of them during my visits. I love the games and the free peanuts. For the quality of the beer, I feel the prices are really good. Hoping to see some additional brews in the future.
