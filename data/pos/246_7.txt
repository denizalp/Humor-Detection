I sure hope my trainer Bill Crawford at Basic Training doesn't follow my reviews!  I know I shouldn't be eating Bundt  Cakes but I don't care!  These cakes are so moist and scrumptious there is nothing like them!  I recently had the blueberry one and it was really tasty.  My favorite is red velvet it is rich and has cream cheesy icing on top. Seriously, if you need to impress, thank or present someone with the best cake ever...this is the place!   I wish I had a wedge now!
