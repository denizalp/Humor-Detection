I don't remember the last time I received such horrible customer service. The older gentleman (and I use that term loosely) was downright rude and not helpful in answering routine questions. I typically avoid self-service kiosks, but that would have been a much more pleasant experience...Then again, so would spraying lemon juice in my eye and trying to rub it out with a serrano pepper! Go out of your way to avoid this establishment or take your business to another carrier if possible.
