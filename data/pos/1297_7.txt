Our first time here and we had the chicken wrap, The Santa Fe cheeseburger and the chicken sandwich which were all equally delicious. Mike our server was very attentive and cordial. Their lunch menu on the weekends is really great as they have nine item for nine dollars with a lot of great selections to choose from and then another mini lunch menu that also was quite diversified.   Are no shortage of options and just really great atmosphere and food
