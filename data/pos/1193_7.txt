I'm a bit of a pizza noob. So when my friend suggested it I didn't know what to expect. Ordered the Njuda Sausage pizza and the Gorgonzola one and goodness, that sausage one is spicy! But Gorgonzola perfection was fantastic. I couldn't leave it alone! \n\nThrow in a bottle of champagne, some girly gossip and perfect ambient noise in the background and you've got a perfect Tuesday night. Yes. A bottle of champagne in a Tuesday :)
