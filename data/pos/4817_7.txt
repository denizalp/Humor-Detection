I guess if you live in this area you deserve this uninspired mediocre sportsbar.   The Chefs Swanson, and Stouffer will nuke you up something nice to go with your choice of domestic brew.  After that satisfying meal and refreshing Molson product you can take your chances with any of their three midway like games.  \n\nOverall I'd describe this place as a post apocalyptic Dave and Busters.
