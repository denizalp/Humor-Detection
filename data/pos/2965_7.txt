Hey this place look nice. But the place is a shithole.\nService department sucks. You have to talk to a manager to understand whats going on to your bike. and they have my bike for 5 days. Still can fix the f..... problem. If my bike is not under warranty. I wouldn't come here....this is after I spend $2300.\nSo if you need to get your bike fix or service it, and then I recommend you take it somewhere else.
