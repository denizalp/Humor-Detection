The positive hype is definitely about a local owned and run pizza shop that has great service, great food, and a clean establishment.\n\nI had the chicken pizza which was fantastic. It was followed up with Zeppolis that were beyond explainable. I have been searching for this dish for years and haven't found anyplace that could make them as wonderful as Biaggios. They were fantastic to say the least.\n\nI appreciate great service and great food, thank you Biaggio. It is nice to see owners take pride in their establishment and engage with their clients.
