My boyfriend and I broke up because he would come home everyday freak out, yell or be violent because his day was so stressful. It got to the point that if I said anything or disagreed with anything he would say \"My job is so stressful, I'm drowning\" etc. etc. If you guys make a call center sales job that unbearable then you need different management.
