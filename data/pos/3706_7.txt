This is a nice little aquarium located right at the flats district. It's the only one of it's kind in Cleveland. As far as aquariums go though, this is not at par with the likes of the New England Aquarium. Think Mandalay Bay hotel aquarium in Las Vegas, which is similar in size.\n\nI echo the sentiments of most reviewers regarding cost and the flats still looking shady. Overall, I think it is an impressive effort, I love it, would love to see it going and would be more than glad to support it.
