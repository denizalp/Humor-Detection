I must say...these guys know how to pamper! I booked in to have my haircut with Thomas (sr stylist) and I got the full treatment!! Consultation, scalp massage, wash n cut, style and after make up touch up! They also know how to up sell!! Suggesting products that they have used on you. My haircut was $75... But I guess you could say.. You get what you pay for!!
