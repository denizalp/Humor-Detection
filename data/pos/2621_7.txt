This store is so nasty and dirty. Merchandise on the floor and the floor behind the cashiers looked like they had not swept in months. The Manager looked like the store, dirty and not good with his hygiene. 1st and last time I go in there. Oh and I was there at 10am. Never again. I will tell my friends and family not to shop there.
