I bought a Naturepedic baby mattress from ToysRUs and paid shipping fee, without knowing this organic mattress manufacturer is 20 minuets away from home! Mattress has lifetime warranty as long as you remain the ownership.\n\nSo when my toddler outgrew the crib, I bought a full size mattress directly from the chagrin falls headquarters. I expect her to take it with her to college. You do have to move the mattress yourself to the car.... and it's super heavy!
