Although I prefer going to the Las Vegas North Premium Oulets, we come here from time to time especially during the warm weather.\n\nThe outlet is designed like an indoor mall with stores from end to end. You have several entrances throughout the outlet and a food court in the middle. There are also shops and restaurants surrounding the outlet. \n\nThey have all of the typical outlet stores here like Nike, Adidas, Micheal Kors and other independent stores so you should be able to fulfill your shopping needs.
