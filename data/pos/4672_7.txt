In a rush? This is your place for quick and tasty wonton!\n\nI've been coming here for years as the wonton is so delicious, massive (lots of shrimp!) and very reasonably priced. \n\nTheir wontons are clearly their specialty however you can opt for beef balls, fish balls, etc. You can also choose to have egg noodles, vermicelli, rice noodles with your soup or none at all! \n\nIt gets very busy around lunch time so sometimes they ask if you mind sharing a table to accommodate all guests.\n\nTea and water is also self-served at the back.
