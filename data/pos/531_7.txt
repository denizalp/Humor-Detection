The crepes are served luke warm at best. They make the crepes \"fresh\" but they are not hot cooked to order. Instead they batch cook the crepes...stack them so they are cooling off. You order your special crepe and they assemble it. All ingredants are cold or precooked. They throw them in the premade cold crepe and kinda warm it on the griddle but not reallllly.
