Over-priced veggies, they have a shelf outside where they display rotten veggies and fruits for sale, for example, they have a package with four apples for a dollar, but three of the apples are rotten, so only one item is edible and the rest is ready for the garbage,  and at the end it is more expensive than buying the already over-priced stuff they have inside.The Asian women at the cash are rude, donÂ´t even bother to say \"Thank you\" and they will never, ever give you a plastic bag even if you buy a million bucks in groceries
