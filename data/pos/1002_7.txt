Everything looks much better than it tastes. This place is \"meh\" at best. I recommend loading up on mimosas prior to braving MGM's buffet (if you're compelled to eat here like I was, because it was bundled in the price of your room.... Or if you're involved in some kind of Fear Factor dare). \n\nStay away from the eggs, taquitos, fish, and pretty little single-serving desserts! I'm not sure if I'll be able to get up from my chair... It feels like I consumed a hockey puck... Made of lead... Ugh...
