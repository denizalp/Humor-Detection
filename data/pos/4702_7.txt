I had an senior neighbor call me in a panic that his kitchen was flooding and needed help.  I had seen the absolute flood trucks in my neighborhood before so I called them for my friend.  Within 30 mins they arrived, stopped the flood and began clean up.  They cleaned up the mess, dried out the kitchen and within a week the kitchen was brand new again and they took care of the insurance claim painlessly.  I'm putting these guys on speed dial!
