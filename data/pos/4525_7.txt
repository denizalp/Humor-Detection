This place has a lot of things but other stores don't carry. The guy at the counter is very knowledgeable and helpful. But be careful about the return policy to try to get out of doing any returns and make you eat the price. Often I'll get a few extra things just in case I might need them and return them after the job but in this case it really cost me.
