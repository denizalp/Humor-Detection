Is it shallow of me to fancy myself a local in Paris whenever I'm in here?\n\nThe successor of what used to be \"Wild Things\", Chabichou is an adorable cheese shop that is still hanging out despite the closures of several establishments in that same spot in previous years. A plentiful selection of cheeses, a round of regulars swinging by for soup-on-the-go, and a charming and verrrryyy French young gentleman serving up samples keep me coming back for more. You can even order gourmet grilled cheeses to enjoy on the picnic table outside. \n\nCheese heals the world!
