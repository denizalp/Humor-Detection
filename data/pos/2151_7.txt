We thought this place would be an authentic Italian type pizzeria, however the pizza had too much dough to the toppings and sauce ratio . The taste of the dough was good, however too overwhelming, it just tasted like bread, with a little flavour. We also tried the \"roast beef dip\" ... the dip was terribly salty.. and the beef was just heated up cold-cuts from the package. Overall, definitely better pizza out there.... and do not try the roast beef dip.
