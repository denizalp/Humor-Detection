I am suspicious that they replaced my stained carpet with brand new carpet while I was running an errand but I have no proof of said accusation other than the seemingly brand new carpet in my home. A search of their truck and the surrounding areas was fruitless ;-)\n\nAside from the quality of their work. I was greeted by two employees Rick and Dante. Both had a similar polite hardworking disposition. I couldn't be more satisfied with the work and the excellent customer service.
