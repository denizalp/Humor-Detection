***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 22\/100***\n\nThis is my quick getaway on days that I run out of time to get coffee somewhere else or forget to bring water. It's walking distance from the office so it's very convenient. They have your usual suspects: Coffee, donuts\/muffins, groceries, alcohol and of course what would Vegas be without your slot machines in every corner? Staff is very friendly and accommodating, the owner is also on site for most part, so it's very well kept.
