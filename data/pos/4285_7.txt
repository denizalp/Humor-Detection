they lost some money today came in with 110k to see a specific car, wearing day off t shirt and jeans. I ask to see the car but they says I can only see it on Saturday because its in the back in the museum lol, angie suggest  that they have cheaper cars 20k thunderbird. don't judge a book by its cover I didn't come to see a 20k car or a ford.
