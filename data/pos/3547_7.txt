I've been to this threading salon on two occasions and left satisfied both times... \n\nThe ladies who work here are friendly and really great at their trade.  They are meticulous with getting every last hair, shaping those brows perfectly, etc... and pricing is more than fair.  The place is clean too.\n\nThe only negative is that if you walk-in, there's no guarantee you won't have to wait.  Regardless, it's worth the wait and I'll look forward to returning when I'm ready to clean up those brows once again!
