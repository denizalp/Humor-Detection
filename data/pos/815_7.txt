Kelly's is a landmark, an institution, and a standby place to meet. The attraction is the owners' commitment to a recreate a nostalgic, magical classic bar with great drinks, good beer, and excellent bar food. \n\nPeople rave about the Mac 'n' Cheese, and yes you should order it. \n\nSome week nights feature vinyl DJ's. The vibe is generally hip and the drinks are strong.
