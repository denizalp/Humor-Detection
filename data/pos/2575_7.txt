I have been going to this location for a few years now, (used to have a 96 Honda Accord) and yea no likes going to the ADEQ Vehicle Emission Station  But this location is always pretty fast, most I have waited is about 10 minutes, and MVD is right next door, so kill 2 birds with one stone I say!\n\nService is friendly and tries to keep everything moving orderly, I'm sure if I have the same car I'll be back in 2 more years haha.
