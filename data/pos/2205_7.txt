Came here on a Tuesday night with a friend and we were the only people dining at 7pm. The butter chicken and the beef korma were both pretty tasty but nothing to rave about. The service was pretty on point- always checking on us and refilling water. \n\nPluses: \n- free popadoms\n- heated serving bowls\n\nNegatives: \n-terrible wine
