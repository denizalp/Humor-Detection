Ordered children food it all came spicy... We are staying in the penthouse I am not impressed by this experience.\nI am not supporting trump in anyway during this presidential election, friends are staying here. \nThe service here is so kind, super super kind. \nLovely service... \nFix the children's menu to ensure zero spice. \nThank you.
