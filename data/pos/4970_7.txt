Their grilled chicken salad tasted awful good with ranch dressing late Saturday night and therefore granted me respite after an epic, trying day of adventure and misadventure. Eat 'n Park rarely lets me down. The Smiley Cookie is a beacon during the twilight hours, acting as a guardian spirit for lost souls like you and me, providing sanctuary as well as decent food at a decent price.
