Love this place. Your brows are in good hands with these ladies. I've been transitioning, growing out, and reshaping my brows and am very pleased with the results. $8 dollars well spent! \n\nThe location is convenient, the salon is clean, and the girls are as nice as they are skilled. I really appreciate how they dont rush, they take their time to do a good job and get the job done right. I also like how they really listen to you and what you want. Highly recommended.
