If only it were closer but it's well worth the drive.  It's tucked away in a plaza in Cave Creek.  The interior is very geriatric but the food is amazing!  \n\nWe split a sausage pizza and I can't remember the last time I had sausage that fresh!  Yummy!  Everything is made from scratch so you don't have that bloated feeling after you devour half a pizza packed with preservatives.\n\nNext time I will try the tasty desserts that were staring me down as I left.
