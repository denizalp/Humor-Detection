Excellent synchronized dancing waters.  \n\nThey play every 15 minutes, and it's a different musical score every time.  It's great to watch the water at play, and to see in it echoes of the Busby Berkeley girls.  OK, it's computer-driven, but the water pumps are huge.  There's an impressively big BOOM that comes out of the pumps when a tall wall effect is called for in the \"choreography.\"
