I'm a big fan of the California Sandwiches chain and this location in particular. It's very clean, modern with decent parking. \n\nAll the sandwiches are massive so if you're not that hungry, you may want to look at the smaller sized offerings. \n\nI've tried the chicken, eggplant and of course their famous veal. All are perfectly seasoned, fried fresh to order and come with the tangy, delicious tomato sauce. I normally only add their saut√©ed onions, but they do have several choices to personalize your sandwich.
