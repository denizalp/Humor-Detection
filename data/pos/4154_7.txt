I have disputed the charge to my credit card.  This was a strong arm robbery.  Terrible Food.  Long Lines.  Most vendors not accepting the coupons.  When I engaged the vendors why they weren't accepting the coupons they said Glendale was not reimbursing them for the coupons.\n\nNot only will I get re-imbursed for my purchase - I'll also not be moving to Glendale - I'm in the process of moving and Glendale was once on my list - no longer.
