Excellent Hotel. 5 Stars.\n\nThe rooms are incredible with stainless steel appliances such as refrigerator, microwave, stove, oven, dishwasher, and sink. \nBeds are very very comfortable.\nCustomer Service is extraordinary.\nIndoor\/outdoor pool is heated and the pool area is super clean.\nBreakfast is great.\nPrice is affordable.\nGreat for children given the Hotel is in Vegas. \nValet service.\nClose to the strip but far enough away where it's relaxing.\nCasino next door at Ellis Island and the heart of the vegas strip is just a short block away. \nAirport is close by with shuttle service.\n\nI will definitely be back. Hidden gem in Las Vegas!
