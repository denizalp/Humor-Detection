I found this little gem while killing time waiting to meet my girlfriend.  It's very spacious, with a few table's, a sofa and very nice music.  The perfect place to kill time.....while sampling tasty gelato of course.  They have many flavors to choose from being either fruit or cream based.  They have cones, not homemade but they are working on offering a homemade waffle cone.  I settled on the Dulce and maple waffle which was really good, but so were the other flavors, check it out if you're in the Matthews area.
