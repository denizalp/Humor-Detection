I'm always really happy with my deliveries that come from Metro. We love their pizza and their small size is perfect for two people. They have great wings and delicious cannoli too. I have tried their salads and am always left indifferent about them so that is not something I order.\n\nTheir deliveries are quick and the food is always hot. Ask about their football specials, they usually have a buy one get one 50% off!
