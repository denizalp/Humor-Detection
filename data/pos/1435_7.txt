I feel like James Franco in 11\/22\/63 when I walk through the doors to this joint. If you like cigars and old antique shit, you will pop a boner when you walk through the doors. Smoke cigars, drink fine whisky  (or beer, or wine) and take a load off in this kick ass establishment. I don't know about the food they serve, didn't eat any. If they served dog turds covered in cheese whiz I would still fuck with this place heavy.
