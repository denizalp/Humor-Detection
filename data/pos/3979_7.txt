I went to this office for the first time, and WOW! The office is up to date, very nice and clean! The staff was super friendly (they all had great teeth!) and I felt very welcome. It has a spa type of feeling. The hygienist cleaned my teeth better than I have ever had done, and Dr Condie was very helpful in explaining the treatment I need. Thank you Clara for all your help! Will be back for sure!
