Kudos to CDC pools. We remodeled our pool and turned out great!  The process was simple and the employees cleaned after themselves. We were out of town during  part of the construction and they communicated with us all the time. Today, they added the last set of chemicals and turned the pool over to us. Great job guys keep it up.
