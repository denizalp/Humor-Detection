Typical casino bar in the middle of the floor. This one has a super cool 3D ceiling that keeps things a little interesting though. It's the first bar you encounter here, visible from the entry, and frequently gets crowded. There aren't too many seats around the perimeter but they recently added a small lounge area with additional comfortable and stylish seating.\n\nPersonally, for about the same price, I'd rather venture further into the casino to Monkey Bar and get some ambiance and live jazz with my alcohol.
