This isn't a Renaissance Festival, its a flea market where people dress up.\n\nREAL Renaissance Festivals at least TRY to be historically acurate.  They don't mix centuries of dress, continents, etc.  They don't have guilds of people in body paint acting like amature bdsm wannabes.  \n\nIts expensive, (to eat and drink all day. Admission isn't much) and the entertainment is laughable. \n\nIf you want to go to a REAL ren faire, save up  a little extra money and go to the Southern California Ren Faire.
