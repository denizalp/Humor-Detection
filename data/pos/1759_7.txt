I hate to admit it but I watch the Silly Kardashian shows and was sort of excited to go in. These ladies are fashion icons so I thought they would at least have more clothes from their new line. I walked into the store and felt very underwhelmed. A few key chains, make up pallets, cards and books. The workers played with yo-yos while we looked around which took all of about 3 min to realize everything is overpriced. I hope they re-do it and bring clothes in.
