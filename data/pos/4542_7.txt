Cool cafe that overlooks the pool. Perfect for brunch, they serve breakfast all day, you just have to ask. Also if you're vegetarian they have a whole separate menu for you as well. \n\nI came here twice in one weekend. Sampled a bunch of stuff and was happy with everything, here's what I recommend: \n-Belgian waffle with strawberries\n-Chicken and waffles\n-Omelets\/eggs\/ the breakfast special \n\nThe only major, major tip I have is do not sit in the sun. It will burn even with the misters they have
