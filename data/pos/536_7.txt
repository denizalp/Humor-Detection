Bagels in Toronto are so disappointing and this place is exemplary of the mediocre nature of big uninteresting bagels.  More like bread in a donut form factor, the bagels here lack the  chewiness on the inside, and a defined crust.  Flavour...totally lacking.  Will never return.\n\nHead south and get real bagels from Gryfe's.
