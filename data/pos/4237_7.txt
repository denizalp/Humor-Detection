Don't bother. Your time will be wasted, literally. It's not even worth it. Rude owners. I stood behind the counter for more than ten minutes. I just left the groceries on the counter and left. The owner was right there the whole time and didn't acknowledge his customers that we're waiting in line. He just kept cleaning and fixing things around the store. One customer even said something. He still didn't bother to look up or hear us. Really?
