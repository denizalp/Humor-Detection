What a concept...a centralized rental car location which is home to 11 of the top car rental companies.  A speedy shuttle bus from McCarran Airport takes you to the remote location to pick up your vehicle.  No longer do you have to wait in line at the airport to take care of your paperwork.  Instead, the wait is taken offsite.   Located a few miles south of the end of the Strip, it's easy to remember how to get there...no need to be confused by the airport signs.  My only gripe, it's not AT the airport.
