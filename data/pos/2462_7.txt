Came here for some after dinner drinks on a Saturday night with some friends. I've been here before for dinner and it wasn't bad and we were in the neighborhood already so we figured we'd stop for some drinks. \n\nBased on their recs I tried the ADC-not my favorite unfortunately. I much preferred the Mason Mule...mmm ginger beer. \n\nService was a little slow for just drinks. It almost seemed like the waitress didn't want to serve us since we were only ordering drinks. \n\nMight come back to try dinner again and to try the Ruben ribs.
