Having a 14 year old Son means a lot of trips to Fast Food joints and this one is in our neighborhood.  This one is not one of our favorite joints.  The food quality here is sub-par....even by fast food standards.  The Beef never tastes fresh and the Bread seems a little old at times.\n\nWe decided we wouldn't eat here anymore because it's that bad.  There are 1000's of other fast food joints to choose from.
