My God. Those are damn good macaroons. \n\nI stopped here today to see what Gimme Some Sugar had and I just couldn't stop myself from buying 4...but was told if I bought 6, I'd get $0.50 off each macaroon. OK! - I'll take 6 then. AND I got a dollar off for visiting the first time and checking in on Yelp. - Thanks Yelp!  \n\n$21 later I'm driving home and wondering how I'm going to eat all these ginormous King Kong sized macaroons... \n\nI'm going to try my best, dammit!
