Came here (Friends invited me to visit their daybed) last weekend. Several visits to EBC and it has always felt the same. Super rediculously over priced for guys, terrible ratios as it seemed like literally every single attractive girl in the place was crowded by men. Gaming pavilion was ok, pool was average and overall another disappointing experience. This is def a place guys can and should go GA as I saw most of the real estate was full of guys with alcohol who were trying to give it away and couldn't! There were not enough girls....
