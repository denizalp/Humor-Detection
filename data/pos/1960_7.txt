Look no further - this will be your new \"go to\" spot!!\n\nPercy Waters is my favourite flower shop!  Their flowers and other products are insanely beautiful and always a great price.  The location is convenient and easy to get to, nestled in one of the most interesting parts of the Danforth. The staff really knows what they are talking about and display a great amount of pride in their arrangements and their shop.\n\nGo check them out!  You won't be disappointed.
