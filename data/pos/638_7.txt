Came here for breakfast and tried their famous \"Slut\" - a coddled (i.e. barely cooked, similar to poached) egg served over mashed potatoes, chives, and sea salt.  I expected the yolk to be a bit runnier, but it looks like they maybe overdid it.  The potatoes were not at creamy as I'd like - a little on the granular side.  Its a decent lighter snack, but overall didn't wow me too much.  Maybe its better to stick with their breakfast sandwiches.\n\nTheir cold brew coffee was okay, though on the pricier side at $5.
