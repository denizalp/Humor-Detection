Stopped in for a late lunch.  Nice new place with a friendly bartender.  Service was good. It was not real crowded due to the late lunch time.   There is a wood fired pizza oven in the corner.  I had the Italian panini that has soppressata, salami and prosciutto along with some pepper relish, lettuce and tomato.  Enjoyed my meal.  Will have to stop back and try a pizza.
