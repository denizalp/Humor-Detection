Have been in their parking lot many times in recent months, but never gone in to check out their booths.  I should clarify - I play Ingress and there is a portal in their parking lot. :)  Anyway, today we went in and were pleased with the variety of booths full of nostalgic items and antiques.  They also have a restaurant inside, but we were there closer to closing and it had already closed up.  We will definitely be back for more shopping and we'll have to try out the food.
