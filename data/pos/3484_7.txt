What a joke this place was!!! I worked two \"temp to perm\" assignments with them, in which both assignments ended after 1 year with a very unprofessional lay off. My paycheck was never on time, hard to get ahold of anyone when I had a question, and they handled situations in a very unprofessional manner! Stay away!!!
