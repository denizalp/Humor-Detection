I'm a fan of Sam's Club and this was the first time I've been to this one.  I stopped in to pick up some vitamins and supplements.\n\nIt is a very clean location and a customer with 1000 items was kind enough to let me go ahead of her since I only had 4 items I was carrying in my hands.....you don't see kindness like that too often anymore.\n\nWill I return?  Only if I'm in the neighborhood, which is rarely.
