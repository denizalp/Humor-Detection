Kind of average \n\nI visited Rolandos based on all of the positive yelp reviews. The service was very good however, I thought the food was just okay.\n\nOn this visit we had the Carne Asada Burrito and 3 rolled tacos with guacamole.  The burrito was full of meat and was flavorful, but it just wasn't anything special. The tree rolled taco, once again were good but nothing special. \n\nI will revisit soon and try other menu items, but this visit was just kind of average.
