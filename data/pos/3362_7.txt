DO NOT USE THIS DOCTOR.\n\nDr. DeRosa's billing practices are wrong.  My wife went to see her for a well visit, which is covered without co-pay by my insurance.  DeRosa mis-coded the visit in order to collect additional fees from us and maybe the insurance company.  When confronted, they told us they would refund the co-pay and after repeated requests, refused to send the refund.\n\nSTAY CLEAR OF THIS PRACTICE.
