Today was my second breakfast trip and I have also been for lunch. First time was with a large party. This time was right at opening. Each time the food has been good, as has the service. Today the garage doors were up so plenty of fall cool air. When the place is full it can get pretty noisy. Definitely a place I will go back to and continue to recommend.
