This place is very tasty and the service is always friendly.  The prices aren't bad, either.\n\nThe downside is that the owner's son fancies himself a musician, so if you go there on the wrong night, you're treated to some pretty middling live music.  It's nice that they are supportive of him, but sometimes I just want to eat pizza and have a conversation with my friends.  If the band is playing or setting up, you might wanna consider getting your pizza to go.
