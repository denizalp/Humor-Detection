I love this location; it's easy to get to and they are super friendly. My car is going on 7 years now with 140k miles on it. I never had any problems with it so I plan on keeping it for while longer. \nI recently bought another Mercedes so between the two cars I'm here frequently. \nMy service guy, Ken Lamb is great. He's always available when I have concerns or questions. I'd recommend him to anyone.
