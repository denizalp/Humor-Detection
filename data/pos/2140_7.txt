My friends and I usually go here after hiking. Or for lunch. \n\nIf you like to eat a beautifully flavored sandwich with a extremely refreshing Sonoran White Ale, then this is the place for you. \n\nThe atmosphere is like a quiet house. Though the outside is refreshing, going inside the house feels like you've been invited to your decently wealthy uncle's house for a bite to eat. \n\nI got the BLT this time and the bacon is thick cut, smokey and crunchy with a slight chew. In other words, perfection.
