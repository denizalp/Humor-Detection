The cauliflower buffalo bites are delicious. Ordered them each time we've come and they really are tasty. Did NOT care for the humus plate, it wasn't tasty or creamy. It was more like peanut butter consistency, rather than creamy. The happy hour specials are decent. Decent portions, decent prices. Definitely get the cauliflower bites, those are delicious.
