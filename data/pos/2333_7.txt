This company is a virtual douchecano from product to service.\n\nRandom fee increases, random charges, wrong box delivered, slow customer service (if you want to call it service)...and my favorite is the last time I called for a refund of a mistaken charge they put me on hold for a half hour and then tried to up-sell me instead of refunding their mistake...\n\nSounds more like their business plan than a mistake.\n\nWorst part:\n\nSLOW ASS INTERNET. Like they are running a digital pony express with every one and every zero delivered on horseback.
