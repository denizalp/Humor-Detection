Take out - No dine in - Friendly staff - Very good Pizza, better than most!  Fast, fast, fast service, great quality, great taste!  Ate here (in there parking lot) Sunday night!\n\nI'm almost sure the Cheese they use is 100% Mozzarella (instead of a blend) I am a Fan of this Pizza with EASE!  If they were located closer to me I would be getting more Pizza from them vs Fuel!
