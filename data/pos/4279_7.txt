Convenient, but small location located off of the freeway.\n\nStopped into B&BW to take advantage of their wallflowers that were on sale and made a small haul. The staff was welcoming and tried showing me some of their favorite scents. They have a wide variety and was glad they placed candles as scent testers, so shoppers don't have to fumble around opening the wallflowers.\n\nStore was very clean and organized, a bit small however. Parking is ample and service was lovely!
