I am a Chinese and I have been to many Dim Sum places in the States. I don't even remember a dim sum restaurant being bad until I came here. \nThe sweet pork buns\/rice cakes were okay. Everything else is horrible. So horrible that we only had one bite of three of the six plates and didn't want anymore. With tapioca duck egg, and beef balls we even spit out the first bite. Ugh.\nA waste of money.
