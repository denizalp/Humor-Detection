A friend of mine introduced me to Sparklings not to long ago. I must say everyone there is extremely friendly and so down to earth. A Very attractive atmosphere. The menu is the bomb.com!! I live in Henderson and it's worth the drive at least once a week. To Jos√©, Char, Andy, Rey and Anthony... thanks for making every visit so pleasant!! \n\nMuah\nMzMj\nFIREBALL queen
