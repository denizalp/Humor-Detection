Small Town Diner.\n\nGood home cooking.Simple as can be.\n\nSeat yourself-1 sided menu and fast & friendly servers.\n\nAccording to TripAdvisor they have the BESt burger in Nevada! \n\nI've been here before & I still stick to the fact that its a frozen patty-nothing special.\n\nHowever the BBQ Beef & Pastrami on Rye are Fantastic sandwiches.\n\nTHIS place is for you if you are looking for Great prices and great sandwiches.
