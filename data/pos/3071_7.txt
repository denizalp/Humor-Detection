Worst casino I have ever had the displeasure of stepping foot in. Extremely rude and curt staff. Classless and low brow  clientele. Very filthy and unkept place all together. I understand its not the Bellagio, but clean SOMETHING every once in a while, please. Would never ever even CONSIDER stepping foot in this toilet of a casino ever again.
