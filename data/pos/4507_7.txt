If you have eagle eyes then you can spot this American Eagle in my picture.\n\nI like it better than Abercrombie although I'm not sure why. I haven't worn stuff from them for a while now, but I still pop in here when I'm Dragged In Here. Me and my Ohio girl checked out this whole mall and this was one of her favorite stores.\n\nThe employees are always nice, but I don't like the clothes here. They're expensive and pretty boring.
