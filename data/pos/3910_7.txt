For the mother of a toddler, I probably still live that hipster Toronto life a little too hard. Every few weeks when it's #momsnightout, and by that I mean I go out with my besties who don't yet have fresh little nuggets ruling their lives, Camp 4 tends to end up on the bar crawl list. \n\nIt's not offensive, the music is OK, there is usually seating and the bartenders are nice. For better or worse it's exactly what you'd expect along this stretch of Dundas W and I'm into it.
