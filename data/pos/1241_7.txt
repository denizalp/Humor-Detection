My first bite was savory and sweet, my second bite was crunchy and soft, my last bite was heavenly. I never thought that such a simple pastry could make my belly so happy. After all, the place is named after the kouign-amann itself. Pair this in the morning with a warm cup of coffee and you're up for a good day. The service is friendly and quick, something expected from a well established bakery. \n\nFor the cheap price, a kouign-amann should be sitting in your stomach at least once a week for optimal happiness.
