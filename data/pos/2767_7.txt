I love Dr. Deka, but could never get in to see anyone but her nurse practitioner, who missed some pretty simple things.  Sent me to two different specialists for 2 separate problems, both stated my gyn should have known what this was.  They never sent copies of my tests to specialists despite my calls and never reported back to me with test results.  Waste of time, sad I won't be seeing Dr. Deka but relieved I never need to see her nurse practitioner again!
