What?????  Moonstruck is closed?????????  That was my favorite date place ever!  Their vanilla icecream sundaes with chocolate fudge are to die for... no joke!!  I will never find a place that even comes close to how amazing their sundaes are when I'm on my cute lil dates with my boyfriend.  I never want to go on another date again =(
