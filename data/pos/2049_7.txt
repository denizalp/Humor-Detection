Let me say I am not very impressed. My meat had alright flavor, but had texture like a shoe! I love the cucumber dressing that comes on the gyro, I'll admit to eating a little with the help of a spoon. This place's dressing had no flavor. It tasted like plain yogurt with a couple slivers of cucumber. No thanx, I ended up eating the meat alone with hot sauce!!!!! Thank God for hot sauce or I would starve sometimes!!!!
