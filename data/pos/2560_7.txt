This place is gross! I will never come here again! Not authentic! The food had no flavor! Whomever says this place has spicy food has never eaten chilli!! Not a fan of the New Mexican style food! \n\nI do give them the one star for their margaritas!!! Yummy! \n\nNo bueno for the food and I've had it about three times already! Always disapointed!!!
