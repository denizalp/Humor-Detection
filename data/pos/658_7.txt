I dropped off my car on Friday with a bad alternator.  I would fix it myself, but I had family in town and didn't feel like running around all weekend long trying to get it fixed.  They called when my wife was near the cell and I wasn't.  She said OK to a 580 bill to fix it with tax.  The part is only 130 online and 225 at O'Reilly Auto.  I just can't believe how expensive they where.  They are nice guys but be ready to pay up.
