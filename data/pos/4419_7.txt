While its a very small cafeteria (almost a cafe), the food here is excellent.  Recently had 10 meals here due to a friend in the hospital.  The staff is friendly, and its never too crowded.  Food has good variety (they change the menu every day), but given its size, its usually a limited selection.  BEST FOOD IN A HOSPITAL CAFETERIA I have ever been to!
