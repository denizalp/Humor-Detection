This Wal-Mart is so terrible. The lines (including the fast checkout) are regularly wrapped all the way back to the clothing section. I seem to almost always get nearly trampled when I stop here, even despite the cane (hello, people!). The cashiers are robots, the selection is meager, and the bathroom is disgusting.\n\nThe good thing, though, is that the old crafts sales lady lets me cut the ribbon by 1\/2 yard instead of a full yard. I make my cat handmade collars, and I don't need a whole yard. :)
