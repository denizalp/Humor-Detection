Costco is a magical place,  it's like if the Dollar Store and Walmart had a baby - a beautiful big baby. This Costco is the best one in Montreal, everything is clean and items are in order. \n\nConcerning the food, it is hands down the best ice cream - it puts Dairy Queen's cream to shame. The pizza is not so great. I would advise taking the hot which comes with a drink for $1.50 and add a poutine to that. One of the cheapest eats you can get, and you don't need to be a member.
