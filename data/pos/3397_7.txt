I've been to Azuza on a couple of occasions and have to say I'm a fan. They offer a fun atmosphere at decent prices as well as a full bar and kitchen menu.\n\nWe have made visits almost exclusively on Saturday evenings and they can get busy but are never too packed where we don't enjoy our visit. Service is attentive and they change out coals and check on each table regularly.
