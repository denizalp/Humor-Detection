$4.50 for a chocolate tart that is the size of 3 Milk Duds squashed together? Uh, no.\n\n$10 for a White Oreo Chocolate Bar? You'd better get the hell away from me. \n\nI have summoned the power of Sarrrisssssss. Sarrrisssss...destroy my foe with your hellbound, velvety, *cough affordable cough* incredibly tempting fury. Suffocate them in a shroud of your chocolate evil.
