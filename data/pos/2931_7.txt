Came here as a group of 6. Got here just before the rush hour at about 7 pm. Our food (main entrees) didn't get here till 9 pm. Service is slow and downright atrocious. Server was overwhelmed. Food was underwhelming. Got the udon carbonara. It was just chewy gravy mess. \n\nThis isn't a fusion restaurant like Carino. Basically, they have a Japanese menu and an Italian menu. Very few actual fusion dishes. \n\nI think people come here because all other places are too busy. I anticipate this place will be out of business in a year.
