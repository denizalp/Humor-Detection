Service was great and you can't beat $1 shots.\nThe quality is horrible, all the artificial colors make me quickly regret it, but it IS Vegas and part of it all.\nSomehow I always end up at one of their locations, last visit it was this one.\nAlways makes it even more fun if the staff is as lively as it was this time.\nRecommended fit r some cheap fun.
