TWO HOURS IN LINE.\nTWO HOURS. \nTWO. \nHOURS. \n\nWe got here at 11:30 on a Friday and didn't get out of line until 1:30...\n\nPlease hire a consultant who can make the food service more efficient. The line wasn't long it was just painfully slow.\n\nThe food was FIVE STARS, though. Grits were fantastic. Beans were perfect. Brisket was 10\/10!!
