Some co-workers ordered from Fazio's the other night and were left with a spare stromboli.\n\n\"Give it to Darren. He'll eat it. He's a human garbage disposal!\"\n\nHey, they have worse names for me.\n\nMy only name for Fazio's stromboli is Real Palatable 'N 'At. \n\nIt had the rustic, dead heavy dough, the gooey cheese, the ham...\n\nI now owe said co-workers. This is disturbing. I shouldn't have taken that stromboli. Damn it, they know that good food is my weakness...
