I came to Vegas only as an adult.  I had heard for years how \"over the top\" everything there is.  A city built in the desert and filled with dreams.  \n\nOne of the \"miracles\" in Vegas is the Bellagio water show.   It's awesome.  Every hour?  Every half hour?   I'm not sure, but it's awesome to see.  And worth a wait if needed.  And yes, it's over the top
