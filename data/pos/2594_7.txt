I love Hana's Asian market! Quantities are limited (and more expensive), so I usually head up to Cleveland for things I really need. \n\nService is amazing! The owner is one of the sweetest ladies I have ever met! There is also a variety of foods the owner makes herself to sell. Sandwiches, kimchi, seaweed salad, etc. Delicious!\n\n\nIt's a smaller store and has a lot of Korean based items. Chinese items are on the fewer side. In a little plaza across from Rice Bowl!
