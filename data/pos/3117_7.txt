HOLY CRAP THEY HAVE FROZEN XIAOLONGBAO.  :)\n\nThese delicious little bites of porky, soupy dumpling heaven have eluded me since I first tasted them in Shanghai - my husband and I have been on the lookout for XLB in Phoenix ever since.  While the search for a restaraunt that serves them continues; we can at least satisfy our cravings with the frozen options from Ranch Market.  I made these from scratch one day and they're a pain in the ass.  Seriously, manna from heaven folks....
