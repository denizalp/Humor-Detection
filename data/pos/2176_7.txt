What I Loved:\n\nVast selection of well seasoned food.\n\nFriendly and attentive staff\n\nPlenty of carved meats\n\nTidy food selection area\n\nNeeds Work:\n\nInterior is VERY DATED and seems to have been overlooked in the 360 Degree resort remodel\n\nAdd Indian and Mediterranean meats and sides\n\nNo stand out deserts like crepes\n\nNo Mongolian Grill
