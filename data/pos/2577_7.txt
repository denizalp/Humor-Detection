If I could give this shiphole less than one star I would. This place is only out to take your money. That's all they care about. If you have a female parts don't even bother coming here, you'll be treated like a secretary and even when you notify the school or your female instructor, zero fracks will be given. Schools like these are not for the betterment of people's lives they are cons, good ones. Do not attend this craphole, a community school is by far better even if you have a horrible one. They just want your money.
