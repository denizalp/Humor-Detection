I went to this restaurant today with my colleagues at office. I liked the vegetable thali, it was delicious. Moreover I got the authentic Indian taste in daal; something I had been longing for since I came to U.S. \nWith food being excellent and service being good, I felt the price is higher..\nAll went well until I was in for a ride shock- gratuity! Yes they collect gratuity for large groups and they didn't mention it in the beginning..I was disappointed with this. Won't rule out visiting again but definitely not in a large group.
