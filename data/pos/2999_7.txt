This spa is pretty nice, has very good service and decent prices. I actually found this SPA on Groupon and that was the only real reason I even tried them out. \n\nI ended up choosing a cupping package and tried that technique...which was AWESOME! I really enjoyed it and felt great the following day. \n\nGive it a try...they are located in the same parking lot as the In N Out Burger on Sahara. \n\nEnjoy.
