It just opened a week ago, the staff is polite, they have a large collection of dips, lots of flavors and garniture toppings. My favorite is Caramel fleur de sel dip with the Oreo and kit kat garniture.\nMy only comment that lead me to a 3 stars review is the size of ice cream, that is not very generous, also they do not offer water cups like most places in Quebec.
