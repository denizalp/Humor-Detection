I hate buffets, I really do. But where else can you get french toast and pizza on one plate?\n\nI came here for brunch. While the food quality was decent, I was expecting a bit more selection. It wasn't terrible, but the Bellagio Buffet didn't quite live up to the hype.\n\nBoo for the long wait, I felt quite pathetic waiting 30 min. in a line for food...I'm a lardass at heart...
