Imagine yourself in your dark garage, music blasting, surrounded by hipsters and candle light. Okay it's trendy, I get it. Still tho ordering at the bar in single file line, yelling over the DJ, isn't the most effective food service. And for what they charge per dish, they can afford to turn on a few more lights in the place. Candle light wasn't cutting it. This isn't the 1700s. Vegans couldn't survive back then.\n That being said cocktails are pretty good.
