This location had a lot of good stores.  I came looking for nothing, yet I found plenty!  Actually I needed a pair of slacks and Calvin Klein delivered.  \n\nThey also have good food options.  Take a look at the website to see if the store you are looking for is here.  Plenty of parking, really clean, and well airconditioned. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.premiumoutlets.com\/outlet\/las-vegas-south\/stores
