One of the worst hospitals ever. In 2007 I was pregnant with my son. I went in with bad back pain. The dr told me I had a miscarriage. My son is 9 years old now. It still haunts me to this day. I was so devastated my first reaction was to go get drunk. Thank god I didn't. I hate that place. Would never recommend it. The Drs know nothing.
