I have been a patient there for about 12 years and it has gone to hell since Dr Abby is not in charge. Horrible office customer service and office policies, they rescheduled my appointment made 3 months ago to follow up in blood work and when I arrived there today 6 mins late they told me I had to re schedule my appointment the Dr. Could not see me. Impossible to make an appointment when your sick. Absolutely horrible practice! I will not be back.
