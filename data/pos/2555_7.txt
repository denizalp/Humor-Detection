If you're shopping for your furry friends, you'll do pretty well here at PetSmart. Well organized and very clean, they have everything for the usual dogs and cats but there are also sections for birds, small animals and fish. Prices are clearly marked.\n\nLots and lots and lots of stuff here.\n\nI'm not sure I would use their grooming or veterinary services after reading the other reviews, but purely for purchasing merchandise, they are fine.
