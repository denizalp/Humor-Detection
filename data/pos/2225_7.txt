Wow wow wee waa! What a nice place.  Didn't eat any food, but I will next time, I promise.  Tried three wines, including their special house Pino, and all were fabulous!   Great patio, ---no REALLY great patio! \n\nGood service. Rockin' good looks. On a Thursday night, only about 50% full, so it's not like Postinos where you have to wait 30 mins for a table.
