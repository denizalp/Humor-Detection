Have been here multiple times and I have been absolutely thrilled with the level of excellent service each and every time!\n\nA big thank you to Lee who helped my fiance surprise me with the most beautiful, unique engagement ring. It was more stunning than i ever couldve imagined and it is absolutely perfect!\n\nI cant wait to come here with my fiance this time so we can look for his ring and my wedding band together.\n\nThank you all so much for making this experience so incredibly special for both of us!
