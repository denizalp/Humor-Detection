Worst bar ever. If you want to be discriminated against and have horrible service come here. \n\nI honestly almost got my CA driver's license taken away because some idiot bouncer didn't think it was me.  \n\nThis is place fell flat on it's face after that. On a Saturday it wasn't full.  So if you're looking for a crazy club in Vegas this is not it.
