Dear Red Lobster, \n\nThere are other flavors besides butter and garlic. \n\nThis food was horrible. The only think saving it from one star was the non-horrible service. \n\nThose stupid biscuits were hard, heavy and taste exactly like Cheez-its. \n\nWe ordered one of the feasts and an appetizer. EVERYTHING was super greasy and drowning in butter. The scallops were rubbery and everything was so rich we left feeling like we had eaten bricks. The feeling lasted for 5 hours until I was finally able to fall asleep. \n\nRed Lobster: Not Even Once.
