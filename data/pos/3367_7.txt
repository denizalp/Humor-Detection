Hidden gem alert!\n\nExcellent, authentic Thai food (menu also features some Malaysian and Burmese dishes)\n\nThe decor was, well, non-existent - but you don't go to places like this for the decor - you go there for the tastiest green curry this side of the DVP (spicy, but not too spicy).\n\nGreat service, great food - definitely worth the trip to the east side of town.
