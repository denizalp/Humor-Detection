EL-LAME-O. Went here to get an adjustment and the chiropractor gave me this huge sales pitch about why I need to be coming here once a month yada yada yada. So Annoying I hate that crap that's exactly what's wrong with this country Dr's trying to sell you treatment you don't even need. Other than that the service was fine and they were able to get me in that day.
