Delicious latte! The food wasn't bad but our party of 5 waited over 30 mins. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. \n\nFortunately they have beautiful views and a very attentive wait staff.\n\nAnd yes! A vegan\/vegetarian menu is available as well. Overall, food is on the pricey side...it's the strip after all.
