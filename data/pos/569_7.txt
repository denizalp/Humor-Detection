This In-N-Out is much more convenient and not as busy as the one on Dean Martin. Minutes from the house.  And still just as good.\n\nThis allows me to pick up a double-double with well done fries on my way home after a night of dice shooting.  Animal style for the lady. \n\nAs Jason Whitlock (and not Andre W.) likes to say, the damn thangy thang gets diddy did.
