Love the variety....watch out for the Asians taking all the crab (my parents being 2 of them).\nEverything was good. Loved the caviar station and all the pretty yummy desserts.\nI don't know when they started this but now they have an all you can drink option. $8 for beer or wine. \nMy only CON: I had to pay full price for my 6 year old. $38.99 for him to eat 2 slices of pizza and have some soft serve.
