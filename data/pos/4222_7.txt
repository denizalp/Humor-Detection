Really legit boba tea here.  It's a great balance of sweetness, tea, and really bubbly boba. Its not like some places where you feel like they forgot that theres tea in boba milk TEA (looking at you Tea Station!) So what I am saying is you can actually taste the tea here! Really good jasmine tea here too. \n\nBad thing is that there is nowhere to chill inside this place. and they dont turn on the a\/c very high so its too hot to sit down at any of the few tables that they do have.
