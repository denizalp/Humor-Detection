Parking can be nuts.\n\nOther than that, this place has a plethora of places to eat at. Restaurants everywhere and a food court inside the mall. The food court is awesome. You can get a filling meal with a drink for about $5. It's all authentic tasting. \n\nThey have the usual cutsie stores that sell Hello Kitty items, etc. Bubble tea shops and Chinese bakeries, this mall has you covered.\n\nIf you're at First Markham Place, a must try is Ding Tai Fung. Soup dumplings are delicious!
