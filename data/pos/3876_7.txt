Finally made it to Bomberos for an after-dinner glass of wine.  I was really surprised at how small the place is!  I love that!  And the patio is so nice we opted to sit outside.  Seemed like a good idea at the time..until we realized it was 95 degrees outside and the breeze had died down.\n\nBut I enjoyed my glass of white wine.  I couldn't tell you what it was beyond something South American.  Glasses average $10-$12, so it is a little expensive, but I would gladly return.  Can't wait to try something from their menu next time!
