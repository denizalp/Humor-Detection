This is your typical Walmart Super Center it has everything you need and more. It was very busy and there weren't enough cash registers open and I sometimes get annoyed when it's dusk and they start blocking the isles with merch that needs to be shelved - but that's the price we pay for everything we could ever need all at one place. Thanks Walmart I like your crafts section please never get rid of it.
