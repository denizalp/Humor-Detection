Oh I got my band geek back on now!  I haven't stepped foot in a music store in almost 20 years, but I'm going to start playing the piano again and my husband also wants to learn.  I couldn't believe the selection in everything.  Tons of sheet music to dig through, at all levels of experience, and then a great selection on instruments.  Hmmm....I may decide to really geek out and get a sax and a flute again.\n\nThey give lessons.  They do repairs.  This is heaven to me.  So glad we finally stopped in.
