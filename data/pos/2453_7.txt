Things didn't get any better here. We wanted the same teacher each week. She called in sick several weeks and quit. Grandson got shuffled around and finally landed with a teacher that he cried the entire half hour. It got to the point that he started to cry when we pulled in the parking lot. After 18 months of lessons @$50 per half hour I gave up. Now, they charged my daughters card again after quitting. They are going to \"investigate\" and have a manager call. It's been 4 or 5 days and no manager call.
