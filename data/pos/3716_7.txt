I'm SO glad that we went with Laguna Pool and Spa because they transformed my Las Vegas Moon Scape backyard into an entertainers outdoor oasis to be proud of. I can't wait to entertain my friends and family! I worked with Billy S. and he walked me through the process and made my wife and I feel very comfortable. Putting a giant hole in our backyard is stressful enough but they pulled it off with no stress and on time. I would always recommend them to any of my friends!
