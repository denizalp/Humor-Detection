I get that's it's a \"country\" inn but for god sake country music sucks and sucks to party to. They play hip hop every tenth or so song and the dance floor fills up. Then back to 20 country songs and watching the same three couples do the same damn spin moves around the floor. This shit would never survive in Cali and by the looks of it in a Saturday night, it's barely surviving here. Piece of business advice- know your customer and what they want.
