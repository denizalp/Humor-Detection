Eatt is tucked away on Sahara among all the dealerships and strip malls. \nWhen you walk in, it's a bit casual, but don't let the cover fool you. \nThey have fresh food with great presentation, and wonderful customer service! \n\nThey change their menu seasonally and have a good selection of different soups, salads and entrees. The only tip you need to know is, save room for dessert!
