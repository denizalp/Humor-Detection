$9.99 All-You-Can-Eat Dinner Buffet w\/Crab Legs\n\nIf you like Chinese food like sweet n sour chicken,lots of seafood stuff like crawfish,crab legs,shrimp and fish.\n\nThey did have bbq pork but it was kinda tough.\n\nSeveral different soup options, around 60 items to choose from total. Pretty standard chinese buffet fair.\n\nThey do cook Mongolian \"made-to-order\" and they have soft serve ice cream.\n\nReally can't complain for $10 pp but I'm no fan of asian food to start this certainly did nothing to change my mind.\n\nPretty boring and fishy! But still good cheap eats for those that like Chinese Cuisine.
