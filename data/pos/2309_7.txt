While in town for a tradeshow, I had the pleasure of receiving a wonderful foot treatment in the spa by the lovely Odalys. It was absolutely delightful and I felt like a million bucks when I left. Also, Joshua at the front was so friendly and accommodating! He helped me fix my phone which had suddenly died for no apparent reason. He saved me a trip to the Apple store, my hero. Many thanks for a truly enjoyable experience... I will be back!!
