I walk through this dog house nearly every day between my classes, but I finally have a chance to sit down and actually order something. The original hot dog bun and tons of side garnishes are larger than most of the dog places that I have been to. The combo of 3 mini burgers are also delicious with chopped bacon on top, but drink size is usually smaller. I like it, just not as much to give it 5 stars based on my personal reference.
