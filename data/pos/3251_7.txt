Really great club in Charlotte. There's a great mix of people here which makes it enjoyable. The bartenders (even the really hot ones) were all so nice. My basic drinks were strong and boy did that get me in trouble, haha. I loved that the club has a photo booth. The decor is great and the DJ passing out glow necklaces was a nice touch. Can't wait to go back. It gets packed by midnight on weekends.
