Fantastic food. Authentic Indian food and great prices. Really great service and very polite staff. This is a hidden gem on Queen Street. I am coming back! I had the curry chicken Roti-medium heat. Still quite hot and I love hot food. The dishes were served freshly maid and hot. We were a table of 4 and we were all super pleased with our meals.
