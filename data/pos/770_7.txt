My workplace ordered cupcake catering (!) from this local company for a party, and it did not disappoint. Great presentation, cute little notes and designs, and, of course, the cupcakes themselves were fan-frikkin'-tastic.\n\nLater, I ordered some of their bacon-chocolate-chip cookies for myself and almost ate all of them just for lunch one day. What can't bacon do?
