I've been here for over an hour and I still dont have a drink in my hand. You have to stand in line forever to buy beverage tickets and then stand in another line to actually get your beverage. Why do they have chicken tender and corn dog stands here??My last name is KELLY and I'm getting PISSED. American Guinness, Blue Moon, and Harp??? Really? This is supposed to be an Irish Festival... Not the fucking Allegheny State Fair. The only thing worth seeing here is the live music. Sorry Pittsburgh, horrible job.
