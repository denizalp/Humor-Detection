Tough review for me to post. I really like these guys. First time I went it was dead and just the two owners. Great experience and great pizza.\n\nSecond time. No owners, soggy pizza, sauce tasted like it was straight out of a can. Also serving cold Zeppoles is unacceptable!!\n\nConsistency might be an issue with this place.
