Where to start? With the fact that there is no seating in the lobby? With the fact that all the kennel buildings lack air conditioning and all the dogs are suffering in evaporative \"cooling\"? How about the issue that they never answer the phone?\nOr maybe the issue that they euthanize perfectly healthy dogs even when people are on their way to come and get them?\nOr maybe its the snotty way the counter folks treat customers?\nThe only reason to go here is to adopt an animal to save it from this disorganized, underfunded crap hole.
