oh yea! love me some SUSHISAMBA! Ive dined here a few times and its always been awesome.\nI always start out with a watermelon mojito... its amazingly refreshing.\nMy favorite app is the Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos. I don't even know how to describe them apart from saying they re like putting heaven in your mouth.\nI also always order the Pacific Roll. its  king crab, avocado, Asian pear, soy paper, wasabi-avocado crema. the pear in the roll really brings out the yellowtail and the wasabi is the cherry on top.\nAnd also you cant forget to order the Peruvian Corn. Its AMAZING.
