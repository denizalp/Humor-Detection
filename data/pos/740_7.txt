Pretty cool place! Great customer service, friendly staff, neat idea of the way its set up, build your own enchiladas! The only thing I would want to change a little is to add rice and beans to the enchiladas (like on the side) I love enchiladas but I need a little more variety. Eating a huge bowl of just enchiladas gets a little bland. Other than that, definitely recommend it for people to try!
