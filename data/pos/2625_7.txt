Who doesn't go to The Peppermill when they are in Las Vegas?? I've had many happy times here. Falling asleep on the table while waiting for my breakfast.. lol \nMy friend from Vegas always set out this place as a meeting place. :-) \nGood chance for me to grab the TEN EGGS OMELET! Heeeeheee, I always get high on protein after it. But of course I share with my buddies. \nHuge portion, nice employees, 24 hrs!!
