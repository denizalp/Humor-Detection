Lame is all I have to say. Went on a friday night and Only 5 dancers. The lap dances suck the men are more about showing you tricks and dance moves than grinding against you. Don't waste your cash here at all. There is a reason why after all these years this place doesn't have many reviews. The only plus about this place is the guys are nice to talk too. As for looks, most are skinny, not many are muscular, and a few seemed possibly gay.
