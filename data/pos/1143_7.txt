Best pool party in all of Vegas!\n\nSexy people. Great DJs. Beautiful space. \n\nThis is my favorite pool in all of Vegas. I definitely recommend a lily pad. They are right on the water. You can store your stuff on the space while you can view the whole space and the DJs. Plenty of cabanas and tables.\n\nMy Summer isn't complete without trips to EBC!
