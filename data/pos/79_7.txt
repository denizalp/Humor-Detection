Was craving a good crepe so we decided to go to Cafe Moulin.\n\nSuper Belgium Crepe (2\/5): good if you like a lot of cookie butter, but I found it to have way too much cookie butter in it which made it difficult to finish.\n\nBanella Crepe (3\/5): better than the Super Belgium, but still had way too much nutella spread on it.\n\nAlaskan Crepe (3.5\/5): very filling and decent smoked salmon crepe, but a little on the heavy side.\n\nOverall I found the crepes to be average and a little pricey.
