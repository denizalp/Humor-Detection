I work nearby and this is the best place to eat your lunch on a sunny day (Like today! May 17 2017). Lots of clean benches to sit down with a friend and just eat and talk. \n\nI also just love people watching and just enjoying my lunch hour outside. \n\nI am very excited for the food trucks to arrive because I have a feeling I'll be there every day.
