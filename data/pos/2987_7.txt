This place is OK. Pizza is decent. Usually takes a bit longer to get then I expect. Service is usually pretty good. \n\nNothing special about this place. It does have a loyal following though. I don't know why. Is it the grossly over sized menus? The old swing\/big band era music playing in the background? The pizzookie? I dunno. \n\nI'd be more tempting in returning here during non-peak hours, because when this place is slamming, there is a long wait at door to sit and a longer wait to get the food.
