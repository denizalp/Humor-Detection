i like this place. small (very)\nthe guys working here seem to be the \"good ol boy\" type. But if you can overlook the undercover (employee\/cop) walking around like they're looking around. (kinda wierd and annoying), \n\nThey have everything a \"Pawn Shop\" (excluding rolling TV cameras. a la Pawn Wars etc) \nJewlery\ntv's\nmusic instruments\nguns\nknives\ncoins (i think)\nold VHS, DVD, CD'S\nPRICES seem to be pretty good for firearms. (in which I don't mind taking the extra road trip coming here INSTEAD OF the overpriced HYATT)\n\nFOR what its worth.. Take a look here then head up 74 to the gun range (Firepower)
