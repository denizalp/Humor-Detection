I almost wept when I saw they had opened a Slices at this end of town.   I don't know what makes this pizza so wonderful, but it's delicious.  Try the veggie or white pizza... I hear the potato bacon is good too.\r\n\r\nThe downside:\r\nThe place is usually wicked hot inside.  I dunno if they are trying to save a couple bucks and not run the A\/C but those ovens make it warm!  Just grab your slices and go sit outside in the foodcourt area instead.
