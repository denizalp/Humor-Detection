Hahahah....something I would never forget...I learned a lot...laughed alot..drank alot and it was only $40. We learned some chair dances and a few moves on the pole. I was so excited that when I got home...I purchased a pole of my own...:) The drinks were pretty strong....and our instructer was quite...uhm...entertaining..she kept suggesting that we get down to our skivvies....nah.....too many bodies on that pole for me.....we had some pics taken...my grandkids will love it.
