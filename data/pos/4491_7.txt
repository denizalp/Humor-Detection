All these amazing reviews, I feel let down. With 5 people in my group, There should have at least been one person with a good meal. \n\nVolcano chicken:  Horrible. Over-fried, crispy, and couldn't taste the chicken. We even had 3 orders of different spicy levels.\n\nChicken Pad Thai:  Weird. The noodles were pink(??) and had a fishy flavor. The chicken was basically flavorless. \n\nChicken Massaman Curry: Just OK. Nothing outstanding. \n\nBummer!! We really wanted to like this place, too!
