finally..a good review.....stopped in for lunch today at sahara\n\nafter i read iain b excellent review, i knew this place had to be a good.. and it was! i went with the lunch platter and my selection was the chicken tikka and for a dollar more i added rice and hummus.  The hummus tasted so authentic and tasty. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how nicely decorated the restaurant is.  it's thoughtful yet comfortable. they have some great lunch specials too!
