This place sucks, ordered sliders and it tasted like crap. The meat was undercooked and the fries were garbage. Our drinks were always empty and it took the waitress nearly 15 min for a simple refill. Oh did I mention that they told us we couldn't order the \"team pitcher\" of beer because we were only 3 people? This is a bad Boston Pizza and the wait staff should be fired. I'd rather eat at McDonalds then come back to this location again.
