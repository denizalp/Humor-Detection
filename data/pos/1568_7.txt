I go to Little City Grill weekly and for the most part this eating establishment is such an Awesome place to eat and take your family. The employees and the owner\/manager have such Excellent customer service they make you feel at home. Their food is Really Good, I like the Bacon Burger and the Fry Sauce is the Best In Town!!
