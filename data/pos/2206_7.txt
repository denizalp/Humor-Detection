My nephew and I came here for brunch we ended up eating off the regular menu.  The place is clean and nicely decorated.  \n\nI ordered the BBQ Chicken Cordon Bleu (tender grilled breast of chicken with house made BBQ sauce, then topped with smoked ham, & smoked mozzarella cheese.  All served on toasted ciabatta bread.  It was good, but the BBQ sauce over powered the sandwich.  I loved that they let you mixed the sweet fries and regular fries.  YUM!
