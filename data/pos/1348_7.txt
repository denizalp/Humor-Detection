There is something off about this place, not sure what it is!\nThey have minimal discounts and promotions every now and then, even on holidays' season, they don't have anything over the top, although the mall has so many other famous stores in this category.\nThey seem to always be short on staff as well, I have been there few times, and I always end up with the manager who's trying to catch up with customers running around
