While I'm a fan of JLo, and admire her range of talent don't spend your hard earned $$$$ to see this show. It's loud, much to sexual and is targeted to the morons. \n\nIf you really want to enjoy her watch her on Shades of Blue. Your already paying for TV so it will be basically free. \n\nDon't get me wrong she is multi talented, but this is not her genre. \n\nSorry JLo, I'm a nuyorican to, but I understand it's about the $$$!
