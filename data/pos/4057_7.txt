It's clean, brightly-lit, and very close to my apartment, but why are the prices generally so much higher?  Maybe it's bec. of all the organic items they offer?  Organic or not, I hardly ever come here anymore, as I'd rather go to Whole Foods on Mayo for my bread and organic foods' fix, and to Fry's on Shea for the stuff my Mom wants.  It's nice to know that there's a grocery nearby, though.
