\"Did you change your menu?\"\n\nNo\n\n\"Then what is this?  I ordered Chicken Lettuce Wraps\"\n\nOh, you ordered them spicy, so those are the *NEW* Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps.\n\n...\n\nDon't try to guess what I want, and give me an entirely different dish.  Also, I'm pretty sure if you are referring to a dish as new, it means the menu has changed.
