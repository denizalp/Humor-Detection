Sittin at the light. A cop is directing traffic and we're not moving. I guess it's Warped Tour. These people are nuts to be standing out here, on black asphalt, with no shade. \nOther wise, I freakin love this place. The name speaks for itself. It shares building\/property with The Silverton Casino. So one of the perks that the Vegas Pro shop has is The Mermaid Bar.\n\nUpdate: Over 300 people were taken to the hospital and treated for heat exhaustion. If you're going to come here, in the summer, you better take precaution. This town ain't for sissies.
