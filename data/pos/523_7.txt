OHHHH Target, you temptress you.  We all go here for this or that.  I swear its like Vegas but instead of filtering pure oxygen in....they filter in some kind of air that makes you buy more crap than you need.  I go in for toothpaste and come out spending $80!!!  Then you get home and wonder how Target got you again....... They have everything and its never as scary as Marcs or Wal Mart.
