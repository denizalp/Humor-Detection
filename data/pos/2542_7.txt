Tickety Tacky in only the best way possible.  I actually really like this place.  The neon lights reminds me of my mothers make up in the 90's.\n\nNick the waiter was a sweetheart.  I am ridiculous in my requests sometimes, but he managed to cater to all of them.\n\nThe portions are huge!   My steak and spinach salad was delicious!  The steak was tender and medium rare just as I requested.  I asked for candied walnuts in it and Nick brought me a bowl of them!  That's what I call service.\n\nLate night eats in Vegas!  I'll definitely be back!
