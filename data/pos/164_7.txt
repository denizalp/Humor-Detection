The Buddhist-peace theme on the patio was kind of wrecked as I had to listen to a song by a black musician railing against \"mother f#&ker's\" and \"niggers\". Huh? What kind of lunch is that? Who picked that station?\n\nAlso, I have to admit it is over priced by about $1.50-$2 per entree. At least mine was.
