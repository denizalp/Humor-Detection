It is a very decent Taco Shop near the 215 and Rainbow. Best part of this restaurant is that it's open for 24 hours. They carry a standard menu list of Tacos and burritos. My preference is carne asada but, unfortunately, it is always way too cooked an dry. Not much to be said, except that it's a very convenient after party off the strip hangover cure late at night.
