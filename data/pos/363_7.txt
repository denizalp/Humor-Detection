Holy moly fancy schmancy...\n\nIf you want to get some cool ideas and feel pillows covered in sheep fur (or some other animal fur), this is your place.\n\nI strolled in on a Friday evening and loved the decor. There's a nice mixture of items available from furniture, dishware, candles, rugs, art work and linens. \n\nIf you're looking for a gift or an interesting piece for your home, you're sure to find it here!
