Hands down the most beautiful art pieces I've ever seen with my own eyes.\n\nI could not afford any of it but hey! Nothing wrong with looking, right? Lol\n\nI can't say what the staff is like, being that I never got past saying, \"Hello\" to them. They did say hello and they flashed  a beautiful smile lol.\n\nI wish I could have all the art pieces!
