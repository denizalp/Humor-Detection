THE LINE IS WORTH IT! This was my first time at Eggslut and I admit I was discouraged when I saw the super long line out the door, but I'm glad we waited! I ordered the Slut which is a boiled egg on top of a puree of potatoes in a jar along with a side of baguettes. (I added a side bacon) The boiled egg is cooked to perfection as the yolk is warm and runny. Perfect food after a night of Vegas-ing\/drinking! Thank you Eggslut!
