Great hotel but shockingly bad housekeeping. \nChecked into my room and discovered dried urine all over the toilet seat...couldn't believe it...see photos. I was too tired to go down to complain...so gross. Also, there was someone's clothing tag on the floor...gross. \nI like the Venetian but this recent housekeeping fail has turned me off completely. See photos.
