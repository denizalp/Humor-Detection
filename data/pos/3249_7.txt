i love savers! i buy all of my underwear from them! HAHA im kidding.\n\ni usually come here to buy military shorts or pants. its always hit or miss. i do enjoy strolling through the books and household appliances. interesting to see what kind of stuff people had. the sports and electronics sections are usually junk. if you have the time you can usually find a great pair of jeans. \n\njust make sure to take a shower or wash the clothes well. theres always a strange smell to them.
