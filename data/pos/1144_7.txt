With the extreme summers here I was looking for a good ice cream place in the Chandler\/Gilbert area.  One of my coworkers recommended McMahon's Ice Cream and it was love at first bite!  I've tasted many different flavors, but I always end up getting the Rockier Road.  It's my favorite and I always get lucky as they have just opened a new batch. \n\nThey can get really busy, but it's definitely worth the wait!
