I don't need the ticket taker wasting my time, telling me how girly my movie is and how he would never see it because of that fact. I really don't feel the desire to have commentary on my movie viewing habits, thank you very much!\n\nOh, and the parking sucks. There is always five people trying to get into one spot. I hate it.
