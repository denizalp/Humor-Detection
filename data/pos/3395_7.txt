A great little hideaway for when you are in the neighborhood! Nothing like stuffing your face at Roberto's for breakfast and coming here after for a nice coffee while you work. \n\nFriendly service. \nFree wi-fi\nFree water to go with your coffee\nExcellent words of wisdom in the bathroom for you to collect.\n\nQuite barren on the decor, so Tiabi lacks that comfort and welcoming aspect. Would come back as the owner was super helpful on helping me pick\/customize a coffee that would not be too sweet!
