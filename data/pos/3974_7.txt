Very chic decor, great location and service.\n\nWent there for lunch.  Although they have prix fixe menu for $20, a few good main course items require additional charges.   \n\nThe ramen and rice with beef steak were great while the soup, salad and sushi rolls are soso.\n\nSince it is so hard to find restaurants on the strip open for lunch, i recommend this one for quick lunch and delicious cocktails.
