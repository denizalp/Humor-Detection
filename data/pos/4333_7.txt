What an excellent sushi joint. From the great service and decor to the amazingly fresh and top-quality sushi, SquidInk does not disappoint. There are very few sushi places where everything comes together like it does at SquidInk, so I will be back time and time again. Great bar atmosphere too!\n\nTry the rockstar roll and thank me later.
