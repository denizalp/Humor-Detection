If you go to the place and spend hundreds of $$$ over the course of a couple years......don't expect more the $5 off your second bottle on Tuesday.........even if the online ad doesn't mention that....\nAnd if  you complain.......you will be thrown out and police called.\nPathetic\n\nVery. Rude. Owner.\nEnough said.
