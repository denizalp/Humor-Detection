Yay, it finally opened!  I stopped in here today to grab some coffee and donuts, and they were both tasty.  \n\n I love dunkin donuts, and am glad that they have this location finally open, and its close to my place.  Great hours, free wifi, and tasty treats anda drinks for all.  I believe they have a drive thru here too!\n\nWill be back in the future for more coffee, muffins and donuts!
