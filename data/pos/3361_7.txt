I ordered a wedge salad and there was a moth in my lettuce. The waitress was flat on her response, just said sorry without any emotion. Flies were all over the windows and while they comped my meal (big deal) I ordered a beer after the fiasco just to kill whatever I may have ingested, and they charged me for it!!!! Dirty and stained menus.\nThey should not even get 1 star but our lunch came out quickly and that's the only reason they get 1.
