I've been a member of the Village at Gainey Ranch for five years and love!!! Today I decided to attend a glass at the DC Ranch location And was incredibly surprised. I enjoyed my workout very much. The instructor was engaging and friendly. This location was much busier then Gainey but equally as enjoyable. The pool is amazing. I felt like I was at a resort.
