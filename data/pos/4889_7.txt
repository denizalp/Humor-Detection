Joshua took the order for our table of nine by memory.  I love that. This location has a pretty small indoor area and a large outdoor space.  Sunset can be a little brutal for half the folks at the table, but its great outside when the sun goes down.  Pita Jungle is always a good choice when  you have a mixed party of vegans and carnivores.  The service was good and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  Easy choice for a group!
