Great Fish Tacos and go buck ass zany on the chips and salsa.  Lots and Lots.... and Lots... and Lots...Lots... Lots of Tequila to pick from.... Lots.   Great vibe and the best thing is its across from La Bocca.  So its like the Bermuda Triangle between Modern Margarita, La Bocca and the Blue Martini.   You can really loose oneself... Just blame it on the Tequila
