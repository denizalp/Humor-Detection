Kaskade Sundays... AAAAAMAZING!!!  I don't know how else I would describe this place!  I danced for 5 hours straight in 110 degrees weather and I did not want to leave when it was over~!  When Kaskade came on, my friends and I went to the stage.  We were so close to him we could almost touch him!!! SO HOT!!!\n\nWe got a daybed between 10 people. Free entry and $1000 minimum~ not so bad at all!  I honestly had the time of my life.  I want to go back there next week if I could! ahhhh!
