This is absolutely a good place to eat sushi in Vegas. The happy hour is when you should go! Their rolls, ramen, and sake is delicious! The bar in the front is very cute with the table that can see through the mall, you can secretly people watch. LOL. The inside is more intimate. I don't remember it having background music, so it's very quiet for you to talk.
