I've avoided reviewing Pita Jungle because I just don't think my meager words can do it justice. So this is what I've come up with:\n\nIf I could live here for the rest of my life and roll around in their hummus all day long, I would die happy.\n\nMy favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix. Hands down.
