Colorful, enchanting indoor amusement park perfect for a 7-year-old who needed activity and space after a 6 hour drive from Los Angeles, and a 4-month-old who just wanted stimulation from flickering lights and calliope music.\n\nIt's not Disneyland. The rides are old and marginally maintained. But $8 for 2 hours of unlimited rides  . . . I'd call Jambo the winner. \n\nGreat staff who follow the kids around so they can mobilize the rides.\n\nAttentive parents.\n\nLovable group of kids.\n\nCaution: filthy restrooms
