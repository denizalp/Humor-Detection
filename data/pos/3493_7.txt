7 Lounge is a good place for a quick shisha and drinks,\nThe shisha quality is mediocre, okay for a non-regular smoker...\nThe bar here is a good plus, since most shisha places have no alcohol,\nTheir burgers and tacos are delicious, had the portobello mushroom and the chorizo tacos!\n\nThey feature live dj on wknds, and it gets pretty crowded, so reservation is recommended. The crowd is mostly youth, so they get pretty loud pretty quick!\n\nService is alright, they can use a couple more servers, but they do a good job keeping up with their tables.
