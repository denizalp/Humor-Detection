The gym is for sure the biggest I've been in, which I found has its downside.\n\nWay too many kids, which makes it noisy and makes if feel like a community centre.\n\nClasses get very full fast, you really have to arrive early to get a spot. \nLots of machine & weights.\nBetter classes are offered for more $$$\n\nStaff is a bit snobbish....will not be renewing my membership
