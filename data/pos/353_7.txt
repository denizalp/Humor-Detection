In my opinion, this pastry chef is the closest to the Parisian style of viennoiseries.  This isn't a claim that it's better than local bakers\/patisseriers, just from which school & style his products are coming.\n\nCould be the closest to Paris-style croissant I've tried in Montreal.\n\nCroissant: 16\/20\nCrust 4\/5\nInterior 4\/5\nButter 4\/5\nColor 4\/5\n- Light & crisp exterior, golden color, soft bready interior, balanced buttery flavor. (Reference points: Pierre Hermé, Fauchon)\n\nChausson aux Pommes: 11\/15\nAppearance 4\/5\nTexture 4\/5\nFilling 3\/5\n- Light, crisp, fluffy pastry with a more tart apple puree.  Size is classic.
