Charlie cheap car is the best dealership for all of your car buying needs. At first I was a bit skeptical but the friendly staff listened to everything I had to say and helped me find the right car to fit my needs. Ask for Toper he will help you find a car and fight to get you the best price. AMAZING customer service and a GREAT warranty as well.
