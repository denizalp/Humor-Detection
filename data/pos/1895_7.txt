$3.5 single scoop\n$5 double scoop\n$10 take-home-pint\n\nFriendly staff let me sample as many flavors as  I wanted to try (too many).\nI settled on the most delicious gelato I've had in a long, long time - the pannacotta with fig jam. Def going to pick up gelato every time I visit Downtown Summerlin.
