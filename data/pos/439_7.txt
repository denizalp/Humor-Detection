Very over priced, food is not great and super small place. If you are planning on going you better expect to wait for a long time if you don't have a reservation. The waitress is friendly but there is only one so service will be slower then any place you go to. Not happy dinning here. Will not dine again with $150 for 2 people, i could dine on the stripe with better service, less wait time and great food.
