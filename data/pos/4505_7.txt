The website on google and yelp both showed that the restaurant was open until 11pm. My husband and I drove from Akron to come to this restaurant and meet friends. When we arrived (~945) we discovered that the restaurant was already closed. I called the restaurant and they stated that they were aware of the google and yelp time error and said that the websites have been incorrect for about a year.
