Best. Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes. Ever.\n\nEVER!\n\nI cannot recall any other pancakes I have ever eaten that were as good as the ones I had yesterday at the Dor-Stop.  They were very banana bread like in taste, yet were a little crispy on the edges and really the perfect density and thickness.  No syrup or butter needed, these are fantastic.  I wish I lived closer so I could hit this place up for Saturday or Sunday breakfast rather than the occasional breakfast-for-lunch at work.\n\nI wish I had those pancakes now.
