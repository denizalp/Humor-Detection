I was up in the area and stopped in. \nIf I lived in the area I would be here frequently but I do find that Sprouts has better prices.  \nMy favorite think about WF has always been their selection of vitamins and suppliments.  However, on this trip I found that many of the things I usually get or the variety I am used to was not present here.  [Sprouts won out again.]
