Definitely not the best buffet in Vegas, but when you don't really have any other places to go..it'll do. \n\nOptions are alright..I did like the grilled veggies, but unfortunately they tasted like crapola. \n\nThey had an omelette bar in the morning, and then pasta at night. The pasta was bleck. Mine wasn't made all the way through, and it was still warm. I got a bad tummy ache later on that night.\n\nThe ice cream machine served delicious ice cream though. With some crumbled up butterfinger on the side. YUM.
