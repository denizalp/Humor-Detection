Dear Le Peep, \n\nI am a New England girl who frequently winds up wandering around down South. \nI was passing through Charlotte, and I was in need of some premium breakfast noms. \nThe eggs bene was delicious. \nI especially liked the \"sassy apples.\" This inspired an inside joke which repeated itself endlessly for several days as my friend and I could not get over the idea that apples could, in fact, be 'sassy.'\nIf apples can be sassy, what can't be sassy?\n\nApproved nom-worthy. I may be back here someday!
