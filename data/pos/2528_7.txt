There's a reason this is considered the best free show in Vegas. I was jaded at first, and almost skipped it. 'Pfft, what's so special about a fountain?' I thought to myself. Then I saw the spectacle and changed my tune. \n\nLuckily any vantage point will be pretty good for viewing the show. Even on the side you will get to see everything. The sheer force of the hydraulics is impressive, and they have a few different choreographed shows so it doesn't get old fast. This is a Vegas staple, and not to be missed.
