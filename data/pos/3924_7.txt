Nicole is so fabulous that I flew all the way from San Francisco to have her cut my hair. Aside from the airfare, her price is extremely reasonable. I don't even have to check my hair in the mirror because she is so precise that she notices more than I do. The atmosphere is so cute and clean, the staff is nice. Best hair salon and stylist I've ever been to.
