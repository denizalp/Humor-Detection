Southside Tattoo has some really talented artists that churn out some great work. I am sympathetic to how busy the receptionist is, but every time I am in there, he is always rude and never particularly helpful or prompt.\n\nThe other day, my friend was hoping to get a tattoo walk-in, and Randy, the receptionist, told her she would have to make an appointment. We exited the shop, and my boyfriend was calling other tattoo parlors. He accidentally called Southside Tattoo, and Randy said they weren't busy. What? I don't understand.
