Okay, I've been living in Los Angeles for almost ten years...so, imma admit I have expectations when it comes to tacos.  Our tacos are akin to New York's hot dogs.  This place was just, meh.  30 minute wait prior to the Cavs game (which it is a block from the arena) and not a lot of personality...from the staff or the food.  Clevelanders: no these tacos are not amazing.  They are just tacos and they still took 20-30 minutes to create.
