Wow! Sorry you all had to come to work today and be put in the position to have to help anyone. Sorry all of you employees were so put out and inconvenienced by my presence in your store. All I wanted to do was place a balloon order. All you could do was tell me you were out of the balloon I wanted. Thanks for offering me an alternative. Oh wait! You didn't. Terrible awful customer service. Party City is too expensive to have such terrible service. I won't be back!
