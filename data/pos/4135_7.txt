They have GOT TO update this place! The ambiance at this location is on par with a Sizzler's. Fortunately, the meal was good.\n\nWhat we Had: (Party of three)\n\n2 orders of crab salad (Awesome!) Just PURE fresh crabmeat, lemon, and a sort of \"Louie\" dipping sauce. MMMMmmmmm\n1 order fried calamari\n1 wedge salad\n1 field greens with vinaigrette (YUM)\n1 chopped salad\n3 iced teas\nsteak\nfilet mignon\nlobster (very good, tender not rubbery or over-cooked)\nbroccoli au gratin (Yum)\nno dessert\n\nOnly got a glimpse of the bill, I think it was $261\n\n\n(Unless they're allergic to shellfish!)
