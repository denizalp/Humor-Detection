This is my favourite falafel place in Calgary. Staff is super friendly, prices are fair, service is usually pretty fast and they're open late on weekends. \n\nTheir tabouleh (salad made with tomatoes, onion, lots of parsley and olive oil) and deserts (especially the baklava) are also worth checking out.
