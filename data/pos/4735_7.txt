Came here for an event during the All Star weekend.  The venue is a decent size with room for movement.  It can be a bit hard to find.  Also there is parking around Downtown Toronto if you can find it and also deal with the bitter cold weather.  The 40z and Waffles event that took place here was a good experience and I enjoyed myself.  Located on King St which is good for walking and visting restaurants.  Great place for any event in Toronto.
