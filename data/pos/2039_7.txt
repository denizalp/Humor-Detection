I would have given it 4 stars but I feel like the staff hate their jobs and everything about their lives. I don't think I have seen anybody smile ever and i feel like I am an inconvenience when I walk in. When I ask questions about any item I get short answers and attitude. \n\nMost of their products are quite tasty which is what keeps me coming back. However, if I find a bakery that has equally tasty treats and nicer staff, I likely won't be back.
