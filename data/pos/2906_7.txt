A great place for Sunday breakfast....the tip is to get there before the crowd shows up.  \n\nSesame bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese may not sound creative, and it is not, but THE bagel is what makes this dish.  For anyone who's not had an authentic Montreal-style bagel, I can tell you that there is no better carb to bite into.  \n\nOrder a cappuccino or Viennese melange with your bagels, enjoy!\n\nThe cafe is located in the \"Plateau\" district of Montreal, it's fun to stroll around and on summer weekends, you can check out the street fair.
