Decent bar with a nice decor\n\nEspecially liked the big lounge area with plenty of couches and sitting space. The bar area was also pretty nice, with a couple of attractive ladies chilling and being hit on by other customers :) There was also a nice new pool table, and other people playing darts in the corner. There aren't a lot of customers because it's more of a suburb neighborhood bar, which is nice because you don't have to push and shove.\n\nOverall, a pretty cool bar with a nice vibe.
