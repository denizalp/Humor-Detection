Ashley is fantastic! Super friendly, professional, and is an expertise in what she does. She's flexible with scheduling appointments and always follows up with her clients.\n\nShe specializes in hair removal (waxing) and you can basically get anything waxed. Eyebrows, nostrils, arms, legs, bikini, brazilian - you name it.\n\nI was referred to Ashley from a few friends who went to her at her former salon\/location before she branched out on her own. I'm so glad I went with their recommendation! Will definitely be back to see Ashley the next time I need any type of wax.
