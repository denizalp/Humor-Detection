Seriously, how is this place so highly rated?! Waited 40mins for weeknight delivery LITERALLY 3 lights east on the same street! Potstickers were bland & the dough was so thick, they never had a chance to be crisp, even if they arrived in a timely matter.  Chicken chow mein was a joke, hardly any chicken or veggies. Just a mass of overcooked mush. I threw it away & I swear, even the trash complained. I think ramen nuked at the 711 wouldve been better. No worries, I will be recommending this place in the future.....to my enemies
