This is the second year Cabarrus Charter Academy upper school has been open and they've had their share of issues but with any new school there are things that need to be worked out in order for the school to reach optimal performance!  \n\nThere are some great teachers here and there were some who should have been closely evaluated before ever receiving a teaching license! \n\nWe can see the positive changes that were instituted over the summer, so we are back to give it another chance!
