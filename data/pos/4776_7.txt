As far as DMVs go, this is the BEST EVER.  It took exactly 22 minutes from when I walked in the door to when I walked out with my new PA ID.  There were a dozen people in front of me, too.  I went at noon on a weekday.  The most shocking part was that everyone was super nice--especially the man at the photo station.  Maybe I'm just jaded from the three hour waits with mean people at Duncan Manor, but this was a pleasant trip to the DMV.  Who knew that could happen?
