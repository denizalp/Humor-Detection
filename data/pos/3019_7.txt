Coming from someone who lives in the East Coast and completely devoid of In-N-Out. On our trip to Las Vegas, we had to stop at In and Out. \n\nThe staff are real friendly. Food is simply amazing for fast food. The burger is truly the best in terms of quality and value. The burgers are made fresh and never frozen, which is the best part. Then get the Animal Style Fries. \n\nThank you for having great fast food and please come to the EAST COAST!
