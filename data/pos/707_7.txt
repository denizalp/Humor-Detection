Great vinyl selection.  Decent used CD selection.  Their new CD selection could use some work...or maybe I'm just picky because I'm a prog-rock fan and all I saw while I was there was stuff that I could pick up at Best Buy.  \n\nThe \"music\" they were playing on the store system the day I was there was some annoying-ass avant-garde experimental crap that gave me an immediate headache.  \n\nWent in hoping to find stuff I couldn't find anywhere else...left disappointed.  The Exclusive Company has a better CD selection.  Go here only if you're looking for vinyl.
