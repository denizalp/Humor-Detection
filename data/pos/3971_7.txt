I was in charge of desserts for friends' new year's dinner, so naturally I got a whole bunch of kouign amann (my fave pastry ever) from the boulangerie.\n\nWe ended up not having enough to split among the group because I ate one too many before bringing the pastries to dinner... then I lied about having never had the boulangerie's kouign amann so my poor french friends would ration me the last piece on the table.\n\nAm I going to hell for all the gluttony and lies?
