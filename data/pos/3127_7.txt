They get a one star because of mismanagement. The first time I came for lunch I was turned away, they said they were closed on Mondays, but had an open sign out front. The second time was today when I showed up a few minutes before 2 pm and they refused service because they close at 2 pm. I don't care who you are or how good your food is, it's bad on you when your customer service is that poor. I won't be returning.
