Ive been living in Vegas for a year and only went to one other salon  before finding Hypnotic and have never had a bad cut..\n\nI get my hair cut every two weeks and the staff and owners are very friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nI recommend Ben to all my friends  for both male and female hair but but all the stylist are very good.\n\nThanks Hypnotic! and Ben
