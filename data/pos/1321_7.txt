So glad to have a nearby theater which features 14 separate cinemas. I visited on the second day of the grand opening. Friendly staff, comfortable  rocket seating ( sorry no reclining),  great wide screens, senior discounts.\n I asked if I had  a loyalty card which one should present at each visit. Free popcorn on this grand opening weekend. I heard there will be a senior priced movie day as well as discounted  children's movie day.Will update for the future.\n\n\nA great asset to Indian Land
