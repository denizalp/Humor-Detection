Love this place. Particularly the hidden bar. This is a very non Vegas place. Bar tender remembers your fave drink and it feels like a 'local' place to be. Food is tasty and the staff are the same faces each time. Love being able to come to a place that I know people.  Very Italian welcoming feel. Great work guys!!!!
