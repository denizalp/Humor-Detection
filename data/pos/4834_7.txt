Have only tried their Muffins here.  I was in a rush to get to my gate and they happened to have the shortest line.  The service was very slow even though there was only one person in front of me....crazy.  The person working there was friendly though.  The Muffin was so\/so.  I was expecting much better since I've had their Cookies at one of their Scottsdale locations and they were phenomenal.  Oh well, will have to give it another shot sometime.\n\nReturn Factor - 64%
