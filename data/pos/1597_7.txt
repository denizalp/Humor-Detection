The complimentary papadum and pickled carrots were really good. The papadum had a nice smoky flavour to it. I'm not usually a papadum fan, but I'm sold on these!\n\nOverall, their portions of food are quite good, and the lamb korma was delicious. The naan were fresh with a light crisp to it, and the rice paired well with their curries.\n\nI would definitely come back for more Agra Fine Indian Cuisine.
