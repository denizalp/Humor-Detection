Love a Garden Center. There I said it. Could seriously do a lot of damage here. Or to my bank account.\n\nI love the set up of this store, so many areas to explore, lots of colour and definitely lots to look at. Rows and rows of beautiful plants, it's so serene.\n\nThe prices are fair. When we've needed help it's been there. We've even had one of their landscaping guys come out and give us some yard redesign ideas. Very friendly, very helpful.\n\nDefinitely a place I will return to again and again.
