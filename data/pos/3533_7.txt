Was I on a date? She just looked at me when the bill came. There was no offer to split the bill. The look in her eye forced the words, \"I got it\" out of my mouth and I paid the bill. I had gotten a design internship that summer. It was half a weeks pay. Maybe it was a date so maybe it was okay. We went out to a bar afterwards and she went home with someone else.
