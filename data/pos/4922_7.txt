Was visiting from out of town when I stumbled across this little oasis in the desert.  Upon entry I immediately felt like I walked into the Batcave.  It's dark in here!  After feeling my way around the store, and squinting through the decent amount of current and back issues, I picked up a few comics and headed for the light.  I downloaded a flashlight app on my phone, so I'm all set for the next time I visit.
