This is an average spa at best. Massage was good but during the process I didn't feel comfortable as the therapist was too hard on my body. I also had my pedicures here, with which I was not impressed. I enjoyed hot tub and steam room and tea room, but service was not as stellar. This spa is also very crowded, and worstly there is subway tunnel  right underneath, which shakes the whole place whenever train passes by. But you know what, the vibration from subway tunnel relaxed me more than the therapist's reckless massage
