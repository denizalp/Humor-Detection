Herbs, crystals, and occult texts, oh my! This little shop has it all, along with small gift items like handmade soaps, earrings, and carved wooden figures. The loose crystal selection has mostly smaller, basic rocks but they are affordably priced. There's also a small make-your-own-charms section with small beads and figurines.\n\nThe shop carries it's own line of essential oils and blends, along with some locally-sourced candles and incense. I believe you can order many of their items online, but doing that would keep you from experiencing the unique old-bookstore atmosphere that I really enjoyed.
