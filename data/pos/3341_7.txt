Love the deals here!!! We shop here all the time and you can get some GREAT deals on more high priced items that you would find in Macy's or other more upscale stores. \nDefinately NOT Walmart quality here! BUT, you get great high quality stuff at the Walmart prices!!\nI didn't give them 5 Stars only because every once in a while, I have to return an item because it was a \"second.\" Other than that, I don't think it is the norm to get \"seconds\" there...
