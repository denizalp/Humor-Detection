Long running and still standing fountain show.  Streams of high powered dancing water cannons shoot and sway in the air.  Timed to classical, vintage Vegas and patriotic music the spectacle can be seen from the strip directly in front of Bellagio or viewed on the street or from the valet fountain viewing areas.  Whenever you're done blowing the kids college funds on the 1 armed bandits or blowing your wad at the strip clubs, it's nice to get something for free right?
