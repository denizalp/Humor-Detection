What can you say about a Subway other than this is one of the most upscale locations I have been to. Large dining area with both high tables and regular tables, nice comfortable chairs and an area of overstuffed chairs arranged to make for good conversation.\n\nVery modern decor on the inside.\n\nAs far as the food, it's a very well run Subway with minimal wait and excellent sandwiches as a result.\n\nVery friendly staff.
