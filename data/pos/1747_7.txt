The steak in my tacos were drowning in sauce\/marinade---drowning.  Of course, I got through it and ate every bite (I always do), but definitely not worth $28.  That's right you heard me, $28 for three mediocre tacos.  I don't think any taco is worth $28--ever.  What possessed me to order those????  Hunger does strange things to the mind.  Not worth it and I was mad all night that I ruined my dinner on the \"so not worth it, $28 tacos.\"
