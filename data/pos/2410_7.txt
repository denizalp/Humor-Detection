The 4 is really for dessert. lol \n\nMaybe I've been to Vegas way too much, but all buffets seem the same to me in Vegas. Why I come here? Crab Legs & Dessert. \n\nMy tip: show up towards end of lunch hour, pay lunch price and enjoy both lunch and dinner! :) \n\nOverall good variety of food. I'm sure I'll be back.
