Where else can you find a can of green tea above frozen bull pizzle.\n\nThis place is pretty awesome!\n\nIf you are a vegetarian, avoid the back of the store.  Lots of living fish, smelly dead fish, & constant sawing of meat with some kind of power saw.\n\nLots of great looking fresh produce.  Stuff is cheap too!!\n\nTONS of Asian sauces & seasonings.\n\nA whole isle dedicated to tea.\n\nMajor plus between May & September - Underground parking!!
