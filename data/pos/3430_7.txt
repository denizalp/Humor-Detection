Ordered two triple decker BLT there was two pieces of bacon on the bottom layer and one tomato with the core left in and a piece of brown lettuce. The fries were burnt it was honestly disgusting they were black like they had been in the fryer all day two days even. Just for reference in the photo the fries are not seasoned they are just charred
