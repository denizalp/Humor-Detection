GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!\n\nI paid $39 for an hour of foot massage.\n\nTwo words: long fingernails.\n\nFirst, she worked on my scalp. It felt like my dog scratching my head.\n\nNext, she worked on my arms and legs. She has only two pressures: barbaric and useless. I felt like she sprained my right wrist.\n\nFinally, my foot massage. Didn't even last one minute.\n\nAnd, she had the audacity to ask for tip. I gave her $5.00 just so she wouldn't chase me out the door.\n\nI could have done a better job massaging myself. For free.
