No matter how badly I rate this sorry excuse of an establishment, it won't make a difference because it has a cherry location and will always have customers no matter what.\n\nThat being said, the food was mediocre and the customer service was the worst I've encountered in this city.\n\nI can't go into details about my experience without sounding like a bigot, so I'll just say this restaurant is a disappointment.
