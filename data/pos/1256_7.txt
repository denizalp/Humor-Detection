We came with a group of friends and had a nice time. Service was attentive. I had the lobster and corn ravioli, the BF had the chicken parmesean, and we shared the meatballs. We were happy with everything. The ravioli was easily the favorite. The lobster was tender and succulent and the corn added a really nice hint of sweetness. The chicken parmesean was good but a much heavier dish. The meatballs were great. Everyone else seemed happy with their dishes too, so a win-win! I would recommend.
