WORTH EVERY PENNY!\n\nI love tall heels but alas, I have back problems that prevent me from wearing anything higher than 2.5\" without enduring some serious pain.  Enter Christian Louboutin.  I don't know how they do it, but these are the most comfortable 3 inchers I have ever worn in my life.  I wore my brand new pair out to dinner and a nightclub.  Seven hours later I had no blisters and even more miraculously, my back didn't hurt.  I'm telling you - they're magic shoes.\n\nOh yeah, and they look fabulously sexy, too.
