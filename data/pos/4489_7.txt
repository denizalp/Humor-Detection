Ok food.  I have been here 4-5 times since I moved here.  I like diners and this feels like an old time diner.  The food is edible if not great.  \n\nToday however will be my last visit.  The way I was  treated by the hostess made me turn around and leave.  I was headed for becoming a regular in spite of the fair to middling food and prices.  But she gave me the push I needed to find something better.  For these prices, I can definitely do better
