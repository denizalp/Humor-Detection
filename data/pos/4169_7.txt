I'm glad Sergio Rossi isn't as trendy as some other high-end heels. These are classy and sexy! Chicks think Louboutins are where it's at...no...every escort in Vegas sports them red bottoms. Rossi shoes are superb!  \n\nI have been dealing with Kay Armstrong for years. She is a gem!! She knows her product and gives world class client services! Make sure to ask for her and you'll see what the fuss is about.
