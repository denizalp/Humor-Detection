So I just called to try to book an appointment and the lady said they do not accept my \"Catch Fred\" coupon anymore. Apparently because the \"original\" owners closed down and they reopened (but under the same name). Somehow I don't believe them?? So basically they're telling me that they will not take my coupon. \n\nI am so pissed. I also find that these CatchFred guys are not alive anymore so can't get refund. I hate them. Damnit.
