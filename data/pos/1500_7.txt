This guy is a riot. He swoops into Uptown only a few days per week, but his little cart is jammed the whole time. Most of his products are homemade, home marinated, or home smoked, and definitely worth the effort. He has the awards to prove it. Ask him about any of the meats and he'll tell you the painstaking process that he went through to prepare it. But don't ask if you don't have time - each answer comes with a heaping side of Charlotte lore and Southern storytelling.
