Not coming back. Got a haircut I didn't want. He even lined my front edge. I NEVER GET MY FRONT EDGED!!!\n\nHe didn't even ask. Said I should have told him. It was NOT what I wanted. I will continue to look elsewhere.\n\nThe journey is long and treacherous at times. But a good barber is hard thing to find!
