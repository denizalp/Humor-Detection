I ordered two pizzas from here today for delivery. I was told 30-40 min as is standard. \nAfter 50min I called back and asked where my delivery was, and I was told the driver left 25min ago. I live about 0.5km away according to google. The person on the phone told be to wait 5-10min more. After 1hr and 40 min total the delivery driver showed up, and I refused to pay, so he left. Can't comment on the food quality but the service sucks.
