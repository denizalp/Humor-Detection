Encore Beach Club was NOT my cup of tea.\n\n$50 for Admission. Special DJ. I do not who it was, but jeez!\n\nI knew I should have research before going over there. Big MISTAKE! \n\nThe music was horrible. All you heard was EDM. \n\nHow can people listen to that for hours?! I was going insane just listening to it for 2hrs! \n\nIt was so bad I didn't care about the $50 - I just left.\n\nIt's big, but the setup is NOT the greatest. \n\nI went. I saw. I conquered.
