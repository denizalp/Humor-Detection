We went there with 2 other family , the food were nice , the surprise when the bill came he charged a flat charge of 30$ per person and this isn't a open buffet but more like a set menu of arabic mezza and grills not only this they charged all children above 6 yrs full price !!!!! . Cut a story short it is a rip off never will go back there . Don't recommend at all
