Vanilla bean custard was so light and delicious, i don't like over doing it for breakfast and the crepe was just the perfect level of sweetness and the portion was good too, very tasty, the service was very good and they even got us granola before we ate as a starter, and dark chocolate for dessert after we ate for free since it was our first time there. Very nice staff :)
