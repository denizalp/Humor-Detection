First off... I'm a guy!  No, not the manscapping kind of guy.  I have been going here for about 2 years also.  \nIt is a perfect combination of great stylist with a little edge and professional polish.  It is not the glam and bling fashion show set up of so many salons.\nNot pretentious... but they could be.  They are that good.\n\nShoot me a message if your going so I can refer you and get the kick back!!!
