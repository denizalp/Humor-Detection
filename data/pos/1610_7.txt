Great food, service, and ambience!\n\nDuring our first weekend as residents of Arizona, we stopped by old town & Nonna's. As it was a spontaneous stop, we did not have reservations. However, we were seated almost immediately in the outdoor area.\n\nThe waitress (I wish I remembered her name) was very sweet and told us all about the area. She told us about different neighborhoods, local attractions, and even the real estate market! \n\nAs we stopped in after dinner, we just ordered few cocktails and appetizers. Everything was delicious! \n\nCan't wait to be back! We're loving Arizona and the friendly crowd!
