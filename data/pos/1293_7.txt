Yelp challenge 2016 (7\/100)\n\nI came here after an open bar sesh on the High Roller. Wow I think I was in drunchie heaven.  \n\nThe menu items all sounded so good.. We got the Brisket Nachos, Mac n Cheese Bacon burger, and the Motley Que Pulled Pork Sandwich! There was so much food too that we couldn't finish it all either!\n\nMy favorite was the Mac n Cheese Bacon burger and I really liked the Brisket Nachos! Our server was really friendly and attentive
