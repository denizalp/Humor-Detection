I almost died when I walked in here, but instead, I wanted to go broke. This was the case until I realized that my husband was standing next to me perplexed by the $700 pricepoint of these fabulous red-soled shoes. He didn't understand, he didn't get it, so he didn't condone it. In the end, I left alive, with my credit card un-maxed, but crying deep inside for a pair of Louboutins.\n\nBTW, they do actually have a decent sale selection with pumps that I saw starting from $399. Check it.
