Clay, the owner, saw my less-than-stellar review on Yelp. He sent me a private message letting me know their Scottsdale location does serve alcohol. He also offered to send me a gift card if I emailed him my info. I emailed him, but he never followed up so I never got my gift card. That was last year so he's had plenty of time to send it.
