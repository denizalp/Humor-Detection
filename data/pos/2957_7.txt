Excellent brunchy atmosphere with great service and generous plates of tasty options. Breakfast has plenty of choices, including healthy, detoxifying juices. I got the L.E.O. lox bagel with scrambled eggs while hubby got the huevos rancheros skillet, another time getting the spicy tofu scramble and three egg breakfast. The skillets took the spotlight of course, with its combination of flavorful items coming together to make a gluttonous dream come true. Also enjoyed the Beet Machine and Immunity Booster juices, both excellent and fresh.
