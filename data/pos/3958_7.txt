This spot is a game changer for Phoenix! They've got unique popsicles and tea drinks. The store looks super clean with fun walls and merchandise! It's great to visit a shop like this. I had the mint chocolate chip bar dipped in white chocolate. Then we ordered the rose tea with the green boba. The drinks were really easy to drink. The service was awesome as they walked around the counter to take our orders. Very impressed\n\nRecommendation: Mint chocolate chip popsicle!
