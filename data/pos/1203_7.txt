I don't know if it's because it's the only restaurant that's poolside or because I've been coming here for so long but i really like this place for a casual meal.\n\nMy favorite is the asian chicken salad but i also love the chicken tenders, coconut shrimp, fruit plate & sliders.\n\nAll simple food but still good. \n\nThe view doesn't hurt either...
