Called the restaurant ahead of time and was pleased to know they are BYO friendly.  This family owned establishment was very welcoming and accommodating. The food was great, and we are in love with the Naan.  Every flavor was devoured and the kids begged for more. The kids stuck to the fairly mainstream items, only cause that's what they like.  Love their sauces and Tikka Masala.  FYI closed Mondays....they day I always crave it.
