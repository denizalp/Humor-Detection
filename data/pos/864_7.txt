Great Satay and pretty good Pad Thai!\n\nWhat really got me though was how much Guy Fieri I saw.... as if he didn't already haunt all of our dreams already!\n\nAs I dined on my chicken pad Thai noodles slowly turned into his frosted tips and that's all I could think about. \n\nOverall Wild Thai was a good experience but, even a little bit of Guy Fieri is A LOT.
