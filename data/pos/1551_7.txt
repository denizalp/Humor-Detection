My Dear Olive and Ivy.....\nI have such a love\/hate relationship with you! \nYour egg sandwich and vanilla latte is what I live for on Saturdays. Your bacon-wrapped dates are sweet & salty satisfaction.Your short ribs make me lick the bowl. Oh, and your apple fritters (but more like beignets) force another 30 minutes at the gym. They're like sweet powdery kisses on my lips! \nBut your service (typically) sucks!!! More often than not....it sucks...sucks....sucks! Now, that I've told you how I really feel.... Lol! \n\nBon Appetite!
