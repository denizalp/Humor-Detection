OK so I am a SPG platinum member, and I have suite nights to burn.  I didn't quite expect they will give me the prime minister suite... The view out to the Lake is amazing from the 35th floor, and all that for a normal room rate.\n\nToo bad I am staying here by myself... it's too big a suite for one person to enjoy... anyone wants to party at my place?
