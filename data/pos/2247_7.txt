This mall is located near my office and sometimes I head here to do a little shopping on my lunch break or right after work. I always end up spending way more money than I intend to here because I tend to duck into stores when I hear escalated yelling between two groups of obnoxious future GED recipients. This happens a lot.\n\nPros: Forever 21 (closest besides it is AZ mills), Macys, Victoria's Secret.\nCons: Chick Fil-A closed, Unusually high risk of filling out some sort of police report.
