Shoe ORGASM.\n\nSERIOUSLY.  \n\nBlinged out sandals & flats.\nLeather is the MOST supple I've felt from any shoe designer.\nDesigns are very flattering on the foot, strategically covering unattractive areas.\nGreat height, but still comfortable.\nService is quick & efficient, great efforts are made to ensure the correct fit.\n\nGripes: the seating is communal, one large leather curved bench.  I don't like feeling every vibration from other's setting their tushes down.  Also, the space b\/t the bench and the shoe display was too small, creating some tense moments between competitive clients.\n\nI walked out with THREE pairs and didn't blink twice.
