I've only been here twice, but I can confidently say there's nothing wrong with this place. \nGoodness:\n1. The smells\n2. The tea\n3. The smoothies!! (Cucumber!! Gosh, soo good!)\n4. The service\n5. The seating\n6. The fire!!!\n7. The door. I mean, come on. That's reason enough to just go inside!\n\nSummary: Love.
