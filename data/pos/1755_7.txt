Another amazing show by Cirque du Soleil. Other than Zumanity, we have greatly enjoyed their various Vegas and traveling shows. Love is near the top of the list. O is still the standard bearer but Love was just wonderful.\n\nThe lights, sounds, robotic stages, artists and, of course, the timeless music. Simply a wonderful experience for the eyes, ears and soul. A very intimate theater with a spectacular production.
