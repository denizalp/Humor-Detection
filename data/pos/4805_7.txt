I love this location! \n\nThey have alot of great treasures..and for only a dollar! \n\nThey have great snacks in the freezer section such as Hot Pockets,Jalapeno Cheese Poppers, Ice Cream, Veggies, Half & Half Etc... \n\nGreat candy selection almost any candy you could think of. \n\nYou name it they have it..cleaning supplies, food, personal care,party item's, and holiday stuff. \n\nThere's only one employee I like here hes a middle aged chubby guy hes awesome and has a great personality all the other employees obviously hate their jobs and definitely show it.
