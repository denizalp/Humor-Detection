Absolutely solid Korean food.\n\nMy go-to here is the deaji soondubu (spicy pork tofu soup). Of course all meals come with banchan. Everytime I have been here it has always been fairly crowded, mostly with Koreans.\n\nService can be a bit slow at times but the food is well worth the wait and I look forward to trying other menu items :)
