First off you don't expect much going to this place? Right? OMG I'm compelled to write a review because they have best perogies, cabbage roll, & cabbage noodles, I ever had hands down! The chicken noodle soup is beyond mind blowing good! & the prices are cheap & the meals are satisfying! I would come back again! My mother in law said this meal reminds of her mothers cooking! She almost cried! Try it for yourself! I'm so glad I came here & it was by accident!
