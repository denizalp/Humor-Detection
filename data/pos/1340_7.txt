This was the weirdest couples massage EVER. the massage itself was good I guess. The atmosphere and everything else was like something from the twilight zone. The employees at the front are so unprofessional. They were arguing loudly in front of us while we waited for our appointment. Also when it was the end and we had to fill out a survey (also very strange) I kid you not-6 employees stood around us while we decided how much to tip. No\ntact whatsoever. Never again.
