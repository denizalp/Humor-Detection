Show starts at 8pm, door opens at 7:30pm. No big crowd into the theater, no wait line. Ushers are all standby to guide you to the seats. Small theater, all the seats are good seat. \n\nLove the state setup, get you into the Hollywood atmosphere. \n\nThe show is super entertaining!! All the familiar songs in the 80's. We can definitely sing along. \n\nNot only good music but a few comedy moments too. They make the show fun & interesting. Definitely get my attention for the whole 2 hours show.
