Good place to start a bar fight in the West valley.  However, there are bouncers, and the crowd is quite young, and it can be loud... but I love the fried appetizers during the daytime happy hour.  Parking isn't so bad during the day, and there's usually a few good tables available.  I thought they were open earlier in the morning than 11 am but my memory is a little fuzzy.
