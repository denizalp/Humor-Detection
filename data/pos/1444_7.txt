We went to this Restuarant for brunch. This place is beautiful, really nicely decorated & has a nice view of the poolside. \n\nThe food on the other hand wasn't all that. Alferedo was our waiter, he was very rude & crude. \nWe ordered the truffle omelette, pastry basket & egg Benedict. All plates were not very tasty & very mediocre. \nThe coffee was terrible, tasted like hot water with sugar in it. I then ordered the latte & it was better. \nI would not go back to this place anymore.
