An update:\n\nThe cake inside was surprisingly good, BUT the icing was Horrible. It was like dried up toothpaste hard not the light delicious whip cream I asked for. I thought the big 6 balls of icing had fruit inside of it but no it was a tease... it was just to make the top look more fuller so they didn't have to add more fruits.. Cheap place!!!   I still wouldn't Ever go here.
