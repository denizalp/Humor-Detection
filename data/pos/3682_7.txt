Awesome Gym, Love going there for teh cleanliness, the washrooms, the huge selection of different sports and activities offered. My two main issues though would be that there are simply too many kids during rush hours. The other concern I have is other activities like boxing, pilates, etc are priced at extremely high amounts. Im not sure what the point of being a member is if they are not going to accomodate for us a little considering I pay an arm and a leg to be there. \n\nYoga is awesome, instructors are great.
