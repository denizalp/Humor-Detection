Late night hazy memory food! Sooooo I can't tell you all that much about it but my gut feeling is of fondness. I think I had a club sandwich? Who knows?!\n\nI also remember my waiter being this german dude who could have been straight out of central casting as a member of Hydra in Captain America. He was super nice though, not saying he's like in Hydra or anything... or like is actually the Red Skull. Definitely not saying that.
