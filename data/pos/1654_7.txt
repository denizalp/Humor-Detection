Two words: TACO TUESDAY!\n\nTecate beer - $2.00\nBeef Taco - $1.00\nALL DAY\n\nThis place was packed.  Live music started at about 9pm.  I have to be honest...I only had the beef tacos (they were a dollar each!) and a beer...I did sample my friends Margs and they are delicious...each one handmade, no mixes!  And there is a pomegranate tequila you must try.\n\nYou have to go on Tuesday night!
