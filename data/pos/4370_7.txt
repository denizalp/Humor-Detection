This is not a French patisserie, don't go here looking for typical buttery Montreal croissants, you can find those elsewhere. Do grab a bag of the fresh little rugalach in chocolate and poppyseed - these are especially awesome little bite-sized buddies for roadtrips. Great cheese danish, lots of special yummy stuff around the high holidays if you are willing to brave the crowds. A tiny spot packed with love and goodness.
