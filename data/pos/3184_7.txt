Delicious but not $50 delicious. \n\nStopped here for breakfast and while we enjoyed the smoothies and toasts, it was not worth the price. That's more than I spend on my groceries for a whole week. I know food on the strip is expensive, but this was outrageous. Plus there is no where to sit to enjoy the food.
