YAY! First one to leave a review for Dr. Martin!\n\nI had my first visit yesterday afternoon. I HATE dentist visits, but the staff here was efficient, professional, and all lent to a great experience. \n\nThere were no \"high pressure\" upsells like I have experienced at other recent dentist office visits. \n\nI highly recommend this dentist!
