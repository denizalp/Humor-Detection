The tacos I ordered here at happy hour - fried avocado, carne asada, and pastor - were very good, the most enjoyable for me being the fried avocado. The tortillas were piled high with filling, making for messy but fun eating. Service was very friendly and the place had the typical noisy energy of a sports bar in a college town. The only issue here for me is the same for any establishment in the Mill Avenue - namely, finding a place to park is quite a challenge.
