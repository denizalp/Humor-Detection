Finally got to try the Jojo's food truck and thank god I did! \n\nTheir beef brisket sandwich was tender, flavoured just right, and just plain delicious. But what wins the award is the jalapeno fries. *GASP* How come no one ever thought of this before??? The fries were perfectly cut, perfectly crispy and had that perfect little kick to it that the jalapenos provided. In fact, I dont think I can go back to regular fries again after tasting these little tastebombs. Yes, I might have just made this word up.\n\nOne of my food truck favourites! Woohoo! \n\n\n13\/30
