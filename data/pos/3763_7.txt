This event was a scam!!!! What a waste of money. This event basically scammed you of your money, the bundle I purchased was useless and it claimed to have over 100 vendors on their website but that was a lie. There was probably 10 at most and I kept looking around for certain vendors that didn't even exist there. Such a joke. Worst foodie event I have ever been to.
