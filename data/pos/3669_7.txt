Got quote on repairing my Benz.  Asked why installing this particular additional item takes an hour of labor.  Guy said that installation takes at least an hour.  Confirmed that had not started installation, then authorized installation.  Guy thought that I wasn't going to wait in waiting area.  Mechanic came back about 12 minutes later to advise the guy I was speaking with that vehicle ready.  Paid the guy and let him know I'm not coming back.
