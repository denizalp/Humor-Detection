I was grumpy this morning (running errands in the snow!) so I stopped at the Starbucks across from the Northland Village Mall.  My mood didn't improve when I found out they were out of the kind of tea I wanted.  No big deal, I'll have a soy latte.  Oh, they were also out of soy milk.  Ummm... I'll take a water?  Unfortunately the bar where they stock lids and condiments was not tidy, nor did I think there was appropriate seating.  I've still got lots of holiday Starbucks cards to use, but I'll be going to other locations!
