It is unfortunate that the Lakewood Village Tavern is located next door to Grafton Street Pub. Comparing the two really shows off the Village's flaws. Grafton Street Pub is a lot hipper, laid back, and over all less annoying. The Village Tavern is filled with hambone white hats (seriously, who still wears those?) and hooknasties. It is a little dirty, too. They do serve food, which Grafton Street Pub does not. However, would you really want to eat it? It is a less classy version of the Merry Arts.
