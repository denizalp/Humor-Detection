One of our cars needed an emission inspection recently and we came here on a Saturday afternoon.  That's right!  Saturday afternoon!\n\nWe had three cars ahead of us, and after a short stay inside, we gave our small contribution of $27.75 to Gov. Brewer folks at Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) and we were on our way.  No fuss, no muss.\n\nNice!
