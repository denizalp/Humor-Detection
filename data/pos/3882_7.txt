Consistently the worst subway sandwich. I don't know where they get there training from because it is nothing like any other subway I have ever been to. They just straight suck at making sandwiches, can't cut the bread worth shit, just toss everything in so it all falls out when you try to eat it. I hate going there but it is close so i do once in a while but it is always a shity sandwich. Go to the one on ASU campus downstairs in the MU, they have there shit together.
