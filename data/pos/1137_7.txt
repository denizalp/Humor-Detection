Super clean store, with great service. \n\nTypical Target with pretty a good selection of all kinds of things from household items to clothes as well as electronics and snacks of all kinds.\n\nCustomer service is fantastic. Jesus is always on top of things and makes returns easy and quick!\n\nThere is a Starbucks also if you're interested as well.\n\nGood location in Boca Park.\n\nI definitely recommend! Enjoy :)
