Great experience with Laguna. The pool was completed two weeks early and exceeded our expectations. We even referred several friends to Laguna without hesitation.  All have been extremely happy with their pools, BBQ's and service from Dewey and his crew.  This is an Old School Vegas company and remembers the value of a great product, great service and word of mouth referrals.
