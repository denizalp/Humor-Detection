All of the previous ravings remain the same. If you haven't been yet, go. Like, right now. Get in the car and go find your bliss in the form of hot dogs and onion rings. There's even another location in Ballantyne now, so if you're not near East Blvd, you still don't have an excuse. If you keep missing this representation of heaven on earth, it's your own fault. I'm on your team, so I only want the best for you and this is the one of the best places to do a hot dog.
