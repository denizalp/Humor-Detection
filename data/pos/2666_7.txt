I remember going there a couple of years back and being BLOWN AWAY by the food here. We're talking transcendent, metaphysical, God-spake-from-the-cloudtops kind of experience.\nI was just there for brunch last weekend and it was more like a Presbyterian service. Nice, but the heavens didn't exactly open up.
