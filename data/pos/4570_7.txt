Decent gym but way too much white trash and thugs ruining a nice place. Not as bad as the one by Metro center, but still noticeable. I had my had car window smashed and items stolen, which isn't the fault of this gym, but it shows you who comes here.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent gym, it's better than average. But 2 years from now, it could be all be ghettoville. Oh, and there's rarely ever hot women here. Just like almost every other bar, gym or store in Glentucky.
