The Green Valley Grocery #43 is also a Shell Gas Station which is why I mostly go to this location to get gas. It's a good place right off the Sunset exit on the 95 freeway. So if you're in the area and need a good Shell gas station to fill up to drop by here. The in-store grocery area is also good to do convenient shopping and the prices are fair.
