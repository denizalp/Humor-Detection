This store has just about everything you could ask for in a Wal-Mart. For example the have an optometrist, a lawn and garden center, grocery's a pick up center for online purchases. They even have a Subway sandwich shop inside. This place is definitely going to give Costco, SAM's Club and Target a run for the money. This is an extra convenient location for Mountains Edge people like myself. I will be doing a lot of shopping here from now on.
