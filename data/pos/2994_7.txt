I love this place and come here every time we're in Vegas.\n\nIf you come during happy hour they have lots of apps for a reduced price.  We got the chicken wings and they were delicious.  For entree I got the conquest sando with onion rings.  The place was piled high with meat the overflowing with onion rings.  Portions are huge!\n\nDrinks are strong and customer service is outstanding.  The decor is tacky but thats what I love about this place.\n\nEasy parking and great for after the club or late night dining.
