I just wanted ice cream and I tried a lot of flavors.  Coffee lacked in coffee flavor.  I got the dulce de leche.  The sample tasted great but after awhile, the taste of it was too sweet.  It cost almost $5 for a tiny scoop.  The store itself is really cute and I would go to browse around but probably find ice cream elsewhere
