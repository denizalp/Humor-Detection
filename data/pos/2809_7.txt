The place to go to if you are hungry for a home cooked meal yet lack the time and energy to prepare it yourself.  Traditional meals feature meatloaf, roast beef and are served with all the trimmings.\nThe dining room is small with plenty of staff on hand.\nI noticed a good bit of warm conversations taking place among the staff and the regular customers.\nProbably not the place to go if you prefer having a private conversation during your meal.\nCash only but there is an ATM available.
