Came there because I purchased a groupon months ago. This place has too much drama going on. The lady who took care of me hasn't even graduated from beauty school yet. She didn't know how to do nails at all... My polish peeled that same day when I washed my hands. She also couldn't stop talking about her lady boss being a b*tch. It was a waste of time and money. \n\nLesson learned: Check reviews before buying a groupon deal. \nI would rate this place zero if yelp has that option.
