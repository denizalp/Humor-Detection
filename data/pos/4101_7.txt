Not sure why this place is rated so high. I wasn't impressed by the food. Tonkastu ramen broth was super greasy, bad flavor, and not hot enough. The bun was not fresh and fulffy. The table is tiny, so you need to move your food all over the place while eating.  but giving the Pork bun filling is very delicious, I would give this place another try later. Perhaps, I can try ramen in another flavor and ask for extra hot broth.\n\nLove their bowls and dishes tho,  very nice quality.
