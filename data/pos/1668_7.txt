How much fun is this place?  The metro area needs more of these.  A car wash, gas station, convenience store, wine shop, gift shop, and BBQ caf√©?!?!  What the heck?  Pinch me!  We picked up some great gifts for upcoming birthdays and some funny things for my husband's fishing trip, and a few beverages for the road.  The food I saw looked excellent.  If we weren't on a mission to Cave Creek, we would have lingered longer.  Now I'm looking for a reason to go back.  Great place!
