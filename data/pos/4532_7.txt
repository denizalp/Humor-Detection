A co-worker showed up with a box of donuts from this place today. I thought I would be good and just indulge in a half ... that half donut was the best I've ever had in my whole life. \n\nSeriously.\n\nI don't know if it's just because I never eat donuts, but it was utterly the most perfect donut my mouth has ever had the pleasure of tasting. \n\nNeedless to say, I ate the other half.
