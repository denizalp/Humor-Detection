Coming from Arizona where they have the mothership of all Asian Market stores in Lee Lee I was a little disappointed with the International Supermarket. The organization was poor and the store looked like it was clean by a sight impaired janitor. There are many wonderful products (though the produce was tired looking and we did not try the meats) but it took a long to find things because the signs are confusing. However the prices were good.\n\nOh another thing, our car nearly disappeared in a pot hole in the parking lot.
