I've been back a handful of times since my review and I felt the need to update it.\n\n- Service has almost always been very nice and friendly. Smiling faces from the moment you enter until you leave. \n- They have not been stingy with the portions. This is huge for me. For other places I've been to in the area it has been a deal breaker. (*cough*KFC*cough)\n- prices are fair for what you get...especially since they aren't cheap with the portions!\n\nThis place is back on my radar. I will be back!\n\n3 solid stars and rising...\n\nA-Ok!
