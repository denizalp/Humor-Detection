I was very impressed by this place.  I was waiting for my to-go order of wonton soup from Cafe Noodle and I decided to check this place out.\n\nVery nice and helpful Korean lady - not sure she was the owner\/baker.  She was cool though.  Very clean, and lots of choices.\n\nI haven't had better almond cookies then the ones here and also I really like their green tea cookies which are not super-sweet and have a strong green tea flavor. \n\nNow I always stop by here any time I am picking up wonton soup from downstairs.
