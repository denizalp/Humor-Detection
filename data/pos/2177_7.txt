I have been going to the Polish Festival every year since they held it ar their old church in Sunnyslope. OMG! I dont k ow whether it's because it reminds me og my gma's cooking or what but that food is mighty delicious. In the same respect, to get excellent polish sausage and real sauerkraut head to (Sunnyslope OR) the downtown Phx or Roadrunner's farmers markets for a taste of 'home.' They have stuffed cabbage, pirogues, and many other polish baked goods\/sweets.\n\nFinally, like (the homeland) their establishment is owned\/operated by a husband\/wife team.\n\nTry their wares.
