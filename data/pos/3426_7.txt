I do stop by here more often than not just to grab coffee and then wind up walking about to get thing I possibly dont need. The service is of course not anything worth writing about and like reviewer said before me I almost never asked for help and when I do hunt them down and ask for help they have no clue ! Oh well.. its close to work and they do have coffee...
