I think I am in love with Mia.  I am that person that is so apprehensive to dental care that I have literally jumped up out of the seat during a cleaning and left.  They are very professional and Mia, in particular, was excellent with my teeth cleaning.  I was going to take a star away for being persuaded to buy a $50 combo of toothpaste and rinse... but I will chalk that up to it being part of the business. My experience was so great that I cannot possibly seeing giving this great business less than 5 stars.
