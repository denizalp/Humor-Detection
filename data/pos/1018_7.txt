Worse experience ever! They ruined our wedding day. The driver never showed up so we missed almost all our family pictures on our wedding day. Even worse, the owner claimed no responsibility and charged us the full amount anyways. We've been fighting with the credit card company for months. The owner stopped returning my calls and emails.
