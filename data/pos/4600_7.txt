Bargain Hunters makes me happy, first of all most racks of clothing are by size. Oh my stars in heaven, this makes thrifting so much easier.\n\nEverything that I liked was $1 or $2, this is what a thrift store should be, I get sick of $3.50 for a t-shirt, and I am not joking. Sometimes thrift stores just make me flat out mad with their expensive crap.  Bargain Hunters made me feel like a gatherer today.
