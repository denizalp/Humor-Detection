I like Steve's. The sign is wierd and I get visions of Freddy Kruger when I pass the place, but the coffee is good. Local stuff. The place is good for working.\n\nFirst time I went in I got kinda \"my sh*% don't stink\" kinda vibe from the barista. It is kinda offputting, so I stayed away for a bit, but have gone back and haven't had any issues.\n\nI prefer Solo down the street, but when I am here and it's convenient, I go to Steve's. Good coffee, good workspace. The end.
