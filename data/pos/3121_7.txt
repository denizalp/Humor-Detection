Pros- Most comfortable bed ever, 3 flatscreens in each suite, 1.5 bathrooms, awesome shower, big ass room!... Your friends will think you're hot shit. \n\nCons- BURNT pizza from room service (freakin' black!), and their mini shampoos and conditioners don't smell good. \n\nIt's a really nice place to stay when in Vegas- especially if you plan on spending more than 2 hours a night in the room! (Hey- it's Vegas, though... how much time do you really spend in the room with your eyes open, right?) I'd definitely stay here again.
