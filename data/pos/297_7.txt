I love the idea of delivering bread on bike, but for someone who doesn't live downtown (yet) and doesn't work downtown, it was inconvenient for me to get my hands on these gourmet baked goods until the cargo bike store opened up on Stephen Ave. I made a trip this morning to get scones for my office meeting. Peach and Chocolate, and some sort of savory feta scone. So, how were they? I'll tell you as succinctly as I can:\n\nTHE BEST SCONES EVER.\n\nCute bakery boy too. He was kind of a skinny hipster meets Fabio.
