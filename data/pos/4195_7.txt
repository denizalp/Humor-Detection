This place is as good as it needs to be. Not 5 stars, no way, but did I say that they had me at fried chicken? Fried chicken on a homemade biscuit with honey'd jalapenos, best wedge salad this side of Ruth Chris's, shrimp n Grits will make your mama jealous. Had a Bourbon old fashioned which came with the round hipster type cannon ball shaped ice that is de rigueur for such place. Tasty, but get ready to pay......
