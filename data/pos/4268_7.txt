After hearing my peeps talk this place up, I decided to try this place out when I was out an about the other day. \n\nI had the Muchacha Combo and a soft drink. The Muchacha included beef, refried beans, lettuce and rice and a large tortilla to roll your own burrito. The food was ok and very reasonably priced at under $8. There was plenty of seating at noon when I went on a Tuesday afternoon. \n\nI would definitely go back to try other menu items, but this place doesn't crack the regular lunch rotation.
