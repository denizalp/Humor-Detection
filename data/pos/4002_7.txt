Bon Chef Cafe = delicious food in a warm atmosphere.\n\nLoved it! The food that I tried so far was incredible! \nMy order was Caesar Salad, Caprese Salad, New-York steak and Tiramisu with ice-cream.. Loved it! LOVED IT! \nEverybody knows what include Caesar Salad, so I ordered it just as classic )\nCaprese Salad has fresh mozzarella, eggplant and tomatoes with basil - my friend really appreciated its taste )\nNew-York steak was fire-grilled skillfully - simply perfect!\n\nTiramisu was fluffy, served with fruits - best treat for sweet teeth )\n\nTHIS PLACE ROCKS!!!
