Grumpy barista. Very curt and dismissive. Didn't get a chance to order a pastry because she rang me up too fast. Is the opposite of upsell downsell? I was obviously looking for a treat. \n\nTwo bad visits in a row. Too many other choices to come back. \n\nVery different from my first experience. The owner lady, who is always pleasant, made me an iced americano I still think about. Never been duplicated by her staff.
