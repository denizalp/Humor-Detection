I live within walking distance of this place and deliberately DRIVE out of my area to another pet supply shop.  I spend close to $200 monthly on raw food for my dogs.  \n\nHorrible staff ... I was followed around the store like I was a thief!\n\nUPDATE:  I needed raw food on a Sunday to last me one day until I got to my regular supplier.  Called the store, they confirmed that they carried suitable raw food for dogs.  Walked to the store with my toddler in tow, and the food was expired!!!
