if I could give this restaurant zero stars I would.  It was that bad.  We had gone for my birthday  and it was our first time there.  They sat us right by the kitchen, after i specifically asked for a nice table. The food was inedible.  And that is putting it kindly.  I even wrote a letter to the owner and manager and never heard back from them.  It was like taking $ 150 and burning it in front of me.  NEVER AGAIN.
