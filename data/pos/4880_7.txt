Here's the Scoop: Silverton's Casino is a must see. Upon entering the lobby there's a huge fish tank that covers the wall where mermaids swim. It is beautiful and quite entertaining. I've never seen anything like this in a Casino Lobby. The Casino is also known for its great buffet. Outside the grounds has a mini park and beautiful landscaped waterfalls. The slot machines are plentiful and the live entertainment is great. We enjoyed this Casino and all it had to offer. My fellow Yelpers Check this Casino out you'll enjoy it.
