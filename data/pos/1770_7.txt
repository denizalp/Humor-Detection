\"May your Guardian angel be at your side to pick ya up off the floor and hand ya another cold stout\"\n\nYep I LOVE this place. I love its dark corners, it's twists and turns and seeing the usual faces.  It's like a warm familiar hug. Be it early afternoon and I'm just chillin' with a beer on the terrasse, or stumbling' in late in the evening and staying till last call, it feels like home. *sigh* Welcome home. \n\nFuggedaboutit'
