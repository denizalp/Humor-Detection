If Heaven were a pizza, it would be this pizza.  With honey on the side.\n\nThe 7th Street Market is such a neat place to go anyway, but when you go hungry - be sure to eat here!  I've only ever had the T-Rex pizza, because it's SO GOOD.  The crust is crispy and just right.  The T-Rex pizza has all sorts of meat on it (Ron Swanson style). The people are friendly!  Annnnnd they validate parking!  Pure Pizza has never let me down, if you want a good pizza and you're Uptown - this is your spot!
