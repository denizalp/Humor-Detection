Doan's is a clean, new, restaurant on South Blvd. Had to go check it out the minute I saw Rod O's review.  He was right, can't wait to return and try some different items, my test item is always vermicelli with pork and spring roll.  I ordered V7 which was pork, chicken and spring roll.  Get crazy!!\n\nFriendly staff and fresh ingredients.  Make sure to ask if they have the house made chili sauce!  I was just there yesterday and I already want my dish again.  Why is fish sauce so addictive?
