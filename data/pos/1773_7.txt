This is my first time here and I must say I'm a bit disappointed with this place. I came in for Korean grill but very limited options for beef.\nI ordered short ribs but got strips and the waitress dumped the entire serving on the gas stove (as shown in pic)\nAll the while we've had servers come over to our table and turn off the stove without saying a word, leaving us wondering how should we continue cooking the food!\nI wouldn't recommend based on their service.
