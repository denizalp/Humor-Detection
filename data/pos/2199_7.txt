One of my All Time Favorite Clubs in Vegas... \nIts very spacious so your not suffocating there! \nThe dance floor is big, the outside area is humongous, its easy to get in. The place has a fun and Beautiful atmosphere. \nThe bar is not too crowded and the drinks are made really good and strong... they have coat check inside thats a plus.. \n\nOverall a very good club to be at. As I said One of my favorites!
