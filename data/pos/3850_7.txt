My friends were staying here while we were in Vegas, and I truly wished we were as well! This is a top notch hotel and the standard rooms are amazing! These are not standard rooms I can you that right now! They are huge!\n\nIt's a beautiful hotel from top to bottom, but the casino floor is a bit on the pricier side. Couldn't even find a 10 dollar table for blackjack! Still, it's beautiful. \n\nI hope to stay here next time I come to Vegas as it's a site to behold.
