We have returned to this wonderful Doctor's office to have to have oral treatment for my other daughter.  We had three different Dr. consultations and Dr. Blacker came across as the most seasoned\/confident out of the three, my husband noted.  I am pleased with the caring and friendly care we all receive here.  Leigh Ann, Laurie, Molly and the rest of the staff make this modern doctor's office a pleasure to visit.  The kids enjoy the fun contests and I like that Dr. Blacker contributes\/donates to the local school causes nearby.   Five stars.
