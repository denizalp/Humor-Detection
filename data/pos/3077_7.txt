Pretty cool.  Clean, well supervised.  A lot for kids to explore.  Not a good food selection.  No soda.  No nachos. If you think fruit juice is healthier than a Coke, you're mistaken. Doctors that talk about \"real\" food verses prepared, boxed, artificial, whatever- are brain washed. It's all real food.  But remember: Soylent Green is people!   It's people!  Dang...  I burnt my fried chicken wings writing this.
