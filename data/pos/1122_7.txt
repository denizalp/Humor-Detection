This location is comparable to all the other Canadian Tire stores across Canada. I enjoy the handy downtown location for random household items, and to price compare. I find they have some great sales, and are always worth checking out for small home appliances. This is a fairly big location with a large upstairs, and downstairs. Staff have only ever been friendly and helpful whenever I have visited... Additionally, I have never found that it is too busy and can usually get what I need, and get out quickly which is a good thing.
