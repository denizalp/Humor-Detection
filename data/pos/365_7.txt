After doing some research and getting a recommendation to Bella Smiles I decided to give them a call and schedule an appointment. Best choice I've ever made. From the moment you check in to the moment you leave the building the staff are always attentive, friendly and helpful. I got 2 teeth extracted on my 1st visit like nothing. Dr Chawla and his staff were very gentle and professional and answered all the questions I had. The facilities are beautiful and liked that they use new technologies too. Definitely would recommend it to family and friends.
