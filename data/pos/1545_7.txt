Smoking Hot BBQ came to our work for our monthly food truck event. The staff was super friendly and the food was incredible! \n\nI got the 2 shredded pork sliders with side of mac and cheese. The pork was juicy and had a ton of flavor. I used their original BBQ sauce that was super tasty. The mac and cheese was super good as well. It was a meal I didn't want to end. \n\nLooking forward to eating here again in the future! Thanks (:
