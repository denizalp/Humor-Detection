Well that was a scare. Had to call EMS cuz I was having trouble breathing when I went to the restaurant. I wasn't getting enough oxygen compared to outside, so my body was struggling to balance it out. Overall, food is pretty good for Chinese food.\n -1 star for piss poor ventilation system. It's like they went full blast cool a\/c with only a crack in the wall for air to get out.\nWould go again if they fixed it.
