These guys make you feel extremely comfortable when purchasing a vehicle! Integrity and service are top notch. Kent was my salesman and he offered a plethora of product knowledge, and he was just an interested person all the way around! Inside they offer unlimited food and drinks at their food and beverage bar. While your vehicle is being delivered you can enjoy putt putt golf with their indoor putting green! If you're in the marked for a new vehicle, I encourage you to stop in and see Arrowhead Lexus! They have several dealerships across the valley.
