After waiting 3 days for them to fix my truck. They finally said they needed to overnight a part ( that shipping  cost $60.00 not covered by warrantee) and when that didn't work on day 5  I  threaten to take my truck out of there shop amazingly they put there best electric tech on it and had it fixed in a few hours. They are the only KW dealer around and they know it. If you can make it out of the Phoenix area and get to another shop. Do it! \n\nSee my update below.
