I went with my daughter (a vegetarian).\nWe were the only customers in there so we were able to sit at a table at a window and watch the world go by while we ate.\nShe ordered a small poutine, we ordered tater tots to share and I had a Philly steak sandwich.\nThe small poutine is quite large, very filling with good onion gravy.\nThe Philly sandwich wasn't quite what I expected but was really good.\nThe tater tots.....omg, delicious.    Trust me, order some when you're there!
