I just didn't get it.  The people\/service are great.  Maybe I ordered the wrong menu items for my taste buds but I wasn't that impressed with the food.  And the pork had a bunch of fat.  I had the cookie for mid afternoon snack and it was really good.  They certainly have plenty of fans, there was 20-30 people in line at lunch the whole time I was there.
