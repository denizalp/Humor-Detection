Awful. The receptionist had the worst attitude and tried to make me feel stupid for something THEY screwed up on. They also don't tell you that when you're sedated- you don't actually fall asleep for the procedure. If I had known that from the beginning, I would've gone somewhere else where I knew that I would be put under. \n\nThe experience was much more awful than it needed to be. I do not recommend this place to any woman. You're better off anywhere else.
