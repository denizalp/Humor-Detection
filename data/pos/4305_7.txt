Ever stop for a meal and regret it as soon as the meal came?  The food is un inspired, plain tasting. Probably just reheated. \nThe music is great for people who grew up in the Dick Clark era - like my mom and dad - but they would not pay that much for a meal.  \nIt's like a wanna be restaurant. \nMaybe a visit from Chef Ramsay would straighten them out! Thee only reason two probably survive at all is because of the Dick Clark name an the bar is close to the exit....
