5 cakes and a year later... this is still, hands down, the most amazing bakery in Phoenix. They have surprised me every single time - each cake has been absolutely flawless. I always receive compliments on how beautiful they look and how delicious they are. I'm pretty sure my entire family and group of friends all order their cakes from Baker Wee now. Check out the pictures! :D
