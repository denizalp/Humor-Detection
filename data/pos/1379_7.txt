Yay! I'm a fan of @PeppermillVegas .  Cool local flavor up in this joint.\n\nThis is a great example of local flavor as well as what happens when you take a diner and rub some funk on it.\n\nI recommend the pastrami burger, although it is a 1\/2 pound of beef, a little more than I go for but it was delicious and I will likely return for another go 'round when I'm in Vegas again.\n\nThe service was very good...almost too good, but not quite.
