Guy's crew doesn't miss a trick.  The team service kept our glasses full and the plates moving.  We hit the appetizers hard and they go great bar food.  The wings, nachos and burgers were all right on target.  The place is crowed and loud, a few more drinks and a party would have broken out.  Good stuff!
