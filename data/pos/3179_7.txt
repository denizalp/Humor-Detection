We went to try the new slushes that have been advertised on tv and told ourselves we'd try the pickle juice slush.....We chickened out lol, but the Tigers Blood slush was tasty and the Blue Hawaiian was a close second. Since we were on a roll with our taste testing my son also got a Oreo cookie bites blast. He inhaled it so I'm guessing it was good ha ha . The lot was clean and although they were busy our drinks came out pretty quick.
