The AZ Science center is great for kids which is why Adult's Night Out is twice as good!\n\nI checked out the science center at last nights first Friday of the month \"adults only night\".  Not only was admission free but they validated out parking making it free as well.  We were able to check out all of the exhibits with little or no wait and with adults only it was much less hectic than on a regular day.
