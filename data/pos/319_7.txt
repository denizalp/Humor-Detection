Purpose for visiting this store was to purchase a pair of sunglasses for my wife.  She is a fan of Oakley sunglasses.  After browsing for a very long time, she ended up with nothing.  I, on the otherhand, snagged a couple of good deals for myself.  Found a pair of shorts and a shirt both from the clearance section at awesome prices!\n\nChances of returning to this Oakley Vault location at the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets are very high.  Shop is clean and well organized.  Most of the staff was polite and helpful as well.
