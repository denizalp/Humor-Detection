Ordered the shortcake strawberry crepe. It was a whipped cream filled crepe with blueberries and strawberries inside with a chocolate drizzle on top. The crepe exterior was fresh and chewy and the whipped cream was a perfect complement to the fruits. The crepe came with two generous scoops of strawberry ice cream but tasted abnormally sweet. The portions were perfect to share as there were two scoops of ice cream! All in all, a 4\/5 experience.\n\nPro tip: master card and visa accepted over $10!
