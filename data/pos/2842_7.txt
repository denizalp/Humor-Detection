Went here, after moving from Long Beach, CA.  I was expecting some good home cooked Korean food.  This place did not have KIMCHI... REALLY...  No Kimchi?  YOUR NAME IS RED KIMCHI!!!  They told me the market price of napa cabbage was too high, so they couldn't make it.\n\nI need to go no further in this review.  It would be a waste of my time, and yours.  I think you get the picture, the rest of the meal was comensurate with the first impression.
