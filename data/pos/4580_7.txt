If i'll be courting a restaurant i'll go for a buffet  at (The buffet at Bellagio )       I would say It's Worth the wait.\nReason - The price is  reasonable i don't think i can find anything better than this.\n               - the service was excellent.\n               - even though i don't eat much i left with a smile.\n                - Good selection of food.\nGuess every time I'm in Vegas i'll be staying & dining with you.\nBecause you complete me =)
