I am kind of confused at the low score this establishment has. When it comes to sushis, low main, pad thai, and asian apps, Axia has it made. Affordable prices with great big portions. Their noodle and meat dishes are very tasty and their sushis are fresh and top notch. \n\nGreat ambience and lovely service. I've been here numerous times and have never had a bad time, I always left satisfied. Try this place out.
