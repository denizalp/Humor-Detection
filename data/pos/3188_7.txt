Best burger and fries I've ever had. The burger bun is heavenly. I just love this place. Beer is cold. Vibe is warm. Outdoor patio is private and comfy. The staff is really friendly and look like they really love what they do. Jolie is the bomb! It's going to be my next home away from home. \n\nAlso so yummy: the fried PB'n'J on the late night menu, wings and Phil 'Shrooms! Nice place to come at 6am for breakfast too.  ; )
