When you turn the key and your car does absolutely nothing, you become really anxious. Now when that happens on a holiday you panic. I prayed I'd find dome place open. A call to Auto Zone and my panic turned to joy when someone picked up the phone. The sales rep was knowledgeable and courteous. I had the proper battery within an hour. They would have even installed it if I could have gotten the car there. This will now be go to auto store.
