Hey guys, I call bullshit on the fact that we placed an order 8 minutes before two AM, through the Eat24 app, AND I called to confirm you received the order AND the guy I spoke with, Saturday night\/Sunday morning at 1:50something assured me the delivery would be made within 30 minutes. How much does your life suck that you work in the restaurant industry and you totally screw customers over by not delivering what they ordered? Congrats Dude! Classy!!
