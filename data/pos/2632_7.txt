What a nice little area to walk around. They have Boca Italian restaurant, Houlihans, Joes crab shack, Brazilian steakhouse, hard rock cafe, melting pot and several others in this little spot all close together. \nDuck tours is here as we seen them board up.\nPaddle boat also, can't remember the name of it.\n\nThey have an old caboose that was back in 1904...really neat to see. \n\nGreat view of the river and the city.\nParking was $3.00 for 1-3 hours.
