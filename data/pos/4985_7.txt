Scott S. greeted me at the door.  They were packed & the phone was ringing off the hook.  Both of my windshield wipers broke & it's raining outside.  He immediately found the right ones, refused a tip & changed my wipers for me w\/ in 5 minutes.  Wow!  \n\nThe customer service on a packed day & personal touch like a real neighborhood autozone.  Everyone in there was kind & helpful to their customers.  I highly recommend this autozone.
