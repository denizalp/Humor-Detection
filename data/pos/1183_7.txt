My purpose for visiting the Queen Elizabeth Theatre was due to the fact that I was attending a party for All Star Weekend.  Parking was $15 CAD ( they take debit cards for that).  Pretty accessible by public transit.  The QET looks old, but is still top notch and capable of holding over 1200 people.  There was a $3 CAD coat check.  My only issue was that the bar only accepts cash and the drink were ridiculously overpriced.  There are ATM's inside for use.  Other than that, the party went up without a hitch despite freezing temperatures.
