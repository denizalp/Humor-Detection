Came here for dinner based on the many positive Yelp reviews and I'm sorry to say this was the worst sushi I have ever had.  The portions were TINY and the sushi was, well, fishy. It didn't taste like the high quality sushi that I was expecting.  Plus the prices were extremely high for the quality and quantity of food received.\n\nI guess RA and Kabuki are the only decent sushi restaurants in the Phoenix metro area.  Avoid this place and go to either of those instead!
