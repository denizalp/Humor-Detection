Oh, yeah and if you yelp about them, even though their service SUCKS, they would term you as a bogus reviewer or disgruntled employee. Why would anyone want to hire them let alone work for such a company! UGH! \nTheir \"filtered\" reviews were probably posted by themselves. Who knows! BTW my name is NOT JORGE! Look at my other reviews, I like my anonymity, but give honest feedback.\n\nGet professional, Penguin AIR, clean up your act first.\n\nInstead of bullying the customers who give not-so-positive feedback, it would be nice if this was taken as constructive feedback and addressed. Oh well...
