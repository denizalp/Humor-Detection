Been to Bahn Thai again and the food and service was excellent as always. The Restaurant is not big I can't help but over hear the table near us complaining about their food. The poor girl she didn't do anything wrong and a lot of the servers  even went over to see what's wrong but I guess they want free food and wanted\nto complain. The funny thing was they ate all the food! Lol \nAll in all the food is great and I recommend a lot of my friends here and they all love it!
