this is a beautiful, peaceful refuge in the middle of the desert run by a handful of hard-working, faithful nuns.\n\nwhen you tour the grounds you stop at each station of jesus' suffering, crucifiction and resurrection.\n\nthe fountain is beautiful and they will allow you to fill vessels with holy water.\n\ntheir chapel features a combination of jewish and christian symbols.\n\ntourists: lots of desert-based photo ops and a great place for peaceful, religious\nreflection!
