I was in Vegas last week and it was day 5 into my vacation out there and I really missed California, so I decided to eat here.  As always, it was delicious!  They didn't disappoint at all! \n\nI always order the following:\n\n#2 animal style fries and animal style cheeseburger with the spread on the side.  my drink of choice: lemon-up.\n\nYUM.. I think I'll have this for lunch today. :)
