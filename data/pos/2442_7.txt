The food served here is awesome, one of the best Hakka Chinese restaurant in Toronto. \nfriendly service, food portions are huge and price are reasonable.\n I will surely recommend everyone to have a try at this beautiful and clean  restaurant . All the dishes are good, \nChilli Chicken and chicken pakora  are the must try items in this restaurant. .
