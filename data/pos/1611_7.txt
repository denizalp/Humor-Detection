At this buffet, you get what you pay for. It reminded me of an upscale Golden Corral or Ryans. I actually enjoyed a lot of the food. The prime rib dipped in the horseradish sauce, the chicken wings, and the cheese enchiladas were all very good. The macaroni and stuffed pasta would have been good if it wasn't so cold! Decent dessert selection. It was definitely not bad for the price.
