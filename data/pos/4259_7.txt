Aunt grabbed a bunch of baked goods for us.\n\nWe were very grateful. The bakery has a nice selection of items. Set up is similar to all other Chinese bakeries. Grab a tray and tongs. Bring your items to the cashier and check out. They have a little dinning area behind the bakery where they offer dim sum items. Tables weren't all that clean, I guess it is Chinatown.\n\nBuns were fresh and had an overall OK flavor. Employees are quick. Don't expect great service.
