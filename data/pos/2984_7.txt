When I was much younger I used to often go to this spot because I felt that it was a legitimate cultural experience.   It made me feel exotic.  All fancy and sophisticated.... mainly because the name didn't rhyme with Boffee Bime.   Of course,  I had never really figured that real Italian culture had nothing to do with generic ice cream slopped over fat batter waffles.    \n\nThere is a nice patio though.  If by \"nice\" you mean \"you can sit outside\".
