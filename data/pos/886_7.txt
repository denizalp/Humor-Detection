Megan is by far my favorite photographer. She shot our wedding last October out in West Virginia and did an amazing job! She is so wonderfully fun and personable that you always have a blast with her. And her photographs I can't speak highly enough about, they are beyond phenomenal! I would recommend her to anyone, because in my mind there are no other photographers other than her!
