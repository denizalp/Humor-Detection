Solid Italian food. Pizza is not my favorite, but bearable. Enough grease to lube up an orgy though.....but anyways, the only reason that I come here is for the meatball sub and their jojos, which are aces. Plus they're open super late, so in case I don't feel like eating at taco hell I can swing through. Foods cheap, goes down well, makes you wanna come back. 3\/5
