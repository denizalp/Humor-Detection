Becky's Betta Jerk Chicken is one of the better or betta places I have gone. Their $5 lunch special make it a great place for a quick lunch. They also know how to add heat to a meal, so if you want to be adventurous here watch out. The heat increases really quickly. The staff is always friend, but the service can be slow from time to time. Still, the food makes up for the slow service.
