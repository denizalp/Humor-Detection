Carpet Monk or Monkeys...this guy provided unequivocal satisfactory service. I use Rick couple days ago with his busy schedule and he was able to squeeze in at 7 AM for our new move in tenant. The carpet was FULL of DOG shit and smell. He was able clean and it was a pretty good job. \n\nEverything is \"in-line with our expectation\".\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nFelix Liu, Hedge Fund Manager\nF. Liu, Trustee & Co.\n\n\nP.S. We got a $25.00 yelp referral discount too. Somebody quoted $200 and it was completed for $175.00.\n\nP.S. I don't do 5 stars but ok, this one I do.
