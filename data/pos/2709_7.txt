Everything was delicious! Love the fact that they even offered gluten-free options. I got the fairfax with arugula salad instead of the brioche buns. The eggs were sooo soft and creamy. It was perfectly seasoned. The acidity from the red wine vinaigrette really balanced out the creamy eggs. This was seriously the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. \n\nWe also got the cheeseburger, bacon egg & cheese, as well as the sausage egg & cheese. The winner was the cheeseburger! Looking back, we should've just ordered 3 of the cheeseburger.
