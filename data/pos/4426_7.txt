There are a lot of pluses and minuses to any Las Vegas Casino buffet. The food is ok and there is a lot of it. The service is good too. On the downside are the crowds which are quite heavy. There are long lines and you may experience an extended wait at dinner time. If you have Mlife Gold status you don't have to wait in line too long and you can get right to work eating yourself into a food coma.
