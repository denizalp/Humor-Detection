I am bummed, this was my favorite Papa Johns.  We used to order pizzas at least once a week.  We had a little tradition with my hubby, Monday or Tuesday night we would order a pizza and open a bottle of wine and watch one of our shows recorded in our DVR.  We went last Saturday and the store was closed.  We called HQ and the rep said they didn't see the location in the website.  This store closed suddenly, boo.
