LOVE IT!\n\nWe ordered our tickets online and got a free upgrade to the VIP ticket area. I guess you could really sit anywhere in the theatre and get a good seat but I really think it's worth it to sit around the center area. They do alot of stuff in the aisles so it's nice to see things up close. \n\nCostumes and all the music is awesome! The little kids that perform are wonderful!!! The stage isn't very large but the way that they change the scenery is very artistic!!
