I've seen Sam's club. I've seen BJ's. But nothing beats Costco. Nothing. Their strength is the great, helpful, and friendly staff. The bright and clean interiors, the generous food samples, wide aisles, easy layout, and novelty items such as USDA prime beef, ribeye roasts, king crab legs; are all that I love among many things done well.\n\nI don't know why, but the food samples seem to taste better in the store than when I make them at home. It must be the anticipation and the thrill of the chase. Anyhow, awesome experience here.
