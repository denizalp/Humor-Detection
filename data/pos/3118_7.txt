Affordable,  good quality.  How is this place not packed?? Just wish the drive thru worked!  Seriously that would be cool.  Happened to be nearby and glad you Yelpsters came through again.  I enjoyed some green tea miso,  and a mango avocado roll at the bar while waiting on a tuna hand roll,  and a custom roll they made to take home to my hubby.  $26? Can't beat it.  Good quality and super tasty.  Seems like a nice family running it.  A little kid was running about,  but cute,  not obnoxiously.
