I had a lunch with some friends over $1 tacos.  The scenery, the tacos, the grease...all good.  $1 fried tacos were well worth every penny.  Crispy fried tacos.  Not an every day indulgence but tasty nonetheless.\n\nThe place has a bit of a funky atmosphere, the service was very good.  I would return for Tuesday $1 Tacos.\n\nI am betting Cien Agaves is pretty busy on Friday & Saturday nights.\n\nDid I mention the $1 tacos were fried?  Very filling.  That was the first time I've had fried tacos.  And I thought tacos were nearly a perfect food.
