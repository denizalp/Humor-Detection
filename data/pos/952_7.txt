In November CDC Pools resurfaced our pool that was built in 1992. Overall fair\/good job but I didn't get as much communication with the job foreman (Kevin?) as I thought I would. I got several estimates and CDC was the lowest. CDC was also recommended by multiple friends. I would use them again in the future but I won't say that I was \"wowed\" by anything they did.
