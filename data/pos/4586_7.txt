Those two tiny tables in the front in the windows just raised a bit off the street on Mount Royal in the tiny yellow building that's wafting smells like French bread heaven? Yeah. That's where you want to be. Everything is tasty, but the brownie is worth calling your mom about, worth writing a hit pop song about, worth picking up some to take home for a weekend of bliss with a loved one or, you know, alone. Delicious lattes to be had here too, and always charming service.
