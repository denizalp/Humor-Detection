I pumped gas at this Speedway the other day. I saw a sign next to the pump that guarantees the availability of cigars. This is important because next time your buddy asks you for a Swisher, you can definitely come to Speedway on Warren. If they do not have them in stock, you get a free gift card, ice cream or something like that.
