I always buy cars from missori and or the east coast and use these guys. \n\nthere Professional and very fair priced...\n\nI head about them originally from The Russ Martin show...he used them for his mach 3,  The only issue he had was someone backing into his car taking there car off the parking lot..but that wasnt DAS's fault...it was some one else picking up there car
