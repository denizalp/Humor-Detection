Very mediocre...nan was among the worst I've ever had...and I eat a lot of Indian food all around the country.  The veggie Kofta was uninspired and the sauce was straight out of a can...I have had this same sauce from a can in other restaurants.  Samosa's were not good...the other apps we had were equally boring...the chutney was generic...2 stars because the service was decent and the place looks nice.  Food is crap.
