After a year I decided to give this place another shot. Fail! Went in and \"waited to be seated\" close to 5 minutes. Finally someone came to greet us only to say, \"the hostess will be right with you.\" Ugh! With less than 20 people in the establishment is it so hard for someone  to take on the  hostess responsubility for the sake of engaging with a new customer in under 10 minutes from the time they walk in the door? #restaurantrescue.
