Oh Yelp how I have forsaken thee.  I strayed from the true path and trusted the recommendation of a coworker about the Fajita Grill.  Lies, all lies, to lure me away from you.  Will you ever forgive me. I swear it meant nothing.\n\nThe chicken mole and the fajitas were okay, but were expensive.  What really says it all though is that they charged us for stale chips and salsa.
