This place has terrible ownership. If you want to be disrespected by the owner feel free to come in on a Sunday and let him talk down to you and your friends.  I have never been more offended at any other restaurant.  Total shame that they don't care about their patrons.  GO ELSEWHERE\n\n\nAnd obviously by their response you can tell they don't care about anything. What restaurant or restaurant owner insult their patrons as I previously stated.  Go to the Distill for FANTASTIC management.  Sad even their past reviews from their old employees state the same
