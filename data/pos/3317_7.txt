I had cheesy mamon (sponge cake), pretty good, but the cheese sprinkled on top was an overkill. Next time I'll just order the plain ones. \n\nHalo-halo is a good summer treat but theirs is a bit too sweet and the mango preserves they put in it threw off the taste. Leche flan has consistency of creamy jello, this could be improved on. \nOtherwise, service is fast and place is clean and conveniently located beside Jollibee.
