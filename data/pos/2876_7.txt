Located right outside of door 13. Pay $7\/one way to the strip or $12\/rt. The driver will help you with your bags. Hop in the shuttle, wait for 15-20 minutes, then take a quick ride to the strip. I was a tad worried when the driver turned into the cargo drop off area for my hotel, so I asked \"Is this a shortcut?\" the driver responded \"no this is the back entrance to the hotel. I will drop you off mobster style\". Lol. Remember to tip the driver bc 75% of their pay comes from tips.
