Mom and pop shop. The food was okay. I came here to meet with a few friends during breakfast. I ordered a couple of items but I thought they tasted okay, nothing to rave about. The hash brown potatoes tasted a little bit off and the sunny side up eggs were a bit too well done.\n\nTheir salad looks a bit sad as well. Maybe this is just not the place for me.
