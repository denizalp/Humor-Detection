Extremely expensive!!!. Mona charges at least $50-60 if you want an already stitched suit or blouse altered in size.... because according to her she still has to open everything up and re stitch it...... if you want a suit made from scratch then it's at least $90-100!! And that's low balling it... She charges extra for zippers, clasps, fabric for under the suit... etc... In the past I have paid $40 total with other seamstresses to have a whole suit made from scratch.... too expensive and i didn't get my stuff on time
