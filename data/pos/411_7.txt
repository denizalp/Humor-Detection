Ahh, my beloved yet loathed ghetto-ass Target.   You are the ugly stepsister to my Cinderella Desert Ridge location.\n\nYou're there when I need trash bags and cleaning agents, but that's about it.  You're small, have a small selection of items, and can sometimes have a gross sketchy crowd.\n\n I like you because you've stuck it through the light-rail headaches.   But I'll like you even more when you move to fancier digs on Bethany Home....
