Ever heard you get what u pay for! Well that is a perfect example of Lesco Optical. Cheap frames, cheap lenses, rude staff! Especially Renee and Bill! I have never experienced such rude and nasty service, or lack there of!! They claim excuse after excuse, not to fix there cheap quality lenses!! Just an FYI, Americas Best! Michael Kors frames, progressive lenses for cheaper than Lesco! Oh and they actually warentee there frames and lenses! No questions ask! Lesco, maybe u can learn a thing or two!!
