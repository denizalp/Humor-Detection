Meh.  I had 3 buffets while I was in town and this was my least fave.  Huge wait in a short line for them to up breakfast over to lunch and yet when we got in most of lunch wasn't put out yet.\n\nSelections weren't enormous.  The pasta sauce was too sweet - if you liked seafood then sure, fill your boots, but otherwise your selections were limited.\n\nRotisserie pork was delicious with the rosemary potatoes.  \nCreme brûlée was more like crime brûlée it was a sorry excuse.  \n\n$25++ and grumpy ass service? Go elsewhere!
