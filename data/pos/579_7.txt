I wish I could rate this place a freakin zero!! We paid $70 for two tickets only to arrive and ladies were getting in for FREE.  Yes I said Free! Did I mention free and 2 drink tickets?  For $70 we got to stand in a long azz line and a lame party.  I am super pissed.  What a way to treat the local ladies, Encore! Bottle water $10 1 budlight $11=worthless!! Never again the jokes on me this time. Yep, you got me!!
