This isn't a very big restaurant - but it has heart! They have about 8 booths and a large table. They serve great tasting food at a decent price! I've dined here a few times; always enjoying the food immensely. The establishment is clean, the people are efficient and they have a great menu. The food comes out fast so you won't hungry long. The atmosphere is nice as well.
