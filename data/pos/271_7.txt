The staff is friendly and although their products lean on to the pricey side we ought to remember the spot's location. Also, their products in fact have very good quality. \nThe sandwiches (open face) are on the small side and the price is about $10 for each. \nI tried their Bee Grateful juice and surprisingly the flavor was great. Both yummy and good for you.
