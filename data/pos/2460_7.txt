I've been to the Avenue Diner tons, but yesterdays lunch was incredible!  I had the Fresh Tomato & Balsamic Eggs Benedict and a nice bubbly mimosa -- it was mindblowing.  The balsamic with the hollandaise creates an epic taste in your mouth and the eggs are incredibly fresh.  Not to mention, the staff at the Avenue is ever so lovely.  I love the atmosphere in that restaurant, always so clean and crisp and full of happy people munching on amazing breakfast foods. A+
