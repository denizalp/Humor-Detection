I bought four new tires and got an oil change from this Pep Boys. The guys working there were really nice, seemed to enjoy their job and went out of their way to find me the best price on tires.  \n\nI would choose Pep Boy's over other competitors because of this interaction. \n\nI didn't give them five stars because they forgot to change the mileage sticker for my next oil change but, it was a small oversight and it didn't  detract much from the overall experience.
