Thanksgiving shopping is DONE! We went to HoneyBaked early Sunday afternoon and got the ham and the turkey and a few fixings. Very helpful staff who walked us through what we wanted and helped us determine the right quantities. It sure isn't cheap though!\n\nThis stuff doesn't have to be bought the day before, ya know? You can get it a little earlier because the line tends to grow as the holidays approach.
