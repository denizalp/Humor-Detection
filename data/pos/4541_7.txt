Had the regular sized (smaller) version, on whole wheat (I WAS given the choice) grilled veggie burrito (do I use too many parentheses?).\n\nLove the option of whole wheat (best part?  It didn't taste TOO healthy) and a smaller size.  BTW, the \"smaller size\" was still pretty danged big, and I'm just north of 200.\n\nLOTS of good toppings, and I appreciated being able to veto the coriander leaves.   Chopped jalapenos were a nice option.  My friend had the pork burrito and also enjoyed it.\n\nNice new addition to the area.
