Where's the beef...?\n\nI used to like Wendys. It was my go to for fast food. Everything just seems to be ok now. Nothing jumps out to remind me to eat here again. \n\n1\/4lb burger (before cooking) is now the size of a small JR burger and the JR burgers might as well be vegan. Seriously there was a spot on the bun where the meat should be. LOL\n\nThe Chili was great, the side salads were good. \n\nI think I am over fast food.
