I really wanted to like this place, but just can't.  The good:  burgers were above-average and the milkshake very good.\n\nThe bad: fries, onion rings, service, and the price tag for above-mentioned milkshake (ouch!)\n\nFries were mealy and bland.  I couldn't even swallow the onion rings.  For half the price I'll stick with In N Out and Smashburger down the road.
