I bought a new iMac online and they automatically add Kaspersky protection unless you remove it from the order. \n\nI saw the remove button just as I was pressing the complete purchase button. They would not refund that portion because it's software. \n\nI called Customer Support and a supervisor there would not issue a refund. Policy is policy. So they're losing my business over a little thing. I have two words for Best Buy----Apple Store.
