Get there early and put yourself on the list because it gets packed on Monday nights!  I just found out  they don't take reservations. \nIt's also hard to find parking, so you might have to park in the gravel  lot across the street from Hula's. \nAs far as the food; I'm not really a burger person, but their $3 burgers on Mondays are definitely a good value. \nThe sweet potato fries were delish. I definitely enjoyed them.\n4 stars for good specials, good service and good, friendly environment.
