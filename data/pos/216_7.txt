I am SO glad they opened this new Goodwill, presumably to replace that older Goodwill on the other end of the very same shopping mall.  This one is brilliant.  It's clean, well organized and bursting at the seams with good stuff.  \n\nIn fact this one had no less than 6 armoires in the furniture area when I went to check it out just a few days ago.  That's a lot of armoires to choose from!\n  \nThis store just opened at the beginning of April so it still has that new secondhand store smell!  \n\nGo.  Go now!!
