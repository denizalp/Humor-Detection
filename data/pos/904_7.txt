The grooming service here has been terrible twice. Our first groom was great but after that, the groomer completely disregarded what we asked for and chose their own haircut. Our puppy came home looking like an ant eater with a full body of hair and a completely shaved snout, head, and ears. The groomers here are untrained and unprofessional. We should have never paid for the cut and I would never take any pet here for grooming EVER again.
