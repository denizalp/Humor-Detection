Who doesnt like this big beautiful dancing fountain? Another great free thing to see in Vegas! The show schedule is on the bellagio website, it usually runs every 30 minutes starting at 12pm on weekends. If you park at Bellagio, walk down the fountain path for a great view on the strip. The music is great and always a good variety. Its a must see attraction in vegas!
