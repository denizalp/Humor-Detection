Alexander's is the closest non chain pizza to my house.  We have ordered from them a few times.  We usually get pizza, wings and fingers.  The food was ok, pretty average but not bad by any means.  I loved the ranch, lots of garlic.  They have lots of different specials to save a few bucks.  The guys working are pleasant and food doesn't take to long.  They deliver, though we have always picked it up.  They are def worth a shot if you live in the area and don't want chain pizza.
