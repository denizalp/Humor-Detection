The secret is the mesquite grilled chicken and beef as the base ingredient to the tacos and burritos. Cafeteria style, clean-your-own-table-before-you-sit-down (and then again when you depart).  3 street tacos and small portion of rice and beans, served in styrofoam container, fountain drink, tip, $18.  Food truck tacos at North Scottsdale prices.
