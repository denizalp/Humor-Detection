Run as fast as you can this place sucks I played 60.00at the machine and got 1 drink for it. Then I was told that I did not play that much and actually the\"mailman\" gave me an attitude about it I don't know who they think they are but this is definitely not a local bar to make locals comfortable Heather the bartender is no better always has an attitude I do like to play and they never compensate for it unless they \"know you\" so for 1drink that cost me 60.00 never again  so beware
