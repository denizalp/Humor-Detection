Mark is truly a master! I am impressed with his technique, a combo of gentleness and good pressure. I 've had massages in china a few times and in san francisco but by far this guy is the best! Even the slightest sign of discomfort or change in breathing, he will check in with you to make sure you are doing okay. As a student studying acupuncture, I can tell he is hitting a lot of the sore spots without even me telling him. I def give him full marks, 5 stars!
