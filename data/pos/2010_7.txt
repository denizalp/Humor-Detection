Yay!! A shop that always has quest bars in stock by the box loads! \n\nThey carry a lot of flavors but the chocolate chip cookie dough is my favorite... chocolate brownie takes second. If happiness and skinny had a flavor, they would be in the form of a quest bar.\n\nBesides quest, Freddie's carries a huge variety for any supplements that you may need. Their prices are a bit higher than most but only by a few dollars. Conveniently located right by LVAC so you have no excuse to ever run out of supplements!
