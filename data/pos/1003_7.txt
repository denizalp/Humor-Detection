Surprised my the bad reviews. This location is walking distance to my house so on nights that cooking is not an option I find myself here. Food is always fresh and as good as any of the other locations I've been to. The thing that makes this location stand out are the people that work here are actually really nice! McDonald's is McDonald's. Not the healthiest and u always hate yourself for eating it but at least the people here are friendly
