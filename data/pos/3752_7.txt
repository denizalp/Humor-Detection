It was titillating...you'd have to be a boob not to enjoy this show. What else can I say...I SAW BOOBIES!\n\nThe show was very entertaining including the three sideshows. It was classy and all the different acts kept you from losing interest. Definitely worth seeing while in Vegas..I paid a fraction for the tics compared to seeing a Cirque show. And the men in their thongs made me giggle.
