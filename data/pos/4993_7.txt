Waitress warned us when we got here that two tables had already bailed after waiting an hour + for food... \n\n...So an hour + later we got our food, and the check comped by the manager... seems they have some issues in the kitchen and with communication. First they claim they lost our order, and then brought the wrong food - 3rd time was a charm though.\n\nThe food is good and the menu is refreshing for a breakfast place. For Scottsdale's sake I hope they get it together.
