I would put 0 stars if it was an option....\n\nPros:\nAbsolutely nothing\n\nCons:\n-Plastic plates and silverware\n-Terrible service\n-Taquitos that are the frozen kind you buy at the grocery store, seriously?! \n\nFor being an establishment in Vegas, step your game up. This place is just absolutely terrible
