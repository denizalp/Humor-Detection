Sounds trusting but buyer beware! They tell you they have the make and specs you asked for but what they put on is different from what was agreed upon... And yet will write on the receipt the specs they promised! They wasted my time and gas. The only resolution they could offer us to replace their mistake with our old tires by putting it back on.... So yes, another trip... More time wasted.
