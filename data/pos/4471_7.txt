Completely touristy and overhyped! Pass!!!\n\nThey do have a lovely patio but it all goes downhill from\nthere. Food is overpriced and underwhelming.\n\nThey have a large selection of savoury crepes ranging from $15-$20. Crepes came out looking more like a calzone, I think they were made in some kind of machine that presses them in half. What the CREPE????\n\nServer was friendly but was in the back folding napkins, ignoring us as we waited impatiently for water, dying in the 30 degree heat.\n\nNot for locals. Stay away.
