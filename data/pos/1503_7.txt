Clean, Friendly, and well organized!\n\nI can't say enough good things about this place.  Everyone was so friendly to me and I felt well informed.  I was instantly 'Wowed' when I walked in.  It was a beautiful building.  Its wonderful to see a collaborated  effort for such a good cause from so many caring people.\n\nAlthough I did not find that special someone on my visit I know I will be back.
