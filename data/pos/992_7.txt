Every Pittsburgher knows Mancini bread. Every one. But getting it in McKees Rocks is different. Fresh. I mean FRESH!! I love stopping in here where the bread is still warm and picking up a loaf or two. It's not the same at any other location. It's not the same from the grocery store although its good anywhere you get it.  But ah, in the Rocks? Yep, this is how its meant to be. Go ahead, indulge! Feel free to pick up a few extra!!
