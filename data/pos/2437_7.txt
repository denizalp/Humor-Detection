Zorbas should be a Scottsdale historical landmark, if the city council had a clue. Which history, i.e. supporting Skysong instead of pimpass hockey arena\/tempe marketplace where old Los Arcos was all the way to the wedge, has proven they don't. But I digress, Zorbas. Where else in south Dale, can young punks who just turned 18, get kicked out of for recreating  light saber fights with  3 foot (maybe they were 4) neon dildos. No where thats where. Also, in regards to that area, long live VR.
