Night ruined.\n\nReservation was made 30 days in advance! The Chef acted like he was too good to spend time looking for our name. Simply looked at the book and said, no that name is not here.\n\nWarning: Don't go here for any type of occasion or you might end up stuck with no dinner that night. Luckily Roaring Fork came through with an amazing meal as always.
