A cantankerous old French woman who owned a bakery in (of all places) Fremont, CA, ruined croissants and french pastries for me for most of my life.  All breads and pastries after just couldn't compare.  A few in Paris came close, but C'est Si Bon was still the standard by which I judged all croissants, tarts and pastries.  Well, Ding-Dong the witch is dead.  Olivier Potier has set the new standard to ruin everything that comes after.
