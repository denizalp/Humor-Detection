I have been trying to work with Quicken Loans for a while now and have very little to show for it.  \n\nI have to agree with fellow Yelpers Cindy A and E.J.  Their rates seem to be off and you don't always get someone who knows what they are talking about.  I really don't understand their JD Powers #1 rating given the level of misinformation.\n\nSorry!
