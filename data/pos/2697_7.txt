THEhotel\nTHEbest\nTHEchic\nTHEelegance\nTHEsassy\nTHEfufulala\n\nYes, this hotel definitely deserves to have the 3 letters of its name in capital. I had reservations at Mandalay Bay, but they had sold out of rooms by the time I checked in so they upgraded me to a very sweet suite at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. I will never stay at another Vegas hotel again.  You can actually get some peace and quiet in Vegas. But then again, who wants peace and quiet in Vegas?
