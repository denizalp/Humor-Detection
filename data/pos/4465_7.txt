Pigs & Pinot, a great night out at the Living Room wine bar.  This was Living Room's grand opening celebration and was a big event to say the least.  Wine vendors everywhere giving samples, live music and Every COUGAR in The Chandler\/Ocotillo Arizona area Out On The Hunt!  We had a blast drinking and watching!!!  GRRRR!!!!!!!
