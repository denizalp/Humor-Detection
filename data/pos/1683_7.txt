Had to give it  only 2 stars.Ordered the corned beef sandwich tonight.  It tasted just fine.  My problem was that the guy slicing the corned beef needs a lot of training.  The way he sliced the meat it came out with the consistency of pulled pork. Totally shredded instead of slices. It tasted ok, but really? The other guy working the slicer knew how to slice.  His sandwiches looked correct.\nIll be back but I won't let the \"shredder\" make my sandwich.
