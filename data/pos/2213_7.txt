Always a stellar time! The 'Cheers' of the breakfasts joints, the awesome service is only outdone by the delicious menu.\nOn the menu today:\n-Joes scramble with hash brows \n- Big Bad Wolf with hash browns \nBoth entrees come with a side of the most delicious warm and moist coffee cake of my life!! \n\nSelect main entrees have a choice of toast or coffee cake, always choose coffee cake. Lol :) \n\nWith indoor and outdoor seating available the resteraunt is always clean, the service is always incredible and the food is always worth the trip!
