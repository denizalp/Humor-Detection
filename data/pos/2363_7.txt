Pros: \n-rooms are divided, we got one that had 4 chairs. \n-fairly clean\n-at $20 for an hour, it's a deal\n\nCons:\n-the chairs are as hard as butchers blocks\n-staff talked and giggled constantly\n-I base how good a foot massage is on their ability to put me to sleep... And I'm doing this review while getting the massage. Wide Awake.
