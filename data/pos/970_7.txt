My appointment here today went very smoothly.  I tried this place due to a Groupon deal and they were very professional and organized upon check-in.  I waited about 10 min before being taken in for my treatment and the doctor I saw was quick and made the procedure almost painless.\nThe waiting room was kind of sparse in decor, no beverages or new magazines so I don't think it reaches 5 -star level but I would definitely return.  Also their B-12 shots are only $10 - the best deal I've seen anywhere!
