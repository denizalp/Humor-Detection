Their CRAB CAKE BENEDICT was the bomb!\n\nIt came with jumbo lump crab meat as advertised in the menu, and it was sooo delicious. I don't appreciate the Hollandaise sauce that much, but it was also outstanding.\n\nThe fresh veggie omelet came with spinach, tomato, onion, mushrooms and bell peppers - was good but not as impressive as the bennie.\n\nAnd the bagel - came with the nova cream cheese (mixed with smoked salmon) and it was great.
