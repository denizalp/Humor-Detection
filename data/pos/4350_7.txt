Staying on the strip and being lazy, we were thankful for a BOGO free coupon for the buffet at Harrah's.\n\nWe managed to get in right before 3 pm, which meant we paid the lunch price but saw the dinner food.  A decent variety of food, especially for the price.\n\nWe were definitely surprised to find stone crab, snow crab legs, and mussels on a weekday for sure!\n\nMy favorite was their chocolate fountain with huge strawberries.\n\nOverall, it's a very simple and basic buffet for a strip casino.  We definitely wouldn't be here if we were paying full price though!
