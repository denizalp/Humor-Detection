I didn't know there was a \"north\" and \"south\" so hopefully I'm reviewing the right one.\n\nCame here for some shopping, there are stores similar to the outlet mall at Waikele, but this mall is bigger and indoor.\n\nThere weren't many stores I wanted to stop in since there are a lot back home. Tried out some places and if you look, you can find good deals.
