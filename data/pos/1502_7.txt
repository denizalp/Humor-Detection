The food was delicious, but the service was non-existent.  It took several minutes for anyone to greet us after being seated.  The waiter didn't seem too knowledgeable or friendly, and it took waaaayy too long to get our food.\n\nThe food runner had no clue where the food was supposed to go (for everyone in the restaurant).  It became comical.\n\nAnd to get the check?  At least fifteen minutes after we had asked.
