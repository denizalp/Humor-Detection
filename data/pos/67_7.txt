Yet another cozy Korean coffeeshop. Each one has a trick up their sleeves to stand out from the rest. Well this place has 3 private rooms available for rent that can easily fit 6 people. $10\/hr. There is a widescreen TV in there and a PS3 if you want to play games or watch movies.\n\nIn regards to doing work the place is not very loud. and the WiFi is reliable but no plugs so charge up beforehand\n\nCozy and not very spacious. Wonderful staff. K-pop always appreciated. Cash & Debit only, no credit
