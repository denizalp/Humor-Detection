- The Beatles LOVE, was the first Cirque du Soleil show I have ever attended (back in 2009.) Having attended tons of shows, including more than 10 Cirque du Soleil performances, I have to say that  \"LOVE\" is my least favorite one. It was convenient for us, since we were staying at the Mirage. Maybe if I was a fan of the Beatles I would have appreciated it more,Duh!\n\n- There was less acrobatic moves, and more dancing. \n- The longest 90 minutes, and the most wastful 90$ of my Las Vegas trip.\n- Still loved the visual effects.\n \nThree Yelps.
