We walked up & sat at the bar on a busy Saturday evening. The weather was perf so we sat at the outside bar. We were greeted by staff quickly & poured a good tequila concoction. The prices weren't happy hour so they were on par for the area especially on a Sat night. I'm too picky on the Mexican food so I have never ventured past a salsa for fear of disappointment. Again not because of them or their food just me. That is all.
