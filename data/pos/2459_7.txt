Okay, I straight up ordered the \"heathen vegans shoplifter's delight\" because of the name.  \n\nI'm not proud of my devil may care attitude when it comes to ordering food, but reckless abandon at Monty's has proven fruitful.\n\nDelightful meal.  Everything about it matched the hippy dippy quarky way of MadCity life.  Service was a shade slow and it wasn't crowded by any means, but I had good company.  Who cares.
