The true definition of a 'dive bar'. Reminds me of the old pool halls I used to sneak into in the 80's, except less smoke. I don't really know how to review\/rate this place without sounding like the total prissy girl I've become so, I won't. If you're looking to play pool, get a beer and play some golden tee, this place delivers. If you're looking for food or to use the ladies room, it isn't.
