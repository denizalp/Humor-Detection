Just got my teeth cleaned and now they feel so much better. I hate getting my teeth cleaned, but this office is so cozy, it made everything that much easier! Very nicely decorated and the chairs are so comfortable, they have to be memory foam. \n\nThey gave me a treatment plan for my next visits, and gave a referral to get my wisdom teeth pulled.\n\nEveryone was very nice and personable as well. I will be coming back, but unfortunately it's to get my cavities filled :(
