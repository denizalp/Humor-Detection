Best place to go for late night grub, serving size is huge and if you have a sweet tooth I would recommend the mud pie.  Its super chocolatey goodness with a large amount of ice cream.  The strawberry shortcake and brownie desserts come in a huge glass cup with ice cream which are also great . It's a diabetic coma waiting to happen .
