Had heard great things about this place and finally was in the area to check it out.  Very clean inside and the staff was nice.  Small but focused menu and I ordered two steak tacos and two chicken tacos.  There's a salsa bar too if you want some extra heat.  Verdict on the tacos - good but not great. They are a little on the small side and the meat didn't have much seasoning to it.  Total cost with a soda was $13. I was still hungry after this meal.
