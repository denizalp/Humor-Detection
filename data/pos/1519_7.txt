Yuzu Izakaya opens till 3 am.. Seriously? \n\nGreat for late night snack and drinks!! \n\nThis place so new I can even smell the fresh paint... \n\nSkewers $3 for 2 not a bad deal..... We tried the Pork Neck and Beef. Pork neck is well flavored, great bite and really porky. Love the hot peppers! \n\nWara-Yaki Beef Tongue ($10) was meh for me unless you love the charcoalness.. The texture was way too mushy for my liking. I feel like I just smoked a cigar after eating that!\n\nBeer selection is so so Coors Light? Meh
