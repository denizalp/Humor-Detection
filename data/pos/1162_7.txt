Fantastic world class library! Visit the CPL for research, reading pleasure or to see the Superman Exhibit. The CPL is located on Superior across from the Hyatt Regency Arcade. Its a free institution and is well worth a visit. The old library is set in a historical renaissance style building and there is a new modern wing in a high-rise glass building next door. The interior of the old building is beautiful and even if you had no interest in the exhibits or books, go there to just see inside this magnificent building. Highly recommend.
