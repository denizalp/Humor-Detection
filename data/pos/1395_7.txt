This woman is making something nobody else in Vegas is. She is doing it in great variety and in the highest quality with the best customer service. Please save room for this. Please make a special trip for this. Please suffer the parking woes for this. The tame and the non-adventurous can be happy here. Remember to tip. My most memorable flavors so far:\n* Rosemary and EVOO- Love the rosemary bites.\n* Chocolate and Red Chile\n* Sweet Corn- Love the corn kernels!\n* White Coffee\nYou can find AOF at Novecento too.
