Food was alright. I got a vibe of not very clean. The staff appeared to not be so well groomed. Not very nice but it makes me wonder how things are in the kitchen and never mind bathroom. I won't be back.\nCorrection ~ 2 of the staff that handled our food were not well groomed. The others were fine~ but it made me nervous for what we were eating.
