This is the hipster heaven in Queen West. \n\nMy friend and I came here hoping to get some food after an evening of chilling at   his place near by. \n\nWe shared the ribs. They where not bad but not great, a lot of the connective tissue was still intact and they where difficult to break apart. \n\nThe selection of drinks was not bad. The service was reasonable.\n\nI would not come here unless craving intense  hipster contact.
