I am reviewing the 2011 festival.\nBLEH! Seriously, this was gross. There was mud, everywhere. It was kinda funny watching people getting their feet stuck, but once it happened to me all the humor was gone. My shoes were ruined so I kinda feel like they owe me Forty-Five dollars. Anyway, the rides were alright, the food was ehh, all in all everything was way over priced and when I went to the stage to listen to music there wasn't any. Not gonna pay all that money again next year.
