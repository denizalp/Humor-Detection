Looking for a Mercedes and\/or a new\/used car?! I 100% recommend this dealership. No hassle, no pressure. My wife and I bought a car two weeks ago and never once felt pressured into making a decision we weren't ready to make. From beginning to end, the experience was impeccable. Don't take my word for it, go experience it for yourself. Ask for Peter. Tell him I sent you... That is the sales person that gave us the wonderful experience. With that being said, thank you, Peter. :)
