Yep...it's official this pizza is the bomb.com!  \n\nAfter chatting up the staff I let my inner meat monster out and went with the T-Rex pizza basically because it's got everything pepperoni, beef, ham, bacon...Mmmmm! \n\nAfter about 10 minutes my masterpieces arrived. I chose the original crust and my goodness it was pretty delicious! \n\nAnd that honey...Wowsers! Now, I admit I never thought of honey and pizza being a great combination so I was a bit hesitant but seriously just DO IT! Absolutely delicious!\n\nHeck yeah, I'm coming back! Loved it!
