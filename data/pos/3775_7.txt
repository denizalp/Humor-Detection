DO NOT STAY HERE!  The rooms are the most disgusting hotel rooms I've ever been in.  It smells like a frat house in the early 90s.  The pictures are completely fabricated.  Hotel looks nothing like them.  Hotel smells like weed.  The hotel seems like it's being run by a bunch of teenagers who's parents are away for the weekend.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
