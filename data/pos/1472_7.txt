The only way for me to enjoy Celine Dion - My Heart Will Go On is if I'm in Vegas and Fountains of Bellagio are dancing to the song.\n\n I love these fountains and it's kind of sad if you looked down to the water, people throw away trash into the water. I saw many \"girls direct to rooms\" fliers, food wrappers, cups, and even coins!!! This is not a wishing well, people. Keep your trash away and throw your coins at me. I will make your wish not come true. :).
