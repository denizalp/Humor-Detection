Try not to go to the east side but yesterday I had no choice.  Typical Mentor spot in a strip mall.  Big restaurant with games for the kids.  Food came out right and fairly quickly.  Server was OK..not very friendly. We were the only table there and our tab would of been higher had we felt more welcome. Next time ya might wana be nicer to the table of 6 Irish people who  drink more than they eat at lunch...
