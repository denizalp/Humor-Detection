Went for a few drinks... in the evening this time ;) lol it was really relaxing and fun... there was a trash can fire... that was entertaining... the bartender was sweet and cool.. she kept coming over and hung out throughout the night... I only stayed till about 930 on a Tuesday... and it was pretty full for a Tuesday I'd say :) i cant wait to go back for the Halloween party :)
