I've heard so much about this place and I finally made it here lol. such a fun place! You will never get bored. Games, booze and friends...all winners in my book. Games are super sized too! \nAfter playing bunch of games and drinking. They have a cafe serving some bomb ass food. especially, for bar food...it's exceptional. \n\nGo to gold spike, Take a night off from the real world and being grown. 4 stars-
