OMG It's a bank! Bank of America may be a terrible bank but the tellers at this location are proficient at their jobs and the lines aren't too terrible. Not to mention there are some cute employees which make my pants more than a bit happy.\n\nThe parking lot here is complete and utter madness which life tilts the crap out of me and getting in and out of the drive-thru during business hours is a bit difficult.
