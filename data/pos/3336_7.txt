Hands down best pool party in Las Vegas. This venue is huge and always has the hottest djs. I also really enjoy their food. Love the chicken fingers, quesadillas, salads and their strawberry mojito pitcher is to die for especially on a hot Vegas day. Thank you to Travis the GM and staff for making our experience wonderful and providing excellent customer service.
