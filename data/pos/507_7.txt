Hong Kong station dinning experience overall was really good! The atmosphere was good! The service was also good and helpful! The food was really good it had great flavor and tasted like authentic Chinese cousin! The only complaint I had was that one of the plates of food the BBQ pork was really salty!! \n\nOverall I would be happy to come again!
