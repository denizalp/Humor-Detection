Easy parking,friendly staff,,i think they need to do like the restoration guy and have a tour.Over at ricks we saw a few people from the show and they interacted with the fans. At least leave Rolie around to work on his English skills J\/K. Overall nice place! Awesome cars, no prices on the cars,,,who knows I may have bought one?Ha !I wish ! I'm a big fan of the show would have liked to meet one of the guys.
