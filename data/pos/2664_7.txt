All-around great bar.  It may seem a bit dive-y at first, but that's what gives it character right?  Cheap beer, awesome food (especially the wings), hot bartenders, pool, darts, nice patio, live music, Buck Hunter, Golden Tee...this place has it all.  \n\nFor the most part the girls there are all pretty average, nothing a few beers can't fix.  Depending on what night you go, there's usually a pretty good spread...great place to pull cougars.
