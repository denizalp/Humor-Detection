NEVER use Dependable Auto Shippers (DAS) if you are moving long distances. My vehicle was picked up in Oakland, CA Friday June 10th @ 8:30pm. It is now Monday, June 27th and guess what...my car is STILL sitting somewhere in California, and has not even started to come east . Now they won't answer my calls. \n\nI feel as if this is moving towards a stolen vehicle case...I know moving has hiccups, but this is ridiculous!!
