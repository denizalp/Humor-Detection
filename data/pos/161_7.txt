Are you kidding me?!!! This place is so unbelievably amazing! The beef from the smoker is moist (such a gross word, but I can't think of another one - so get over it). The buns are fresh. Not too soft, not too firm - just right. \nStaff are chatty and friendly, super helpful. That alone is tough to find these days.\nA must try
