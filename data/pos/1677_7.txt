After coming to Vicky's salon now for years I can honestly say that my bi-weekly appointment with her is something I truly look forward to and couldn't live without. She keeps my nails in tip top shape and I get compliments on them all the time. \n\nHer little one woman shop has expanded into a bustling 2 location salon with lots of clients and services. She now offers skin services, eyelashes and sugaring in addition to nails.
