I hesitate to call this \"Russian\" or \"Eastern European\" market. Just think former soviet block- there are Russian, Ukrainian and Armenian offerings to be found aplenty. \n Love the variety and selection, I am Russian and this place is spot on. For an outsider it's probably going to seem a bit quirky, but that's how I feel when I go stomping the aisles of Asian markets, like I know what I'm doing. \n If you can get past stellar famous Russian customer service and are feeling adventurous, it's worth checking out.
