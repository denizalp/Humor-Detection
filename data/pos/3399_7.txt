The food here is very good but the owner is insulting.\n\nApparently in Korea it is ok to insult someone.\n\nOn two visits the owner came over and poked my stomach and asked when I was due. He considered it a joke to make fun of my spare tire.\n\nI will not enjoy a meal, pay money, and then be insulted. \n\nThis owner has been in the US for many years and STILL does not understand American ways.\n\nMy wife and I will not be going back.
