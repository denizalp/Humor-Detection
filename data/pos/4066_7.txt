At this time 10-24-16 the mall is AT MOST 20% occupied.\n\nA couple things worth mentioning is that they have a Halo Rescue Pet Adoption Store, anchor store is Sears...(Not sure if Dillard's is staying) an Antique Store, a tiny Space Themed indoor Playground, a partial Food Court and Walmart is to open sometime within the year and hopefully will revitalize life into the mall. \n\nThe mall it's self seems clean and was designed with interesting features and in areas has attractive stone work.
