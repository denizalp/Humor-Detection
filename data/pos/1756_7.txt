Slightly over rated and expensive!!! But it's still a lot of fun as long as you don't go broke gambling the night away. Good to visit at least once or maybe twice in your lifetime.\n\nAnd I don't know why people want to bring their kids here...sleaziness all over the strip!\n\nDon't bring the babieeezzzz!!!!!!!!!!!
