Disappointing experience. The hostess stood at the stand and ignored us for several minutes until finally staring at us--which is when we then asked for a table for 2. She never spoke a word to us. Our food was mediocre at best...our drinks came out about 10 mins after our food and they were definitely underwhelming especially for the steep price. This is our home airport and we don't intend to return.
