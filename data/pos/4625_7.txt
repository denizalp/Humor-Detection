THE PRICE IS NOT OVERHYPED. HUZZAH to saving more in the city of gambling! Came here after the disappointing news that Bacchanal Buffet wait was...7 hours! No joke. We were all starving...and Chipotle was waving to us!\n\nTo be honest, this is unlike other Chipotles I've eaten at. Chicken was bland, corn salsa was still frozen...but at least they were quick! Gave great portions! And best of all, not wallet breaking. \n\nI would still come here again without a doubt if I have to wait too long at any nearby buffets.
