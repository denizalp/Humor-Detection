I know Thai fairly well.  I've spent a while in Thailand and cook Thai a few nights a week.  This is not Thai food.  It's not fresh, not all that flavourful, and just not worthwhile.  The worst was the cashew chicken which was deep fried and tastes like generic ginger beef or something you get when you sugar dip breaded deep fried meat.  I can't say to food was shockingly bad, but it lacks any of what makes Thai food so wonderful.  You could make a better Panang curry with a store bought sauce.
