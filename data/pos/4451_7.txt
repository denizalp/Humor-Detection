This place will not remain a hidden gem for long. Their sauces and noodles are incredible. The weekend-only braised beef and tendon has the perfect chewiness and QQ-ness. The flavors are a perfect mix of fresh and light with spicy and earthy. I don't know how they do it, but they do!\n\nThe hand-pulled noodles are to die for. They are magically thin and springy. I ate mine like I hadn't eaten in weeks. \n\nMy favorite meal yet in Toronto.
