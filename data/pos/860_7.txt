At the place right now. 20 minutes and no one has even come to our table. No water... Nothing. I'm a waitress and this is by far THE WORST SERVICE EVER! They obviously don't care about customer service what so ever.  No one has acknowledged how awful the service has been. Food was room temperature. Super angry. Fail! Oh and of course it's super expensive. I hate it so much.
