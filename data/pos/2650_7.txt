This place is good if you are on a budget. My biggest complaints is the communication the front office LACKS. You bring up an issue to them and they don't really resolve it. They cut off water sometimes without letting you know, change gate locks and don't tell anyone, and they aren't too friendly either (like most of the people in Phoenix that I have encountered). But for the most part, you get what you pay for.
