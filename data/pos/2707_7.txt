I probably have lung cancer from all the inhaled second-hand smoke....\n\nI probably have a failed liver from all the alcohol i consumed the three days I stayed in Vegas ...\n\nI probably acquired an STD from the pole I had been dancing on at Club Pure...\n\nI probably have aged 10 years in the three days in Vegas from partying\/vomiting\/grinding\/fighting, etc.....\n\ni probably have no more friends because I chose to act like one of the dumb bitches from the bad girls club being belligerently drunk.\n\nBUT HEY! YOU only live once!\n\ndon't judge me
