Super delicious chicken and waffles! Fried chicken is perfectly crispy, waffles infused with cheddar cheese, and syrup laced with bourbon! Hmm.. That could be why it was so good. The flavor combo was just fantastic, I can't even explain it. I just couldn't stop eating it, you'll have to try for yourself. This plate is big enough for 2. It's also $35. Yes $35 for a plate but I'll totally do it again! After eating that, I couldn't get myself to eat the egg and sausage sandwich. It just didn't compare.
