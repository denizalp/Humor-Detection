Waited in the drive through line for over 20 minutes behind one car. When I got to the cashier, I paid, and had to wait again.... Currently waiting on 3 burritos, all of which are the same. \nHow hard is it to make a burrito when you are a burrito store. \nAbsolutely insane that the worker didn't even apologize. \nNot worth the diarrhea
