Better Pedicures then Greyson! \n\nAn amazing find tucked away in a niche in Kenilworth Commons.  The ladies who work here are very precise and go out of their way to make us feel like special customers to them.\n\nFor a nail shop, this place is a cheap manicure that lasts as long and looks as good, if not better, than when I pay 2 or 3 times the amount.\n\nTheir pedicures last me several weeks and with their ministrations, my feet have never looked better.
