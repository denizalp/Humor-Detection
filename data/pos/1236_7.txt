Such a lovely experience.  The butcher's sandwich of the day was flank steak with tomato chili sauce on baguette.  Flank steak was tender and the robust tomato sauce with a hint of spiciness. We also had the forest bowl, which features an assortment of mushrooms, lentils, greens, and pureed squash.  You can enjoy the different flavors together without muddling them all together.  This is where Wisconsin produce shines!  The garage door style window offer great people watching.  Service was unobtrusive yet attentive. I look forward to returning, especially for the forthcoming cheese bar!
