Amazing service....I took my 04 vw passat to a aamco and was told I needed 3k worth of transmission work. I went to Tony at sun off of a referral from another transmission company he solved my problem in a day No transmission fluid. 40 bucks later I was good to go. When the other company changed the oil in the car they drained the transmission fluid instead of the oil...crazy will send everyone I know to Suns\n\nSteven Paquin\nJpmorgan Financial Advisor
