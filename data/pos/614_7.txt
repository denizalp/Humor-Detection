I went to the sugar factory with my boyfriend the other day and it was an amazing experience!!! I would highly recommend this definitely to my friends and family ! I came one time and I'm hooked now !\n\nI had the chicken parm and it was like one of the best that I've ever had. chef Chris and chef Alejandro are the best ! I will only go in now when they are there !\n\nPlease try this place and better yet this location and make sure Chris is there !!!
