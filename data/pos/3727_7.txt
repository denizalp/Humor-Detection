I know where I'm going when I have my next banh mi craving! Finally, a place that meets my expectations. Fresh tasting crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside bread, well seasoned and good portioned meat, and perfectly pickled veggies. My go to sandwich is the grilled pork banh mi ($3.25). I've tried the pricier ones like the lemongrass beef banh mi, which was good, but was not worth the price. Very friendly service and my order was complete in less than 10 minutes.  I'll have to try the pho next time! \n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 challenge*****\n17\/100
