We came to Drai's for a Big Sean concert. I liked how it's indoors and outdoors. We didn't have to wait in line for too too long. The dance floor was crowded by the time we got in. Overall good vibe, good sound (nice & loud). However, like a previous reviewer said, many people stand on the booths\/seats and it blocks the view completely of the stage. So you're standing a few feet from the artist, but can only (partially) see them on the screens. Anyway, I'd go back, had a good time.
