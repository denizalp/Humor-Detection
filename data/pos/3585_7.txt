Everyone told me about the Strip District. \n\nJust keep in mind after 4pm a lot of shops and businesses start to close. Yes no joke. I got here by 6pm and pretty much everything was closed. The street was dead and it seems like the actual Strip District (Penn Ave) is just a few blocks. If you walk further down then you end up in no where.
