Love the chipotle hummus, diverse crowd, light rail convenience and fantastic service.  Rode the light rail here with a fine gentleman for a date-thing.  The patio was a welcome respite from the noise and crowd inside.  There were two couples on gaydates who had obviously just met online, and I totally sipped sangria and auditory voyeured on their insights about Facebook, Craigslist and the current state of internet dating. \n\nMaizie's, please please up your credibility and spell your specials right.  All the boards with frilly chalk-drawn \"RUEBEN\" on them last night made me cringe.  REUBEN. \n\nPS menu: \"Caesar.\"
