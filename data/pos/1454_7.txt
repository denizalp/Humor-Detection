Top notch care! Shout out to Dr. Comeh and Dr. Segreti you two women are rocks stars in my eyes and I want to thank West Penn for getting my mom all fixed up brand new. \nShe went in for  major surgery on 01\/16 and was released 3 days later.  The hospital is kept extremely clean and well managed and her surgery went like clock work.
