Great store! They have a large selection of items on sale in the back. That's always a plus. The place is clean and well organized. Take your time and find what you are looking for. Staff is friendly and helpful. I was glad they let me browse around the store without flocking to me to recite every single sale. At checkout I asked if my hiking shoes were on sale. No they weren't. But the Manager said he could give me 20% off. I'll take it! Thanks for going above and beyond.
