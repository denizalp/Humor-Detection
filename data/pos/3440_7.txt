I stopped in for a couple beers with some buddies after a meal up the street. This is a spacious and clean bar in the middle of a nice, more upscale shopping center. The large patio area would be perfect for soaking in the evening air or a large group gathering, and the large horseshoe bar had plenty of space to belly up should you want to spend a lot of time here. \n\nOur server was sweet and attentive and the beer selection pretty decent. All in all, a great watering hole for those in the area.
