Really really like the nail tech but every time i come here i have an appointment and have to wait 30 minutes. What kind of customer service is this?  Come on people. Don't over book or take walk ins when you have appointments. Very frustrating as I don't have time to waste. Also they just decided to change their prices and charge me more for the same exact service I've been getting the past few months since they opened.
