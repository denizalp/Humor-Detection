I love this place and love all the samples  the girl who helped me with a neck tattoo was soooo hot and friendly haha. I was very needy and indecisive but she sold me on the chocolate fondant gelato. The prices were fair and all the flavored were amazing... I must have them all!! I recommend to have the gelato on a cone :)
