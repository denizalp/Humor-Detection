I used to live down the street from this place.  Recently tried it again.  My problem with this place:  the regulars get good service.  So, my question... how do you BECOME a regular when you are all but ignored by the staff that doesn't recognize you?  \n\nFood here has been decent.  It's a bar... it's OK.  \n\nI am now officially done trying this place.  I don't need validation so badly that I need approval from a bartender or a waitress in a small town bar.  Yikes.
