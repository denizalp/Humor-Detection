Extremely poor customer service.  Aaron was sent by home warranty co to repair our spa.  They showed up unexpectedly without scheduling.  Woman answering phone in office was apathetic and then defensive and extremely rude (she hung up on us!).  Technician was condescending and curt, and was not interested in helping or answering questions.  When we lodged a complaint with our home warranty company, Aaron said they refused to return because things were thrown at the technician and profanities were screamed at the secretary (all absolute lies).  Unless you enjoy incompetence, lies and aggravation, avoid this place at all costs!
