This place sucks balls! Supposedly closes at midnight yet they proceeded to usher us out at 11pm. Never asked us if we wanted anything to drink. We had to ask for something to drink then the waiter takes two drink orders when there is three of us sitting there. I'll leave it at this since I could go on and be brutally honest. No wonder nobody was here on a Saturday night.
