Two pitchers of sangria later, I approve.\n\nSeriously though, this is clearly a family run joint where the father is in the kitchen and the children are working the front of house. That, plus food which was far more authentic than I expected (umm, cactus garnish?) makes for a small business that really deserves to be rated favorably. Was everything a home run? No, not really... but it was still better than every other Americanized Mexican joint I've been to in the States. \n\nWhatever you are doing Restaurant El Meson, please don't stop. Merci.
