In A Nutshell:\n\n-The USO in Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is pretty nice.\n-It's a good option to have since The Club at Phoenix (which is part of the Priority Pass lounge network) closes at 3:30pm every day.\n-You'll need to show your ID card to get in.\n-If you are new you'll get a quick tour by one of the volunteers.\n-You can have at it w\/ any snacks, junk food, drinks, toiletries, etc...\n-There's areas to play video games, a kids playroom and other small areas to relax.\n\nOverall, it's a decent USO, at least it's an option at this very busy airport.
