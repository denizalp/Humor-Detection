WARNING-Do NOT expect help or service of you are white. I was completely ignored by two employees and waved off by another. I was told afterward by a friend that that is to be expected if you are white. They won't be going out of their way to help you.\n\nShame because I wanted a place to recommend that wasn't one of the normal places around here. STAY AWAY! If the money from this veteran isn't good enough for them, will yours?
