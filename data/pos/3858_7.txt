Horrific customer service & owning up to poor quality workmanship. Manager (very rude & snooty) redirected & basically blamed BFF that she must have stored it (never used new) incorrectly for the handle to leak glue & damage the purse. She wouldnt issue a credit & said it couldn't be fixed w\/o $ or guarantee. NEVER buy LV! BUY Gucci across the mall from them. Too bad cause sales staff was great though.
