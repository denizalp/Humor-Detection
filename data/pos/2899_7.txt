Late one night I hopped on down here to meet a bunch of nerds who had just seen a director's cut of something boring at TIFF. \n\nI had an old fashioned, some vodka, and we shut the place down. Everyone else seemed to be all about their beers, but not I. The person next to me had their massive burger (complete with onion ring on top) and it looked delicious. \n\nBarhop is more public house in atmosphere than I expected being on King W, and I was pleasantly surprised. Hooray for drinking.
