We celebrated a birthday here the other night, and celebrate we did...  \n\nThe d√©cor at Claim Jumper is big and rustic, but cozy, evocative of a Yukon lumber mill.  Given the name, that can't be a surprise, right?  \n\nThe food portions are generously sized to match.  Think food for lumberjacks; delicious, hearty, meaty food for lumberjacks.  \n\nDo you have a lumber-sexual in your life?  Bring him here.  Feed him man sized hunks of meat and mighty forkfuls of mashed potatoes, all washed down with beer.  \n\nHe'll thank you later.  \n\nAfter the kids are in bed.
