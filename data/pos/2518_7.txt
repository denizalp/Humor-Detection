I've had the pleasure of experiencing Special Event Linens through the cleaning of my linens and have nothing but great things to say. Yes they do offer linen cleaning services in addition to renting their own linens! The price is competitive to other cleaners and it's nice to support a local business along the way. They get my linens done in a timely manner and I always enjoy working with the staff. I will come to them if I ever need to rent linens as well!
