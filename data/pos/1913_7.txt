Second time, and I laughed just as hard! The first time I thought perhaps my expectations had just been exceeded, but this time, I went in thinking it was a 5-star show. I left feeling just the same. When a magician can thrill you with their tricks again, and when a comedian can make you laugh with their jokes on the second listen, then you know you have a true entertainer. Mac King did both! I love this show!
