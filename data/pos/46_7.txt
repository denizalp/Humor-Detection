ItÂ´s a nice,  cute little place with funky decor, I found myself in on Saturday night. \nThe service is friendly and polite, the music is great and the beer is cold. I must be honest, as much as this is a cool place, I'm into more of the lounge\/intimate types of bars. However, I can see other people enjoying a drink or two or dancing with friends there, that's why I'm giving it a four stars rating.
