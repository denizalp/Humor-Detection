Halo is amazing.  I've been a customer since I was 18, (that's 10 years).  I've had all my piercings done there.  They carry a full selection of unique, high quality jewelry that makes you feel like you're eight years old at a candy store.\n\nTheir piercing rooms are probably cleaner than your doctor's office and because Glen and Kelsey only hire good, clean professionals, you are always in good hands.
