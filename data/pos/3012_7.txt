Sunday night pool parties here are the perfect ending to a non-stop 72 hour Vegas trip. Totally worth the 0-2 hours of sleep you have to survive on because you have to pull an all-nighter to get back home to work the next day. \n\nIt's a far more relaxed vibe than the usual XS experience, although you still have the option of dancing if the mood strikes. \nLounging with champagne in hand on an in-pool daybed is the business. I felt like Queen Cleopatra! LOL\n\nGlam, glitz & gorgeous on steroids. \n\nA girl can get used to this...
