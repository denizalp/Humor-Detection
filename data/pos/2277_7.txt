I moved here about two months ago and so far it has been great! Really nice apartment complex, they upkeep everything really well and the staff is super friendly! Great size one bedroom, parking and everything is very well lit and safe. Fitness room is awesome with nice new equipment and the laundry facility is good too. Maintenance has been on top of anything even small that Ive requested too, I'd recommend it!
