Well... it's air conditioned.  I have been there four times over the past 15 years, but the only exhibits I remember are the mirror panel that allows two people to \"Swap\" facial features, a water\/pipe exhibit (a water and pipe exhibit, not a water pipe exhibit), some spinning thing, some pulley thing, and a place with blocks.  Last time I went (the fourth time) I kinda felt I never needed to go a fifth, unless I had a fifth.
