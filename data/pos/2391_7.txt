Disclaimer: I haven't had any food here. This review is purely for the bubble tea (albeit not of the bubbles themselves because I haven't had those either hehe).\n\nThe hazelnut milk tea is the best milk tea in Pittsburgh. No contest, and trust me, I've tried them all!\n\nCash only for bubble tea, pretty pricey (almost $5 for a large), but when I'm craving good bubble tea, which is lacking in Pittsburgh, I come here. Yum.
