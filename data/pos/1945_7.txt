This place sucked.  The people seemed to be mostly older.  Age 35 and up. The younger ones were mostly ugly and or fat.\n\nThe had a dance floor and a DJ. The music choice sucked. It was rap and country.  It was almost to get service since I wasn't a regular.\n\nI would not bring friends here unless they were old or ugly.
