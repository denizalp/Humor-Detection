These folks think it's ok to run a VERY LOUD foam insulation truck with no respect for local noise ordinance and HOA rules.  They have been parked outside my home insulating at my neighbors home since 6:15 AM.  When I called to voice my concern, they said I could leave my name and number.  Thanks for nothing!
