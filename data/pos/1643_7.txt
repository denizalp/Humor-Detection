There's a full-sized sand volleyball court, half a basketball court, and some huge tin trash cans to play a larger-than-life game of beer pong. \n\nThe outdoor seating is just that HUGE. \n\nIndoor is comfy, too, with a killer sound system and nice A\/C. Bartenders are way nice. Shots and mixed drinks were all like $5. \n\nYes, it's in the middle of nowhere, but this bar kicks ass. Drive the extra 10-15 minutes from Westgate and have a blast.
