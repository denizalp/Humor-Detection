Took my children for a free consultation for braces, yes both my kids need them, ugh! They took a full 360 x ray then we sat with the doctor. This consultation was our second opinion which I highly recommend, see more then one dentist.\nMr. Chenin was amazing, so friendly, made us comfortable, it was affordable, he's attentive, patient, knowledgeable and more! They also offer payment options with no interest.
