We just finished a total pool remodel - pebble tech, new equipment, travertine deck. At each step of the process, we were pleasantly surprised. Everyone was on time, did a very professional job & took great pride in their work. There was always a supervisor checking the job as we progressed. We had no problems with cleanup after each stage. Our project Supervisor, Ray, was obsessed with making sure we were not only informed, but happy with all the work. We simply could not have asked for more!!
