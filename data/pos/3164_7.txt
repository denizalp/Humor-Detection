Stopped here briefly to see that this is a pretty normal ground-level Lynx station, located behind the Pepsi plant off South Boulevard. Several condos and warehouse-district offices are nearby.\n\nNote: Triple C Brewing is also very close by: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/triple-c-brewing-company-charlotte\n\nThere is no parking but there are some bike racks.
