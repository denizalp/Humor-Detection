I like this Recall. Its big and clean. Well organised, the shelves are always stocked. \n\nThe people that work there are nice, a few walking dead ( those workers who don't care but are just there for the paycheck)\n\nCan be busy on the weekend but my favourite time to go is Friday after work. Its empty then. Darn I just spilled a secret. Oopsy
