I have not been to this mall in AGES!  It has changed and has a facelift (nice).  They have a parking structure, Costco, etc....  \n\nWe walked through the food court area.  Nice, clean, and lots of tables\/chairs to sit.  In the mall, they have many rest areas so your feet can get a break.  =)  I am not sure if they let dogs in, but someone was walking a HUGE dog???
