Decent Chinese fast food that is similar to Panda Express.  About what you would expect at a food court.  \n\nThe prices for the food entrees was a bit high.  The price for a bottle of beer was way too expensive.  Just get your alcohol at the casino while playing.\n\nGood place for a quick meal.  I would stop by again.  I just would not buy beer.
