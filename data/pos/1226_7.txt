Every time this business gets bad reviews they somehow make a new account on yelp lol!!\n\nThis place should be called CROOKstone Dental....Con artists that shouldn't have licenses to work on even a dogs mouth...\n\nOverpriced and poor quality are two things to expect when you come to this establishment.  Got a root canal and wasn't able to eat on my left side of my mouth for two years...\n\nShut this place down!!
