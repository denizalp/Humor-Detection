The ambience is very cool. It has a industrialize vibe to it. I absolutely love their cold brew drinks. It's very strong! You can also mix the cold brew with one of their almond drinks. I'm a huge fan of the Green Milk. The drink consists of almond, hazelnuts, spinach, kale, romaine, parsley, date, vanilla bean, maple syrup, and lava salt! I definitely want to come back and try a cleanse! I was told they are going to start having hot coffee soon.
