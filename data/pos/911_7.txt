Same cousin in town who took me to Rick's Restoration took me here. Turtns out this place is, also, a reality show that he watches.\nNeedless to say, it was beyond busy during SEMA week.\n\nSuper cool vintage motorcycles and old cars with one of a kinda paint jobs. I'm not into cars or anything of that sort but, I found this place to be a place of art. There was, even, a cool looking Porsche (I think) that I can picture James Dean driving.
