Garbage service, garbage food loaded with butter, not fresh, super greasy. My husband and I had a stomach ache all day after that disgusting meal.\nAfter all that when paying the bill the stupid waiter asked us to get up and go so that they can seat others.\nSo extremely rude and an awful experience.\nNever ever will I go back there. YUCK!!
