I dunno, Ive been there a few times over the years, and everytime pretty much without fail there are one or more of the following at governors:\n\n1. A harmless but HAMMERED regular who wants to tell you his life story.\n\n2. A group of  22 year old baseball cap wearing douches who give you stares \/ attitude\/ etc etc\n\n3. A semi-drunk semi-regular who will leer at and hit on your girlfriend\n\n4. Other stuff like the above.\n\nIts actually bordering on dive or hole status, if not in appearance then in \"atmosphere\"
