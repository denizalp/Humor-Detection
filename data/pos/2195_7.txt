There is a  HUGE selection or wigs, weaves, creams, oils, sprays, knockers, rubber bands beads, headers ect! All things hair related is in this business and at a fair price! There are also \"clothes\" kinda the quality is more like a mix between Wal-Mart and Fallas so the quality is questionable...but one time wears are cool too! Need less to say in any given week I could have long hair or a fade so I'm down for a good Midwest type hair store!
