This is a \"half-way house\" not a rehab facility.  If you care about your family member, do not send them here.  Run by a very mentally abusive onsite staff of past clients.  They are not professionally trained to work in the rehabilitation field.  There is no counseling provided.  Not only will your loved one not improve, they may get worse.
