Gross.  No idea how anyone likes this slop.  Bread is all soggy and way way way too big.  Everything we tried was kind of tasteless and just weird.  Meatballs are horrible.  side salad was a joke...I felt like I was eating weeds.\nAnd...the bill was over $70.  I don't get it.  Are people in cleveland clueless about what a good sandwich is?
