Had an exchange nightmare! Ordered aluminum and they delivered steel. Ok, no big deal, just exchange it. WRONG! 7 calls over a week and I still dont have the right product. I had the boss in sales tell me it was \"on the truck\" two days in a row only to have the original order still sitting on my dock. \n\nAfter waiting 2 weeks I have picked up what I needed and cancelled payment on the original order. Who knows if they'll ever come to get their steel back....
