Avoid at all costs. The dining experience couldn't have gotten much worse, save a hair or bug in the food, here at Steiner's. From very mediocre food (of course they ran out of their nightly special, as well) to completely neglectful service (yes, you, blond pony tail girl!), this was completely unpleasant. Decided to give our neighborhood Steiner's a try instead of the go-to, always reliable, always delicious,  always friendly Roadrunner. Major mistake. Steiner's is crossed off the list. Let me save you the trouble of finding out for yourself. :( Should have a 0-star option.
