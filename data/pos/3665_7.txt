Meh. Just a basic tourist trap souvenir shop located in Old Montreal.\n\nA mish mosh of t-shirts, hats, Canada paraphernalia, pins, and the normal items you find in these stores everywhere.\n\nThey do carry some old school Montreal Expos hats and T's though. Cool throwbacks.\n\nOf course I had to drop in and pick up a cheesy Montreal magnet for the fridge. When on vacation it's what I do. A sick obsession.
