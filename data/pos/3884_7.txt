My go-to nail salon! I've stayed faithful to this place for years now and I've never been disappointed!\n\nAll the workers are super friendly and great at what they do. For indecisive people like me, I always just leave my nail designs to them and I'm never disappointed :)\n\nI always get compliments on my nails and I'll always direct my friends here. High quality work that's quick and efficient!\n\nI come back once every month and I recommend  booking an appointment beforehand because you might have to wait if you're a walk in!
