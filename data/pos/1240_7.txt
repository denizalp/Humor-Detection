I really enjoyed the pomegranate\/mango juice ($2.50) I ordered from Freshly Squeezed at Eaton Centre.\n\nThe selections of Real fruit juice are huge and interestingly exotic?... but I wish for more healthy less sugary options if available.\n\nThe servers here were nice and polite! Definitely I would advice no ice if you order one of their juice... You really don't want to have 1\/2 cup of ice in their smallish small size...
