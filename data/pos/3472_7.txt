I love Mediterranean and was so excited to find this quick and easy order at the counter restaurant. Hubby and I ordered the gourmet cheese focaccia with steak, the gyro pita, and feta fries. The fries were good - seasoned fries right out of the fryer! The pita was a little bland and dry but hubby ate it all. I enjoyed the steak focaccia - highly recommend. Their green tea was pretty good too. With the 15% Check in discount, it was around $22. I will come return and try other items for sure!
