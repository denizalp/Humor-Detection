Molly's Pizza just continues to impress and impress. With my Baby Doll away for the weekend, I dined last night with my parents, whose NEW pizza delivery vehicle is Molly's. \n\nMolly's now has a deep-dish pie that comes with cured tomatoes and is doughy, cheesy divinity. Some say that no pizza purveyor has the right to offer more than one style of pizza pie. Molly's has overturned that rule. \n\nAlso worth ordering: The crispy, wafer-thin strips of deep-fried eggplant. \n\nSupport Molly's for she is mighty.
