MMMMMMMMMMMM\nMMMMMMMMMMMM\nMMMMMMMMMMMM\n\nYummy in my mutha effin' tummy!\n\nGot the medium sized burger no lettuce no tomatoes..BOMB.COM\n\nAlso got some onion rangs and ranch to add with the fries..I'm getting hungry again. \n\n(They need to season up the fries a bit more though. VERY plain.) \n\nBut, overall..good place to eat after some drinkin' :D
