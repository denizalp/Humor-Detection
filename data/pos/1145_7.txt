Kiss the Cook is so old school! Its a charming little place that's good to take the family or friends to enjoy breakfast. I use to live near by here and was first taken by people that raved about this place. I was surprised that they were right on about how good the food was. I am not a morning\/breakfast person, but for Kiss the Cook I will get my lazy butt up to enjoy.
