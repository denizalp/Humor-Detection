Funny story. So we were filming a commercial for our law firm. The basic premise of the commercial was that a drunk man mistakes a big fat biker for a hot girl. The director wanted a nice blonde wig. We went to showgirl supplies, which is in our building. They gave us exactly what we need. I still have the wig! I'm not a stripper, but I think this place could help any girl who needs supplies.
