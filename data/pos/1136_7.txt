The rift in our friendship is widening. Perhaps we should go to a Therift store.\n\nThis is a really cool used goods store with bargain prices and lots of great and very random unpredictable items. I like it a lot. I haven't seen a store quite like this anywhere in the US, except perhaps in NYC somewhere like Brooklyn or Queens.\n\nIf you're into thrift shopping, especially for unusual items, I highly recommend checking this place out, which also happens to be right in the middle of some of the coolest ethnic food spots in Toronto.
