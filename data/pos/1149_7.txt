I'm a sucker for the Coach outlet store. I don't like outlet malls typically, but I can never seem to enter this store without buying something unfortunately. On this occasion, I was trying to find a gift for my mom's birthday and my fella and I were each able to find something for her. Service is always really friendly and helpful. Despite the crowds, I'm always approached by a sales associate that will go above and beyond to help me find what I'm looking for.
