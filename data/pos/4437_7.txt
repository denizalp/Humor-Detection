I ordered a #1 Grilled Pork based on reviews here and the milky eye guy said it was most popular.  It measures 7\" compared with 9\"+ elsewhere. They are pretty light on vegetables and do not use cucumbers.  The pork was decent, maybe next time I'll have them add pate.\n\nI took the advice of another Yelper and did a little shopping at Vons while they made the sandwich so I don't know how long it took to prepare.\n\nI like the banh mi at Hue Thai better although more expensive.
