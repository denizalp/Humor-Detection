The staff at Capital Grill went above above and beyond. But since this is their standard they do it with grace and sophistication without pretension.   I always love the occasion to expose and expand my flavor palate, in combination with the proper education the nuances and deeper elements come through.  Between the staff providing an overview of the wines and the chef description of the preparation and pairings, each taste and morsel individually was amazing, and paired with precision.  \n\nThis event in 2 words:\nElegant\nDecadent
