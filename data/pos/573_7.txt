Oh happy day! Find me a service professional who is both professional and wonderful at service. They took in my upright Miele - which is like taking an appendage for a woman with children and animals - and told me it would be about a week. They called with a very reasonable estimate and voila, my treasured vacuum was in my possession exactly a week later, working like new. \n\nOwners are husband-wife and could not have been nicer. Yay for ABC! Do I hear Michael Jackson and a dance coming on??? Sorry but these guys are great.
