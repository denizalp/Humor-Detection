Had great fun at the batting cages with my wife and daughter. As Swedes we are not fed with baseball in the mother's milk like the Americans are. We struggled to hit the baseball even at the slowest speed (40 mp\/h), but after like 100 attempts we started to figure it out how to hit the %#%&\" ball.\n\nA really great facility and a very helpful staff made this visit a pleasant one.
