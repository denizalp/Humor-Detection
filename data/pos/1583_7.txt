Stopped by when bicycling the Three Rivers Heritage Trail on the North Shore.  There were 5 different food trucks so lots of variety to chose from.  Most of the picnic tables have a sun shelter which was nice.  Even though it was not hot, the sun and all the asphalt could make this rather hot but not so the day we were there.  \nThis really looks like a great place to have happy hour.  With many beers, wines, ciders on tap.  An area for corn hole and ladders.  Looking forward to a return visit in the evening.
