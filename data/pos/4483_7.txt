Wow. What a turn around. This place used to be great. Now it seems like it has turned a corner. All of the games are broken and steal your money. The whole place is now dumpy and unclean. I saw the owner yell at some guy for doing a slap save (a pretty normal move in the pinball world.) What a psychopath.
