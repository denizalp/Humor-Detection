Used the main space here for a meeting. Nice and bright, but quite echoey.  A minor issue getting the room warmed up but they eventually fixed it.\n\nThe food is awesome!  Almost worth having a meeting here just for it.  Everything comes from Fabarnack downstairs, so you'll know it'll be good (look for their reviews).. I think I'm just going to host a random meeting now just to come back and eat.
