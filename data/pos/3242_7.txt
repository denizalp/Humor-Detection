Amazing show at the Mirage!!! \n\nIf you are a Beatles fan this show is definitely more exciting and in a nice intimate venue where every angle side and seat makes it enjoyable with great views. It was nostalgic to hear the music and see the different acts throughout as each and every part of the cast was very talented with dancing, acts, and acrobatics explaining the story visually and through The Beatles music. The inside and outside of the of the venue all have wonderful decor, lighting, and ambiance. 5 Stars.~
