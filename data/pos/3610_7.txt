$26.75 will get you :\nRefrigerator flavored bread and butter\nStale chips and runny old salsa\nBrown over cooked meat (or is it?)\nSushi (wait, what is that again? Rice and cucumbers, oh yeah, sushi)\nShrimp cocktail from costco\nFrozen Crab legs\nBurnt potato wedges\nA sign that says bread pudding, but I wouldn't dare try it to find out if the sign were true. A reminder of why I haven't done a buffet in 20 years and why I will never again. Blech. \nNice server though.
