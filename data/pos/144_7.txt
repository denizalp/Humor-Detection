The service at this Wendy's can be choppy, but last night it was ever so gracious. The young woman that took our drive-thru order gave us desserts at no charge (their excellent Cinna-middles and chocolate chip cookies) after our first choice (brownies) had been completely depleted due to customer demand. \n\nI'm still enjoying Wendy's standard menu items, particularly the new, improved Hot 'N Juicy burger. \n\nP.S. Fast food workers, along with all others, deserve a hefty pay raise...\n\nhttps:\/\/www.commondreams.org\/view\/2013\/08\/29-7
