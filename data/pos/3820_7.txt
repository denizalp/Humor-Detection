Ask for Mary Ann- she was incredibly helpful and made what could have been a super stressful experience really easy.  They have an incredible selection of granite, at what we thought were fantastic prices.  They also gave us a great deal on a stainless steel kitchen sink, and they have a nice selection of tile & cabinets, too.  We will definitely be back for our next project.
