Spacious shopping area with a variety of stores and restaurants. I come here mainly if I'm in the area and want to browse at Crate and Barrel, but other stores such as Z Gallerie and BCBG are other favorites of mine to browse in. This is one of the few shopping areas that doesn't have one of the large department store anchors such as Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, or Saks.
