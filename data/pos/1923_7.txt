Tender was good.  I don't know if I would crave to go there again. \n\nThe service was excellent. Our server was very nice with a sense of humor. They did however get the cuts of meat mixed up and cooked them the wrong way. We did not bother to correct it.  \n\nMy steak was cooked the way I wanted.  I also asked for extra butter to which they forgot. \nThe oysters were good. \nThe Mac n cheese was probably the best thing I ate.  I love truffle.
