The Buffet at Bellagio is OK. \n\nI got a lot of items, mostly snow crab legs though (you got to win at the buffet!). I also got eggs benedict, bacon, sausage, California rolls (I know), and a spring roll. All were OK. The best were probably the desserts. I had a small pecan tart and a carrot cake for dessert and both were great. \n\nThe wait on a Sunday after check-out was about 15 min. The price was about $32. The ambiance is alright.
