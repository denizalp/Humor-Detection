Into her 80s, Mrs. Hotz still holds court here every Saturday night. After her telling of her husband's passing in the 1990's and how she has ran the bar ever since, I thought I was complimenting her, \"You're quite the entrepreneur.\" She saw right through my bs and asked, \"Are you calling me some sort of whore?!\" I love this woman, maybe even more than her 100yr old bar. If you want to feel a part of Cleveland's history, come to Hotz.\n\nIt has bar shuffleboard.
