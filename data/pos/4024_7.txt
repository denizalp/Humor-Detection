The worst restaurant I've ever not eaten at. Came with my friends and the lady at the front asked me a question and was visibly annoyed with me once I could not immediately respond. The servers we're complete jackasses. There's a fine line between sarcasm and rudeness and it seems like the team members need additional training. Eat here only if you're on the S end of S&M.
