I scrimped and saved for an AG doll for my grand-daughter.  Ordered her about a week ago for a whopping $125.00.  Several days later AG dolls were marked down 20%.  I wrote the company requesting I be reimbursed the 20% (just like I've been reimbursed from The Gap, Sears and Target).  I just received a letter from them saying they cannot reimburse me as that's against their policy.  WTF????  I just spent $125 for a freakin doll and they can't reimburse me 20%?????  So thus the review.
