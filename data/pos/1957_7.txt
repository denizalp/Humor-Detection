I only come here to get their 99 cent bags of ice that are advertised all over their outside windows. \n\nUnfortunately, out of 6 visits they have only had the bagged ice once. Why??? And offering me a large cup of ice for the same price is not gonna make me happy Mr. Manager. Just bag that ice up....
