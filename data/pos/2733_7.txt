When the doughiness of Winchell's and the glaze of Krispy Kreme combine ....comes this amazingness that is GLAZE! \n\nWhenever I get donuts, I get the standard choco glaze. I enjoy doughy donuts over cake (thick\/heavy) ones. So I judge all donuts by the same choco glaze ones. \n\nLemme say that Ronald's and Winchell's are my favorites ...til now... \nAiry, fluffy, and I think bigger than Ron or Win ^^^ GLAZE IS OFFICIALLY MY NEW FAVORITE!  Yes, it's officially official when it's said on Yelp. \n\nDonut forget **pun intended** about the 10% discount by checking in on Yelp ;)
