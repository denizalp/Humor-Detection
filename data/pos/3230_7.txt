Found this new pharmacy next to the mini mart I always go to. Decided to drop off my scripts and run some errands, but the pharmacist said he could get it done in about 15 minutes, to my surprise It was done by the time I finished getting my stuff next door at the mart. He was fast and efficient, and super nice. They have this free antibiotic program, which I think is super cool, even though I have insurance. It seems like this is a pharmacy that actually cares about their patients. Transferring my scripts here.
