My favorite breakfast place hands down. No matter which location you go to the food is always top notch and you can count on fast and friendly service. Veronica was our server today and she was an absolute doll. Another stellar meal.\n\nSome of my favorites include the eggs and cheese stuffed French toast, the chile relleno omelet, pork carnitas, and classic breakfast. The red chile sauce they serve with some of their Mexican breakfasts is so good we usually request some on the side in lieu of salsa.
