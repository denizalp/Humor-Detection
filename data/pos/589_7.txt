Nothing about this bar excites me. They had a nice B.J lounge over by the MGM grand but the lame Dotty's brought out the building. I wish the bar would do somethimg unique to get the blood boiling for a change. Karoke, trivia night, bingo or something. Shit, adding a Touch Tunes machine would help enormously. What happened to the female bartender's skimpy outfits? Come on man. EXCITE ME!!!!!
