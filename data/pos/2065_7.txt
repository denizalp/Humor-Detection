This cafe is amazing! First off, the Volkswagen tent and grass area is an awesome idea!! Such a cute, hipster feel to this cafe. The honey toast is TO DIE FOR. All the fruits, ice cream, and condensed milk on top of warm brick toast = heaven! Must try. \nTheir lattes and mochas are very good too. The service was okay. Not bad, but not superb. \nI love that they have a bunch of tables to sit and enjoy a cup of tea\/coffee with friends. Will happily try this place again!
