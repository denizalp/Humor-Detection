What a 180 from the horrendous experience I had at David's Bridal!\n\nWe didn't even have an appointment here we just had the urge to go inside and look at some dresses and I am so glad we did!\n\nNot only did we find the most perfect bridesmaids dresses, but I found exactly the dress I was looking for!\n\nShe listened to everything I wanted and got me into the perfect dress!\n\nThis store is beautiful and the staff actually pays attention to you and your wedding needs! Definitely will be recommending and getting all our wedding needs from here!
