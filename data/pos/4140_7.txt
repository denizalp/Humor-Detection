Well, the frosting is bad and the cake is horrible...not a good start for a cupcake shop.\n\nMy biggest mistake was expecting large cupcakes like you get in NYC.  Unfortunately these are more on par with Giant Eagle's packaged bakery offerings.\n\nI will not be returning unless they really change their cupcake options.
