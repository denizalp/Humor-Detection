Stopped in while in town for a wedding, it's directly across the Hilton Home2Suites in a really nice shopping area.  Great environment, friendly staff, and efficient service.  \n\nWe were seated promptly and we liked the variety of cocktails, wines, spirits, and overall menu.  They are the self-proclaimed the home of the $4 Sangria which is pretty legit.  \n\nThey offer a small variety of seating that ranges from table top to lounging style sofas for more intimate parties.  \n\nHad a great time here with extended family and would definitely recommend and would be back if in town again.
