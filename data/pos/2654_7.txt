My Big Fat Greek Restaurant in Burbank closed down, so I was happy to see this in Phoenix.  Serving portions are huge and prices are reasonable.\n\nGyro was a bit dry, but the flavor was spot on.  I took my girl here for dinner.  Our server checked on us often and water glasses were always well attended.
