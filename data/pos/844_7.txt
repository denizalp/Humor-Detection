I went to Station Square in 2014 with a girl I like and we got our picture taken at the photo booth. One of the options for borders to place around our picture was \"HAPPY NEW YEAR 2006.\" The picture came out grainy, like I took it on my old flip phone from high school.\n\nI paid for parking because I was forced to pay for parking and I walked past the tourist traps and tourists being trapped in this cesspool of everything I wish died with Pittsburgh's steel mills. \"If only they had a Spencer's Gifts,\" said no one.
