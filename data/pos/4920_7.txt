We were informed we were on the \"guest list\" but so was every other female in Vegas apparently. We waited almost 2 hours to move approximately half way through the line. We decided to leave and went to our hotel pool instead that had a DJ and was way less crowded (but still super fun!). The \"non guest list\" line was mostly men and 3x as long. Kind of a scam of the promoters of you was me...
