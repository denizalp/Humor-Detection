There is a mural outside of cat people drinking PBR. There are some craft beers. mostly everyone is chugging PBR crying into their smartphones, looking antisocial and hopeless. smoking up a storm. wearing the same post modern uniform of coolness. \n\nThe kitchen is a closet that looks like a torture chamber. \n\nreally bad techno bumping on a sat night.\n\nthey only take cash and rip you off via ATM fees. \n\nIt's tiny like being inside Castro's cigar box.\n\nEnjoy if that's your thing.
