Food was good, but seems not as good as a few years ago.  Seems attentional to detail not as good. The lady took my order but she was in such a rush to sit down and eat herself, she forgot to put our order in and started to notice people there after us getting their food.\n\nMistakes happen, but for the inconvenience I would have preferred more than just a cookie offer, seriously brau?\n\nClub sandwich needed work, but oriental side salad was good.  Poor bros chips good, Arnold Palmer bland. They need work on their lemonade, little \nweak
