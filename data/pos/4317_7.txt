Hung over from your hardcore partying at (fill-in-the-club-name-here)??\n\nA nice, steaming bowl of pho is the perfect fix, and Pho Thanh Huong makes it gooooood.  Their broken rice (com tam) dishes are also delish.  Make sure to get the tau hu ky (shrimp in tofu paper?).\n\nThe restaurant is bright and will definitely wake you up.  Wear your sunglasses if needed.  The prices are cheap, the food is good.  What else do you need?\n\nWhen you've nursed yourself back to life, make sure to buy some Vietnamese sandwiches for later!  The shredded chicken sandwich is yummmmm.
