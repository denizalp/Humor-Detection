Have you ever wondered what it's like to enjoy lemongrass chicken in a rice bowl? (No? Just me?). Well, you can get to try it at Yummi Banh Mi Truck, just follow them on social media. The truck is everywhere. The bowl was satisfying, and can be shareable ( I was starving and I didn't share it). \n\n\nFive Yelps.
