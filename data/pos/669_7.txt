If you're a dude, expect an awesome service. Female? you're better off asking your guy friends to order for you. Haha.\n\nWent here one time with a friend. She got \"discriminated\" or that's what she thought. Well, she was sitting at the end of the bar where the bartenders couldn't see her!\n\nDrinks are okay priced at $6.50. Went here on a Saturday night. Thank god, no cover! They were pretty much playing traditional country and pop country.\n\nWould come back here with a group of guy friends rather than women.
