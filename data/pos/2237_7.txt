Hot Topic used to be about the music. Now, they're about what's \"in\". This particular location is weird. The people who work there are less than helpful and any time I walk in, I feel like I'm being watched. Plus, recently, they've pretty much shut off the lights, so it's extremely dark in there. It's kind of irritating when most of the store is black to begin with.
