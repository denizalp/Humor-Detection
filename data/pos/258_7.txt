I stopped in here for a nonfat vanilla latte on my way to a meeting on Friday morning and it was good, not great. There was a little wait and overall, it didn't knock my socks off. However, it is near my house and I would rather support a local business than Starbucks so it is likely that I will be back! :) It did have a cozy atmosphere so it may be nice to come here and work someday! I would like to try their food next time.
