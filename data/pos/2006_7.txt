Relatively expensive for Ossington, The painted lady offers an interesting selection of beer and nachos. Nachos get top marks for using fritos instead of generic corn tortilla chips and cheese whiz instead of semi-melty shredded cheese.  Watch out for the toilets- as you descend the stairs into a dark, dark place you might get scared. Have bat vision before going pee!
