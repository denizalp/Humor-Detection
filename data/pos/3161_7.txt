Enh. Not thoroughly impressed. The waffles, pancakes and French toast were tough and stale. And some of the pre-made salads were bitter. Everything else was decent--especially the cookies and Japanese cuisine. I guess you can't beat the fairly low price ($26+tax). Otherwise, I wasn't impressed with the style or layout. Also, the lighting in there sucks IMO. Maybe this used to be the best buffet in Vegas, but I think the Wynn has the top spot on lockdown!
