Located off the strip SpringHill provides comfortable rooms at reasonable prices.\nIf you want to stay away from all the craziness of the Strip this is a decent option.\nThere is a free breakfast buffet, with great coffee and below average food.\n\nIf your coming to Vegas to have fun on the strip, don't stay here as it is too out of the way.  Exactly why we stayed here for our business trip LOL.
