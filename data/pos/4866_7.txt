I absolutely loved the coffee here. Very robust but smoooooth! I enjoyed the buckwheat crepe with veggies. Unfortunately, not gluten free, which I will pay for. Ugggh, though worth the itching and tummy ache. Lol\nThey have a lovely menu and are in the process of expanding the dining area. \nWe got here early due to a long waiting line. \nThere is limited patio seating so plan accordingly.
