Came here to check out Hash a Go Go for breakfast, man WHAT A DUMP! Park garage is a maze and so is the casino. The entire hotel was fithy, I didn't want to touch anything in fear of getting hepatitis. \n \nWe didn't eat at Hash a Go Go because it was packed.\nI understand its being renovated but you can't polish a turd.
