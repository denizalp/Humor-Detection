Sands Expo hosted Adobe MAX and it was well oiled experience. Facilities were mostly modern and refreshed with temp staff everywhere to assist with directions and guidance. \n\nConference seats were comfortable and A\/C was strong. Dessert air is very dry so be sure to bring some lotion, chapstick, and a humidifier too!\n\nBathrooms were well stocked with paper towels, facial tissues!\n\nBe prepared for lots of walking so bring comfortable shoes!
