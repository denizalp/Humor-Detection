Our first time in Vegas to see our JLO and we ended up leaving the event, because there was a couple in front of us that did not want to sit down. Everyone was telling them to please sit down and they were just rude.. I was so upset that I just got up and left. I didn't want my fianc√© to get arrested for actually speaking up for everyone.. The security did absolutely nothing.. Will not return to this venue unless we sit right up front.. Our event was a disaster..
