I have been to this place two times the first time I was offered barely any assistance in trying to help me find the proper hair and the second time was just the other day I waited out front when I realize that they do not open till 11 a.m. for 1 hour and then 11 hit and they never showed up I finally left at 11:15 a.m. and went up the street to a different hair store that I realized now is really great.
