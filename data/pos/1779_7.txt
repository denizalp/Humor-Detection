Make an appointment for registration....I went in thinking I could just register but there was something wrong with my account. Then 3 hours of my life passed, lunch was eaten, and then I got to talk to someone about the ONE class I needed to schedule. Is there a reason that I needed to talk to someone face to face and not over the phone? I will make an appointment the next time anything happens, that way at least I will know the time to come in and will be seen right away!!!
