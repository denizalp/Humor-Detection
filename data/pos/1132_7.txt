I am new to the west side of Cleveland. I like this place! Shelly is a good manager and  simply doing her job; Providing a good product at a fair price to both the patron and the owner. \nThere are many items on the menu to choose from and I have never been disappointed in the bar food specials, staffing or experiences I have had here. \n\nIts a great meeting place, that I highly recommend!
