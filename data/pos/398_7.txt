I went there a few minutes ago. Yes let this Hispanic Customer Rep upon entering. He had horrible service. No smile nothing. I was going in there to spend money. I told him that I want time name of the owner because he would like to know how his customers are treated. Professional guy here and will not go back with that guy  He should be fired!!!  Wednesday- June 28th 8pm was his shift. (Hispanic guy with big teeth).
