Kudos to yelper and fellow foodie Aaron L for recommending this place! Dude knows his stuff! \n\nRepeat after me: \"$20 lunch special - 3 course meal!\". Where else can you get great Greek food at a fancy restaurant overlooking the strip with great service for that price? Answer: the one and only Milos. \n\nParking in the structure at Cosmo, restaurant is right by the elevators on 2nd floor past the gigantic blinding chandelier.
