Fairly reliable service, and the PSW's are fairly attentive. Some are completely rude and out of order. It's a bit pricey compared to private care, but there's a comfort knowing that there will generally always be someone available and accountable. Antonella, Leslie Anne and the other coordinators have been awesome as well. They always reply fairly quickly and take all concerns and matters seriously. They always do their best to make sure customer satisfaction is achieved. I'd recommend this company to anybody who needs Private Care for a loved one.
