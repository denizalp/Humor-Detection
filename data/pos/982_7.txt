Anyone who reads my reviews knows that subway is the bane of my existence. I have no patience and high standards when it comes to the simple things. \n\nThat being said, this subway makes me more fond of it every time I visit. Hands on owners, curated staff that are quick, super friendly, and really just well rounded in every way.
