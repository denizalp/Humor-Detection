Caramel sea salt ice cream, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul... the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth....\nI will be back...you just have to wait - 4 months, 15 lbs later - I will be back...to hold you again, to taste you again...deep sigh.
