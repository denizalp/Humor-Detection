Am I the only one who forces their kids to go grocery shopping with mom and dad??  Lol,  honestly,  they, sometimes,  want to join us. I love it of course when they do.  We cut up and hae fun.  And outside of Publix  (where shoppin is a pleasure!) Teeter rocks!  Actually we love both.  This teeter is probably our favorite.   Love the vibe and set up of the store. It even has a bar section where folks will actually sit and drink!  Its just a great location!
