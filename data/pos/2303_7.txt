Unprofessional.  Came for a fire and ice hot stone massage treatment scheduled for 10am.  Arrived at 10:05am and the receptionist stayed on the phone for several minutes while we waited.  When the masseuse came out she states we can't do your treatment because you were late.  I explained that the receptionist was on the phone.  She refused to do the service and offered to do something else instead.....or give a gift card to come back.  I am going to save myself the aggravation and avoid this unprofessional staff.
