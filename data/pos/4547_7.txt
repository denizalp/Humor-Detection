Super huge w\/ a Cafe 27.  It's hit and miss w\/ service.  Sometimes they are nice and helpful and sometimes they 'guide' you to the isle.  The cashier area is strange with 18 isles, but that area is all smiling & friendly employees.  \n\nI like the location in Town Square and that's the best I can say.  Totally overpriced and although they sell way more stuff than Best Buy, I like Best Buy better. \n\nThank you for turning the annoying slot machine sound off on the outside entrance.
