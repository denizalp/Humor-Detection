Just got home from dim sum with the family here. I come here for dim sum about once a month. It's one of the better dim sum places in vegas. The line can get pretty long, so we try to come around 11am. Today the line started getting long just after 11:15am. \n\nThe food off the dinner menu is good too, but the portions are small. Salt & Pepper Frog Legs is one of my favorite dishes here. Yup. I said FROG LEGS!! Soft like fish and sorta tastes like chicken.
