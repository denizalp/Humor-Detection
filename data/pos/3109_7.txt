1 star = for the awesome & flavorful clam chowder; one of the best I've ever tasted\n\n2 stars = for the fried calamari.  Great and generous portion!  Every bite was crisp.  I don't like the sauce though.\n\n3 stars = oysters!  We always get a dozen...they're fresh and yummers!\n\n4 stars = the way they cook in front of you...check it out for yourself!\n\nGo try it now if you are craving oysters.  They usually have crab leg specials too!  South Point is an awesome casino too!  Huge place and lots of video poker!
