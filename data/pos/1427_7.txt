I'm currently sitting at the bar.  I just finished a over done burger and I'm drinking a coke because I have a professional engagement.  My meal has been finished for close to 20 minutes.  I mean, plate empty, glass empty, waiting for the check finished.  So where is my server?  I don't know, and if you find him, could you send him over with my check, I got somewhere I need to be.\n\nUPDATE: 20 minutes later as my server was leaving for the day, he notoced I was still there.  Amazing.
