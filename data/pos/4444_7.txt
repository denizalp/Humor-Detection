Get the pie. You HAVE to get the pie.\nOrdered a lunch special, with a sandwich, coffee and a slice of pie ($10?). Of course, since Rockaberry's is a cafe renowned for their desserts, the pie did not disappoint. Not only was it an enormously huge slice about a quarter of the entire pie, the berry pie was tart, sweet, moist and flakey. The margarita panini with a small side 'salad' was fine, but not exactly memorable. The pie, however, I still crave to this day. I will be back...for more pie. Yum.
