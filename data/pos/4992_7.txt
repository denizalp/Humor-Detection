Shitcan Ben R. He will only continue to screw-up, embarassing himself and his team in the process. He's also, dare I say, overrated. \n\nThe Rooneys need to stop being so damn cheap and find a consistently good QB, one that has his head in the game, always plays at the height of his powers, not just when he feels like it, and isn't saddled with personal problems and emotional disorders.\n\nIn other words, find a good QB who's not the NFL's equivalent of Dubbya.
