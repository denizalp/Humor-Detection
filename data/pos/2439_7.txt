This Old Navy is very clean and well-kept. The staff is very friendly and they had a lot of different size selections. And when we went it was awesome they had Sales Plus they gave you cash (paper) depending on the amount you spent to come back and spend more money.  Got a couple of summer dresses for ten bucks can't beat that!
