In A Nutshell:\n\n-Noodles Ranch is a nice little Vietnamese-Asian restaurant tucked away in a strip mall in Scottsdale, AZ.\n-The owner, Noelle who is a Pacific North West transplant was very friendly and we had some great small talk.\n-My brother was very happy w\/ their pho.\n-I ordered the Bun Thit Nuong which was pretty good too.\n\nOverall, I like their happy hour b\/c you get IPA's for only $3!  Cam on chi Noelle!!!
