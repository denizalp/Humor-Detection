Stopped in here for lunch and got the Cucumber Sunomo, Yellowtail Jalapeno and the Tuna Special. All were very delicious and fresh, for being a Monday.  These are off the modern sashimi section, so no bed of rice.\n\nEach had a little spice and crunch which complimented each other well.  The meal did not come with Wasabi and Ginger, so we needed to request that.  After trying one with the typical mix, I now know why they weren't served with our meal.  They were better without.\n\nIf in the area of Crystals, give them a try, it won't disappoint.
