I wouldn't eat here.  The guy they have cooking often walks food through the garbage area in the building with food.  That's gross.  I wouldn't want to get sick.  Just putting out there because I've seen him.  Probably not following food handling code by doing that.  Pretty gross.  \n\nThat having been said, the coffee is ok and the staff are nice.  Probably ok to enjoy the patio and have a few drinks.  Just no food.
