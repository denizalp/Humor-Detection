This mall is like a ghost town. \nFrom the food court - which lost all the good choices. \nTo the shops. There's no more Wet Seal, Forever 21, or even a makeup store. Why don't they add a Sephora or something? \nBesides those stores, almost everything is empty.\nThis mall used to be my go to back in day. \nNow I drive all the way to Arrowhead. \n\n- also, the food court has roaches. I posted a pic of what I seen.
