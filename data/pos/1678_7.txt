This place sucks! No Sauna\/Steam room, no more racquetball courts, and no jacuzzi ! They downsized the pool area! Idk what LA Fitness is trying to do, but I'm looking hard @ their competition, for some of the amenities that they left out from the old club, that in my opinion, was a better workout facility! If LA Fitness is successful as the say they are, then they should've opened the new facility, and left the one on 67th Ave open, as well!!!
