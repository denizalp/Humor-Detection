Quality was great, I ordered the cookies and some cake truffles.\n\nHOLY BEJEEZUS those truffles were HUGE!\n\nThe cake truffles were moist but not gooey like the Starbucks cake pops, which is how I always want those to taste, but they never do.\n\nThe cookies - sour cream sugar cookies- were as moist as they sound and again HUGE. Individually wrapped, the price to quality ratio is way in favor of the customer.
