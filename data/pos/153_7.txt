Blehhhh, blehhhh, blehhhhh! I did not like this place at all!  Ordered the chicken fried rice, yuckkk!  I had them take it back, I ended up replacing it with the chicken lettuce wraps, thankfully they were good and much better than my other dish but I've had better lettuce cups.  If your in Vegas, skip this place there are so many other good places to visit.  Even the other people in our party said their food was bland and they had to drench it in the hot sauce to make it taste good. =(
