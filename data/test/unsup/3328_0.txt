Had three burgers and mozz sticks. Nom. Wife had Church's mashed potatoes for her mangled dental destruction mouth. Good to have around, but doubt I'll be back for a year. I like that each burger comes in it's own cardboad sleeve. Like a vinyl lp. Probably would last as long if I never ate them. The burgers I mean. I would never eat an lp. Well, never say never. My Michael Symon \"Greatest Laughs from a Wacko Chef\" lp with the pork shoulder cover looks sort of tempting sometimes.
