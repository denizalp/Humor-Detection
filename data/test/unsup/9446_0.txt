The closest pet store to home.  It has all the brands we need for our dogs.  Having Wal-Mart in the same plaza makes it easy to kill 2 birds with one stone.  Sorry, I know killing birds isn't the best comparison in a pet store review.\n\nMy wife thinks a better dog clothing department would help :)  \n\nThe cashier line can be a bit slow at times.  Especially when you got the old lady in front of you that has broken out 11 different coupons.  Some are expired, some the cashier isn't familiar with and one is for Del Taco.
