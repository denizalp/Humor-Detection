Soo if I could I'd do a half star.\nDining room is gross and the food looks like it's been sitting out all day. Gross and when I asked for my bacon to be super crispy the kid laughed to the kid that was about to make the meal. \nLike I'm sorry this kid had braids hanging down on his face \nHealth code violation time 10.\nJust so much grossness going on.\nDon't bother here
