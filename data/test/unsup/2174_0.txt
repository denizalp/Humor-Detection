This place pisses me off. I grind my own beans, I know what roasts I like, I know pour over and french press and aeropress and all that esoteric subculture I have a love\/hate relationship with.\n\nI don't like being talked down to and explained they don't carry *anything* but sugar in the raw. Thanks but that's not how I drink my coffee and unless this is liquid gold, I don't want my coffee with a side of your useless MFA.
