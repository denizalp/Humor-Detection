The food was good but the waitstaff was very rude. They told us we would have a 20 min wait and we waited for 45 min. As soon as we got seated our waitress was very rude and not friendly whatsoever. When we were getting ready to pay our waitress told us that they don't spit checks that they should have told us when we checked in and then she guesses she could do it for us this one time
