Super happy with both the product and the customer service! I ordered a 5*7 photo book with a deal on Groupon, the order was delivered to me exactly 9 business days later, right on time! \n\nI'm also very happy with their customer service. I needed to make changes to my order and they handled this promptly and courteously. I'd definitely use these guys again.
