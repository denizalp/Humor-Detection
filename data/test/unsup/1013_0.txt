Heyyy mannn, if you usually talk like how I'm writin' right now, and you, like, wanna spend your time hangin' out and don't mind waitin'... and waitin... for your sammich, this is the place to be dudes. \n\nAnyhoo, it took me 20 minutes for my sandwich to be made!  The bread is nicely toasted, the ingredients and sauce are plentiful, but the Thai jerk sandwich tasted a bit strange to me (probably related to the sauce), and was not worth the really long wait for lunch.
