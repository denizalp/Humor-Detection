I hate to give such a low rating to a local place, but this food wasn't anything close to Thai cuisine.  Every dish we ordered [Cashew Chicken, Mongolian Beef--which isn't even Thai--and a noodle dish] had the same exact sauce.  Very little flavor.  To be very honest, it's not even really passable as Chinese food, much less Thai.
