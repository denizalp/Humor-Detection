Decided to stop by Demore's Pizza and grab a quick bite to go.  I got an Italian Hoagie Pittsburgh Style (fries & slaw on sandwich) and an order of their Hot Cheese Balls. The place seemed clean, the staff was very pleasant, and the food was really good.  I recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area.
