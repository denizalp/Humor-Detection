The food was great, and so was the service.  The entrance at was a bit odd though.  There is a bar entrance at one side, and exit only door in the middle where the hostess desk is, and the restraunt entrance at the end.  My husband had been craving a teriyaki burger forever, and since they have a build-your-own burger menu he was quite happy.  I would go back for sure the service was great and our glasses were always filled.
