Came here yesterday afternoon and it was an extremely quiet lunch, due to cinco de mayo i think. Everything was delicious and came out quickly. My husband and I both work at a CPK in San Diego so we tend to have high standards when we visit other Cpks. The manager came out to say hi and was super nice and friendly. Definitely enjoyed our time!
