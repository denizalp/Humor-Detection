*IF YOU ARE ORIENTAL DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO SERVE YOU* \nI went to the food counter to order something and the girl working there looked at me with hatred and completely ignored me because of my race. She then motioned for the person behind me to come up so that she could serve them instead. Absolutely disgusting how racist she was.
