Terrible 4 from arizona went here and i could not eat a bite. 3 others started and had to stop eating. Food was cold and would not pass a health food inspection.  See my other reviews i am fair this is a noooo go place it will make you ill. Our mistake for picking a buffet. The manager ende up charging us 2 full buffet cost. 3 bites cost 34 buck. BEWARE
