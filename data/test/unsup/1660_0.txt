I loved my experience at the Wigwam! Stayed here with my family this weekend and we had a blast. The room was so nice, it was spacious with comfortable beds. There was a nice little balcony overlooking the pool. We loved laying out by the pool and enjoying our drinks. I loved all of the old photos in the lobby. Just walking around the lobby was fun! I loved all of the decor. Really awesome hotel, good staff. I'd come back!
