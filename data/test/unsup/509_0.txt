Medical Director is a insensitive,  rude and arrogant man.  Management is unorganized.   Case Managers are worst I've ever seen.  Nurses Understaffed.  Many Doctors and staff are rude, heartless and lie to protect each other.  I will make sure that I notify their administration, community, insurance companies and government of my actual observation as a professional health nurse.
