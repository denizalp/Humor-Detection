The Alfredo the dark with chicken was DELISH!!! The bread that comes with it had a funky flavor. My husband ordered the margarita pizza. It was tasty but very traditional (meaning very little cheese) so my husband was a bit disappointed. Environment and service was upbeat. We will try it again. (Looking forward to enjoying my leftovers for at least 2 if not 3 more meals) Yum!
