Stopped by last night with my colleague to shop for some things needed for our Halloween costumes. I was impressed! If you need a Halloween costume, forget going to specialty stores because you can likely find everything here for half the cost. The staff here are extremely helpful when looking for something. After we picked up everything needed for our costumes, we looked through their regular clothing items. A lot of good stuff for very reasonable prices.\n\nGood for: shopping, Halloween
