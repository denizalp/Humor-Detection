What I want to know is who the hell puts sweet relish on a burger? Especially a burger that already has dill pickles.. I mean I love pickles as much as the next asshole, but I fn HATE sweet relish, so it pretty much ruined the whole thing. \n\nAside from that, my curly fries were perfect, and they have Cherry Coke.. so here, have 2 stars.
