the sashimi is not fresh at all. Oshikushi and aburi plate tastes ok, but not comparable with Jabistro or Miku. Momisan roll, is not good. The atmosphere of restaurant and service are good, but there are little black flys around the place, and even a dead one on the menu.  Overall, not recommend, will not come for second time.
