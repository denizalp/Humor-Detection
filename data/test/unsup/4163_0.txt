LOL......I (Sheila) had never been to a K-Mart in my life!\n\nSo there happened to be one in the shopping complex we were in, so naturally we walked in.\n\nI wasn't missing much... everything was cheap, store was a bit messy and had lots of shoppers.\n\nReally goes without saying -  I will not be coming back.... ever!
