Don't waste your time.  Unless of course you love undercooked chicken and the results of eating it.  Or perhaps you like an upscale lounge where you can dine with multiple people shedding their shoes and socks and really letting those traveler's feet air out while you enjoy the raw chicken delicacies.  American Express has succeeded in helping me appreciate the food safety standards and \"no shirt, no shoes, no service\" policies offered by McDonalds.
