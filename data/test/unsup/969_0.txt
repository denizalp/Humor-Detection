We went to and were greeting by friendly people.   We sat at the bar and the bartender Dakota was very helpful in explaining menu items.  Dakota made us great drinks.   We ordered 6 different kind of tacos.   They had several to choose from.   My favorite was the portobello mushroom.   Their salsas were wonderful!   Everything was great.  We will definitely go back when we are in Madison again.    Loved it!
