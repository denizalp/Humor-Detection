Came to Big Heng's, as I've heard great reviews for mandarin cuisine. Was promptly sat, and waited over 15 minutes for the server to return to take our order. After several attempts of eye contact and waving at other servers\/ restaurant employees... We still sat hungry, with our waters. At the 20 minute mark we left, and will never return again.
