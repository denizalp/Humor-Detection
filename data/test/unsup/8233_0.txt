In our rush to depart on time, We accidentally left my sons suit in the zipped bag hanging in the closet.   We realized our forgetfulness about 3 days later.  \n\nWe offered a reward and filed a claim with the hotel.   Even security admitted the maid probably took the suit and didn't report it but encore would not take any action.  \n\nNot trust worthy.   \n\nThe operations VP wrote us a letter stating case was closed and no action was taken.    We will never stay there again.
