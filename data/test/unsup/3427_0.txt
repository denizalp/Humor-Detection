Loved Marquee on a Friday night. The place was packed, everyone looked awesome and the music was great.\n\nThe 2 rooms give you a choice between hip hop and house music. \n\nDrinks were pretty strong compared to other clubs we went to.\n\nOnly dislike was how small the dance floor was in the House room. It got so packed that night that they had to start blocking access to it.\n\nRead a more detailed review here: http:\/\/shotsandstars.com\/marquee-las-vegas-cosmopolitan-review-with-cosmic-gate-and-emma-hewitt\/
