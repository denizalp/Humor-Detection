They did a great job trimming two trees, and cutting back oleander bushes.  One tree has two trunks growing at odd angles.  I had thought about bracing them, but was told the danger of doing so to the tree.  That is, eventually the metal brace would cut into the tree and kill it.  Grateful for their expertise.
