Just recently moved to the area and have tried a few other local salons but Lovely Nails is by far the best I've found. Salon is very cute and clean. Staff is very friendly and helpful and usually not too long of a wait (if there even is one at all). They also have a huge selection of shellac\/gel colors to choose from and prices are reasonable. Definitely recommend!
