This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant! I prefer seafood and typically l don't find it on our regular Mexican hangouts.  I end up have Chile relleno. Not today! There were many options for pescatorians and vegetarians, woot woot! \nFor my first time here l picked the ceviche tostada and a side of beans. Ron got a chicken quesadilla. We were both amazed how good everything tasted! Our waitress and hostess were so helpful, friendly and attentive.  Prices are  $ food tastes $$$. We will be back soon to explore their menu further!
