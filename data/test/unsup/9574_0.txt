This place has absolutely the best Pho I've had in Phoenix. I went to college where they had a pho places everywhere but out here they are hard to come by. To date this is one of the tastiest places I've been to. The portions are good and the flavors are great. I did order a Thai tea with boba, the flavor of the tea was bland but the bobba was perfect. I would 100% recommend this place
