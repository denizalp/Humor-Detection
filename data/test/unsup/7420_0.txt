I found Delma on Groupon. She's quick to make appointments and very friendly. She definitely knows her stuff. She loves to chat during the facial. She always has interesting stories and knows about current events.  The prices are reasonable. I love the facials. She's been keeping my face healthy for years. Highly recommended!
