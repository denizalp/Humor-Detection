First off I am reviewing this as a Burger King, and its the hippest, coolest BK i have ever been to! \n1)All the employees had their teeth A++++\n2)The bathrooms didnt have standing turds from the previous trucker who ate there. A+\n3)Its perfect for when you are on your last $10 for a cheap eat on the way out of getting casino raped at the RIO.\n4) only bad thing??? Its way in the top back corner and very eay to miss. \nI mean everyone knows, NOBODY KEEPS BK IN THE CORNER!!!
