Ordered through UberEats, and the food was made fast, and fresh!\n\nGot 2 medium pizzas with 3 toppings and a small side for $24. The pizza was nicely loaded with toppings, and really delicious!\n\nThe garlic bread with cheese was also good, tons of melted cheese on top.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place!
