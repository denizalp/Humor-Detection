Our origional mortgage company sold our mortgage  to round point. I'm freaking out as I can't find anyone from Customer service that is competent enough to help me with issues with escro account. My husband and I have called several times trying to explain that we don't owe from 2016 as they sent two checks to the city in error. You ask to talk to a manager and they you that they not available. Any have a decent contact?
