Why would anyone want to be in this place for a concert? Can't see the stage if you don't book a table. Why even let anyone in and roam around and can't sit or do anything?  They didn't even put the concert through the monitors. Servers were rude AF! Get a regular ticket and watch the concert down in the Arena. Let all the  Kardashian-esque people be in their own little utopia.
