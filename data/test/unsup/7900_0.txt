Was invited to an event here.  I'm impressed by the top notch service delivered by every employee.  From the valet team to the front desk, they were on top of our every need.\n\nThis review is not of the rooms since we didn't stay here.  However, the wait staff and other front of the house employee made our short visit memorable.  If I had to stay in downtown Phoenix, I'd consider staying here.....great service goes a long way with me.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
