Very cool coffee shop. Typical prices, but awesome space. They sell vinyl records, new and used. They also have artwork on the wall for sale. In addition to downstairs seating, there's a loft upstairs with a few more seats. I believe there's also a vinyl player up there for you to listen to records. Really great vibe overall, would love to spend time working\/studying there if I lived in Cleveland.
