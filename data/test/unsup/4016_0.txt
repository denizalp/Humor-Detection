The Double Bacon Cheeseburger at AMP 150 is a great looking burger. Ohio Cheddar, Benton's Bacon, truffle aioli, house pickles, and an onion bun. The rich flavors of the bacon, cheddar, pickles, and aioli make for a great burger. This burger had some smart flavors, however its shortcoming was the fact that the two beef patties were overly cooked and dry. This led to a very dry profile for the entire burger. I found myself chasing each bite with my drink. If you get a juicy one this burger might be quite a bit better!
