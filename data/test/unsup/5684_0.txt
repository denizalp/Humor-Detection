I don't really like to eat at buffets. Not really a big fan of cafeteria style food. That being said, I don't mind having lunch at Feast buffet once in a while. It is clean and they have pretty good salad bar. I usually just eat the roasted chicken and salad if I go here, so I can't speak on the rest of the selections.
