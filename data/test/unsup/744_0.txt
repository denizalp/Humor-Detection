I so hate you now, Pink Box Doughnuts!\nI bought a dozen for my work and as I was standing there, I felt a disturbance in the Force.....my eyes fell on a small, circular tower of dough that you so-helpful clerk stated was a \"cronut.\"\nI thought, \"that is a silly name for a doughnut,\" and figured I'd try it.\nSo sorry Kristy Kreme, I now have a new favorite pastry!\nLight and flaky like croissant, but glazed and delicious like a doughnut, and now you are open 24 hours!!!!! \nDamn you Pink Box!  (See you tomorrow night!)
