Atmosphere check, service check, food check. Love the farm to table concept too. The  Brussel sprouts were great, crispy, soft inside, sweet and salty from the bacon. Perfect! The entrees took some time to arrive, but the generous appetizer portion held us over and we enjoyed  our adult beverages, the wine pour was generous and reasonably priced. The entrees were good, but the dessert was another food feast.  Rhubarb strawberry bread pudding , yummy!! I don't usually get dessert but was so glad we did.   We're looking forward to trying a weeknight dinner of small plates at the bar.
