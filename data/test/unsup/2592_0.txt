I was very impressed with their service, and the price was not as bad as I thought it was going to be for the repairs.  My convertable top was not functioning properly.  They fixed it fast, and at a low cost.  Usually I just come to expect to have a bad experience when dealing with car repairs, but not here.  A nice pleasant surprise.  Nice work Mercedes!  I love my Kompressor!
