In a nutshell, you're getting a new United terminal with free wifi (yay!) and handfuls and handfuls of slot machines, but at the cost of slim pickings for places to eat (nay!). \n\nIn an extremely hungry state, I walked up and down the terminal today to avoid eating lunch at Burke in a Box (way too greasy) and decided a Chicago style hot dog at Jody Maroni's would do.  $11.26 bought me that hot dog plus a Mrs. Fields' cookie and Gatorade.  Overpriced, but should I be surprised?
