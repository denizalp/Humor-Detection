Awesome sandwiches.  When I am in the area on business.  I always make a point to either stop in for a sandwich or have it to go.  My favorite is the veal sandwich and everyone should be warn, the sandwiches are huge and filling.  I can never finish an entire sandwich at lunch, but 1\/2 size portions are not available.  The restaurants also have a nice selection of specialty coffee, and soup.  This is a great lunch spot.
