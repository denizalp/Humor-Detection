I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Waiting room was nicely decorated and modern. Staff was friendly and helpful. Was seen by Dr. Zhang. My blood pressure was really high by just being there, nervous and all. Dr. Zhang's personality and demeanor had a somewhat calming effect. Left feeling happy that I had chosen this place!
