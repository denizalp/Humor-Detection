WAXING QUEEN HANDS DOWN ... If your looking for a new esthetician to do your waxing look no further. D'lisa is AMAZING !! Not only does she wax women but she offers services to MEN TOO ! Not very many offer such luxury for men. I have super sensitive, thick corse hair and home shaving was a never ending battle with ingrown hairs... Battle OVER  ... It hurt at first but I have no bumps no irritation  and my skin looks amazing. ( PS I got a manzilian in case you were wondering) \n\nTHANKS D'LISA\nxxoo Janmichael
