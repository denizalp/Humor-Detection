What is this thing called poutine?  Apparently invented in Quebec, it consists of cripsy french fries, cheese curds, and some brown gravy, with your choice of additional coronary-inducing toppings.  In other words, late-night hangover prevention food (see Carl's Steaks in NYC).  I know I would have loved this more if I had been wasted.  An interesting experience, but I prefer my native chili cheese fries, or better yet, a Frito pie.
