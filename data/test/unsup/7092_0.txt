Fantastic customer service! Called Rob out to install a pressure regulator valve as part of the home inspection for selling the house. He gave me an accurate, up front estimate and showed up right on time. Turns out, my set up was extremely unique and Rob was honest about what the new cost would be. I ended up passing on the repair, but Rob's visit was free and he even fixed part of my water heater while he was out there. Great guy and would recommend him based on his integrity and customer service.
