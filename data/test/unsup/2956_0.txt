I had never had Syrian food before and this place opened up my eyes. We got the Christmas tasting menu. Excellent food. The best lamb and dessert I've ever had. The waiters were extraordinary. Of you get Alan and Julian, tip them well. They can pair wine with food spectacularly. This place is something I would definitely recommend to anyone coming to Montreal.
