This is the first time I've been here, and I loved it! I had a steak taco, and it was so juicy and flavorful. I'm not the biggest fan of corn tortillas, but these corn tortillas were amazing! They were moist, unlike many corn tortillas I've had that are dry. All in all, it was so delicious and will definitely come again!
