The bar is fine, the staff friendly and the beer was acceptable.  The riff raff band was good.  What was not acceptable is the despicable patrons, 2 couples who showed up in Black Face.  Seemingly everyone in the bar thought it was funny.  The bar reserves the right to refuse service to anyone but apparently the management agrees that racism is acceptable. I guess this is what I should have expected in a neighborhood filled with the Grand Wizard Trump signs adorning so many lawns.
