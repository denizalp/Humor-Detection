Absolutely incredible. Went with another couple and had a great time. At first, cooking your own food seemed unpleasant. After getting used to the grill and how the food cooks it was fun. The meat that is brought to your table is fresh and taste amazing. For all you can eat this place is absolutely ridiculous. Can't remember our servers name but she was awesome as well. Going back soon and with a bigger party.
