I assume this will level off after the hype dies down (I'll be back in several months). For now it's the latest \"douche fiesta\" in old town...  I like the style of the place and the food\/drinks seem to be above par - but the nighttime crowd is mostly comprised of obnoxious drunken children visiting from Smashboxxx and El Hefe. In fact, if you're over 30 and\/or not a professional model steer clear.
