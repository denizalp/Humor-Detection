By far one of the best Indian restaurants in Toronto. They have the best butter chicken in the world. Mango chicken is one of my favourites. Butter chicken poutine is one of my guilty pleasures. Awesome decor to host friends and family. Gets packed on certain days so you might want to make a reservation.
