Awful service! I used to come her back in 2010 when it was new, the food and staff were awsome! I recently came back and the staff is all new. One word... RUDE. Our waitress seemed pestered when id ask for a refill or when id place another order. Like, um, sorry to bother you at work lady? The food was good, but theres a ton of other sushi places in the east valley with the same grade of food and better service. Its a shame this place shot to shi*, could have been a real gem.
