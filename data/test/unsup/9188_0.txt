Listen, I could write all kinds of words and try to give you some sort of foodie review of this place,  but I'm not.  Here's all that I'm going to say:  half roast chicken, beans and tostones.  That's all you need to know.  \n\nLocated in the shopping center on East Blvd. behind Outback Steakhouse and the recently remodeled Brixx Pizza.  Eat this chicken or you are doing your stomach a disservice.
