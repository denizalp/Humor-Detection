This was my first time there and was happy with the overall meal.\n\nThe waitress was very helpful and attentive.\n\nI started with Ceviche De Pescado Inka it was tasty and not too spicy\nThe Cusquena beer nothing special, a weaker ale\nFor the entree I ordered the Tacu Tacu con Lomo Saltado, the meat and vegetables were seasoned well.  The pancake underneath was excellent, think of it like the outside of a tamale.\nI also tried the drink the Pisco Sour it was great and would be even better on a hot day
