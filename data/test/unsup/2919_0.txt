(Review overdue)\n\nOnly 4 stars bc we were thinking maybe, just maybe we might see one of the guys from the show.  We got the next best thing though- lol (see pic).\nIts hard to pick a fav but if I had to , would say The Ol' Man! ;D\nWanted to get The ol' Man bobble head but it really didn't do him justice.  He's much more handsome on TV.  \nHad no trouble parking or once we were inside.  What little staff we saw were way cool to us.  No pressure, answered all our questions.  \nWould definitely go back.\n\n(11\/2011)
