I love this casino and visit it every time I am in Las Vegas for two reasons:\n\nOne - my favorite video slot machine - \"Kaboom\".\n\nTwo - Tony Roma's prime rib special ($9.99).\n\nI do enjoy the overall Fremont Street experience and love to stay at the Golden Nugget across the street. If you like the FSE too, try the Fremont Casino -- if you hit while playing \"Kaboom!\" you owe me!
