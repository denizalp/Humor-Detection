This place was so beautiful. My co-worker just got married here last weekend. The services was outside under a gazebo. Beautiful flowers all around us. The trees all had lights in the branches, it was just amazing. Especially when the sky started getting darker. The reception was held inside and the decor was absolutely amazing. Beautiful decor, table setting was gorgeous!
