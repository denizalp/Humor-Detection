If you're looking for a classic diner experience, then this is it. The atmosphere is bustling and fun, and the restaurant is jam packed with patrons of all ages. The menu is pretty huge, but once you order, the food is out in a flash.\n\nThe patio is very dog friendly, and they bring out water bowls for the pooch as soon as you sit down, which is much appreciated.\n\nFYI -- Cash\/check only, but there's an ATM inside.
