I used to be in love with this place, but I think it's definitely changed.\n\nYou can definitely tell when you walk inside that the ambiance just isn't as lively as it once was before. The placed definitely has quite the high price for what it is and I feel like they put TOO much in a cup where I feel like I will just make a huge mess. \n\nTheir flavors aren't that amazing and the only one I would really get that's not too sweet is vanilla.
