I did the mail-order thing............What I got was 1\/2\" slices of wet meat....it has sauce on it...I like dry jerky...this is more like slices of steak that were left on the counter...it has pockets of white fat that are squishy and gross..You shouldn't have to wash your hands after eating jerky...and @ $22\/lb is twice what I'd expect to pay.\n\nCheck out the Jerky outlet in fort myers, fl...........it is way better
