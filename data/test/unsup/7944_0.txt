Just fantastic. \nSmall menu, but I have faith that everything is as simple, fresh and stellar as our choices today. \nWe had the Mediterranean Vegetarian Sandwich (maybe too much balsamic dressing, but other than that, really great and interesting) and the Ham\/Cheese\/Jalapeno sandwich.\n\nAlso!  The caramel and hazelnut macaroons.  \"I don't like sweets, but this is the best pastry I've ever had.\"\nI will unquestionably be going back.
