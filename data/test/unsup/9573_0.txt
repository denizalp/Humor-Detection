Yet another Filipino restaurant that will prolly go out of business as it lacks consistency.  One day, everything is delicious and many options to choose from and some days very unfamiliar dishes with the worst portion control.  Why not have chicken or pork adobo everyday?  I had chicken Tinola as one of my choices and it contained mostly chicken parts (skin, bone and cartilage) and mind you the lady took her time filling the serving container and appeared to be selective.  Why can't you just take a big scoop and place it a bowl.
