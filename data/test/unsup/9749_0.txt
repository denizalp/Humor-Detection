It's time to update my review.  We decided to give this location another try and believe it or not, the girl behind the counter was even grumpier than the first time.  I really can't give four stars to an establishment with such horrible customer service.  In addition, my son ordered a bbq chicken and jalapeno pizza, which he said was horrible.  He only ate two slices and was done.  My daughter ordered broccoli and cheddar soup that was delivered with cold spots throughout the bowl.  Not cool.  Why the three stars? Because the sandwiches are pretty darn good!
