The service was great!  We called ahead to get our name on the list because it is a very desirable restaurant.  It opened 2 years ago.  Most of the items on menu are shareable because you order a la carte.  The sea bass was succulent and the expresso seasoned sirloin was delicious.  We ordered the beet salad, it came with pistachio covered goat cheese and mandarin oranges.  We also ate the chicken skin and honey as an appetizer.\nMy daughter had the short rib grill cheese with tater tots.  It was very flavorful with a generous portion.
