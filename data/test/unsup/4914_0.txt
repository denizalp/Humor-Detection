My third trip here and it's a 5 every time!  On my two previous visits, I intended to eat one bagel but had to eat a second one (they are that good). On my third visit, I ordered a turkey sandwich, hoping it wasn't a mistake. Well ... it was awesome! Absolutely perfect. Even the pickle was super fresh. \n\nThe customer service is outstanding. They are very friendly. On top of that, this joint is crazy clean. I live in Huntersville, but it's still worth the 15-minute trek for bagels. Highly recommended.
