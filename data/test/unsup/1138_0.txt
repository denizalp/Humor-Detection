In 2004 Bobs took $1,500 from me as a college student. I entered a contract with them for a Honda 900rr for $5,000 that I would pay in monthly while they store the bike. Two months in they sold the bike and refused to give me my money back and only in store credit for their sparse and crappy inventory. Being young and in college I didn't use the courts like I should have but I can save others a headache by utilizing Yelp.
