I think it's cool they make the bagels fresh. But  they really didn't taste very different than Einsteins bagels to me. I was also suprised they don't have a commercial bagel slicer. I bought a half dozen and wanted them sliced but there was a line behind me and they had one little bagel slicer. I didn't want to hold up the line. Also they seemed a little disorganized in their service. Not rude, just sort of frazzled by the crowd.
