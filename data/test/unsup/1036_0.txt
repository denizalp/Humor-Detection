Not surprised to see this location closed. The service was absolutely horrible. The French fries we ordered were cold and tasted of rancid oil. When we brought this to managers attention he then asked us if we would like hotter fries. I responded \"not if you cook them in the same oil.\"Then would not give me a refund for the fries we turned away. I wouldn't eat in any of their other locations.
