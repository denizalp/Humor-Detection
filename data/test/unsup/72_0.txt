Food was disgusting. I asked for a salad I got lettuce and a rotten tomato. I got a chicken gyro and what I actually got was runny sauce, a soggy pita, a ton of onions and some pieces of dry chicken. My server had the biggest attitude problem. When I would say thank you or please she would just ignore me and walk away. She never came back to the table to see if we needed anything or to ask if we were okay. Just a horrible first experience I won't be back.
