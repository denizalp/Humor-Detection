I've been to this bar every one of my trips to Vegas. Why? Simple :-\n\n1) Proper pour of Guinness.\n2) Decent fish n chips\n3) The banter\n\nIt makes a change from the up market super lounge or nightclubs in the big swanky hotels but for serious drinking and watching the world go by on their patio, it cant be beat.\n\nThe staff are awesome too.
