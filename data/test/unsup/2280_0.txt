What a great place - Zikwid is more than just a brick and mortar e-cig vendor, it's a great little hangout staffed by cool knowledgeable folks that are just as passionate about vaping as their clientele. They're also open 7 days a week, which is a boon for those of us who just can't seem to make it out there on weekdays.\n\nAll they need to get that fifth star is a pinball machine!
