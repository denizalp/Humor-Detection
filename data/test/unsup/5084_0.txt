Ah-mazing food.  Not even kidding we ordered half of the menu because everything coming out of the kitchen looked so good we had to try it.\n\nCrazy friendly staff and service and Dakota kept us informed of all of the different things to mix and pair so that we had the best experience. \n\nHighly recommend sitting at the Kitchen bar.  You see them make everything and can talk to the staff.
