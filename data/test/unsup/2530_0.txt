This place is awesome. If you spent $20 you know you're gonna be trashed. Cheap beers, personable bartenders, and awesome people watching. Skeezy as hell after 1 am!\n\nEdit: what the heck they messed this place up! Full security lock down, dress code, one bar open. Seriously, 5 rent-a-cops with guns working security. If this keeps up I won't be back.\n\nEdit edit: security has lightened up, the girls are back. I'm happy.
