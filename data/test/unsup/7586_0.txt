This place is STILL my all time favorite place to go for EXCELLENT sushi with a GREAT atmosphere.  The sushi chefs of San Francisco, Miami and Northern Virginia need to come here and learn a thing or two about quality and price.  ARIGATO!!!\n\nI just had lunch here the other day (9-9-09) and the quality is still the best I've ever had anywhere.
