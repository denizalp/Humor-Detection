Best all american breakfast in AZ hands down. My friends who visit me from LA all ask to come back to Butterfields every time they come. \n\nMust try : egg white omelette is the fluffiest ever, skillets are to die for, best corned beef Benedict in town.. Jk.. In the world ! \n\nDon't ever change butterfields
