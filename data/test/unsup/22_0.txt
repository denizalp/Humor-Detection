This place is great. Came into town for one day for work and had their coffee and breakfast food. Coffee is amazing, nutty and lightly tart. Perfect way to start the morning. Menu was simple, delicious and easy to choose from. Vibe in there is quiet, cool, light jazz music playing. Perfect place to work, study or catch up with a friend in a quiet atmosphere. Awesome!
