A one-stop thrift shop that's perfect when you need to buy a last minute Halloween costume.\n\nThis brand-spankin' new Goodwill recently opened up. It's clean, spacious, and the clothing section is well-organized. Plus, the prices for designer clothes can't be beat; though, some items I selected do have visible wear and tear.\n\nHalloween decorations were surprisingly pricey, and the home decor and knick-knacks were in disarray. \n\nReturns are accepted, but only for store credit.
