Another item checked off my list. I made a special trip here, as I was scheduled to be in Columbus. While I'm glad I got to see the exhibits here, they didn't WOW me as I had expected, or as I experienced at the far superior Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville.\n\nAmong the highlight, and one i would recommend spending more time at, is the film offered on the 3rd floor..... I could have spent an hour just at that exhibit.\n\nAll in all, a positive experience.
