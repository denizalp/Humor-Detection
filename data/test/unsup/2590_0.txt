Today was my first time ever eating fish and chips.\n\nFish was freshly fried and tasted yummy. I'm not really into fried stuff so I took off some of the batter. Mmmm fish and tartar sauce is so yummy! I got to try a bit of the cod off of a friend and it was good too. The meat was very soft and moist. My order of halibut and chips was a bit pricey for the amount of fish I got.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my fish and chips experience!
