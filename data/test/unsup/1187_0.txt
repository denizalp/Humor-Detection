Thanks to US Airways, my very first (and already short) trip to Pittsburgh was cut down to little more than 24 hours. What to do?\n\nThe Duquesne Incline! Like Stefanie, I'm a bit skerred of heights so the shaky rides up and down the incline were mildly terrifying. But a great choice for a visitor like myself! From the top, I got to see a great view of the city skyline, the stadium, the ball park, the rivers and their renowned bridges. It was the perfect choice since I was short on time!
