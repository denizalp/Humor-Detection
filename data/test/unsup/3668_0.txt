We came at lunchtime and they were making only lunch specials and I was a little skeptical.   We ordered all of them and they were absolutely delicious!  Staff had a bit of an attitude.   They could of been more accepting that regular menu items not BEING available is at first confusing.   But, \"tude\" aside, so good!!
