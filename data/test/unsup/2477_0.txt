Second visit and will leave a review for the experiences\n\nFirst visit I got the Spicy Beef Stew Noodles,  delicious. Plenty of meat and the soup stayed hot through out my meal. I would recommend it, definitely not too spicy so you can add chilli sauce. \n\nToday I got the pork chop lunch box. It was average,  I had better else where. The pork portions was average as well and little rice. I would suggest getting an appetizer to go along w the lunchbox.\n\nThe environment and seating is good. Many TV screens as well as a small bar.
