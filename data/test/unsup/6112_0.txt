Really decent specials during football. I had a nice cheeseburger and beer for $8. Service is always a little suspect here, and has been on a few occasions. Food is good though. Sadly the game was a blowout, Atlanta whipping up on Tampa Bay.\n\nI'll be back because I do like certain items on the menu. Its an ok bar, just wish the bartenders were a little more friendly and a little quicker.
