Poor PA system and announcer, need more scoreboards, outrageous pricing for food and drinks, looks nothing like Wrigley, lousy seating section identification.\nOtherwise nice.\n\nNo parking lot identification markers, easy to lose one's vehicle.\nStay out of right field sun seats--scorchers.\n\nDie Hard Cub Fan since 1946.
