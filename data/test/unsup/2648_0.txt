Four years ago, this place had decent food at value prices with a fun, adorable atmosphere.  \n\nToday it has bad food at excessive prices with a fun, adorable atmosphere. \n\nI'm probably never coming back, but if you have kids, you'll probably want to take them here.  Or McDonalds.  Or leave them at Grandma's for a few days, there is no reason to bring your kids to Vegas.
