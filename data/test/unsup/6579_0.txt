Decent northern Indian food with friendly, genuine services.  The fish was surprisingly tasty.  We went for dinner and not for the buffet (something I wouldn't mind trying on my next trip to Canada).  I would suggest the saag paneer.  As for the butter chicken, it's passable but I can't say it's the best I've ever had.
