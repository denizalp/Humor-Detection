One of my favorites in Las Vegas. GEN has beautiful decoration. The food is great and the staffs are friendly. Today, my server was Kailin who showed her wonderful personality to us, and we had a great night with her passion and patience. I am definitely glad that I did as this was one of the best meal I've had in quite a while, and I definitely will come back, as well as hope I can still meet Kailin again.
