Well, I think the food is just Okay...price is slightly more expensive compare w\/ restaurant outside of Bellagio.  We did waited for a long time for our food to come that day...\n\nI ask for the sauce on the side for the chicken wings but seems like they have hard time doing that, so I didn't argue and just let them put the sauce on it...
