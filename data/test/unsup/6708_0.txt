There is only one reason why I would not give this place \"5\" stars.  It's only because they should reconsider naming the place \"Grandma's B!t@hin'\nThe food is really good but the owner likes to come around and complain about past customers while you eat.  It's kind of off putting.  Otherwise, everyone is really nice.  The atmosphere is more than pleasant and you can't beat the breakfast.
