Great place to have a nice meal, in a great atmosphere with the significant other, or a group of friends. Visited on New Years Eve and had a great experience. Party of 8 on New Years Eve is no small job, but they got us sat in 30 minutes and the service was consistent with the busy vibe. Everyone enjoyed their selections and even when my food came out late, they were quick to comp the entire meal. Now thats what I call customer service.  Been here  a few times and will be back.
