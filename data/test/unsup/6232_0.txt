Hourglass is THE BEST. Hands down, the friendliest drycleaner I have ever been to. Family owned, operated, and staffed everyday, its such an enjoyment to take my dirty laundry too. The location in the breezeway across from AJ's at 44th Street and Camelback Road is hidden from site, but once you find it, you will remember it forever.I wouldnt think of taking my clothes anywhere else.
