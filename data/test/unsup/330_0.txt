Have you ever taken the Amtrak? Wowee. Via Rail might not be a high speed European babe, but by North American standards, she's pretty terrific. \n\nI'm a huge fan of business class, it's a very luxurious way to get places. Unfortunately, if you don't book far in advance, the prices tend to sky rocket, but the main cabin is A OK, too. The staff is always lovely, and leaving TO from Union Station is pretty special.\n\nIt's almost the holidays, friends! Happy travels.
