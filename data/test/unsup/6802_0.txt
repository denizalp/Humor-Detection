Pho-tastic. Pho-nomenol. Pho sure going back. \n\nMade for puns, I mean, I couldn't resist. Also can't resist the pho. It is damn good. A modern spin on the classic bowl of noodle goodness served up with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, chilis and beef.\n\nDesign interior is ultra modern without trying hard. Staff are great and service is just the right amount of attentive.
