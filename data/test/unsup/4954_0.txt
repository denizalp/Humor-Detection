Had lunch with the family this afternoon. Great Food selections, fresh sushi (Tuna, Salmon, Mackerel, Scallop..etc..) Fried Tempura, Fried and steamed rice, good line up of desserts. AYCE (buffet) so you'll leave the place full.\n\nServers are friendly and attentive. They always check it you need drink refills. 5 star for service.\n\nDefinitely a place to visit.
