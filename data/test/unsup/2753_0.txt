My husband really likes Pei Wei's, but the floor in here is very red which makes me uncomfortable.  Are they trying to make me feel mad?  Other than that very good food.  I got the sweet and sour.  The futuristic soda machines are confusing though and added with the blood red floor I got very heated.  Fix the color scheme please I will be back frequently.
