Nothing amazing really. Mashed tasted like they were made from a box. Au gratin was very cold. Bisque tasted to much like sherry. A lot of the meats were really good though! Beef ribs awesome! Key lime pie was disappointing. 4 star review because I left my card and they called me 3 minutes later! Great guest service!\n\n2 guests 2 dinners 2 glasses of Chardonnay 1 dessert.$170 yikes...
