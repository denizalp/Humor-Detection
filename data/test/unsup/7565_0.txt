Been wanting to try this out for some time. Maybe I expected too much. It was good but not great. Not as good as some of the other area burger joints in Tempe. \n\nWorst part was the owner kept staring at us. I couldn't tell if he thought we were a threat (business people in business suits) or if he was looking at me with bedroom eyes. Either way it was super creepy. I also got the feeling that the employees weren't too fond of him either.
