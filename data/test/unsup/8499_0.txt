This buffet is located at South Point which is a bit further from the strip but we were here for the rodeo competition and were hungry so to the buffet we headed.\n\nFor $15 we went in for lunch...which included mimosas. \n\nThey had normal buffet food...but it wasn't great quality. I still ate 3 plates:\nPlate 1: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=fsbBhNLTpOun8rUazxefNA\n\nPlate 2: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=3sTWwO4oZ9xzTrzigk9ADg\n\nPlate 3: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=AlXdm4Rww07ObBjUKh3odQ\n\nI ate because I was hungry...but when your in Vegas, the city of buffets, there are better buffets to venture!
