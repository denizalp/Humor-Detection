Just happened to be in town for the MLK holiday and was happy to learn there was free admission that day! It was pretty crowded due to that fact, but still quite enjoyable. The venue is huge and seems to go on forever, there's so many floors! All of which are jam packed with interesting exhibits and there was also live performances and special screenings to honor Dr. King. The gift shop prices were actually very reasonable, so be sure to grab some souvenirs before you head out!
