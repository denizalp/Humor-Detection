Our family goes to this dental office.  We've been coming here for 2 yrs now.  It's conveniently located near our neighborhood, so it's easy to come in for an appointment.  Everyone here is friendly.  The dental hygienist does a good job cleaning my teeth, which I do every 3 months.  I haven't had to do any major work here (thank God), so I can't comment on cavities, crowns, or anything else.  So far we're all satisfied with our experience here.\n\nReturn Factor - 70%
