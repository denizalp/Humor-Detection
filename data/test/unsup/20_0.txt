I *love* the Vapiano in Union Square, NYC.   It rocks.  The CLT Vapiano venue lacks the open air sidewalk feeling that makes the Union Square property so special.  The food is still quite good.  The European, self-service, cafeteria style is different and fun.  The staff could use a Red Bull or two to step up the energy level, but, maybe Sunday nights are just slow.
