Edit: They fixed alot of what I complained of below. Good changes, give them a shot!\n\n\nOriginal review:\nI stopped in for the beef poke bowl and wasn't impressed by a couple of things. Unsticky Basmati rice in East Asian is ok, but I would use sticky rice, even sushi rice would be better. The mass of iceberg lettuce should be dressed with a simple sauce. Mixed greens would be better. The beef was awesome, but there needs to be a larger portion for $10.
