this place is a state treasure, and i'm being serious.  the only yoshinoya in arizona.  i realize some of you cannot warm up to this place.  but if you're from cali and you've grown up on this stuff, or if you've spent some time in japan and have become familiar with the yoshinoya concept, then you'll come to love this place.  and realize just how valuable this location is.\n\nthe beef bowl is pretty similar to the way they do it in japan.  also love their chicken bowl.  love the saucy veggies on the side.  yum!!
