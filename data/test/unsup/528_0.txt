You'd think that a fish restaurant would know how not to cook fish until it turns to a charred lump of shit, but, hey, what do you expect from a Landry's restaurant? If it was on food alone, I'd give it one star. Total disappointment.\n\nHOWEVER: The host, the manager, and the waitress were all FANTASTIC. Attentive and friendly, they all made sure that my party and I were being treated well. So, if you want good service and overpriced, badly-cooked fish, go here.
