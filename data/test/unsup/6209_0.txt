Went for breakfast with family members from out of town. The food was generally ok, they forgot my toast and didn't bring it until after we were finished. \n\nThe customer service was poor,  we overhead the chef swearing and at one point he was arguing with customers who were waiting for their food. I wouldn't eat there again. \n\nNot sure what the other reviews are about but I would take them with a grain of salt.
