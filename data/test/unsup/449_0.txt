This is a popular go to for \"higher end\" Italian food in the area. Plot twist: given the cost - the food is really not that amazing. Especially compared to the other Terroni just down the street on Richmond. \n\nWe got a variety of pasta and pizza and if it was cheaper I would give it a 4 star but for $20... I definitely expected more. \n\nOne thing that's worth getting here though is the dessert, the Tiramisu is very rich and very generous portion too!
