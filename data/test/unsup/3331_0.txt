Birthday dinner for our best friend now has to be rescheduled.\nWe did not like the waitress from the beginning, she was too good for us!\nThought the dirty rice balls were just okay. The fried chicken was overcooked on the outside, good on the inside. Definitely not what was expected. Red Velvet cake was good, not great!\nVery disappointing evening! Won't try again.
