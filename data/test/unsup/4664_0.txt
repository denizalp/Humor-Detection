This place scores major points on a couple of fronts. \n\n1- They offer the best authentic Syrian baklava in the city\n\n2- Each baklava is made to perfection with the finest ingredients \n\n3- The staff is genuine and friendly\n\nEveryone here from the store owners, to the staff and clientele is Syrian, which only makes it that much more legit. \n\nI first found out about this place from my Egyptian landlord, who claimed it was the best in town. I of course had to try it out. And wow, was he right!
