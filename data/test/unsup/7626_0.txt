Dear Madison,\n\nYes, you are eating sushi in Wisconsin. Lower your expectations, or catch your own tuna. For sushi of the midwest, this place is awesome.\n\nThe atmosphere is cool - thank you darkness! Great spot for a date. Sitting at the bar is lovely, sitting at the tables are lovely (although if you get weirded out by the traditional Madison table layout where all of the tables are *veryclosetogether* you might not love that)...and there is outdoor seating!\n\nYou will probably have to wait if you walk in on a Friday or Saturday, but you can leave your number.
