Fell in love with my waitress..... and that was the highlight of my evening (and I still wonder about her..... divorced at 26... sigh). The place is very well decorated, but the 40+ crowd gave the place a more museum feel than lounge.\n\nI'll definately go back there again...... with my boss or with clientele that don't know any better, but not with my closer club friends.... unless it's to use the bathroom..... or to say hi to that gem of a waitress.
