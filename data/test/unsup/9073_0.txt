We stopped in to grab a croissant after seeing the baked goods displayed in the window. Only 2 other customers in the shop. The lady was very polite, chit chatted with us, and we were on our way after my husband had a donut and I ate half of the croissant. Delicious croissants, even after taking half to-go and eating it hours later.
