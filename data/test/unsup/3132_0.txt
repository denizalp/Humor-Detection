Interesting place. Seems to be family owned and operated. Tip: don't go near closing, which is 8:00pm. They start cleaning and rush you out lol\nFood was tasty and interesting. I had the triple seafood with veggies. It was veggies, shrimp, scallops, and 'imitation crab' (haha)   Strange but oddly good. I could have done without the 'crab'.  I may come back to try the shrimp with lobster sauce. My boyfriend got it with fried rice. The sauce was a white sauce instead of a typical brown sauce. Looked good. Portions were definitely large and a great value.
