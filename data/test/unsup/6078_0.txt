I have been going to this place for quite a few years now.  Anita is very knowledgeable about the tax laws.  Her staff assists in inputting all the pertinent information into the computer and Anita reviews all the documents you present to her. This place gets really busy during tax season, so I would recommend coming early so you don't have to wait too long.
