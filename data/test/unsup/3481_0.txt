Red Rock is really huge and always packed with people! they basically have everything in this casino: bowling, theatres, bingo, pool, restaurants, great food court, etc. I love going here to play bingo with my parents, it's a fun time. \n\nit's most likely the top hotel of all the station casinos. and it's a great place for all ages to just wind back and relax!
