Vey bad.. came here with my friend. .very disappointed. Waited almost an hour for lechon and it came out cold and nasty. Halo halo was tasteless if it wasn't for the ice cream it would taste like water. Even the lumpia took almost an hour.atleast now we know where not to go. We came all the way from nlv because when I check the reviews it was all good but all lies. What a waste of time and gas. This doesn't even deserve 1 star.
