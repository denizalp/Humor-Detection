Excellent Thai food find - and worth the drive! Joy cooks traditional Thai dishes with lots of flavor and no unnecessary additives - everything we tried was fresh and healthy without sacrificing the wonderful flavors. We had a large group so we decided to try take out, and I called a few hours in advance so she was able to prepare. Make sure you try the Green Curry and basil eggplant!\nWe really enjoyed the meal and will be back. Would recommend it to anyone who loves Thai food.
