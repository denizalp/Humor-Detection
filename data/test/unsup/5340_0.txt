Such an exciting new addition to the Yonge and Sheppard area. We were wooed in by their $1 oyster special. Oysters seemed very fresh and came with a number of condiments. The  white wine vinegar and oyster was a superb combination. Note to self: vinegar goes much better with oyster than lemon juice! \n\nI had the Shrimp Udon Salad, wasn't particularly amazing but I really liked the wasabi dressing. I also tried the self-proclaimed \"Toronto's BEST\" short rib, and in my opinion, it barely fell short of claiming the honors.
