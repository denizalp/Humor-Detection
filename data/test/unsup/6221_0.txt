Sweet Republic is a dandy little ice cream joint - sort of in between a B&R (lots of flavors) and a Cold Stone (I don't think they do mix-ins at Sweet Republic?)\n\nAnyway - 2 good reasons to go right now.\n1) The waffle cones - lighter, more crisp and delicate than most, with cinnamon, I think?\n2) Mayan Chocolate ice cream - chocolate, cinnamon, and chile flavored ice cream - yes, please!  It's hot and cold and spicy and sweet at the same time - wow!
