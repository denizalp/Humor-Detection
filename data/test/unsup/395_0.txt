Rather mediocre cuisine. We found the menu to be kind of carbie and fatty.  I had an asian tuna wrap that was dripping with mayo, lacked asian flavors and the tuna was overcooked. Overall, meh. If you are looking for a piece of chocolate cake or a chocolate martini you are probably in the right place. Service is very good. No recommendation.
