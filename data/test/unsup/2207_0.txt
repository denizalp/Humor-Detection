Very tasty Mexican food for very cheap prices. And it is an open kitchen so you can watch it being made if you like. Cool! I had a carne asada burrito, which was large, tasty, and filling. And a bit under $8. That is pretty hard to beat. I got there extra early because by noon the place fills up and the wait time becomes very long.
