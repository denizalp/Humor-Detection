My wife and I had lunch here today. The food was outstanding. We started with avocado toast which was amazing. Then I had chicken pot pie which was the best I've ever had (sorry, dear). The pastry top was so flaky and the filling was delicious. My wife had the Vegetable Pastry which also had the wonderful flaky crust. The service was great. We will be back for sure! Written by Tom
