Really enjoyed this restaurant. It has an awkward open layout, but I'm slowly discovering that most restaurants on state street do. I guess it's just dat college vibe! Food was good, satisfying and at a decent price. Went for dinner and what I really wanna do is go back for the lunch buffet to try EVERYTHING!!
