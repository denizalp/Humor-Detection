AWESOME DESSERT PLACE\n\nI would highly recommend you getting the honey toast or any shaved ice dessert.\nThe honey toast consist of buteered up bread with ice cream in the middle with two piroulines. so frekaing good.. Or you may want to indulge yourself with there shave ice and fruit on a hot vegas summer day! I love thispalce i usually come here for dessert. I have there menu it was decent but i would just stick with dessert for this place.
