Decent airport lounge.  Full bar was nice.  The complimentary food, not so nice.  \n\nThere was chicken breast in some sort of liquid..water?  Tasteless.   \nI did enjoy the carrots and other veggies.  \n\nI just expected a bit more from the snacks here.  However the lounge is lit well, not too bright, and quiet..good for relaxing before your flight or getting some last minute work done.
