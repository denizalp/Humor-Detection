This store has a great selection of food including a really nice salad bar, plenty of organic produce, chips of all sorts, and a great selection of wines at a good price. \n\nThe people are always very friendly and helpful. \n\nCase in point - Today I was making a purchase and asked the cashier if I could drop off some cardboard boxes to be recycled. She not only told me that was AOK, she followed me to my car to help me bring in the boxes. That's what I call above and beyond service.
