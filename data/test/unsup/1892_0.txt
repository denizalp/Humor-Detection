We have lived here for 2 months and couldn't be happier!!  All of the staff at Camden ( in fact all the Camden properties) are truly wonderful!!  Everyone here is helpful, kind, compassionate and awesome!!  Albert was so helpful and kind in helping us get our new home!!  This is the best place we have lived!  It's also extremely close to shopping, restaurants...everything you need!!  This is a great place to live!!
