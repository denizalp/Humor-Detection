Their suites are nice and roomy. Fully equipped kitchen. Very nice walk in closets in both bedrooms. \nConveniently located across from Sam's club and Walmart.\nOnly issue for me was the windows were slightly cracked open which let in the cold air......wouldn't have been an issue if they were the kind of windows you can slide open and close. He screen window was popped out of place. Some of the appliances, such as the hair dryer was cracked. Drawers in the bathroom kept coming off the hinges.
