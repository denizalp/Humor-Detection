Walked in everyone said hello, okay good start. Checked out the 5.0 cube freezer. After seeing that is was a little pricey. Guy asked me if I found what I was looking for. I said yes but a little more than I wanted to spent. Almost $40 more. I said may just pick it up at Sams club for the cheaper price. He said put your money where your mouth is. I was taken aback. I wasn't digging their store,product, nor price. I will never buy anything at spencers ever.
