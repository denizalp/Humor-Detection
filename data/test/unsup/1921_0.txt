A friend took me here for my birthday.  We both had the five course tasting menu. It was delicious - one of the best tasting menus I have had.  The quality of the food, presentation and flavours were impressive. The service was top notch. The wine list I about of this world. Overall very impressed.  The entire tasting menu experience does take a while - it must have been about three hours in total.
