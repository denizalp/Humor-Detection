I have been to many Korean bbq restaurants. This place can be a pretty cool place for date nights or if you want to hangout with your friends and sing karaoke. The staffs are super friendly and they make sure to check up on you often to see if everything is okay. I like meat, they have meat. The food is pretty decent\/good, depending on what you get. I don't always drink but when I do, I prefer more on the menu. Stay thirsty my friends.
