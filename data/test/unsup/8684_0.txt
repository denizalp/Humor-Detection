Their pho soup base is different from other restaurant we went, it is rich and tasty! We were told by the friendly owner there's no MSG. Their sate beef viet sub is also very good, the sate sauce is full of peanut flavor, one thing I would hope is they can have meat inside. Overall it's a very nice restaurant and their food is tasty!
