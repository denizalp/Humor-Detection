This was a surprising find.  I have overlooked this place for a long time, what a mistake. I went with a girlfriend during the week, it was still happy hour so we ordered the dips and a ceviche as well as some margaritas.  The margaritas were really nice and the ceviche was spectacular.  Big chunks of crab meat and shrimp, it tasted so fresh.  We also ordered chicken and steak fajitas, it was incredibly large.  Can't wait to come back, I want to have more of that ceviche.
