I love ramen so it's no surprise that I loved this restaurant. While it is quite busy, service is pretty speedy and the taste and quality of food is amazing. They have plenty of different ramen flavours for both pork and chicken as well as a couple vegetarian options. Would recommend for all ramen lovers!
