The food was very good,  opposed to service... probably won't go back. If you are paying about $100 per meal, you would expect a nice and helpful service. I had a much better service in Morton's or even in McCormick's. Sadly,  at the end I made a mistake and mis-down-calculated the tip... anyway Fleming's is off the list forever while many other nice places are out there. The ambiance of the restaurant is good, though.
