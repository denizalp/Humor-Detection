firt time there was during the day and it was pretty empty. which was fine. Bad service. I was ignorred by the female barkeep pretty much the whole time when my drink would run out. i would have to wait a long time for a refill even though the place was dead. Then a group of guys showed up and they changed my tv even though i was drinking first and my food just got there. And those guys brought in mcdonalds.
