I've been a regular at this place for 2 years now. Me and my girlfriend come to this place monthly\/bi-weekly and they always do a great job!\n\nThey NEVER have thinned our brows to a horrifying level, they always shape it perfectly, and yes occasionally, if you have a particular eyebrow lady, she might be a little rough, but no pain no gain‚Äç. Our brows come out looking great each time. Quick and easy 5 minutes, affordable pricing, and a wonderfully talented staff.\n\nHighly recommend this place!
