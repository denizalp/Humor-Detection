For a late night cafe, this place is ridiculously excellent and reasonably priced for the amount of food portions they give you!!! \n\nLocated inside the Venetian, this cafe was surprisingly filled at 3AM!!! I had a party of 8-10 and we were seated promptly from what I remember.  Every time we make trips to Vegas, we certainly make sure to stop in and have a bite to eat. \n\nTasty & affordable, can't get better than that...
