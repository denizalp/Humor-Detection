I showed the lady how I wanted my dog to look like as always and I told her that I can start brushing the dog out if that would help but I didnt want to have a short cut at all and guess what instead of just washing and blow drying the dog they were saying that the coat was heavily matted and there was no way to save the fur they didnt even call me instead I got a shaved dog back and I mean shaved to the skin. Check out my photos.
