Absolute worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Carnitas burrito, the carnitas.. so bland and looked boiled.  The burrito itself was covered in some red sauce that reminded me of canned kids pasta sauce.  The sprinkling of shredded cheddar on top really put me off as well.  \n\nThe salsa for the chips was the same red sauce with some onions and cilantro.  Flavorless, worthless.  This place sucks
