In the quest to pimp my nook (read: bed in friends den), I have hunted department stores, homesense and winners to find bed gear. None of the above had a good selection, so I decided to check out Dreams. \n\nDreams has a really great selection at decent prices and I found what I was looking for. Along with a massive selection of sheets and duvet covers, they also have pillows, some furniture and bath supplies. \n\nNote: This isn't bargain basement prices, I had to ball out 150 bucks for an entire bed collection. Whatever, now I'm a P.I.M.P.
