I came here with a few pals and I decided to split a salmon dish with one of them. The server was very attentive and she made sure to split the whole meal into two plates. I appreciated that! \n\nHowever, the salmon was so salty and hard. The vegetables were also heavily salted. I was getting dehydrated from each bite I consumed and just gave up.
