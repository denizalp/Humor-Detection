I WILL NOT GO HERE AGAIN!!!! I thought I was going out of town for a week but ended up staying a couple days longer.. I told the owner I wasn't sure the exact day that I would make it back and she said she didn't have room to keep my dog??? Which was a lie. She's SO RUDE (Donna) and kept saying I was trying to abandon my dog there. You're a dog boarding place your job is to board the dogs! I don't get it?! Don't waste your money here.
