This place is outrageous. I have never eaten such bad pizza in my life. The pizza is overpriced per slice at $2.75 for a sliver of pizza. The crust is non existent and the dough is too soft and undercooked. This place reminded me of school lunch pizza I used to get, no wait, this place is worse than school lunch pizza. I will never EVER eat pizza here ever again.
