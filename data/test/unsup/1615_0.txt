Just walking past this shop you smell so many different varieties! They always have super cute displays and they have so many packages open for you to try out. Everyone working is always smiling, they also are all very helpful and never pushy! (My favorite) I usually don't get anything unless it's for my sister, but I do have a bath bomb that I cannot wait to try out!! I'll definitely post some pictures of the bath bomb when it's time for some relaxation!
