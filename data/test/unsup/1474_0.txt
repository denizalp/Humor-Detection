Dr. Tsai is a pretty decent doctor and the staff is friendly, but as other reviewers have noticed, his staff screws up too much for me, so I switched and am with a doctor and staff that are spot-on.\n\nI received strange bills in the mail over and above what medicare said I should have been billed, and once received a bill for $1.50. That was more expensive for them to bill me for that amount than it was worth!
