The facilities are nice, but every time I come here, I've had to wait at least an hour before being called to a patient's room. And then it is another half hour before being checked on and back out the waiting room. This doesn't feel so express. The staff is friendly, but when you just don't feel well, and there are only 2 people ahead of you in the waiting room, it really shouldn't take this long.
