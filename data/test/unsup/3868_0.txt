With a name like that, I was expecting something new in terms of vibe and space design. But... Nope. But this isn't Architectural Digest so, you're right, on to the goods.\n\nCoffee was meh. \nPastries seem meh.\nStaff is super nice.\n\nIt's not a place that seems to put pride in the product. Instead, it was all kinda blas√©. Wouldn't make my list of must trys.
