Are you made of money? If the answer is yes, you should probably stop by this place for a drink...although if you are made out of money then you probably would go to places that are more posh....right? So where does this leave us? A place for the yuppies with a bit of cash to burn and wants to be cool.\n\n$32 for two drinks after tax and tips. No food, just two cocktails. Okay the atmosphere is cool but how did it end up burning a hole in my pocket?
