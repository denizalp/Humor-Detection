When we decided to landscape our backyard we received many bids from different people... pool, landscaping and patio.  We decided to go with Proficient Patio for our patio because not only was Jim courteous and timely he gave us an excellent price for what we wanted.  Jim's extensive knowledge of patios helped us with the design and structure.  The work was done almost immediately and we LOVE the look.  I highly recommend Proficient Patio.
