Cheapest gas in town. The Costco membership is definitely worth it. You'll notice the savings right away. \n\nThis location is busier than the Decatur\/215 location but far more shops\/restaurants in the area so in that sense it's more convenient. \n\nDon't let the long lines scare you away, it moves quickly. Have your card & debit\/credit card in hand to keep the line moving.
