The waiting time was unexceptionally long, I was the only person in line and it took them 12 minutes to give me a Cappuccino and Green Tea Frappuccino.\n\nThe Frappuccino had too many squirt of vanilla syrup in it, so it tasted no where near green tea but instead like vanilla.\n\nThe barista was also very clumsy, she spilled juices and ice cubes all over the counter and took more time wiping them off than actually preparing my drinks.\n\nI don't recommend this place, as there are 7 other Starbucks within a radius of 500m.
