There are only a few things I expect from a Bank:\n\n- Keep the lines moving.\n- Keep the process simple.\n- Don't charge me any unnecessary fees.\n- Get it right the first time.\n\nI've been to this particular location a couple of times and they have met my requirements each visit.  The staff is friendly and it's a quick in\/out.  It is located in a pretty good shopping center with Starbucks, Chipotle, Smiths, Golden Swirl, Sammy's Woodfired Pizza, and numerous others that make it a convenient if you're hungry or need to run errands.\n\nWill I return?  No doubt.
