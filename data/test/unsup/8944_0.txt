My entire family goes to see Dusti. She is amazing. She has been cutting my hair for years and I don't trust anyone else to do it the way I like. She give me a great skin fade. Then she gives my boys each their own style. Lastly she takes care of my wife's hair, any style she brings in, Dusti nails it. On top of that, she has a great personality and loves what she does.
