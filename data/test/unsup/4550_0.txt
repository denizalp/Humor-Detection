The food is good here if you want something healthy or happy (not so healthy).  The last time I came in I was trying to have the least amount of carbs and I usually get the naked chix that comes with rice. The guy at the register suggested for me to substitute it for cauliflower rice.  I was hesitant as I don't really like cauliflower but I was SHOOK at how satisfied I was with it.  Now that is the only way I get it!
