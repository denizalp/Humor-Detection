This is a great spot inside of the Forum shops at the Cesar's. I was having a hard time picking what to have for lunch since everything sounded delicious. So I asked our bartender Brody (great service) for a recommendation. She recommended the Baja Ceviche and it was amazing! Would definitely come back for a couple of drinks, tequila shots, and the Baja Ceviche.
