I have had the barbecue here a couple of times before. They have chicken, ribs, links and brisket. All are delicious but I warn you now, the brisket is very popular. Get there early if you are planning on having brisket, they might run out if you don't. The prices are reasonable. Twelve dollars for a plate of chicken with two sides, I got the Mac and Cheese and potato salad with corn bread. Beef Brisket plates are $15. I will definitely be returning here for more soon. All meals are to go. No seating is available.
