Super slow service. Requested a change in our seating and server never flagged down the hostess for us until we did ourselves. No drink refills either. I don't think the waiter was trained enough to take care of the entire patio section by himself. \n\nFood was mediocre as well. Jambalaya was extremely dry and the salad was dumped in dressing. I've definitely had better at other Cheesecake locations. I was swamped after hours of walking and shopping but then this experience just made it worse...
