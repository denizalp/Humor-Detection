What an amazing place! Not only did they squeeze us in during the busy holiday time but they were so very caring to our pup! He was very tangly and he was a lot of work. They are fair priced and they are truly great at what the do! We have been to many places in vegas and this by far has been the most pleasant. Thank you again for the best xmas gift ever!  My kids are ecstatic! #pics added!
