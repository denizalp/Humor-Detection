We used to live at 90th and Shea, a mere stone's throw from Sweet Republic. Then we moved to CenPho, and I have yet to find anything around here that compares. Gelato Spot? Nope. Too much commercial hype. \n\nI have been known to call ahead and  make sure SR has Mango Lassi before making the trek...
