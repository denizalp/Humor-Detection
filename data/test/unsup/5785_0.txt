Ridiculous!!! Always a long line and today was no different so I left and went to the post office on Horizon Ridge HAH!.... Same mess! No wonder why they are billions of dollars in debt. What a disgrace.  Do yourself a favor and go to UPS or another mailing service where there are no lines and the employees don't go on breaks or hide in the back when there is customers in the store needing service.  And like many others I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN ANOTHER POST OFFICE AGAIN!
