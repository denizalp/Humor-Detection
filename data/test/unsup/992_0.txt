This is my favorite Fry's.  They have a section in the center of the store that has tons of home stuff!  Dishes, pots and pans, glassware, plasticware for outside, it never ends!  The store is huge and the service is great.  They have a great seasonal section also and was able to stock up on summer stuff before it's all gone.
