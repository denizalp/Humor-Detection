We decided to have breakfast at the Grand Lux Café before leaving LV.  We were seated promptly and our orders taken just as quick.  I ordered a standard 2 eggs, toast, and sausage.  There was nothing special about the food, but you get linen on your table and a good set of silverware.  As always, this came at a casino restaurant price.\n\nIf you're limited in options and want to stay within the casino, then the Grand Lux Café is a good enough option.  Sometimes, you just want a quick bite to eat that's better than fast food.
