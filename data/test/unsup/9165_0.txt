Didn't catch groomers name, but she had an Eastern European (?) accent--she did a phenomenal job on my pup's nails. He's usually very timid and a little tooth showy, but she put him at ease immediately and got him in and out super quickly. They also carry his wet food which is not the easiest brand to find at a very competitive price. Will definitely be back!
