Came here for the second time ever the other day and the adorable waitress with tattoos and long, pretty hair walked up to me with a sweet smile and confirmed that I wanted a margarita on the rocks.  I was in utter disbelief that she remembered my drink order from the one other time I'd been in, a couple of weeks prior, but I guess somehow she did.  Plus the margarita was delicious, and perfectly mixed.  Very impressive service!
