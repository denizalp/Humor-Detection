Very bad service.They take order in a tablet device and end up serving a wrong order every time (3\/3 so far) Took more than 45 min to serve the food after they took order, giving silly excuse that it was mistakenly placed behind. No one comes to attend the customers in time. Had to ask for water while they go back and forget abt it. I would never visit this place again. Food ofcourse wasnt fresh, I wonder why they take so much time to serve food for reheating .
