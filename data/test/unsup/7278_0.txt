Just what this town needs. Another Gelato joint, right?\n\nThe funny thing is no matter how many new gelato stores pop up, they are almost all still so good.\n\nFlavors I tried: (Pretty much every one in there)\n\n- Wild Berry \n- Chocolate Cake\n- Tropical Fruit\n- Caramel\n- Peanut butter\n- Strawberry\n- Cookies and Cream\n- Car Battery\n- Scuba Mask\n- Monkey Poo\n- Whatever I can't remember the names
