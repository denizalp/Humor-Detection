Very nice restaurant.  Great food (pretty expensive), and jumping.  Pretty loud, too.\n\nNow, after dinner...different story.  \n\nDescend into the bar area (live band, etc.) and you'd better be careful.  Why?  There are more cougars in this joint than you'd find in Yellowstone or Yosemite...combined!  RAWWRR!  I had an absolute blast having fine drinks and just watching the give-and-go between the seasoned hotties and their prey.
