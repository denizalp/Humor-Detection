Who: Marquee Night Club!  \n\nWhere: Cosmopolitan\n\nWhat: Best Club in Town\n\nWhen: Monday Nights the best or weekend i guess.\n\nWhy: Because they have a Boom Box Room that spins Hip Hop and not just ElectrotechnohouseRoboJobo like everywhere else\n\nHow:  Get presale tix.  You have to be in shape to walk in this club.  You must drink before you get in. You must look your best and be on your best behavior.\n\nMarquee got the best club layout I've ever been to. I love the way its decorated and looks.  Bartenders Cool, DJ's Cool, Security Buttholes, Drinks too expensive, Layout is awesome!!!
