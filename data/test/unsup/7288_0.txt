We enjoy going to the Lakes - the food is great, reasonably priced, & we often wish we had anything even vaguely close to this in Mountains Edge.  The only thing iffy there is the service.  Tonight we had one of those waitresses who checked back when we were almost done eating  & brought the check before asking if we would like anything else.  Her lackadaisical service left a bitter taste on an otherwise enjoyable evening.\n\nLakes Lounge, you really need to improve your service.  Restaurants in general, Mountains Edge is dying for some good options!
