i live extremely close to this restaurant and have been meaning to try it out and I'm so glad that i did! the service was great and it had a nice humble feeling to the place, i loved the decorations and just the layout of it was so simple yet calming, my shrimp and pork cutlets were cooked perfectly and i know i will definitely come back again!
