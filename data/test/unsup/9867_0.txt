J Levine Auction is an awesome auction house.  They consistently have a great selection of high-end estate items to bid on at great prices!\n\nThey also have an \"art gallery\" upstairs called Gallery J2.  This place is a disorganized mess.  The art for sale in the gallery is lackluster and amateur at best.  When I was there, the pictures in the gallery were not even hung straight.  This place is a joke.  I think you'd find a more lively environment at the county morgue.
