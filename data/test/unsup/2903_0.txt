Ode to a horrible pool company;\n\nYou don't show up to clean our pool but charge us anyway.\nOh, but you devious devils I get the final say.\nYou take apart our stuff without permissions or notifications.\nSo I guess your \"quality pool service\" should just be in quotations.\nWhat's this, incorrect billing charges?\nNo worries, It's just some corrupt surcharges.\nThese were not just isolated occurrences\nbut rather numerous recurrences\nSo beware my fellow pool enthusiasts\nbecause their \"quality service\" is rather dubious
