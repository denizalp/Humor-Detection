What a wonderful affordible apartment complex. The rent is quite reasonable. And you get a good amount of space for what you're paying. \n\nIf you opted to select one of the upstairs apartments, you won't even miss out on there being no fitness room or center here because the stairs are super steep. You'll be getting your StairMaster experience every day. \n\nYoue bathroom has a jacuzzi jet feature, which is quite fabulous.
