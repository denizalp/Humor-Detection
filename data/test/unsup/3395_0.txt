Dark Horse is a really chill, hipsteresque coffee shop. It's definitely a great place to work at. It has many large tables (each fits about 10 ppl), fast Wifi, great music and delicious coffee. The coffee is amazing! I loved my espresso. It was very busy when I went but not so busy that there were no seats available. The music is a little loud but they play good hits (indie, alternative tunes).
