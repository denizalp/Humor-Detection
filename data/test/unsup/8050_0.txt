I got an email from a friend at work asking where she should get drinks with a possible date this Saturday. Her bar shift ends at 11 Saturday night and wanted something around her place of employment with a good atmosphere. I recommended Moe's. Her email response read:\n\nMOE'S?? Really? It might set a mood. Both times I've been inside there, 2 separate occasions, 2 separate homeless people were masturbating in the bar. And techno music was playing. It was like a zombie movie.
