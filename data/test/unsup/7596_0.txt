Well, totally unexpected but admirable & appreciated! I got a phone call from Vanessa, the Owner of Lash & Sugar tonight. She wanted to hear what happened and what she could do to try and fix things. I have already moved to another lash salon but Vanessa really heard my issues and I felt a change in stars was warranted. Thank you Vanessa, sincerely, good luck with things. Happy New Year!
