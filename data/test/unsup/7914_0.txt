With all of the burger places in Vegas, this would not be one that I would visit a second time. It's set up like a fast food restaurant - order at counter, pick up tray, find a seat (good luck) then wait until your order is called. It wants to be a step up from your typical fast food burger joint, but it just doesn't measure up. The burger patties were very thin, the house chili lime sauce has a strange taste and the tatter tots were disgusting - ice cold! Shake Shack is a much better option.
