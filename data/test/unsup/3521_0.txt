This is my first time here. The food is on point!\nThe pulled pork is fantastic and the brisket isn't far behind. Prices are reasonable espically considering portion size. \n\nIf you are reading this and haven't decided where you are going tonight, go here because it's the best choice you will make.\n\nSide note: I hate sweet potato fries but I don't hate these, they are delicious.
