Decided I needed a caffeinated refreshment to make my drive back to Summerland. \n\nPopped in to Coo Coos and the choices were abundant. \n\nThey offer approximately 12 sugar free flavors in addition to the 15-20 sugary ones. Thumbs up for options! \n\nThe guy was friendly. I was there a grand total of 2 minutes before I got my sugar free brown sugar cinnamon ice blended latte. Served in a big cup with cinnamon sprinkled on top $4.53. \n\nReally cute place!
