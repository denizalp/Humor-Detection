It's a great place to sit and dine in.  The TOM YUM SOUP is really good and healing, since I have a sinus and congestion problem I feel a lot better.  Anita was very helpful and kept are cups full.  The atmosphere feels calm and just makes you want to come back which will happen again really soon.  Don't take my word for it just come out and try out there food you won't be disappointed.
