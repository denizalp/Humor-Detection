Breakfast sucks!\nCorned beef hash-sucks\nOver easy eggs-sucks\nScrambled eggs- wait for it.........sucks\nToast-sucks....how do you screw up toast????\nHad to go to the kitchen for our own coffee refills\nNo drink refillls even offered on other drinks.\n\nDid I mention there were only 2 other occupied tables?\n\nGo somewhere else.....go anywhere else.....slowly figuring out why the Rainbow always has a wait time
