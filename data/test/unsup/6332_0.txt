I love the meat it's so soft the texture is amazing I don't care for the sauce It taste like sauce for ribs which for me doesn't go together..the pickled onion was bomb..my kids ate all there food so they loved it and it was a groupon whoop whoop I'm happy will go back soon maybe I can just buy sauce from lnl lol
