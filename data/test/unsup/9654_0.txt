Best Pho in the area!\n\nI was skeptical because most authentic pho places I've been to are too ghetto to have tacky chandeliers. I leave that up to the Chinese places. This was not the cheapest I've had, nor the most generous... but it hit the spot. The broth was good. The noodles were the right texture. It had a variety of meats that most people cannot identify for just around $8.\n\nPlus, service was pretty quick. Spring rolls were ok but they came out at lightning speed. Also, they allow you to pay individually and use credit cards!!
