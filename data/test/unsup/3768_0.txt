Second cup to me is like Philz coffee back in the USA.\n\nThis, my Canadian Yelpers is a compliment.\n\nGreat smooth espresso, and good service.\n\nI even enjoyed their Maple Latte made with the famous Canadian maple syrup.\n\nSweet and savory all in one.\n\nHonestly, I'll take this place over Starbucks or Java U any day.
