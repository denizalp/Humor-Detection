If I could give them a zero, I would. They're so rude and disrespectful. I called in for the second time, of course they only have record of one call, and asked if the doctor could call me. Almost three hours later, I called back and her MA tells me that she does not make calls to patients. What?! Are you kidding me, she's too good to call her patients when they have an issue? Add that to the poor bedside manners and disrespectful staff... I just need a new doctor.
