Very good sushi. I'm a vegetarian & their vegetable sushi rolls are delicious. Price is about the same compared to other sushi restaurants in Madison. This place is quite small though & you sit very close to your neighbors. Even though the sushi is good I probably wouldn't go back because of the environment. Too cramped & too loud to hear what your dining partner is even saying. Even though the sushi was good, I'm only giving two stars because that's how much I disliked the environment.
