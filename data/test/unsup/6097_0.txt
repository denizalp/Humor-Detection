\"What's the big deal?\" I said to a friend when I was visiting them in Cincinnati a couple years ago. But when another friend mentioned hitting this place after a movie in the area, I thought, \"Aw, what the hell.\" But this joint totally hit the spot, kiddo. You have to face the fact that the spaghetti and\/or hot dogs are simply a conveyor of massive amounts of chili + cheese. Accept it, live with it, and love it.
