We were told someone would call us on Monday, today is Wednesday and no call or contact from anyone there.  Even though the girl we talked to knew what the issue may have been, still no apology, no offer to repay any of the $100 plus we spent and never got consumed.  Reading previous reviews now it looks like over the past month there's been issues.  We have never had any issues at any of the other locations in town only the Town Square location.  Oh well, many other good places in Town Square that care.
