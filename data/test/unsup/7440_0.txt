I still think about the fries.\n\nI love their seasoned fries. I'm not usually a fan of fries, but they came with a combo that I ordered. I would hold back on the salt a little. Otherwise, it's great.\n\nI know the place was small but I ate in and I was surprised to be served. The staff was quite friendly. I know other Yelpers had some poor experience before me.
