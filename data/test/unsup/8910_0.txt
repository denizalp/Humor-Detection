Stopped in after a meeting today and was pleasantly surprised! I was told by friends it was a middle eastern style chipotle and they weren't wrong! The flavors however are 100 times fresher and better! I did feel a tad rushed since it was my first visit and didn't know how many toppings I could get but it was still spicy fresh and delicious!! I got th hummus bowl with falafel, salad, onions and the red hot sauce.\nStaff was on point too. Highly recommended!! .
