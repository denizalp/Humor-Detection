3 stars for the great service.\n\nFood was pretty mediocre. We got the sliders and rising sun (?) burger and fries. The burgers were overcooked (we ordered medium and they came out well done) and the fries were soggy. \n\nThe only thing that we really enjoyed was the black cow shake which tasted like a root beer float except with coke and cherry pop rocks. Brings you back to those good ol childhood days for sure!
