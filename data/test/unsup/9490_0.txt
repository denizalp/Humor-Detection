I love this place. I usually go a couple times a month. I've been to another location of theirs in Chandler, but mostly I end up going to the one on Central. \n\nThe pulled-pork sandwich hits the spot and the sauce they have just makes it. It has just enough spice to give it a little bite that I think BBQ needs to have. Every chance I get, I bring out of towners to experience it and they love it. With the exception of Southerners, they are incredibly insane when it comes to BBQ it seems. :)
