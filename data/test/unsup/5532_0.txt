Decor: 5\/5\n-lots and lots of seating. You won't have to wait for a table\n\nService: 5\/5\n-top notch, good comes out so fast\n-$15 minimum cc\n\nFood: 3\/5\n-viet coffee was so strong and perfect. I was feeling sleepy and this thing woke me up on first sip. They are also very generous with the condensed milk\n-pork shrimp spring roll and thit nuong were less than stellar. I would not recommend\n-pho however had a sweet broth taste and they were generous with the meat portions. I would recommend this not only for cost, portion but also how fast it comes out
