Ok, it must get better over time. (I hope)! Grand opening, and the place wasn't too packed. Got my red velvet, chai latte, lemon meringue, triple cinnamon, and vanilla. All were way too dry, and lacked flavor with the exception of the lemon. But still way to dry! They must've baked way too many and had them sit out way too long. That's what I get for going to their grand opening. I just pray this isn't what to expect in the future, as I will just stick to their ice cream.
