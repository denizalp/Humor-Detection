Great shopping mall for Great deals!! They have many of the high end stores here with some fun too! \n\nA little bit of everything..\nThey have a Dave and Busters, bowling, pool, movies, race car driving, and in the winter ice skating. \n\nThey are under a bit of construction right now for a re model, but nothing that got in the way of some good fun shopping!
