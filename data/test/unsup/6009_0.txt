Lets mix drinks, dancing and video games.\nGeek heaven right?  Yup.\n\nWe need a place like this in Los Angeles.  But crap this would never happen because everyone here is too hip and uptight to dance.  Dancing here is equal to people with their arms folded and bobbing their head.\n\nI'm glad its in Vegas because when I'm here I need a place to spend my time other than hours and hours at the craps tables
