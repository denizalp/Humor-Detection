Buhaha the Las Vegas airport.  You see a ton of crazy things.  My last flight going home, grabbed a pic of some girl all passed out laying on the floor.  She was a hot mess.  But only in Vegas  are you going to witness some extreme stuff.  People who just can't get their last minute of gambling in.  It is truly unique airport and to take with a great stride.
