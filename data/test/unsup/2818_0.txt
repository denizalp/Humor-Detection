LOVED THIS!!!  I'm a fan of Eli Roth and the horror genre, so this was right up my alley.  The best way to describe this, is to say it's similar to a haunted house tour.  We went on the tour before the \"actors\" came on, and it was just fun to hear the story behind the Delmont Hotel.\n\nOur tour guide was great, and made me feel like he was part of the \"Hostel\" crowd.  I will go back when the \"actors\" are there the next time we go to Vegas.
