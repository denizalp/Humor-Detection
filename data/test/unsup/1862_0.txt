Very unhygienic place to eat!!\nopen 24 hrs \nwe went with friends ordered naan ,dosa ,Malai kofta etc.,\nDosa is tasteless!! \nFood tastes real bad at this place .But i see most of the Indians eating here.\n\n\nI would prefer going to India masala on E flamingo st.\nThat is definitely a must try if you want Indian food!!
