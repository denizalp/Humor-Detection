I was very disappointed. We have been here before but something has changed. The food was very nasty, I didn't receive my drink of toast until I was done eating, and it was burnt. We sent menu items back but they were still nasty. We had omelette, grits, French toast, and pancakes. The French toast was decent but don't waste your time or money!!!!
