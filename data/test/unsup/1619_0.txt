I found this place today on accident, while taking a break from reading.  Thank God.  A cookie place that's open late?  Fantastic.  The macadamia nut was awesome and the double chocolate chunk was melty and gooey and delicious.  Cookies are $1 each and the store is open until 2:30 am!\n\nI hear they also deliver.  Wow.  Nicely done, Illinois, Nicely done.
