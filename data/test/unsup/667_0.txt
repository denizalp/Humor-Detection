What an interesting place. I just got back from lunch there. The dining room had only about 12 people in there. The price was reasonable. The server was personable and friendly. Everything I touched I loved. What an interesting buffet. I can easily say I have never had a better lentil soup. I also know I like Baba Ganouche. (sp?) now. Sat in one of those big old booths and had a perfect lunch. I was absolutely amazed that I sampled a little of everything and everything tasted fresh and good.
