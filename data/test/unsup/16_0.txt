Omgggggg thank god theres a place in vegas with REAL HAWAIIAN POKE!! If you're eager to try poke like how its made in Hawaii than you should come here! I had the Hawaiian poke bowl that came with kalua pig, lomi salmon (salmon, tomato, white onions), your choice of rice & poke. I chose brown rice with spicy ahi. The look & most importantly flavor of the food was on point! Thank you paina cafe for satisfying my poke cravings. I will definitely be back again.
