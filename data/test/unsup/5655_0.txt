Yuck,\nIn a town with a huge Latino population, why can't the food be just a little bit better?  The only good part of the meal was the chips and salsa.  Don't get the flavored margaritas because mine tasted like mango syrup on the rocks.  Stick to the traditional or just order a beer.  Flavorless and lukewarm food.  Get out of this casino if you want food, I have eaten at the Oyster Bar, Coffee Shop and now here and for some reason the food in all three restaurants is undesirable and barely heated through.
