I tried this place 4 years ago finding it thru Groupon, and it was absolutely amazing, both food and serve..  I went back last year, Nov 2017... oh WoW what a huge difference in food and serve.  Such a shame, this place was very good before and well worth the price.  Now, I wouldn't waste my money and time (serve was painfully slow, took 25mins just to be acknowledged and order a drink), too many good places to eat in Vegas and this is no longer one of them.
