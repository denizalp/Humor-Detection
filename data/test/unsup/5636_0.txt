This other table was being disruptive, and told their kids they were going to beat them.  We nicely said, \"Please keep it down, you're cussing in front of our kids.\" She then threatened to kick our butts, and beat OUR kids! We told the manager, and they said \"Maybe she's crazy.\" No apology or anything. Very unprofessional.
