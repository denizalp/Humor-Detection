Absolutely horrible experience - customs suits for wedding and after two hours of measurement and fitting these losers give me a suit that I could have bought at Macy's - all measurements off and embarrassing customer service is out of control. \nJust take your money ship to Italy and say I am sorry to big to long and looks like fits some one 6-2 50 pounds bigger.
