alright mon pass me da ting ting and make sure tha jerk chicken is spicy, extra hot sauce!\nRice and Peas and coleslaw on da side makes everyting aright - $12\nOk, so perhaps my Jamiacan accent isnt that good, but the real jerk is soooo good it makes you actually feel like you are Jamiacan! Fast take out service, friendly staff, great \"island feel\" makes this joint truly - Irie!!
