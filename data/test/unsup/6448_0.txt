After a couple years of bad cooks and sub par food, I've come to realize that they are consistently inconsistent. \n\nThe Sometimes Good:\n\nThe Steak Sandwich is sometimes good (other times there are chunks of cartilage which make it inedible. )\n\nThe custom pizza (with sausage and pepperoni) was good today but sometimes way too greasy.\n \nThe Cannoli's, coffee and espresso were good today. \n\nConsistently Bad:\n\nDirty dishes (dirty coffee cups and forks)\nChicken dishes are almost always too dry.\nWait staff...not always the friendliest. \n\nWe give this place 3.5 stars.
