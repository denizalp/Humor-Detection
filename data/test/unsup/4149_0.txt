So, for the Gyro enthusiast, Steve's is the place!\nTONS of meat on the regular or the jumbo\nAmazing Taste.  So much garlic.\nFresh onion and tomato and a unique tzatziki on warm pita.\nThe line gets busy sometimes. So if you're in a rush, get their early.  It is cash only but for a stand in the Westside Markets, Steve's is spot on taste and quality
