My furnace broke down while away on a vacation and I came back to find a substantial amount of damage to my house and it was -30 degrees outside. Casey came over that night (after hours) and made sure we had heat, otherwise the house would have been inhabitable. Over the next week he helped us get the house back up and running; he was always very polite, attentive and responsive. We live in a relatively nice house, and his workmanship was seamless once completed. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
