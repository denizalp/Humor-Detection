My daughter noticed one of my headlights was out on my car early this morning. As I was in Gilbert today, I found this Autozone location via Maps and am extremely glad I found this location. I not only was able to purchase a new light, but a wonderful employee replaced it for me. I am extremely grateful, as I travel with my service dog and he made my day. I neglected to get the employees name, but cannot thank him enough for going above and beyond to help me!!!
