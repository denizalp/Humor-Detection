Called in for delivery and the guy taking the order was so obnoxious. He couldn't write down a simple phone number. Yea and 27 dollars for a large pizza with garlic?? No. Just so much no. This isn't Los Angeles, it's downtown phoenix so don't kid yourself. Way too expensive for a pizza. It's good but not that good. Also, $3 per topping?! Tessio's charges 50 cents per topping. Are these limited edition or endangered toppings? The audacity.
