Stuck $5 in a poker machine. Never registered the credit.  Slot attendant filed a claim and told me to come back tomorrow, which I did. Next day after waiting 1 hour to get assisted they told me they did not find the $5 in the machine. I asked them if they reviewed the camera footage and they had not. I gave up since it was only $5 thank god... I'll never get the wasted time back, and they obviously don't value their customers\/marks.  Don't gamble here!!!.   Avoid like plague!
