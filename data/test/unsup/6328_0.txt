Delicious food at an extremely reasonable price. Our very filling and flavorful dinner for three people was less than $40 including tip and non alcoholic beverages (chai masala teas and a mango lassi). Best naan ever I've had - it's perfectly fresh, fluffy, and each piece is about twice the size of typical naan. Indian food is one of the best options for vegetarians and Koohinoor's options are no exception. I really enjoyed #36, Baingan Bharta (mashed eggplant with onion, tomatoes, and green peas).
