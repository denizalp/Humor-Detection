I do travel and move a lot. I spent a weekend there few months ago with my husband..nice place, check in went smoothly and fast, staff is very nice, rooms are clean.. TV did nt work the first night, however after that they were able to fix it the next day..I liked the location.so many things for the kids to do. We used valet parking which was a little bit expensive, but over all a good place.
