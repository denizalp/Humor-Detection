Nestled between a trailer park, majestic ash trees and a sewage treatment plant. Kinda of smells like everyone has to poop in here. Theres a dog running around outside looking as lost as the patrons within. \n\nWe came for the wet tshirt contest but instead found Madisons portal to hell.\n\nQuit drinking, found jesus. He bought us a Jaegerbomb.
