If I could give 0 stars, I would. I just want a pitcher of water and they said they can't give me one....but no one has refilled water at our table even tho I've gone through 3 glasses from other people at my table. They only seem to care if you want to buy their drinks here. As a pregnant person, this really feels like they are discriminating against serving me.
