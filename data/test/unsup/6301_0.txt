Such a cute little coffee place! We came in early on a Sunday morning & were greeted by the friendliest employee! She told us some of her fave's so we tried them (one was a latte with caramel & cinnamon, omgggg good!) They came out promptly & exactly how we ordered. For the size of the building there was plenty of seating which was nice. Looking forward to coming back & trying some more things off the menu.
