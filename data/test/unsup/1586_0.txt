This company took advantage of an elderly person (85). Customer service is an absolute joke. The elderly person I speak of has Alzheimer's and had to be moved to a facility. Person doesn't even have the house any longer and they still wouldn't let her out of the contract. Total waste of money. The system NEVER worked correctly right from the beginning. Do not use this company you will regret it.
