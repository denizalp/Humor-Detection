The NP was great, but the wait time was horrendous. I go to urgent care expecting to get treated quickly, not wait in the waiting room and exam room for 1.5 hours before I even see the NP who spends 5 minutes and sends me on my way. I would've been better off making an appointment with my regular doc and driving an extra 30 minutes to see him.
