Lol the lady waitress ran up to me and my uncle when she thought we didn't leave a tip lol because we paid with a credit card and left a tip in cash but she didn't see the tip in cash just the 0 from the credit card , she really ran up to us and said the tip wasn't included lol like the service was up to par to even get tip \n\nNever not tipped but never had a server run up to me asking for one smh never come back here again just on that note
