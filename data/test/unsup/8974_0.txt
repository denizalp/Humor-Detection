Great service. Terrible food. Dover sole was soggy and lacked flavor. Hard to eat. My stomach feels sour now. My husband's very expensive lamb portion was incredibly small. 4 skinny ribs. No sides. Still hungry afterward.  Like going to the Super Bowl and sitting in the nosebleeds. Underwhelming. Do not recommend to anyone.
