This is where I get my daily coffee for the past 7 yrs... Love it. $1 can go no wrong (if ur not a regular they will charge u tax). i also like to order the chicken burger combo w\/ a soup. monday's soup is usually a cream soup, while the rest of the week varies.. most often it is chicken noodle w\/ rice, veggie, etc. \n\ni find the breakfast a little too oily for me (watching weight) but also tried the chicken souvlaki, grilled cheese sandwich here. not too bad! :)
