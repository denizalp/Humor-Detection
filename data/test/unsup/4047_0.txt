Great place for sandwich, salad and refreshments after golf.  They are open for dinner and have a new chef...forgot who.   Have been here for charity golf and the food was good.\n\nToday, ate in Sammy's and had a very good Apple Walnut salad with chicken and raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  It was huge...way to much for me!
