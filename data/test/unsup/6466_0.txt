We loved this restaurant. The setting in the Palazzo was gorgeous. They start by bringing garlic bread with a beautiful little spread of humus, olives and a mix of cheese and dry sausage. Lovely. They are known for their meatballs and they were tender and delicious. Wait staff was attentive and helpful. Will go again!
