We took our grandchildren to this location today and ordered wings. When we received our order there were two wing tips included as part of the 10. I thought maybe it was a mistake but when I took it back I was told that that is normal. I don't know what part of the bone we were expected to eat. We were really disappointed in the way we were treated and do not plan to return.
