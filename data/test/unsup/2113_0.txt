Slot machines in an airport. Need I say more?\n\nI don't need to, but I will. The airport itself is located near the strip and a quick taxi ride will get you where you need to be. The problem is... the wait to get that taxi is very very long. Not cool. That is my biggest complaint about this airport. Inside, there are plenty of yummy places to eat at, seats to sit on, and places to purchase those last minute pairs of fuzzy dice for your car. And did i mention they have slot machines??
