When entering the restaurant, the atmosphere made it seem like an enjoyable place to eat. It was clean and the employees greeted me with a smile. However, being the cheap person I am and also considering other Korean Barbecue places in Vegas, the price of the All You Can Eat, was surprising. $27.99 per person! Yikes! In addition to that, the bathrooms were kinda gross. I don't trust their toilet with my booty. Overall, the food was good, the employee service was mediocre , and bathrooms were guhrosss.
