Love this place. I've been coming here with my family since I was a baby. I've never had a bad experience and have always left having had a great time and for a great price. As for the lady with the kid eating the dime bag. You are outside and there are lots of people the staff can't be constantly looking for tiny little bags of drugs. People leave that stuff everywhere I'm sure the manager didn't give it to your child.
