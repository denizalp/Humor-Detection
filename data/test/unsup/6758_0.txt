I love how chewy the ramen noodle is. The pork was okay, sometimes I don't find it not piping hot enough, I like my pork piping hot, but that is just my personal preference. \n\nI've ordered the tan tan one, it has a good spice level. I've asked the staff if that particular ramen comes with an egg. She said \"no\" so I ordered a side order of the egg. I ended up with three eggs. Wasn't too happy about that, but anyways, good noodles!
