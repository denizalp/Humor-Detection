LOVE when good food is open late.\n\nI came here after marquee, YEARNING for some food. The long wait for our food to come made me very very very very cranky. The bread they gave did not suffice.\n\nBut the sundried tomato penne def was worth that wait. It is very garlicky, so any vegas hookup should come BEFORE eating this. There was so much flavor that I left no morsel uneaten. I nibbled off everyone else's other dish (shrimp scampi, the sandwiches, the burgers, etc), and nothing compared to my dish. WIN!
