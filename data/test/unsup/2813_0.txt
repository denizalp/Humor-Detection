I hope I don't get linched because I didn't really find the flavors all that great.  I had the famous salted butter caramel.  I am a fan of caramel and sea salt items.  This scoop didn't had any saltiness and the ice cream felt like I was coating my whole mouth with a stick of butter.  Not the most appealing taste.  I had a taste of the Lime Basil sorbet.  That was much better.  I wish I had ordered that one instead, at least I wouldn't have felt nauseous.
