This store is so trashy. They have Horrible service. I've been there several times and it doesn't fail to hear people always complaint. \n\nStore has so much random junk all over they place looks like they picked up all that junk in the LA district. All the junk is placed everywhere. \n\nTakes forever to check out. For being Boca park this store stinks. This store in this condition belongs in the east side.
