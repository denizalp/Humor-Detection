Another awesome spot for poke. Their ingredients are fresh and they give general portions of each toppings. The restaurant is very clean and staff very friendly. The dining room is very large, much more spacious than the competitors. One other difference I noticed is that they offer yellowtail as one of their protein choice which I haven't seen anywhere else. However, the prices are slightly higher here. I'd highly recommend.
