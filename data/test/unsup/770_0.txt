Literally the worst food I have ever eaten! I paid $140  for dry, tasteless shrimp and a sliced cucumber with olive oil on it. The service was terrible! I saw my server three times, once when I ordered, once when I got my slop, and once when he dumped the check in my lap. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy! NEVER eat here!!!
