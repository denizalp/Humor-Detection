This place is not very busy yet but that's okay because I was seated right away. $35 for a simple mani and pedi. My lady Kim did a great job. Didn't fuss when I asked her to do something like put extra paint on the side of my nails & etc. Leslie took the time to talk to me while Kim did my nails which was very nice. Will go again if I can [:
