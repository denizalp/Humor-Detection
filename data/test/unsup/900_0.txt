I came here for dinner and ordered the butter chicken pie. I wasn't expecting much from this pub but it was surprisingly good! The butter chicken actually tasted like butter chicken and the crust of the pie was done well. The vegetables were delicious and the only thing I didn't like was the mashed potato but I don't like mashed potato to begin with. I would definitely come back here when I'm craving pub food.
