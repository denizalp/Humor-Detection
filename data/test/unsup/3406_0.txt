This is like an upscale Denny's because of the various sides you get with each breakfast\/brunch plate; which is great because I like variety in my breakfast\/brunch. I have had most of the scrambles and omelets, and all are terrific. The gluten-free pancakes are not the best but they're passable. The texture is off but the flavor is decent.\n\nThe wait can be long during traditional breakfast\/brunch times on the weekend but if you get there before 9 am or after 12 pm the wait is short or nonexistent.
