I recently purchased a new Tacoma from the dealership, and had a comfortable and professional experience. Yes. The Tacoma sells itself, but my salesperson Ben was knowledgeable and low-pressure. I found other staff members friendly and helpful through the car buying process. -I haven't had any dealings with the service department.
