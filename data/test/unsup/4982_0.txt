Awesome!! This places rocks. My favorite breakfast I've had in a long long time. Service was incredible - got seated quickly, waitress right there to take our order quickly, and food came out amazingly fast given that it was a full house. I got a really tasty blueberry waffle, with scrambled eggs. Others got omelette and pancakes which were really tasty and fluffy.  Good coffee and fresh OJ to top it off.  It was a bit expensive ($42 for 3 people) but a nice treat out for breakfast. I wish they had these in CA.
