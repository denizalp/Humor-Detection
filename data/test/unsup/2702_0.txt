Granted, this place was only open a month at the time - there were the the tell-tale signs of dishes crashing to the floor in the kitchen - but there's still no excuse for taking over 30 minutes for an ice cream sundae to get to the table. \n\nOur server explained that the sundaes were coming from \"retail.\" Meaning it's not coming from the kitchen but instead from their candy store in the adjoining room. Who ever heard of such a thing?
