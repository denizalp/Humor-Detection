Our Ginger ( dog) had a growth in her face and they did surgery in her. She had one on her leg too that was removed. It bled a little the night if the surgery but we went back and they took care if it asap. They were great the whole time. One month later her hair has grown back and she's 100% healed and happy. I get very anxious about her since she's my baby and felt  comfortable and am so happy we took her to Dr. Ceballos and team!
