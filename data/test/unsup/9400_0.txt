I have given the salon my business for a while now. The last handful of times that I have been there I was treated so rudely! Christine was who worked with me last and she was so unprofessional. From being very rough and shoving my foot in the water to not even saying thank you after I gave her a tip she didn't deserve. I will never go back nor recommend anyone.
