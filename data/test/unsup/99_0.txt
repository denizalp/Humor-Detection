Every time I visit Vegas, my first evening is spent at Rhumbar. Great music, great ambiance and a great start to another Vegas weekend! I usually have 3-4 cocktails($17-20) and get the unlimited hookah($65). \n\nOne gripe though, I feel the cocktails are too diluted to get any sort of buzz going, so a little more alcohol, please. \n\nTill next time.
