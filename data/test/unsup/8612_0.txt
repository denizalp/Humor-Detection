Phenomenal food! Currently my favorite restaurant in Toronto! You have to go on oyster night (a buck a shuck). Start with a massive ice cold Sapporo beer and the Japa burger sliders. The Chilean sea bass will blow your mind, probably the best thing on the menu. Get the pork belly as well only $6 a plate but so good. Oh and treat yourself to a bottle of hot sake it's da bomb\n*if you do go on oyster night you probably want to make a reservation a week or so in advance ;)
