Went by at 11:30, thought it would be open based on hours posted on Yelp. My wife went in to ask if they were open and was told \"Yes, sit anywhere you want\". Then, when we were walking into the restaurant, another person came by and told us they weren't open, and the other guy had been joking. Who thinks its funny to joke about a restaurant being open 30 minutes early? Not me!
