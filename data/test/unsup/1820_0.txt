They're lucky they're even getting one star!!!!! \nI am fed up with having faith that this place will carry some decent coconut, but every time I buy one and crack it open the coconut meat is moldy ! C'mon on now! Coconuts aren't cheap! Check the coconuts! Also, they don't accept credit card! Had to leave my stuff behind because that's all I had was a credit card! \nOh and the staff there look so depressed.
