Awesome spot! Adorable inside, super friendly staff, and the food!!!! I got biscuits and gravy, steak and eggs, AND the banana pecan French toast..... Just awesome, all of it was! I would eat there again in a second! My boyfriend got the chicken fried steak which was so dang good, and the fresh squeezed orange juice, to die for!!! You MUST go!!!!
