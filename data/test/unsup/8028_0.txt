I thought 5 minutes was too short but after trying to bump and roll inside the zorb ball I was exhausted within 3 minutes. This is coming from someone who isn't physically active at all. It's super fun for both adults and kids. I definitely recommend this to anyone! They also do birthday parties too! Instead of getting a bouncy house just get this instead! +5 stars!
