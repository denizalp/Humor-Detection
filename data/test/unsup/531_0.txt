Came here after work today. This place was so spacious and the ambiance was so fun. We were seated promptly and greeted by our server Kailin. Very welcoming and genuine with how busy the place was. Kailin was spot on with our meat and multiple grill changes. She also recommended the soju to us. It was soooo good!!!! Definitely will come back!
