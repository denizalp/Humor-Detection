The best bar that I ended up at in Vegas! \n\nThe dueling pianists sing songs on request, with tips of course. Everyone in the bar is singing songs together! Great atmosphere! Great crowds! \n\nEven though I did not stay long, this is one place I will definitely be coming back to. \n\nSinging songs when drunk is fun!!!!!!!!!!!
