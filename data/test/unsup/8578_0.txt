Don't be fooled by the beautiful models. When we first moved in we absolutely loved this place!! This was until we saw how GHETTO the people around us were. No body has regards for other people, if there is ever a problem and you have to call the office or maintenance they couldn't care less. Replacing a KEY that cost 3 dollars to copy, costs 75 dollars to replace. I really could go on but I think based on the other crappy reviews this place speaks for itself. Save yourself the time and don't even bother!
