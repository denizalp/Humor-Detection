My wife loves this place.... she is an avid knitter. Its really great to have this nice little shop only a mile form the house. Now she can spend more money on her yarn \"stash\". \n\nThere are relatively new owners, and they are really nice. Nice selection of yards, and accessories. Books, and knitting magazines, and patterns. \n\nHelpful knowledgeable staff are always available.\n\nI go and sit and drink coffee... and nod a lot when my wife shows me yarn and asks for my opinion! :)
