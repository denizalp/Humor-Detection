Do not as them to order products that other Sprouts have. They will tell you they are going to get it in for you and then come up with some lame excuse. Funny,  but the Sprouts in. Higley and Southern carries it, but Val Vista can't get it. This has happened with many products, but especially Pazzelle cookies, vanilla,  chocolate or maple flavored.  If we stop shopping there, maybe they will get the picture. I will never step foot in that store again. MANAGER LIED TO ME.
