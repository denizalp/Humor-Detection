About 4 times in a week and still want more.  Right after lunch I start thinking about the ribbons of delicious snow!  I start patting my forearm waiting for a fix!!  \n  So light and airy with a multitude of topping choices.  Just eating each flavor bare or naked is good enough!  Another point I would like to make, is how it keeps it shape while eating.  When you get to the bottom of the container, which I always do, there is no super sweet syrupy mess!\n Cant wait to go again!!
