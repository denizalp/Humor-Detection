The best thing about this place is their unique variety. From Girl Scout, to cookies & cream, bacon\/maple and cereal covered donuts their variety never seems to disappoint. The donuts do however leave that oil after taste, but they're still good donuts. Not the BEST in town but among the better of the specialty donuts. Definitely a great place to go to if you live nearby but not worth a drive across town for.
