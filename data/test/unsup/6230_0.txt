Some how took me 2 years to find this place (sad face). My husband and I are both middle eastern and this is the best mid east restaurant we have been to in NC. It is amazing. The food is so delicious and authentic. Their bread is the best I have ever eaten in my life. I had the kofta kabob and my husband had the mixed kabob plate, all three kabobs (kofta, chicken, and shish) were amazing. I cannot wait to go back again and again.
