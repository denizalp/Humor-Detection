*Thumbs up*\nThe grilled octopus salad had a tangy, citrus vinaigrette that complimented the pieces of tender octopus. The manila clams in the linguine main entree were fresh, and the freshly grated parmesan cheese on top was a nice touch.\n\n*Thumbs down*\nThe margherita pizza came free courtesy of MyVegas loyalty points, but that doesn't excuse the soggy and flavorless crust. The pizza could've used more fresh pieces of basil, instead of just one measly herb per slice.
