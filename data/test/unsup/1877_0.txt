Sometimes you are just craving Mexican food and want to try someplace new. Well I wouldn't recommend this place. They do not serve alcohol, which is weird because who doesn't want a margarita with their tacos? The menu is very confusing and even shows drinks, but they are all non-alcoholic. The service was very slow and not very good. The whole experience was mediocre, which is disappointing because I love Mexican food. A LOT!
