After the renovation... \n\nStayed here for three nights - took advantage of the club lounge for breakfast and a pre-drink before dinner.  All in all, very clean, staff was nice... However, there was a pair of BIG briefs hanging in the bathroom which I thought was a hand towel... not so good - had to call housekeeping to clean up - they actually changed our room because of it.
