I really enjoyed this hotel. Our room was in a weird place (next to a fire escape) so I figure that's why the room's layout was so poor, despite it being a huge room. The casino area has a great outdoor downtown New York vibe to it, and offers plenty of restaurants -- some of which I can confirm DO NOT suck (hello, Gallagher's).\n\nAnother reason to stay at New York New York? You can get discounted (or in my case) free ride(s) on the rollercoaster, which is actually a pretty decent one.
