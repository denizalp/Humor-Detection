Recently went with a friend and her dog to eat on the porch. Kind of crowded, little noisy, but what can you expect for a Friday night? Good service, friendly patrons, and great food. Had the fried cheese curds for the first time, very yummy. for sure to go again, and highly recommended for friends.
