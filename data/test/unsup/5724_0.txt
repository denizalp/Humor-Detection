The girls running the front desk were rude as hell. So much so, that I decided to write a review on Yelp which I've never done in my life. Nobody was in line so I came up to ask if there was an open lane. When she said \"May I help you?\", the tone of her voice and the look in her eyes translated to \"why are you bothering me?\"  Geeze... sorry I asked. I'll never go back. It's a bad vibe anyway. It can't decide if it's toddler arcade or a real bowling alley.
