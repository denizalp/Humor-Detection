When our water heater flooded part of the house I called A.S.A.P. They were onsite within a couple of hours and began opening walls and drying the areas that got wet from the leak. Josh was very professional and persistent making sure that every area was exposed and completely dry.\n\nIf you need this kind of help definitely call Josh. One thing that I learned is that this is a long process and it takes good communication with your insurance company to get this right. Josh handled everything in that area perfectly.
