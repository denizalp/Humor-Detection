Corn dogs. Beer. \nDo you need anything else?!\nGo.\n\nBut really. The inside is welcoming and cozy and makes you want to stay all night. The staff is friendly and will tell you about any beer you have a question about.  The beer list may not be super long yet but they are all solid choices. And that is much better than throwing out 20 mediocre choices. I applaud them for that. \n\nThe atmosphere can make a non beer person feel totally at home. There's no stuffiness about it.
