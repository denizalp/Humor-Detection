As we pulled up in the parking lot I was skeptical about whether or not I would be the 44th five star review for this restaurant. But the food was delicious, the service was friendly, and we rolled out of there with really full bellies. The naan was spectacular, the tamarind sauce and mint chutney were perfect, I loved the palak paneer, and the tandoori chicken. The owner said they've only been open for two months and my guess is they will be around for a long time.
