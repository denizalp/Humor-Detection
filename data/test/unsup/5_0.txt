I wasn't expecting much but was I surprised .\nThe restaurant is modern and clean and the servers were welcoming .We orders our food and and it was served hot and promptly .The food is so much better than I thought and the server is awesome !!!The burger is a lot better than we thought considering its out of the city core \nI would definitely  come again and our servers name was shonagh and she was fantastic
