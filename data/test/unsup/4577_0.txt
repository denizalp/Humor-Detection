I think it's time for another poem, dedicated to the really nice people and delicious food at this Steak 'n Hoagie location:\n\nHello, gyro my hero - I missed you so,\nIf I didn't have pants to fit into, I would never let you go. \n\nWith salads, sandwiches and cheesesteaks too,\nThis Steak 'n Hoagie shop is my new boo. \n\nSo, go on and grab a $4.20 gyro pita,\nI promise it will make you purr like a cheetah.
