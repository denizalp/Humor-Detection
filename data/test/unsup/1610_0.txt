One of our go-to bars in Summerlin. Three Angry Wives is an Irish bar located next to Starbucks in Boca Park. With Guiness on tap and some of the best chicken fingers Ive ever had, its impossible to not love this place.\n\nThe atmosphere is a dimmed, intimate gaming bar. The bartenders are always pleasant, and accommodating. Its exactly what you would expect a neighborhood bar to be.
