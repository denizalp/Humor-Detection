Slow and overall bad service. Server didn't come when my party sat down. Waited 5-10min and we had to flag down someone to get us started. Drinks came pretty slowly as well. Salad bar is alright. Meat was either salty, tough, or overcooked in general. We asked for different types of meat, cause only 4 circulated to us over the 1.5 hours we were there. Tried to pay the bill, had to wait so long just to get it. And forever to get the cards processed too (split bill). Avoid.
