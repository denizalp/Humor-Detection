Just another pseudo-cowboy bar in Calgary. The crowd is white-bread and the music even more so -playing remixed top 40's into the night. If you are looking for a predictable night of expensive booze, low-cut tops and dancing at one of Calgary's many meat markets then the Roadhouse is the place to be. But with Calgary's cultural and nightlife scene blooming the way it is why waste your time at a sub par bar?
