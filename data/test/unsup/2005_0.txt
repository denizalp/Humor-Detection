My friend and I were out of state visiting. This mall contains many popular shops for females in their 20-30s. Overall, the mall was clean and most employees were friendly and helpful. The mall also has a food court with plenty of options as well as several restaurants\/ fast food joints right outside the mall. We spent about 3-4 hours here and still did not get to explore the whole mall, so give yourself some time to explore. Given the opportunity, I would come back!
