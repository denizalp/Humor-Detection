Service has always been good\nFood quality is the same as NYC but the quantity is less and it has increased in cost with more popularity. I like that it's close but don't necessarily have cravings for it anymore. \n\nMediterranean style chicken, rice, lettuce and tomatoes with small pieces of pita. \nAddicting white sauce and really spicy hot sauce which has a thick paste like consistency. \n\nNot something I would go to often, too many other places to go nowadays. But like I said great service and reminds me of being in college again!
