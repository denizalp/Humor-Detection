The food here is absolutely great. However I ordered food online, waited over an hour and half, and once I call the guy tells me \"it hasn't been shipped out yet\". Hoping I would be satisfied by that answer. I then ask if my food had even been made yet. NO, it wasn't even made yet!\nThat place is way too slow At every given time to not have completed what must have been only their 7th order of the day. They won't be getting my money again.
