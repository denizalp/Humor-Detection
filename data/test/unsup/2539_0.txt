I would give this location zero stars if I could. Very rude manager and employees. They would not honor the Goodyear road hazard protection plan, nor would they honor tire rotation for their own tired. Even Firestone is willing to do it (on Goodyear tires). We are going to stick with Firestone from now on. I would never come back here, nor will we purchased Goodyear tires in the future. We drove quite a ways to get here and are very disappointed.
