This location just isn't good or very helpful. They don't use rewards card either. It's a waste of a location. I rather see it independently operating in its own suite in the same shopping center instead of inside in a grocery store operating by their own standards instead of Starbucks standards. Please leave Albertson's and move into you're own space in the shopping center !!!
