As a first timer ordering Zeppe's, this was an awful first impression for a delivery to my home that is approximately 1 mile from this location. 16\", XL thin crust doubled over on itself after a lap around the Avon Nuremberg ring. We eat with our eyes first, and this experience was unpleasant upon reaching my tastebuds.
