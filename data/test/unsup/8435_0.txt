Awful food. Garlic sauce is dark brown and incredibly syrupy. Chow mein has no noodles, but crispy chips on the side of cooked vegetables and meat. Very nice service, though.  We still shudder at the thought of that food.  I don't know that a Chinese person would know that it was even supposed to resemble that cuisine.
