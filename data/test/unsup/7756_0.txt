As so many reviews begin... I purchased a Groupon. \n$25 for 60 minute massage. It was money very well spent. I received the best massage ever from Tammy! She was so intuitive and new exactly what to do.\n\nI ended up coming back and having some adjustments done. The rest of the staff is nice and friendly, but not spectacular. I scheduled another massage but was told Tammy was no longer there. I still got the massage but it was not even close to as good.\n\n5 Stars for Tammy. 3 for the rest of the place.
