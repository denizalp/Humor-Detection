We had a terrible experience here - and on Valentine's Day! I don't know what was worse, the food or the service. Or the drinks. Weak tasteless, margs. Bland queso that seemed straight from the Velveeta package. And service was so slow, even though the place was not crowded. The only good part was the chips and salsa.
