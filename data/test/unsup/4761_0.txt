While visiting Arizona, I had to try out this place and I'm glad I did! I went on a Sunday for brunch. There wasn't much of a wait for 2. I made my own omelette with a side of their berry pancakes. Delicious! My friend ordered a chicken sandwich with fries. Seems like it didn't come with a brioche bun as stated in the menu, but it seemed acceptable. Maybe just go for breakfast items as it seems that is what they excel at. Would go again if I'm in the area again.
