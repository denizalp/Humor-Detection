Can't say enough good things about this hotel. Super clean rooms, snacks all day, beautiful pool, friendly staff and an amazing restaurant attached to the hotel in the down stairs lobby. They also offer bikes to cruise the town. I have never seen any other Hotel offer that service. We had an amazing time here and cannot wait to come back.
