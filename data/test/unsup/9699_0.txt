I have a huge throbbing wood for this place...\n\nI love their pizza and this location is on the up and up.\nAlways order extra cheese because you cannot get enough of their fresh mozzarella... May I suggest basil and sausage too.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with this place.\n\nI would give them 5 stars if they inserted an awesome tap into their mix.  That's about all I have to say about that.
