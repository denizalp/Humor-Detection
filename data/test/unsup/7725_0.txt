Great selection of beer and always a good drink special.  Probably has the best Pizza in the east valley.... definitely worth it for the pizza alone.  Other menu items are good, and portion sizes are generous.\nNot the best place to watch sports, but has an adequate amount of TVs, including some HD flatscreens.
