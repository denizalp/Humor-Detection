Great service and decent food. I enjoyed the gyro platter with a side of rice and vegetables. One thing that could be improved is the pita bread portioning. Who in the world is only satisfied with three tiny slices of pita bread? Put some more bread on the plate. Then I will up this place's rating to four stars.\n\nUntil then, My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is okay if you want smiling service and questionable portions.
