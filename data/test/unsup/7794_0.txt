Either they don't care about their food or they don't read Yelp. Seriously. All of the mentions about the food being \"not so great\" are spot on. My fries were cold, the chicken super greasy (and not in a good way) and my soft pretzel was made of soft\/fluffy bread. Everything I had pretty much sucked.\n\nPlus the staff seemed to be about the age of kids actually going to camp and there were flies inside the place. So I guess they nailed the whole \"camping\" theme, but not in a good way.
