I stay at this Hampton Inn at least once a month. It's always very clean! The staff at this Hampton are exceptional! Shannon, who works evenings at the front desk, goes out of her way to be helpful. The same goes for the woman who works in the breakfast area (don't know her name), but she's fantastic!
