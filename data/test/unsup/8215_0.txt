Grimaldi's is a Brooklyn treasure. It is nice to be able to get Brooklyn pizza out west. If you are in Las Vegas, I highly recommend visiting Grimaldi's. We had the Grimaldi's salad. A large can be shared with 4 people. We ordered a large cheese pizza and a large The Don. Which is a meat lovers pizza with sausage, meatballs & pepperoni. Delicious. The waiter and bus staff were helpful, friendly and extremely efficient.\nEnjoy!
