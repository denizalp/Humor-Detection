It's rather good Chinese food, and they are on delivermefood.com - which means we can have it delivered to the office.  Works by me! \n\nIt's not the best I've had in the neighborhood (like I'm even qualified to make that statement), but it's not the worst either!  I would recommend the Curry Chicken or the Schezwan Chicken.  YUM YUM Shout Outs to both!
