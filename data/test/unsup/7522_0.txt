We love Leslie, Chris, and Johnny!!! Everyone is so friendly and makes it a real joy to keep coming back!\n\nIt's hard to see from the street. Located near Mountain's Edge, next to the liquor outlet and Dotty's. On Rainbow between Blue Diamond and Windmill.\n\nWe will continue coming back to this shop for as long as we live in Vegas! Would definitely recommend to anybody looking for a relaxing and fun pampering session!
