Very good ice cream. Benches for you to eat your ice cream so it melts on to your hands, which is the right way to do it. There is also a lawn here, so families and teenagers can throw a ball around while waiting, or after eating their ice cream. Just a good overall ice-cream-shop vibe. I wouldn't put Bruster's as #1 ice cream I have ever eaten, but it's in the Top 10%.
