Just moved here from\nBuffalo and needed my hair done. Found the closest salon and found Amber! She has highlighted and now given me a great cut. I love how she starts out cutting just a little then goes shorter she doesn't just chop! I have loved the color she gave me now love the cut. Will continue seeing her even though it's a little pricey.
