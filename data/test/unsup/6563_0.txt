Just bought my brand new Jeep Renegade Latitude from my cousin Chris Montana and Jesse. I'm not saying this because I'm family either but they really care for the individual and the financial stance they want to be with their soon to be vehicle. Love you all lots over there at Chapman and I thank you guys so much. Chris, Sal, Jesse, and Rocco...
