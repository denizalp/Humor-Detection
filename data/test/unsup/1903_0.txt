This is my go to snack spotwhen i'm shopping in the area. I have a soft spot for the really bad food at Taco Bell, i gotta say. When you need a quick, cheap snack, it's great to pop in. My fave is the $5 combo thingy. A pop, choice of fries or nachos and cheese, 2 tacos (I like one each hard & soft) and your choice of dessert apple pie or cinnamon twists. Filling!! I know it's not the best food, but it's yummy, and i don't get it very often ;)
