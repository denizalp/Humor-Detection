Worst living situation of my life. \nThe staff could care less about your safety. \nDisgusting apartments, takes maintenance a week to respond, loud!\n\nThey're gonna show you a gorgeous untouched unit and give you a shit hole. Every email sent hasn't been resolved. My 12 months was horrible. Splurge an extra 150 and get your own place. Also this area is known for murders... Look on crime maps LVP\nReally safe for students
