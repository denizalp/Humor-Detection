I've tried the location in Tustin, CA and although this location doesn't have some of the same items, it has other unique yummy meats! Service is impeccable. Kevin was our server [we were a party of 2] he was knowledgeable about all the meats and was able to explain what each one was that we weren't familiar with. Atmosphere was very nice compared to any other kbbq I've been to. I would definitely come again and recommend Gen to my friends.
