The service here is 3\/10, the focus on processing online orders instead of the people physically in the store. In fact, they don't even acknowledge the people in line. I stood in line for 10 minutes and during that time they helped no one in the store but were processing orders. They never acknowledged anyone with a simple \"be right with you\". A few waiting customers left. They had plenty of staff but not efficient. Not sure I would return to this location.
