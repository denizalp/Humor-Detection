My first time staying at this hotel although I've been to Vegas plenty of times.\nThey have a huge footprint and there are several entrances besides the main one. There is plenty of shopping and restaurants pretty much on site. There's also the roller coaster here as well. \nThe rooms are not bad, I stayed in the NY Tower. Spacious enough with a desk and a lounge chair as well. \nI didn't use the pool but I could see it from my room and it was a huge pool.\nOverall a little dated.
