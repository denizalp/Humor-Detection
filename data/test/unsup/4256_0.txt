There is a crack in my windshield! \n\nSo I needed to call my insurance company.  I have glass coverage so I wanted to see who they recommend.   Auto Glass Authority was the top of their list.  \n\nThey were able to replace my windshield the next day.  Yay! Ken S. arrived in the time frame we set up.  He was very thorough and professional.  Within an hour my car was pretty again.  \n\nI would highly recommend using this company.  Everything went smoothly!
