Itty Bitty Tokyo Discount No. 2 Review\n\n- Thanks to Suzy H., my new obsession is green tea Kit Kats. I stopped by Tokyo Discount for a bag ($7.39) and browsed the little Japanese shop.\n- Lots of Hello Kitty and other Sanrio items; kitchen and home decor items; spices, ramen, sauces, snacks, gold Buddha statues.\n- The green tea Kit Kats were located at the end of one aisle, alongside the Bitter Chocolate Kit Kats --I haven't tried those yet, so I didn't want to risk it (they're not cheap!)  I'll wait until Suzy lets me try hers.
