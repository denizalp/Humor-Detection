I just stopped in late night for a quick beer once we arrived in the Phoenix area. It was 10pm and the place wasn't too busy. Was able to score a seat at the bar and was served quickly by the attentive bartender. \nIt was close to our hotel and arena\/Chase FIeld so a nice spot to meet friends for pre-game drink. I cannot comment on the food as I did not try it but it seems like the typical pub menu (burgers\/sandwiches).
