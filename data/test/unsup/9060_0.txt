Went for lunch late Friday afternoon and sat at the patio.  Pretty, but it took 45 minutes to get 3 sandwiches and it's not like it was crowded.  My daughter wanted a vanilla milkshake but they had no vanilla ice cream. The quality of the food was good but portions were small for the price.  Even if a restaurant is new they need to have their act together from the start.  Not planning to rush back there.
