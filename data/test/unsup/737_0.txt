I lived in Newmarket for two and a half years and Sushi Jun became my go-to place for Friday evening takeout sushi. The food is great, the prices are very reasonable, the staff are super friendly. There is some seating for dining in and it's right on the charming part of Main St. near the water feature\/skating rink, the farmer's market, and the former town hall. So super well situated, great good, it's a fantastic little place.
