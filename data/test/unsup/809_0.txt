Great Show! Nathan appeared on the show America got talent, he got 2 beautiful assistant, very entertaining, and the sound system is perfect. There's a photographer \nGoing to greet you before you fall in line and take picture of you, you can get it after the show if you want, and not bad for $20 it includes a DVD of his show. Inside the show you can\nOrder stuff we only ordered soda. My over all experience is great.
