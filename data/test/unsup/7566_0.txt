I've got roots in Louisiana (but I don't hold 'LouisianaStyle\" restaurants outside of Louisiana to the same standard)... That said... These ppl should be shut down for claiming to be a NOLA style restaurant. On top of that, the service left a lot to be desired. Not my favorite experience of the year.
