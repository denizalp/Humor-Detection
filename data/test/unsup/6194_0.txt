Hopefully this place is a money laundering front because they know nothing about tires and even less about customer service. I was told after dropping my car 2 hours before closing that my transaction would have to be cash only and I wasn't given an explanation. This place has a work release program vibe to it.Save your money and time and drive to discount tires on Flamingo.
