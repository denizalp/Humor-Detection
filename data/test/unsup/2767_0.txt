Love it! Splurge on the 7 course tasting menu. I'm a vegetarian, and it was just as delicious! I have never tasted a better meal. Treat Yourself!!!! \nThe only thing I did not care for was the dessert course. I think it was mochi. The sorbet on the inside was delicious, but the mochi was tasteless: clever, but the glutinous \"skin\" was not needed. It tasted odd and gummy. My husband liked it though!
