Just need to use their wifi....\n\nBought the Mac Junior with free soda deal...it was over three dollars...the soda is worth only $1... the Mac Junior is not worth over $2...single patty with shredded lettuce and thousands island dressing only....\n\nThe Mac Junior tasted like all other Mc Donald hamburger...the bun tastes like card board, and the patty has no beef flavor. \n\nA total rip off!
