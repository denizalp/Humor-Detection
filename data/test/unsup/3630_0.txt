I was so happy to finally order from Bobbie's Flowers after hearing so many great things! I ordered two floral arrangements for a styled shoot I had planned and not only were they absolutely stunning arrangements, Paula and Chelsea opened the shop on their day off for me to come pick them up to work with my schedule. Bobbie's does beautiful work and has the best customer service, I would highly recommend them to anyone for their floral needs!
