Hair stylist royalty, Alta Moda Hair consists of Canada's preeminent hair professionals who have won multiple competitions and are true innovators in their craft. Ricardo and his brother Dave are truly creative in the way they style hair. With influences from Italy (south), the family of hair stylists offer modern looks and efficient service. As a matter of fact they were also written up in Macleans Magazine (February 13, 2006) - a first in the industry. I have only the highest praise for Alta Moda. I strongly encourage you to try their services.
