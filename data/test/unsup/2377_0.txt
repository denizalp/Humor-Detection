Stopped in and purchased 6 cupcakes, girl behind counter not friendly at all seemed like a struggle to say hello to me. I normally don't go out of my way to review bakeries but with so many bakeries that sell cupcakes only these were so so and were recommanded to me by a frequent customer of the shop. Advise be pleasant to your customers, if you are only nice to the ones you know it's not good for your business when your cupcakes are average and nothing I couldn't get at your competition.
