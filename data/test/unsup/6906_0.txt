It had been a while since I dined at any Outback Steakhouse. Our experience this evening was superb! Our waiter, Cloid, was terrific. I ordered Prime Rib and my wife ordered some coconut shrimp and a salad. Everything was prepared well, tasted great, the service was stellar and the atmosphere was fun.
