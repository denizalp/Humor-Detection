Thursday night, no children and not many people here. There was only one bar open, it was the middle bar. The waiter sucked, he sat a punched numbers in screen while we waited for drinks. It seemed like he was on drugs. It's 2017, and most bar tenders are junkies! Then went to the bathroom and it was filthy. I'll go else where next time. Not work it! This place has gone down hill hence the reviews. I'll stay in south end where customer service and staying clean is of importance.
