Unable to tune my car with ethanol said car had issues. Brought it back with 91 and said my car has issues again. Prior tuning shop had no issues before, took it back to the prior shop where it was able to be tuned with no issues. Paid $500 and got excuses and broken promises. Travis is a great person, think he has the heart but is to inexperienced at tuning.
