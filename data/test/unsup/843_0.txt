My daughter is visiting from a place where they do not have Jersey Mike's and so she made a special request. Easy enough, this restaurant is clean and bright and has plenty of parking, as it's one of the out-buildings from the nearby Harris Teeter.\n\nInside, the same JM menu and setup. We ordered our sandwiches \"Mike's Way\" which comes with lettuce and tomato and salt and pepper and oil and vinegar. It gets a little messy but it's tasty.\n\nThey have a soda fountain and a selection of chips.
