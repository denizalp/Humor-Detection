I asked for a Polish Girl and I received. I ate the whole motherf***er. I was full after I ate and delighted in the schmaltzy dialogue among two gentleman escapading from their work at Key Bank. I farted quietly and smiled.\n\nThe wait was not long. I was seated at the bar in short time with timely service for my pints of Samuel Smith. It was at the bar among the crowd alone I sat and farted among these people.
