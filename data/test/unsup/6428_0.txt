What has the world done to the people in this place to make them hate life as they do?  And why does that translate to the mediocre food?  \n\nYou can do better for pizza.  Hell, practically across the street from this place is Salvatore's.  You'll spend a bit more, but it'll be worth it.\n\nThis place slaps grease and cheese on cardboard, wraps it cardboard, and hands it to you with a look on their face that plainly says, \"I should have listened to my teachers in high school.\"
