Don't go there and expect customer service.  Showed up on a Monday,  they had one customer and they wouldn't open the patio bar windows so we could sit on the patio.  Had to order my food to go and they never even bothered to ask if i wanted anything to drink while I'm waiting.  So glad their comfort was more important then a paying client.
