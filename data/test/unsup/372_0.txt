Was wanting a burger and thanks to yelp discovered Giant burger. The woman behind the register, who also cooks your food, is super friendly! The burgers are exactly what they say, GIANT. Packed with yummy deliciousness. Fries are yummy too. We were satisfied, would come back but it is out of our way. Hope we're in the neighborhood again.
