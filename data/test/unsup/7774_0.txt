Don't enter if you are expecting big portions and a low price. This is special dining experience serving up great tasting dishes prepared with Love and High quality ingredients. In fact, small portions and high price, but what the heck, you're in Vegas and sometimes you need to treat yourself to a special dining experience. I sat at the Bar and had the Duck Tacos and EBI, Great tasting and well worth the money, Bartender Jeffrey M. served up some great cocktails and was most friendly and made the visit memorable. Will come again next time in Vegas.
