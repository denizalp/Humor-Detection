Just ate here, and must say, it was truly what I wanted. Mom n Pop Thai joints always have that feel and taste that other Thai places dont. \n\nPros:\n-Great service\n-Most meals under $10\n-Great portions, even my Beef Curry had a steak full of protein!\n\nCons:\n-small place, could hear every other conversation in the room lol.
