I love the thin crust classic signature.  So does my mom.  My husband thinks the sauce is too sweet...but his opinion doesn't really count.\n\nI tried the antipasto with the house italian.  pretty decent salad for a pizza joint!\n\nWe ordered online and picked it up...I am always a fan of not having to call and place an order.  I have an aversion to talking on the phone.  I have no idea why.
