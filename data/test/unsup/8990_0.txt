Stopped in while traveling in the area.  Had been there in the past and food was decent.  Heard rumors about the staff.  Well, rumors are true.\nThe servers pay attention to the older regulars and barely say hello to anyone new.  I get better service at ihop or dennys in the middle of the morning.  I don't expect @#$% service at 9AM.  Then the owner spends more time talking to the older regulars.   I give it a two as the food was \"ok\"\nNext time I'm in cleveland - I'll pass
