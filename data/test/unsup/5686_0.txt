I have been seen by Dr. Karin Machnau, Dermatologist and Dr Clay Forsberg, Plastic Surgeon on several occasions due to a cyst on my back which has now been removed by an excellent surgeon!! Each visit I was given wonderful attention to my questions, any concerns were thoroughly explained. Both docs were kind, caring, skillful and very knowledgeable. The office staff was professional and helpful at each visit. I highly recommend this medical practice! Don't look any further schedule an appointment here.
