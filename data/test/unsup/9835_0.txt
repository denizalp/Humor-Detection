I really want to love The Montauk, cute atmosphere, fun drinks and great vibe. But the service really needs work. Service today was so slow, bar tenders couldn't get drinks right. Our waitress was so nice, but to get the table cleaned and water was the longest I have ever seen. Please take the time to do better service. I want to love you and spend money here but it so hard to. Make the Montauk as great as the real Montauk in New York, please stop disgracing the name.
