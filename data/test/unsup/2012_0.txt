Very friendly staff and helpful with the samples. We rolled in from California and rolled out with the ghost pepper cheddar and the haba√±ero cheddar along with some applewood smoked garlic cheddar. The selection here is good covering almost the entire cheese spectrum so if you can't find it at Ehlenbach's it probably doesn't exist.
