This food is pathetic we came late night and the meat is cold and the service is super bad.. the owner before was better the meat tasted like rotten rat meat from thanksgiving. I'm sorry please close down and don't try this.. she served me plastic meat no cheese no sauce no nothing.. why couldn't you tell me before I ordered . Waste of money this place should re consider what they sell and change the menu to Cat meat or Rat meat.. pathetic !!
