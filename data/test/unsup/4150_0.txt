Excellent Filipino Food and Filipino Hospitality at its best! What a great luck for me to find this Filipino restaurant in Las Vegas. The Lechon Belly is just done so perfect and soooo crispyyyyy!!!  The service was impecable and the food was delicious...  Friendly and funny staff! Highly recommended.
