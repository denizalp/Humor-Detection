Brunch review :\n\nTrendy place with fun crowd, good music and cool atmosphere. Service is fine as well. \n\nFood is good, our plates where a little cold but generally the food was good. If you're here for the bottomless mimosas you better like orange juice. I would t recommend this option whatsoever. \n\nHappy to have tried it out once.
