Nice patio up in the mountains with a view of the Scottsdale area.  Several fire pits for you to sit around and relax.  Choice of Dinner inside\/out.  I was there on a company function and there was a set dinner menu.  The food was respectable, but not memorable.  If you looking for a nice romantic night out with view of the Scottsdale skyline this is the place.
