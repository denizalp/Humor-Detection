Another sports bar where I am ignored. However this time there was no one else there. Also how does a sports bar have bad ESPN reception?  Seems like that should be THE channel that always works.  3 stars because I did like the food.  Good southwest chicken wrap.  Good nachos, made with real cheese.  So I guess if I want to go to a sports bar, eat decent food, and be left alone then I will be back.
