A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  This seems to be consistent from visit to visit.  They have great tasting hot dogs and brats with a wide variety of toppings all for about $6 to $7 per dog.\n\nI would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.\n\nWhen you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!\n\nEnjoy!
