Average tasting Hawaiian food. But it's casual, quick, and affordable. \nMy favs are the seafood mix combo, and the teriyaki meat combo. \nI also like the spam Musubi (without sauce), and the macaroni salad. If you like juice, then try the Hawaiian sun canned juices.\n\nIf you get the chicken Katsu make sure you try the Katsu sauce- it is nothing like you've ever tasted!
