Must be one of the busiest Walgreens in the country.  Terrific location on the Las Vegas Strip.  There were dozens of patrons milling about the store.  Plenty more lined up to be helped at one of their many manned registers.  Line went very quickly like a well oiled machine.\n\nPrices were fair considering they are located at the heart of the Strip.  Service we experienced was good too.  No complaints from me.
