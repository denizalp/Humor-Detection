Kensington Market is one of the coolest places I've visited so far. The whole street is filled with different types of cuisines, from vegan\/vegetarian to bakeries to different types of ice creams. I can honestly say that I tried things I wouldn't have if I hasn't stayed here and the atmosphere of the neighborhood is just awesome. There's a lot of art around Kensington like the old car with plants growing out of it or the graffitied walls. \nOverall it's a really interesting place with various types of stores and definitely a must see!
