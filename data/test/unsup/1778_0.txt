Not a bad Micky D's visit but not necessarily anything positive to say unlike recent visits to several other locations where the service or food quality stood out. Conversely, here the service, while not poor, was remarkably ordinary. As for the food, my fries were a little wilted and the container was about 3\/4 full.
