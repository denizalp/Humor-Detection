Kinda sad now. I ordered huevos rancheros smothered green and I got a plate full of beans pretty much with green chili thrown on top of the beans and eggs on top of that. They said that they dont do the green chili sauce. How can you call yourself a NM restaurant with no green chili sauce?  Looks like I will be taking the drive to Carlitos from now on!!\"
