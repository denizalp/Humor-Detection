Our first day in Toronto and we came to this Restaurant, it reminded us to our San Francisco Hayes and Ashbury neighborhood, the service was really nice, food was amazing, we had the Hungarian Schnitzel, Chestnut Chicken and Green Curry Chicken and all the dishes were fantastic... will def be back...
