Seriously good authentic jeero at a reasonable price, with huge portions. The only way I shovelled that whole jeero dinner in my face was by not having eaten anything for lunch. \n\nThey are quick and friendly, the tzatziki is awesomely garlicky, and thick. The portions are huge, which is great because this stuff is amazing to the taste buds. My personal preference was the chicken over the pork, but both are good and juicy. The roasted potatoes are nice, the sauce was delicious, and I liked that they threw extra on to the rice.
