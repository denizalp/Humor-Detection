I love this place for breakfast. The menage a trois breakfast deal is enough food for the whole day and it's only $4.95 and coffee is included. Try the cinnamon coffee while you are here. I've been coming here for hears and the staff is always friendly the atmosphere is eclectic and the good is great. The lunch time pizzas are always worth the trip if you are in the are ready for lunch time. My family and I love this place on an early Saturday morning and we drive in from the suburbs just to eat here.
