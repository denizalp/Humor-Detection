I got the chicken piccata with mushrooms and capers in pasta from the lunch section, delicious! Great and decent portion. Just like Cheesecake Factory but better because it's Vegas and the service is usually always good.\n\nGood for groups or eating alone. They have a lunch buffet but I never did it.
