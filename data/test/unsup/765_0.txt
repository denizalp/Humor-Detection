This guy deserves 0 stars!  Needs to be reported to the BBB for sure. Took $1000 from me and NEVER delivered on his promises. His pants are surely on fire!\n\nDavid, I already have an attorney. It's YOU who should be worried. A dishonest company that doesn't even have me on file shows how inept you are. And how low you stoop to counter my review shows your professionalism. I'm still waiting for the Tempe police. Just one of your fake promises. Feed fake news to someone else and never underestimate my intelligence or determination.
