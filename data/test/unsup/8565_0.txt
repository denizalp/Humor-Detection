Great place to eat.  Service was also very good.  Our waitress checked on us often to ensure we had what we needed.\n\nWe got the bento dinner which was great as well as the BBQ pork sushi roll which we were hesitant about but it was GREAT!  Certainly recommend this place for good and good service.
