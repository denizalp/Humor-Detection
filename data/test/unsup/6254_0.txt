Once you land at McCarran Int'l you know you're in Vegas. The amounts of slot machines and the strange dry smell is probably their trademark, their C19 gate is always oddly hotter than the rest of the gates adjacent to it.\n\nThe service is quick here and everything is easy to find. The shops and restaurants are just okay. It's too hard to concentrate on food when the sounds of slots are constantly going you off to draw you in.
