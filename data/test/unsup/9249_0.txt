Not really worth the wait. Food was okay, could of fit the same at IHop. For a place to be called \"BabyStacks\" the Pancakes were less than average. They have a whole menu of different pancake flavored but it's all fluff. Service was okay nothing exceptional. Overpriced for the portion size you get. $10.95 plate came put like a kids menu item.
