Local outdoor store with a small selection of clothes and gear. The selection for rock climbing gear was very limited. The store was clean and well organized. Prices were on par with MSRP. So, why two stars? Well, I don't particularly care for being followed around by employees as I peruse the store. I'll take my business elsewhere.
