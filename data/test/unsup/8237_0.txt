This place just opened last Monday. It's an EAYC Korean restaurant but they have a limit on the shrimps. 3 orders per table and there's only 2 shrimps per order. It was such a joke! The servers were slow and we constantly had  to follow up and wait for the meat to come. I am definitely never gonna come back.
