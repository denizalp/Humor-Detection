This is definitely not a gaming bar.  My husband and I played more than enough to have our drinks comped at ANY other place in town. But they still charge us for our drinks.  When we discussed this with the manger, Stephanie. She changed the story multiples time with excuses of why we where being charged, including she couldn't see our play. She reluctantly agreed to take one beer off and when she came back with our check it was still on there.  Stephanie's policy is clearly that the customer is always wrong. Beautiful bar, terrible customer service.
