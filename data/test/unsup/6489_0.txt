The food is ok as expected. The service here is poor. We had to wait 30 minutes for water and bread. Extremely pretentious for a Vegas hotel diner where you expect hospitality to be number 1 on the priority list. The buffet next door is a much better option and for a party of 12 was about 80 bucks less.
