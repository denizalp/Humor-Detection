Just checking in takes forever. One person checking people in two others standing behind the counter doing nothing. One of them obviously a manager. I guess manager at Brunswick means do nothing. At our lanes dirty dishes stacked up at most of the tables and nobody cleaning anything. Bowled for 20 min and not once did a server come by to take an order. If you want to just bowl go somewhere else.  We went on a Sunday at noon. Not even that busy they just don't know how to give any service.  The place is very understaffed.
