Shawn is great: I had a massage with him last night and it's true: I am not sore today, and the pain in the shoulders from dragging luggage at the airport is gone.\nHe is very professional, punctual, efficient and nice.  I hope I'll have another treatment before I leave, otherwise I will book him on my next visit. His rates are very reasonable and the massage proved effective.
