Heard this place has the best burger in Las Vegas. So I had to try it. It surely did not disappoint...although I havn't had many burger in Vegas before. It comes with fries and basically is everything you want a burger to be. Got the lettuce, tomatoes, sizzauce, onions and yo uget to choose how to want the meat. Rare right?! \n\nI think one thing you MUST try it you come here are the shakes. These might be one of the best shakes I've ever had.\n\nYou should definitely check out when you go at least once...or twice
