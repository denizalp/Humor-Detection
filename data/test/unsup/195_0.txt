I always think of that woman-shaped syrup bottle when I come here.  I think her name was Mrs. Butterworth?  \n\nAnyways, this is a delicious breakfast spot!  They serve up all the tasty morning classics, like pancakes, belgian waffles, eggs, omelets, etc. But they also offer slight variations by making them with fresh fruit.  \n\nThe portions are huge too, so you'll probably end up with leftovers.  It gets pretty busy in there on the weekends, so you might end up waiting 20 minutes or so.  \n\nIf you've been wanting to try a new breakfast spot, this is it!
