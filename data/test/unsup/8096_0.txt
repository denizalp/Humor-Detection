Awful customer service, an employee named SOMA rung items through, purposely giving us a hard time for coupons that were being used,  rolling eyes, scoffing, then scanned the same items twice. Went back to tell the manager that items were being scanned twice, and she came back to accuse us of lying.  Left the store, paying for items that we did not buy and will never return again.  Terrible!!
