GREAT place to bring your more mature friends and play the \"I'm So Edumcated I'm Sophisticated, Let's Wax Philosophical\" Drinking Game where you can talk about politics or recycling over a few drinks. Love the location and the atmosphere (no young males who just turned 21 and are all  annoyingly wearing the same button down shirt in different colors).  Pretty awesome beer selection.  Pretty awesome staff.  Pretty awesome crowd.
