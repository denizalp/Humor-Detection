If you go on a weekend when there is a big act, they over-sell the place. It is SOOOO packed and the security guys are total dicks. We couldn't even see the stage. Were forced to just hang out outside most of the time. This place, unfortunately, is far too popular for it's size and you will be battling people for space and drinks alllll niiittteee. Go somewhere else where you can actually have fun.
