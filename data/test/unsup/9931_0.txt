* Good dan tat *\n\nI live in Vancouver - what is billed as the mecca of Chinese food in North America, and continually search for a good dan tat:  http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/list\/the-quest-for-the-perfect-egg-tart-vancouver\n\nBut I have to say this was a damn good dan tat.  This little bakery appropriately tucked under an HSBC in a small mall offered them up fresh from the oven so the custard was still nice and warm and surrounded by a flaky crust.  The custard was the lighter type - a bit light on the eggs, but very tasty.  I enjoyed this little unexpected treat in Calgary!\nPhoto:  http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/diamond-bakery-calgary?select=LDI5p_7drmeOfesQF7jmCg#dwv5A6o1VTxd4VmFL2zAZQ
