This one is an easy one for me.  A solid meh.  \n\nThe Burger itself is so so.  A little overpriced in my opinion.  It's not great, it's not bad.  It just is.  The fries were either too soggy or too crunchy.  Complinetary peanuts do nothing for me unless I am at a bar.  The decor is pretty cheesy.  White with red accents and the music is too loud.  I could barely hear my number being called.  \n\nAll in all I wish a Fatburger had gone into this location instead.
