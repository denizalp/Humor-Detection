I was very pleased with the services and facilities at this Hampton Inn location. The staff is professional and friendly. The room was gorgeous with a big picture window to watch the snowflakes go by. \n\nThe  hot breakfast is tasty and convenient. So nice that it runs until 10 am. \n\nThe tv and internet was wonderful. \n\nI have no complaints
