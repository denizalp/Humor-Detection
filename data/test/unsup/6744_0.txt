China Max,  they get me with the samples every time.  I had the salt and pepper shrimp two pieces for a dollar!!! The shrimp was huge not particularly peppery but tasty none the less. \n\nMy kid sister was not pleased with her General Tso's it was bland and gummy and the lo mien noodles that she got with it were drier than the Sierra desert.
