We were looking for a place to chill. We had been at the Arts Festival and we were heading to the Pirate game. This place was perfect. They had a great selection of beers.  They had a few beers that we had not tried before. It's always fun to try new beers. Plus it was across the street from PNC park. Our server (who looked 12 LOL) was super nice. He even showed me where I could plug my phone in to charge while we were hanging out there. It's definitely a fun and relaxing place.
