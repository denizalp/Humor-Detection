This is my preferred Giant Eagle, even though it is 15 miles from my house. I make the trek here because it never overcrowds, the cashiers know what they're doing, and I can always find the GE brand whole wheat bagels my wife likes (surprisingly, they're not ubiquitous across the chain). Also, the produce is generally superior to the stuff found in city stores. If I'm going to shop at GE, this is probably the best one in the area.
