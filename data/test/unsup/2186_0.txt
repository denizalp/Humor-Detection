Came here because it was part of our pre-theater dinner package with \"O\" (which, by the way, was breathtaking!). 3 course pre-fixed meal - I had the soup served inside a coconut shell, ribeye, and finished with raspberry cheesecake. I'll say the most memorable dish was the soup. The restaurant was fairly empty when we were seated, which can't ever be a good sign. Didn't stick around long enough to see if it filled up afterwards. It's cool to try once, but I don't think I'll be back.
