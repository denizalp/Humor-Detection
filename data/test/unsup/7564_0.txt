Great at first. Bought the one smile plan for discounted services. Then had to wait 30 days to get tooth pulled. During that period I called numerous times to get antibiotics. They said they called it in. Went to Walmart numerous times and they had no prescription. I gave up after numerous messages left unreturned. Finally today I get the tooth pulled. I was told at first visit 128.00 with the plan. But today I show up for appt and it is now 400.00!! Never again.
