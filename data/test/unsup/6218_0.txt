I've been wanting to go to Hank's for the longest time, and I finally made it down one day. I had heard great things about the place and I'm happy to say that everything I had heard was true. The staff were amazingly friendly and the service was quick. I ordered the pulled-pork sammy - it was alright, not great. The place was kind of empty for the lunch hour, but it was nice to be able to sit and enjoy a book without loud conversation. I would definitely go again!
