This place was AMAZING !  The Micheladas were fantastic, along with everything else we ordered.  The Langostinos were on point, ceviche was fresh, & the soup hit the spot!  They even made us the bread we were craving to order :D  I wish i lived here to go to this restaurant all the time.  I haven't found any good Mariscos where I live now, so it was especially sweet to find this place on vacation.  Will go here every time I'm in Vegas !!
