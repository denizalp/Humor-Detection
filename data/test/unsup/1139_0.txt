What is it they don't understand about turndown service? We asked them two nights in a row and both nights they did not provide any service. Perhaps their day ends earlier.\nWe have stayed at many resorts like Aria or MGM and never encountered this problem. ENCORE just doesn't give  a damn. Stay elsewhere
