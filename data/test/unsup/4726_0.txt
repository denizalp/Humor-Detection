Ah yes, American sushi.    White, frat boy sushi chefs.   The server was under 21 so her friend had to drop off the drinks as she followed here to the table.\n\nIt's an alright place, not bad for ASU but that's where the buck stops. The asparagus app. was good. The rolls were good.  We didn't get sick, good.\n\n\nSmoking hot Asian hostess..... arrrrrrrr...............
