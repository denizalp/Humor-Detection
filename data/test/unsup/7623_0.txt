Come for the delicious,  mouth-watering shawarma and delicately seasoned hummus, enjoy a masterfully prepared hookah, but stay, and return, for the love.   I adore hookah, but I'm very sensitive to loud music and distracted by the prevalence of sports television(a pox on them!) Guy, ever the gentleman, turned down the music for me and even turned off the TV, just so I could have a pleasant experience!  There aren't many hookah lounges in Vegas open in the afternoon, which all makes Layla Grill & Hookah a treasure!   Please, check them out!  You will not be dissapointed.
