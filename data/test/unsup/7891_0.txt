Some of the best gas in town for a reasonable price. They offer two grades, the cheap stuff and the super. Usually long lines but with what you save at the pump here you can splurge inside Costco. They used to only accept debit or your Costco Amex but now they accept any Visa credit card...very convenient. I just filled my wife's car at a local Terrible's Herbst for $3.28 a gallon and here the same grade was only $2.97 a gallon! GET YOUR FILL UP ON!
