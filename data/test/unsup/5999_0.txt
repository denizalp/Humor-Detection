Everything was mediocre to below average. With so many other area options like Corbin's, Timo and North Mountain Brewing there is no reason for me to ever go back to Spoke and Wheel. It is too bad since I always hope a good restaurant will open in this building. None have lasted long so it may be the layout or location. They should level it and start from scratch.
