Me and my mother had our eyebrows threaded. We were both happy with the results. Our eyebrows were not in good shape because of plucking but the lady ( I wish I got her name) was able to clean them up and make them look nice. She said to try not to pluck them and come back in 2 to 3 weeks. We are impressed with the service here.
