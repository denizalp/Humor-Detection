Cora did some major alterations to my wedding dress and I wouldn't have trust anyone else with the job. She was absolutely amazing and went above and beyond with everything. Her &a Eric were so sweet and helpful and accommodating through the entire process. I couldn't be more grateful and my dress fit me like a glove!!!
