nice & clean jamba juice establishment with quick service.  although i love fruit smoothies- i don't make it a regular stop for me because it can get kinda spendy for a drink that i can make at home and add protein powder.  i've been here twice this month, once after working out in the morning and not having time to make breakfast and once because I was craving one.
