So I went to The Nosh today. The service was very slow and the girl who took my order was very rude to not only me, but also her coworkers. People who came in after us got their food faster and it has taken over 40 minutes just to make a bagel and a side of bacon. I am very unimpressed with this restaurant and will not be coming back.
