We found this restaurant via Yelp - excellent discovery! This restaurant is a part of a chain started in California in 2012 AD. As of this writing they are expanding rapidly; they have over 200 locations.\n\nThe concept is quite similar to MOD Pizza, except, they don't serve beer and they have three different crusts you can choose from. We ordered the thin crust and it was perfect!\n\nThe inside of the restaurant was clean; the staff was helpful and friendly. The price was decent and the portions were ample.\n\nI would recommend this place to family and friends!
