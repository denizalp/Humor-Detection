Worst experience ever!\nThe only positive that came from this was being referred to a wonderful clinic where my treatments are of no charge to me. After speaking to ALL the medical professionals that I deal with at several hospitals and facilities in Toronto about my experience at ToCa (during my time there & after); I was referred to a great facility. No more leaving this joint in tears!\nBye Felicia!!!!
