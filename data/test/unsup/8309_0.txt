So awesome! At first I was like, I don't feel like baking my pizza...and we almost went somewhere else. Then I decided how much fresher Papa murphy's (I really want to call it Papa Smurf's) would be.\n\nThere were a bunch of people in there and our pizza was put together fast and it was not sloppy at all. It was perfect. The employees were very helpful and nice. \n\nSo glad we found this spot, thanks to Yelp!!!
