Maha's makes fresh Lebanese-style falafel to order in their stall, and is a perfect snack to enjoy while walking around and shopping at West Side Market. Those little balls are always hot and delicious! Strangely, the hummus and baba seem to be the same quality as the mass-produced supermarket stuff, which is extremely disappointing, but not enough of a problem to deter me from visiting. Pita is just ok. Skip the platter or sandwich and just get plain falafel with tahina for dipping. You won't regret it!
