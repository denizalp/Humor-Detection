This place reminded me of the food courts back home where they serve lots of Asian cuisine, and it was a nice try.  We love cha giao and they have it on the meny for $4.95, so we orderd 2 and waited about 10 minutes for our food.  They come out hot and crispy, served only with romaine lettuce leaves, pickled carrot and radish, and their fish sauce.  It was pretty tasty and a great way to satisfy that cha giao craving on the cheap.
