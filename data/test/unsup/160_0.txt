As a Californian, were spoiled with the best boba drinks made with real ingredients. \n\nPerfect Scoop is a shame in the boba business. They use powder ingredients instead of real fruits, teas, etc. I give their boba drinks a Zero star. They should just stop selling them.\n\nNow for their ice cream. It's good but not great and definitely way better than their boba drinks. \n\nOverall, I think this place should just concentrate on selling ice cream and abolish their boba drinks. Don't ever order their drinks if you don't want to be disappointed.
