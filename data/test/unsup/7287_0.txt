Clever name, perfect for snagging unsuspecting tourists. Nice patio, ideal for passing the time waiting for a server to acknowledge your existence or for anything from the slow kitchen. Ideal Old Town location, one block from the hospital. A fitting neighbor for the home of the worst tacos in town. The $2 (stale) chips and (strangely oily) salsa are a perfect complement to anything on the overpriced menu.
