If you haven't been to Triptych yet, you are missing out. This place has some of the best craft beers I've ever tasted, and I have been to my fair share of craft breweries.  Come here for a flight, find something you love, and take home a crowler, which is a huge can of beer filled right from the tap.\n\nThey don't have food, but feel free to bring in something and eat with friends while tasting delicious beers.  Also, no TV so you may have to talk with your friends.
