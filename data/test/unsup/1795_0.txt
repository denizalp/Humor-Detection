The eggplant kibbeh was impressive! I've always wanted to say that! \n- Just kidding. I had no idea what kibbeh was until I tried it here... I'm pleased to say that I'm now a big fan!\n\nByblos was easily the most interesting restaurant and offered the highest quality food we ate during our 1-week stay in Toronto.\n\nThe meal was certainly on the pricey side, but even at these prices I considered the experience to be a good value.  If you want something a bit special... a bit extraordinary... I highly encourage you to try Byblos.
