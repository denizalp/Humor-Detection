Blue Nile Cafe is located in a little strip mall and the prices are pretty reasonable.  This is definitely a great spot for vegetarians or anyone that likes Ethiopian food.\n\nI usually alternate between two dishes when I eat there- I've had the Suro Watt, which is chickpeas in some kind of sauce (really good) and Begerdan, eggplant with bell peppers.  I recommend them both.\n\nIf you've never had Ethiopian food, don't be afraid to try something new, you'll be glad you did.
