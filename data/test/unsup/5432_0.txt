I have been chatting with someone on their Facebook page and he was the most accommodating person I have ever met. He was willing to open Christmas Day for my group but we opted for Christmas Eve - even though they are supposed to be closed. The best customer service I have ever received from an establishment!! Seriously a MUST TRY!
