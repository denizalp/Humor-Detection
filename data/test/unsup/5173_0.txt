Considering how douche-y it could be, it's really not that douche-y.\n\nDrinks are expensive but prepared right. Service is good. The seating is comfortable and the atmosphere relaxing. \n\nNote to the single guys wearing chin-strap beards and Affliction t-shirts while looking nervous and sitting at tables alone and not approaching women: Try \"Hello\" or \"Nice outfit\" or \"Those martinis are great, aren't they?\" or something. I'm old and fat and dress like I'm teaching a fishing class, but I'm not afraid of girls. Just talk to them like they are people.
