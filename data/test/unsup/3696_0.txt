It's always been okay Thai food (not the best) but unfortunately I had the experience of finding a bug in the curry tonight. Well, my boyfriend found it. His face suddenly turned to disgust and when I looked at his plate no mistakenly was a pretty long leg of what looked like a cricket. There was no denying it because it was still attached to the pelvic region of the insect. I'm a pretty forgiving person but that's incredibly unsanitary. Makes me worry about what goes on back there.
