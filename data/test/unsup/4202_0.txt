This place deserves less than 1 star.  Where to start.... Filthy lockeroom and bathrooms.  Smelly and overflowing trash, usually missing soap and paper towels.  \nWeight room is never cleaned up and weights are left all over the place. \nEquipment frequently broken.\nThe icing on the cake is they recently commandeered a large portion of the gym for \"personal training only\" which has new equipment of course, and NEVER being used.  I guess you don't get any sort of services here for the monthly membership rate, so they try to con you into some crappy training packages.
