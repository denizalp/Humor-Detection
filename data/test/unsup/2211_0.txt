I'm not really a fan of BMV.  The staff are not helpful AT ALL and I find it peculiar that they have all these books that are supposedly \"used\" but in fact look brand new.   Remember the guy who had all the bikes for super dirt cheap and they turned out to be stolen goods?  I'm just saying that when something is too good to be true, someone is paying for it.  Also, they only take cash which is inconvenient.
