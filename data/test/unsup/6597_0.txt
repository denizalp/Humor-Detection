Great staff, great drink menu. Joke food. Joke atmosphere. On a Saturday night this place is so packed that it's a fire hazard. Only entrance\/exit I saw was through the back. Owner hunches over in the corner and stares at you. I feel sorry for the people that have to tolerate this as a work environment. Store your foods\/liquids properly and not in mason jars. Thanks.
