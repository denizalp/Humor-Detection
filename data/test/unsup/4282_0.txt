It has been a long time since I have happened on OMGrill.  Short line and it moved fast.  Didn't take to long to get my order.  Had the Usual - a grilled cheese with buffalo chicken breast and jack and cheddar cheese and a side of dipping sauce.  The sandwich was good, the buffalo chicken breast had a nice buffalo flavor and the cheese was a good compliment.  Really enjoyed the dipping sauce.  Had a side of Dirty potato chips.
