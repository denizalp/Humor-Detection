Adorable! All who know me know I love a good home wear store. Those fabulous little boutiques that have the coolest gifts, the chicest finds, the most adorable kids \"krap\" (for those of us who don't have kids to give to those who do!), custom jewelry, and ultra unique finds... well, Steeling Home has it all! And I especially love that they have really cool gifts that can only be described as Canadiana at its finest! And if you don't know what I mean, just take a wander through this shop - you will then :)
