These guys fixed my machine today. they gave me a warranty. From the plaques on their walls you can tell they have been around since the mac was a mac back in the day. Their place looks like 30 years of learning the machines, the problems and the business of it. I won't go anywhere else and you shouldn't either. \n\nTrustworthy, freely supplied me with the info I needed. I won't be ever replacing century 23. Thanks guys!
