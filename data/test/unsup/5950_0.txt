The staff here is always very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, they run out of things very quickly. Today they were out of bagels, regular cream cheese, and coffee stoppers before 11 am. It's never fun finding out AFTER you order and pay for something that it's unavailable. I wish their stock was as consistent as their service, but I'm not going in there for the service.
