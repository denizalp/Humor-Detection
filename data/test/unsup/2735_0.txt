Do not go here! These ladies are rude and unprofessional, they do not know anything about taking care of natural hair. their weaves are mediocre and they charge you 25$ for every little thing on top of the fact that they tell you that your hair will only be sixty dollars and you'll walk out paying 175.00. Just stay away, you're better going off to somebody's kitchen salon !
