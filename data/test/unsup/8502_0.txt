There was nothing bad to say about panera bread. Everyone loves panera bread, but now that they stopped carrying country bread and large loaves of rye bread, maybe they should rename their store panera sandwiches. I loved their bread and while they do still carry white wheat and sourdough bread, I can go to any grocery store for that. Their bakery is yummy though. I am dissapointed because I like to make my own sandwhiches and pile on the luncmeat but with good bread. Sorry panera. Call me dissapointed.
