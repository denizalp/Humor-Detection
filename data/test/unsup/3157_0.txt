Im not a fan of Chinese, my husband is the main reason we order Chinese food. Moving out here from Jersey City, NJ you've got pretty big shoes to fill in the Chinese food department but they've got it covered hands down. The chicken fried rice, crab rangoons and wonton soup is my fav. My husband and daughter LOVE the wings. I took away a star for price. Just a tad pricey but for good food I would pay. I also took away a star because they dont have crab sticks LOL man I miss that.
