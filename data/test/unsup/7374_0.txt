I have been to Leroy Foxes a couple times as it is really close by. Each time I have had very good food. I would say the sides are probably my favorite. The Zucchini fries, Mac and cheese, vegetable medley, it is all very good. On one occasion I became fixated on the pretzel brownie, I had to try it. It was worth every bite! A fun place to go with friends for some true southern food and drinks!
