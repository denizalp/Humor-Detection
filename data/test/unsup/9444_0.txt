I know this might sound weird and I cannot explain why I feel so strongly about this, but Urban Kitchen has the best dang chicken fingers I've ever tasted in my life. Those babies are moist and juicy, seasoned well and have the perfect amount of crunchy breading on the outside, making it a dish like Goldilocks' - just right in every way. I've tried some of their Egyptian menu items, as well, which were also tasty, but keep going back for the amazing chicken tenders. They get five stars for these alone.
