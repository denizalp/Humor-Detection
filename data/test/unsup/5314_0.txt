I took my sister here when she came to visit and we had such a good time. I got free tix from the seat fillers website so that was nice. But if I had paid I would have been equally happy. Its a good show.\nThey sat us right down in the front booth..we had the best table\/seats in the place for sure.\nSis bought a round of drinks and they were nice and strong and the server was very nice.\nThey sell a pic of your party when you enter for 10 bucks..of course my sister had to buy it.
