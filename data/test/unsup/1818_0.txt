Francis is awesome! She always gets me in and fixes my self trims. L\n Her hair color doesn't fade, and I always love the cut.\n She had to repair a job recently and always does it with a smile. She always offers me the Groupon price I came in for originally, too. Less than half if what some salons charge!\n The salon is nice and clean, and offers many services. Nails, hair, etc.\n Call Francis, and book today!
