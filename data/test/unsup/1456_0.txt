Maybe it was my long day of travel that got me disoriented, but I couldn't find my way out of the airport when I arrived! I felt like I was wandering around on the lower levels trying to get to the street and was thrown for a loop when confronted with that super-speedy tram. \n\nStaff was friendly and the facility was clean.\n\nIt's an OK airport. You fly in and fly out. Nothing can touch PDX!
