I enjoyed the free parking. This is an average casino. I am at casinos for the buffets, mainly. The buffet here is just average, for about an average price. I do like that they have stations for different types of cuisine (American, Asian, etc.) \n\nCuriously enough, the jalapeno pizza was the best thing there. I tried a bit of most of the menu items.\n\nIt is a quieter place than downtown Las Vegas and I enjoyed that too during Casino GamePlay.
