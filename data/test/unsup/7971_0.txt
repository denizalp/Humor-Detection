I have to say I really like Quik Trips for Gasoline needs. They are usally always cheaper than the other local stations for starters.\nIt is clean, inside and outside, and the peeps that work there work really hard\/ They are always friendly and helpful.\nThey keep the food and drink area nice and clean.\nWhat I don't like is the last few times I was there ,I am always being asked for $$ by pan handlers.\n This is not the fault of the station. I am just so sick of people asking me for money.
