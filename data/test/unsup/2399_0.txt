I went here for a happy hour with some coworkers, and it was so much fun. The atmosphere was great, the service was top-notch and the food\/drinks were amazing. I had a couple of different drinks, and 2 of them did me in (very strong but you can't tell because they are so delicious -- that is probably why they are so dangerous). The presentation of the food and drinks was so original as well.
