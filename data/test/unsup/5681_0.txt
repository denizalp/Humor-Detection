The waiter\/waitress have no clue what is going on.  Waited 10 minutes before I was seated and then once I ordered my happy hour they charged me full price. When asked about why I was charged full price they said they must understood me but I still need to pay. I will never return here or any of there locations again as I thought this place was great before coming here based on word of mouth. Never again.
