I've been to a couple of shows at the lost leaf and each time I enjoyed myself\nThe service is always very welcoming and friendly\nIt is a cute little house with a cool layout\nThey even have a small side patio where you can enjoy the weather or enjoy a cigarette\nThey also have a great beer selection\nI always ponder where they put their beer... Like, it's a small house... With a ton of beer..\nI always just see the fridge though lol\nI had a pumpkin ale one night and I loved it\nThe guys behind the bar are very helpful
