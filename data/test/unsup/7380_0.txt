My GOD, this store is awful. The customers treat this place like a carnival. Merchandise is everywhere. The shopping experience is terrible. The staff is OK, from my experiences, but the customers are awful. I'm not certain even perfect staff members could keep up with the carnage here. \n\nNot impressed, or returning. I don't have enough prozac.
