Of all the non-strip casinos I like red rock the best. You can literally spend all day here. Huge movieplex, bowling alley, casinos, restaurants, shopping, game arcade etc etc.  Plus it doesn't get that skanky feel like the orleans or Rio.\n\nEasy parking and access.\n\nEasy layout\n\nLocated right off of highway 215
