We arrived at El Encanto at 7 for our 7:00 reservation and we were seated at 7:30, it would have been longer but we said we would sit inside.  The server was pretty nice and the margaritas were actually pretty good.  The food was about average except the pollo fundido which were delicious.  The fajitas were alright.  I think it would be more enjoyable at daytime as the lighting isn't the greatest and maybe another item would fit better than the fajitas.
