Three stars for the white chocolate martini I had for $10 and included a rolled white choc stick.  No stars for our server not understanding my husband's drink order and getting it wrong when he served it.  \n\nAnd of course, no stars for our server disappearing after he served our drinks.  We waited a fair amount of time before we left cash under a glass on our front patio table, and left.\n\np.s. another bartender we met that night made gagging noises when we mentioned where we'd been.
