Been here several times but today's customer service was just awful. Lady at cashier #4 at appx. 8pm 2\/18 told us to remove our items from the basket and put it away with a rude tone along with a horrid facial expression. Maybe she was having a bad day but she's going to be the reason this market will lose customers. Would recommend if they actually have a note stating remove items and put basket here, not just remove items from basket. \n\nSide note- please change Hear to Here in picture.
