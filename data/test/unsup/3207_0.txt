First time here and I've gotta say, FANTASTIC. Was recommended by close friends and I can't wait to visit again.\n\nWe had a late dinner after seeing Celine Dion.\n\nI've had many versions of Chicken Pot Pie but not like this.\n\nThe contents were prepared like a soup and a large single crust resting on top.\n\nKiller. Easily the best PotPie I've ever had.\n\nHuge menu. Lots of types of dishes.\n\nYou won't be sorry.
