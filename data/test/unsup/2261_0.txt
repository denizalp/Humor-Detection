If you decide to dine here, please dress in dinner attire. That being said its worth the time to put on a cute dress.  The service was excellent!!! Greeted timely abd seated immediately. We went for lunch around 12:30. The serving size of each meal was well worth the money. I enjoyed my salmon salad.
