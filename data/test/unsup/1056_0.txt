I took some material into Van's so she could make me 2 short panels for theatrical drapes that I would \"bust through\" during a show.  And material to make a \"sash\"...all of this for a fun speaking gig I was doing.\nShe was wonderful!  She listened, help me decide what was the best way to do it, did a beautiful job...on time and perfectly!!\nI was very lucky that I found her (on Yelp) and all of the great reviews are true!  She's lovely and kind and does gorgeous work!\nThank you, Van!!
