I called this business because of the reviews here on  Yelp, and Jason answered the call. I live quite a ways outside of the service area for this business, but this didn't stop Jason from providing me excellent customer service, including the description of the kind of test I need and a local referral.  \n\nJason went above and beyond; he was personable, patient, informative, helpful, and willing to have me call him back if needed should the referral not work out (it did!). \n\nThank you, Jason.  I will definitely recommend your business to others.
