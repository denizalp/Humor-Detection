Yikes! One cook + many hungry customers = disastrous service.\nJust awful service from start to finish. It seemed like it was opening day but they've been open for a year! \nI understand that it takes some time to prepare the meals. However, we waited around 15 minutes and when my number was called it wasn't ready! I saw one person doing all the cooking and the cashier helped a little. Not even close to providing good service. Not even a thanks for waiting when it was finally ready!
