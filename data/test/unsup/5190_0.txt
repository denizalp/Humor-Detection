Tiny place on the 2nd floor of the Container Park. Quite a few people walked in and ended up waking out because the wait to order was too long. Glad we waited. \n\nPizza is thin crust made to order. Choose from a handful of toppings and it's done in 10 minutes. Little Caesar's quality\/tasting pizza that's good enough for a fast bite. \n\nFolks were super friendly and threw in extra pepperoni too. Definitely stop by. Aside from the hot dog place, this is a better fast food option at the Park.
