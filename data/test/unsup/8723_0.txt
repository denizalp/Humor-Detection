Really frustrated and angry. I called at 2 pm on Thursday to make a facial appt with my $75 gift certificate.  They offered the next morning at 11am.... I called at 10am, less than 24 hrs later, from a doctors office to say I was not able to keep appt due to dr orders and they wanted to charge my gift certificate a $50 same day cancellation fee! What kind of service business is this???
