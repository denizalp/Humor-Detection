I like this place, but the food is just okay. It's never blown my mind by any means. But the servers and owners are really nice, and the environment is really cute. The patio is really nice, especially. It's a good space, average prices, nice people, but don't expect an out of this world meal. \nReally big selection, though, including breakfast\/brunch foods and Indian fare, which is cool.
