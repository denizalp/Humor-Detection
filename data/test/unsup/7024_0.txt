Warning! This is a drunk review! \n\nSo my coworker took me to the hood of Las Vegas claiming this place to be the best taco place in the city. To be honest, I was terrified and am still terrified. But after inhaling the tacos (al pastor with pi√±a-pineapple, lengua, and buche), THESE ARE THEE MOST AMAZING TACOS I'VE HAD MY ENTIRE LIFE. Mind has been BLOWN out of my skull socket. So effin delicious!!!!!\n\nBring a friend (preferably a Spanish-speaking one) and some mase and come down to the hood to try these tacos. So F*CK*NG GOOD!
