\"You know what would really turn this day around? A hot dog baked into a doughnut\" - My inner dialogue, with alarming frequency. \n\nLove Koko Bakery for the above-mentioned treat, as well as the delicious coffee and bubble teas. Also, I bought one of the beautiful fruit cakes for a work birthday once, and it was a huge hit!
