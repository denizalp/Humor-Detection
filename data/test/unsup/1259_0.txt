I was looking for an afternoon tea and stumble across this place. When you walk into this place first thing you smell is coffee and pastries. Right away I new this was going to be good. We ordered lunch coffee and a few pastries. We were not disappointed with anything. Very cute decor which gives you a feeling of being on the French Countryside. Next time we're in town will definitely come back.
