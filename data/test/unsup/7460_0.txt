Wifey and I each ordered Omakase style which was delicious, fresh, and exciting. It's 5 courses, and they threw in an appetizer to hold you over while they made it. It's pricey with tip, I think we spent $300+, most of which was paid for by wifey's dad, who is a chinese mobster.\n\nGo here if money ain't a thang and you want some yummy fish.
