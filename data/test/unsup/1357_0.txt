Nice place with two ice skating rinks, snack bar, lessons, hockey, and a store to buy all your hockey and skate gear. We came here to look into lessons from the kids.  It's a stand alone building not attached to a casino like every business in Las Vegas. \n\nI plan on coming back for some open skate time or to just to sit on the bleachers and catch a hockey game or watch the practice with the kids.  Great place to come to get out of the heat!
