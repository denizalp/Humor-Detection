Chain restaurant but food quality is always good. Price is reasonable compared to other high-end restaurants inside the hotel. \n\nThe Service: Very efficient and attentive. Never disappointed. \n\nThe Food: \n\nShrimp Scampi - Sauteed with White Wine, Lemon, Garlic, Fresh Tomato, Basil, Parsley and a Touch of Cream. Served with Pasta. Huge portion~ Lots of pasta. The shrimp is to die for. Cooked to perfection. Love the garlic taste shrimp. The sauce is very flavorful. My favorite on the menu!
