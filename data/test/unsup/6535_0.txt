My husband and I jumped at midnight on 4th of July. From start to finish, we were done in an hour and a half. The ride was absolutely amazing! The staff is highly skilled and you go through numerous safety checks before you are able to jump. I was worried about a roller coaster stomach feeling, not at all. Felt more like a fast zip line straight down. I recommend that you jump at night, the views of the lights and skyline are spectacular. Highly recommended and will definitely do it again.
