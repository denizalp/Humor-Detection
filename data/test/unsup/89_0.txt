Quiet in the afternoon when I stopped in, I chose a spinach and feta scone. The seating is good and they have a couple of them with a power outlet to enjoy your baked treats with their free wifi. The scone was definitely too dry and crumbly (more so than a scone should be) that had lots of spinach but not much on the feta side.
