This is probably my favorite gallery store in the valley.  There isn't a whole ton that I would buy here but everything they have is very reasonably priced.  As everyone else has said, there are a lot of naked sculptures and paintings and whatnot.  I'm okay with that.  The other things that they sell are just amazing though.  We've bought a few things here but the giant Phoenix sculpture made from tools will always be the item that I want.  Just wish I could afford it.
