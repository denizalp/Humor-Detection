The Cowfish is a very unique restaurant that incorporates sushi and hamburgers. You can order sushi or burgers depending on what you prefer, I feel that this option can help those who don't like sushi (or never tried it) a chance to try it again. The sushi itself is very good, but it's a little on the pricey side. This is an excellent place to take someone who's unsure about sushi, but if you're looking for a lot of sushi at a reasonable price you can find the same quality of sushi somewhere else at a cheaper price.
