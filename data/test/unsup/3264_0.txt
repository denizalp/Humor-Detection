Food is usually good but young brunette lady taking orders there today ( 8:30 am 07\/12\/18) was so unwelcoming that she made me feel uncomfortable.  She stared and didn't say hello or can I help you. She waited for me and my daughter to initiate conversation even though we were the only ones in line. I usually tip at least a dollar for to-go service like this but it was so weird for me that I didn't leave anything.
