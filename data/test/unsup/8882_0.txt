I'm guessing that Mike is one of the owners and he served me today. Such a cool looking place! The ice cream was incredible! Creamy and rich! I sampled a few different flavors that I loved all of, but chose campfire smores and strawberry rhubarb. I wish I lived closer so I could come here more often.
