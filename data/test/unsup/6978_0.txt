Solid italian joint in the middle of Parma. I'm looking for my baby because I have to have my car fixed at Kurak's. Where is my baby? I'm chomping this stromboli and my baby said I eat too much and now an aloof lover. Kurak's has Marco's Pizza for lunch yet I am eating Rocky's and I'm am tired of the pain and misery of my baby who has impressionable stupidity at every last turn lately. I wanted to take the old man's pair of shoes in bathroom and start whack-a-mole.
