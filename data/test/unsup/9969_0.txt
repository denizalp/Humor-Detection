I should have listened to the other reviews... Because they were right! I love cupcakes so I decided to give this place a try... Big mistake!\n\nI ordered the strawberry shortcake which tasted nothing like it. All of the cupcakes look extremely dry because they are! The frosting just tasted like pure sugar and butter.\n\nI honestly regret this purchase.  I think it's so funny that they say they are \"the best little cupcakes in Vegas\" what a bunch of bull!\n\nDon't waste your money... Bake your own!
