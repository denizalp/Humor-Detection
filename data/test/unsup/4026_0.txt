Food is good, I am from the southern east coast and was looking for food I am used to having back home. I thought this would be like Zaxby's and I was right it sure is similar. \n\nOnly downfall to here is that they only offer the Canes Sauce, which is a Cajun based sauce and I am not big on Cajun, they should add some more sauces and then it would be perfect!
