I am a regular customer here at 7hills car wash but today has to be the longest I have every waited. My receipt upon paying states 11:53 am. The current time now is 1:05 pm and I am still waiting for the employee to wipe down my car. \n\nFor new customer, plan to give away 1 hour of your time and bring a book to entertain yourself. \n\nI have been waiting for 1 hour and 30 minutes. \n\n:-\/
