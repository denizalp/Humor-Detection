This place is fantastic! It has a fun atmosphere, great martinis, amazing pizza and fantastic salads! I also love its back store, having been a department store many years ago. The bathroom\/fun house mirrors are definitely a trip and you gotta check out the widely known creepy dolls in the basement.
