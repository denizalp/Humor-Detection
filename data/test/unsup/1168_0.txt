I was in the area this morning and I decided to try Pocho's Mexican restaurant.\n\nI tried the special $4.99 chorizo\/egg with rice,beans& corn tortillas.\nA big filling portion that satisfies.\nVery flavorful and it hit the spot.\n\nI Definitely will be back for more.\n\nGreat taste and great value.\nTotal bill $9.13 with drink, tax , tip
