You can actually cover your eyes and point. No joke. Everything on the menu is so good. Since I've been here, I've eaten here 5-6 days straight. If you like breakfast food to anytime of the day food , this is the spot. I'm so glad is walking distance from work. Probably see you guys at Wok & Roll today . Lol
