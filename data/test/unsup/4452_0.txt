This place is awesome. Great atmosphere, great food a little pricey for pizza though but really don't mind. Less than a 1\/10 of a mike from my house. Great place to stop in anytime. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the attitudes of my servers could increase from a stoned appearance to a more upbeat one. This place is GREAT the staff should think so too.
