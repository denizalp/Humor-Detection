I love this place.  There aren't many Korean\/Chinese style places here in Vegas.  The Jjampong (Spicy Noodle Soup) is really good here along with the Jjajang myun (Black Soybean noodle).  The Chinese food isn't bad either.  The service is friendly, and the price is decent.  It might not be the most decorative place inside, but the food is still very good.  Korean\/Chinese style is different from just Korean and Chinese.  However, I think generally people will still like this type of food.
