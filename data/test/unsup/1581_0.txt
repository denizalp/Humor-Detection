I ordered online for delivery and received an automated confirmation.  I waited 1 hour.\nI then called 4 times (to check on my order) and got the voicemail every time.  I left a message.  I asked the hotel front desk to call the same number; they answered.\nThey said they never received my order (I have the email confirmation to prove it) and that they don't deliver to my hotel anyway.\n\nHorrible communication and customer service.
