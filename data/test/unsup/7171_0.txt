Strongly recommended!! Very flexible and various selections. Fun and artistic graffiti wall decor. The lady working there is upbeat and attentively offering the samples of ice cream. \nThe black sesame and taro milkshake is AMAZING BOMB!!!!  it's so good that I dance in the store after my first sip!! \nThe macaroon ice cream sandwich is not bad, either!
