Service department -  I don't know why I always fall for this crap -  your service will take 20-30 minutes so why dont you have a seat and wait.  Then an hour and 45 minutes later - the car may show up.  Just friggin tell me the truth and drop me off somewhere or give me a loaner.  \n\nSales department -  love Tino, sorry Tino.
