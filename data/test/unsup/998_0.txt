Love supporting this place! It's a locally run Christian coffee Shop that is all about supporting local community and inner city kids. They hire and teach high schoolers, preparing them for the next step. That alone brings me here! \nThe workers are very friendly, helpful and upbeat. Great customer service. The environment is family friendly (I always see families or groups studying here). \nTheir drinks are too sweet for me (I like my coffee dark and strong, no sugar). But they have some great creative flavor combinations. They also have fro-yo and just started implementing a weekend omelette station!
