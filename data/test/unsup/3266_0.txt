This review is for the small booth located next to the Rhumbar.  The booth is also called Rhumbar?!\n\nAnyway, the drinks here are pretty well priced.  What I like about this Rhumbar is that they make their drinks strong.  When we ordered our yard of Pina Coladas there was a ton of Rum poured into it.  There was also a ton poured into it when we bought an extra shot.
