This. This thing. This thing called a \"Patacon Pisao.\" I can't imagine a more perfect thing than this.\n\nIt eats and tastes like nothing else... the flavors, the spices, the texture, the fact that you'll need two hands and a scuba suit to eat the damned thing. Or a big bathtub and two consenting adults.\n\nBut how addicting. When a craving hits you, you'll have no choice but to end up at La Taguara.\n\nJust awesome.
