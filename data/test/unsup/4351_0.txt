I'm actually sitting here right now and enjoying some hookah and shawarma pita.  \nI must tell that this is the best shawarma i've ever had in my life.  The meat is so soft and so testy, the service is really nice, my server name is guy and he is so friendly.  \nHe gave me some free home made pickles and i loved it!\nThe hookah flavor lasts  for long time and it's so smooth and nice.  \nI recommend this place and want to thank them for the nice hospitality.  :)
