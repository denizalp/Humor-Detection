Really disappointed in the Chef's special dish- seafood and scallops.  The lobster portion was a teaspoon full of garnish-like flakes...mostly potatoes.\nIt was also served in one of those pretentious oversized plate-bowls.\nThe place has really gone downhill since they expanded downtown.  Not worth the $23.
