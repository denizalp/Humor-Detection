Mom's in the back frying up the bacon, Pop's in the front topping up your coffee, and small photos of the moon landing hang on the mostly bare white walls. Yep. This place is what you're looking for for breakfast. \n\nI had a mushroom and (deliciously processed) cheese omelette with bacon and sausage. It was exactly what you'd expect from a diner. It ended up being a touch pricier than expected, but that could be on me, extra meat and all that. \n\nPlaces like this truly are giant leaps for mankind, and I will be back.
