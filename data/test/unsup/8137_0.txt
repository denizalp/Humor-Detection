I am really happy with Protea Medical Center. Dr. Pefferly listens to me and has a common sense and realistic approach to my needs. Celeste coached me through a weight loss program with outstanding results. Their entire staff is always cheerful, very helpful and very much in tune with the patient. Protea is not just a medical center, their team members are life changers!
