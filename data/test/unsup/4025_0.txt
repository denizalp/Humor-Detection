yep been there nice place,took in some watches and was amazed about what I got offered.If you call $1500 for 3 Rolex's fair??? anyway ended up taking them to Los Angeles and sold them for almost $6000 to a dealer. If Max Pawn is the Highest buyer in Las Vegas I'm scared to see what the others will pay
