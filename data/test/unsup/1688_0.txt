I didn't know there was a place to get an $18 Bloody Mary in Cleveland but this is it.  In fact I didn't know a place like this existed in Ohio at all.  Very cool atmosphere: dimly lit, great chill music, comfortable couches.  If I was making mid six figures and lived in Cleveland this is where I would bring my dates.  Unfortunately that's in another life.\n\nYou get what you pay for.  Great drinks and some stunning female eye candy.
