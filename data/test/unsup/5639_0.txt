This company is a joke. Overcharging for simple repairs, said it would take 3 weeks to get a refrigerator water line. Unacceptable. Made a call to GE who fixed it in 10 minutes with no surprise charges. I'm thinking that buy rite has a contract with Protective plan we got thru HOA. Canceled the protective plan as well.
