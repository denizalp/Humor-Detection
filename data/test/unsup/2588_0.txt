Gone to salon in past when in a pinch but I would not recommend this nail salon. I wont be going back. I had an 11 a.m. appointment, but didn't get a tech until 11:30 a.m. then it took the tech 2.5 hours to do shellac mani\/pediatric. Very rough with filing during pedi, never had issue anywhere else, thought I was bleeding. The manicure was disappointing, no massage done. Shellac is already chipping on nails and just had done two days ago!  Then to top it off was told two different prices for services. Not a happy customer :\/
