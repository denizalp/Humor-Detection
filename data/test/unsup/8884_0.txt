When you go to Vegas, you think that each buffet is the same except for the price you pay... Makino is an Asian inspired buffet that is located off the strip. It's in the plaza where Smith's is. It's always packed and even though there is a wait, you don't wait for hours to eat.\n\nPlace is tight but enough for you to move around. Selection of the food is limited but it is within their theme --- Asian. Food is yummy and nor overwhelming. It's a more relaxed resto if you ask me.
