I only find myself at this location every couple of months when I am in the area so I wouldn't consider myself a regular Smith's shopper.  This store gets 5 stars from me because I really enjoy their sushi.  It's always fresh, the selection and taste is just much better than other grocery store sushi.  They also take request.  This Smith's also carries specialty items that I don't find in Albertson's and if it is an item Albertson's carries it's higher.
