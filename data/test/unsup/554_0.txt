Godiva Chocolate is one of my favorite chocolates of all times.  I may have to drive 5 miles to go to the store, but it is well with it.   Every time I go into the store it smells so good.  They even hand out sample too.  :)   The last time I was in the store, the lady was really friendly and hopeful.  It is not every day you can get a free box of chocolate (it was for my birthday).
