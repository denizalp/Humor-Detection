I set up a session put a deposit down. I had to move the appt the first time. I made it very clear that I needed to see the draw before my appt. texted never heard back until a couple days before my appt. I cancelled again and stated I still had not seen any draw. Lost my deposit and never heard back from this place. Will never consider here again and will keep letting people know.
