Stumbled upon Citizen on a quite Monday morning.  Tim was an awesome server and really was spot on with his recommendations.  French toast was great and the orange zest in the whipped cream was a nice touch.  The breakfast burrito was great and had tons of flavor with good guacamole.  Fresh fruit smoothie was made from scratch, not from a mix.  Cool vibe, decor, and good tunes.  A solid discovery!
