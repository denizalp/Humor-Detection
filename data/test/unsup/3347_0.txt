Stopped by yesterday since we were on that side of town. It was amazing just like the first time. I ordered the chencho fries and the pepperoni calzone. The fries were the best as always and the calzone was really delicious. They were really generous with the pepperoni and the crust was out of this world. I do have one complaint. The calzone was pretty greasy. That doesn't matter though. I enjoyed my experience at Fat Boy and will return soon.
