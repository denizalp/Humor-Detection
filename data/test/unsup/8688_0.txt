This place is very professionally run and the staff is the greatest! They are all volunteers from my understanding and you can tell they love helping out. \n\nI have been searching for a dog for about a month now and stumbled across this shelter and knew I had to get a dog from them. \n\nI could tell this organization really cares. Their website is the best I've seen. Very clean and up to date. Pictures and videos of there available pets. \n\nWould give more stars if I could.
