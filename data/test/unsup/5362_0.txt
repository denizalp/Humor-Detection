OMG, FYI, it's p.h.a.t. (pretty hot and tempting ) \n\nSeriously could not decide where we should dine for dinner on Saturday, we wanted to go somewhere we could dress up and dine like Millionaires. Maybe try Bobby Flay's restaurant or Micheal Mina's? \n\nWe went here instead. I never had anything like it, well, maybe when I was in Japan when I had Kobe beef. This is not Kobe beef, but the filet was sensational!
