In a hurry,,,\nThey conveniently charged me 99 cents a pound, my total was only $13.50 for a full tub of dirty clothes, w\nThey hand them to you folded and clean :)\n\nThey take debit cards!\n\nYou can't beat the convenience.\n\nI'm always embarrassed to hand my underwear to someone to wash so didn't ask nor gave them those to wash but I'm curious if they did :$\n\nGreat service, convenient, and speedy.\n\nThey take the time to call and let you know clothes are ready!\n\nA+
