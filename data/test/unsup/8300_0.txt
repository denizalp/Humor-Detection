Elitist punks. Blows my mind they are still in business in this economy. Their attitude is the opposite of what's needed to grow the sport, it creates bad energy and I would never spend my hard earned here again, and all I bought was a tube. Tried to give management positive productive feed back and got laughed at. Heard other people were treated the same way hence this review.
