I don't come here often but had to eat today and thought...why not shy away from the oily food that is the watermark.\n\nThey have a new autumn menu that isn't bad at all.  i had the salmon pizza app (ok), lamb shanks (dry and not great...so meh) and cold tiramisu (actually surprisingly good).\n\nFood was ok. ambience was ok (but only because it was work related).  service wasn't too bad, the manager was good!\n\nWhat i learned about myself: i ain't vivek :) jk
