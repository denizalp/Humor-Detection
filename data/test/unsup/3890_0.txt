Food was good, atmosphere not that great. Went on a Saturday night and you could hear a pin drop it was so quiet. Kids enjoyed the giant Jenga but felt like they were scaring the crap out of people Everytime it fell because it was so quiet. Server was not very engaging at all with anyone at our table.
