I knew I shouldn't have ordered poke from here from when I looked At the quality of the fish. I was starving so I ordered anyways. That night I had major chills, constant sweating, and Nausea. Day 4 I still have these symptoms. I definitely believe I got stomach flu from here. Never going again in my life and now I can't even stomach the thought of any fish or seafood for a long time.
