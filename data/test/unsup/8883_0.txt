Awesome! Great experience! Came here with my Mom and my sister, and we all loved it! The service was amazing (Guy is da bomb) and the food and hookah is even better! I got the falafel and hummus appetizer and just that was seriously soooo good!! Also the pina colada hookah was nice :) I love this place, you've gotta give it a try! :)
