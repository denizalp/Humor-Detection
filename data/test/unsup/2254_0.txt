What can I say... they are open all night... and they are close to my work.\n\nThey do have a few \"healthy\" options... or a few options that might kill you. If I am going here late at night... I am usually hankering for something that might kill me in my sleep so that is what I get.\n\nLove the fries as well, forget the curly ones as the regular are better.
