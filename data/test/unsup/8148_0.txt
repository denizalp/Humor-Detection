This is my go to local joint for breakfast take out. They make yummy, home style meals that are affordable for the average bear and they're cook time is impressive. We only live a few blocks away so when they tell us our food will be ready in 7-9 minutes that means from the time we leave our driveway and park our food is already ready for pick up. Their Big Daddy Hash is amazing, their pies are delicious and the service is always great.
