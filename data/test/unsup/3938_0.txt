I'm Filipino and I don't even like Halo-Halo, but theirs is so delicious!  The only reason I tried the Halo-Halo here was because my aunt was excited to order this for me on my trip to Vegas, I didn't have the nerve to tell her I don't like Halo-Halo... My husband, who also isn't a big Halo-Halo fan, really enjoyed Red Ribbon's version.
