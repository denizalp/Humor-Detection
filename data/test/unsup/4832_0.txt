Great overall experience!\n\nExcellent movie to build hype prior to the official release on Friday as I'll be telling my friends and encouraging them to go and see it.\n\nThe location is top-notch with a central address for easy accessibility no matter where you are departing from.\n\nLast but not least, the Yelp crew hosted an awesome event with some great trivia and prizes before the movie.\n\nShall I dare say they did a better job than TIFF?
