They sell your e-mail address to spammers!\n\nIf you reserve your tee time with them online, they will sell your e-mail address to Viagra and penis enhancement spammers. It happened to me. I used a unique e-mail address with them and next thing I know, I start getting spam on that e-mail address. \n\nI confronted them about it and they denied it and didn't take any action which makes them worse.\n\nThe golf facilities are mediocre so don't even bother.
