The food here keeps getting worse and worse it has open. The only reason I go is because closest buffet to my house and it's tolerable but if there was another one in the vicinity I would go to that other one. Good price, mediocre food. The cheap skates even took away the ice cream cones. I recommend Krazy buffet or Buffet of Asia. Not this place.
