You really cant go wrong with their bar menu, their house draft beers, and of course their garlic fries! I'm not a fan of their whole menu and how expensive everything is, but I don't mind sitting up at the bar, garbing a few small bites and chasing them down with some craft brews. But if you are looking for a nice meal and maybe a date night this place isn't bad for that either.
