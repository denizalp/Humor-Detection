We went here for our first time on a Friday night at 9pm. Yeah way too late to be eating dinner but we ate a lot. Our server Justin was very good at recommendations and of course we had to try it all - except I ran out of room for dessert, will have to go back. \nThe service was excellent, ambiance is very comfortable and the food - even an hour before closing was amazingly delicious- best Mac and cheese ever! We will definitely be going back. Thank you Justin
