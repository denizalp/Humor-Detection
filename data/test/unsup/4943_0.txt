I waited a couple of months to post this review to be sure I was pleased. I can say that Brad was extremely thorough, professional and our big issue has been resolved. Brad took the time to discuss and answer our questions reassuring he will only come when he's needed and warranties his work. AND scheduling by text is a breeze. No longer will we be subject to constant calling, paying monthly or quarterly for service we might not need and know we will get the service we paid for. Thank you.
