Nice little place for a quick and inexpensive meal.  Have had the Fish & Chips and decided to try the Banger & Chips on this visit.  The Banger and Chips were good.  Received a little cup of gravey to go with the sausage.  The Chips are really good, too.  \nThe staff is super friendly.\nThere is one communal table that seats about 9 and a counter in the window that seats about 4. So not a place to eat in if you are with a large group.
