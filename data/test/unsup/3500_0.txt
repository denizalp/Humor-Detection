Yes, in a gas station. To be fair it's quite a snazzy gas station, the kind with a full service car wash with people hand waxing and such. Chicken is light and fluffy with no fat or bones. Chips are the deep fried semi-greasy kind but that's my only gripe. All Ingredients are fresh light and not too spicy or too greasy. 1st visit we had the super nachos w chicken and two cheese enchilada combo meal. Delicious!
