So we visited during our last trip to Vegas just to see the shop. It was the day after Christmas so it wasn't to crowded. The shop is your average pawn shop a bit dingy and old looking. They have a section of pawns stars related merchandise but compared to most souvenirs there are overpriced. The regular merchandise is overpriced as well. You can haggle I'm sure but why buy overpriced used when I can go to a real jewelry store and get something similar for a lot less. Not impressed at all.
