Great find.  Very unique menu. Wonderful staff, exceptional food and a hip decor all combine to make this one one of my favorite places. The menu is full of great dishes that are one of a kind takes on your favorites but I usually get side tracked with the specials. The attention to quality and freshness are very evident. The music is also very nice. Good tunes played at a level that you can hear the music but don't have to talk over it. The best place in town for a dinner date.
