Came to pampas on a voucher from tahiti village.  Started with a sangria it was good then moved on to the salad bar. The food was fresh and tasty. The salmon was cooked just right.  Vanessa seated us with a smile and Ambur was a great waitress.  We got great food and great service. We had to get to a show after so they took care of everything so we could get to our show on time.
