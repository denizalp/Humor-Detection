Let me start by saying that I have tried VooDoo Donughnuts in Portland, Oregan and they cannot hold a candle to Pink Box Doughnuts in Las Vegas, Nevada!  The s'mores doughnut is by far my favorite.  The staff at this location are consistently friendly.  My only complaint is that they share the same parking lot as my gym.
