Came here for my bachelorette! We got our tickets through groupon and paid an extra $10 to be next to the stage which was totally worth it! \n\nWhen we picked up our tickets from will call we also bought drink vouchers for $10 which saves you money because drinks were normally $16 and then you get refills for $11 and the drinks were strong. \n\nBefore the show they allow you to purchase tip money as they do not use real money to tip the guys. \n\nWe had so much fun! Would love to do this again!
