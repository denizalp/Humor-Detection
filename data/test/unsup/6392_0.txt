Really a terrible disappointment.  WAY overpriced, food is average to below average, service is almost obnoxious, and restaurant decor is like a Holiday Inn restaurant.  Would never go back, even if they offered a free meal.  Waste of time and money, and a horrible disappointment for what was supposed to be a special night.
