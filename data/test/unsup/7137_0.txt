This place used to be a 4 1\/2 but slowly going down to a 3. The service is why it is now going down the drain. The service makes the experience less desirable. The food is still top notch but for the price we would expect that servers understand English and actually don't leave plates forever waiting to be served. Until they change 1 or 2 servers this place will not see my business.
