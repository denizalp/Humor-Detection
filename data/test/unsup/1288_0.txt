Really impressed! My closet looks absolutely amazing, and they even gave me discounts and free stuff to go with it. Derek Price is amazing to work with, he has such great style and is very nice. The fellow who installed the closet was great to chat with and also very nice, he brightened my saturday and did an excellent job. \n\nWholly recommend this company. I am very picky and hard to please, but they did a perfect job and deserve a great recommendation!
