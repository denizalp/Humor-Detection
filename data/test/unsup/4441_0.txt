This is a charming and fresh feeling place with their act together. This is the best restaurant we have discovered in ages, and that says something in a resort town! The crab cakes, sunny salad and fish sandwich were special, as were the cookies and milk for dessert;) We were in on Mother's Day and all had truly delicious meals. Even the kids were wide-eyed with thumbs up! Our server, Emily, was amazing, attentive, and made our time a delight! We will be back again and again to a new favorite!
