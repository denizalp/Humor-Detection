Absolutely fantastic service great location customer service is great. \n\nThey do get very busy so I would make sure to book an appointment a few days in advance although I have been lucky to get a same day appointment\n\nIt's always very clean in there \n\nI recommend you take earbuds to listen to your own music because the music and there is not the best\nIt's kind of boring elevator music\n\noverall I give this place a solid 10\n\nThank you for making me look fabuLash
