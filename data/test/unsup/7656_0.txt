I hired CPK at the PARK for catering purposes. I had a private party on the strip for 30 people.  The food was delivered on time, and the presentation was also very nice. They even threw in some cookies and desserts for free. The manager Mc.Kenzie was in contact with me several times via email and telephone. I would recommend them for catering anytime. I was very happy and the food was DELICIOUS!!! \n\nYou did a GREAT JOB!!!!!  Sorry I took no pics of the food, I should have, but it was AWESOME!!!!
