I am a big sushi eater and love trying new places out, so a friend told me to come here. I was not impressed at all. The sushi here was nothing special and the menu didnt have very many options. I ordered the yum yum roll and my friend ordered the Japanese Lasagna. My roll was crab and yum yum sauce. It was really bland. The Japanese Lasagna was ok but also not much flavor. The service was good but I can definitely say that I wont be returning.
