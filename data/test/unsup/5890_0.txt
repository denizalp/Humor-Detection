I stopped by today and ordered a chicken sub. When I got home and opened my sandwich, I had a turkey sub. When I ordered my food, I noticed that the cashier was processing a large catering order of turkey subs. So I guess that they mixed my sub up. It's funny that I have gone there and they are super busy and the get my order correct. Today I was the only person there and they mess up my order.
