We had a bachelor party there, we were getting a table $(500), and then pay entrance $50\/ person on top of that!!! Where does that happen?? You pay for a table and entrance????\nThe service was horrible, very unorganized and we saw people randomly sitting on our table to get a lab dance because they only paid entrance and they have no chair to sit on.\nSo we had to argue a lot which took the fun away.\nNever in this place again
