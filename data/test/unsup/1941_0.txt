A nice little place to stop and refuel while you are out at the District. \nThere is indoor and outdoor dining available. I like that the order was brought to the table. The staff was friendly and able to give suggestions in regards to what kind of meal we were craving.  I had the watermelon juice which was very refreshing. My grilled cheese sandwich and side salad were filling and tasty.
