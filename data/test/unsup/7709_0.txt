This is a review for the size and looks of the restaurant. This place is TINY.  A party of 11 literally came just before us and the place was full instantly as there were about 15 people seated ahead of them.  Therefore I cannot comment on the food. We ended up at D' Pinoy Joint a few hundred feet away. Much bigger place, ambiance is better. I am leaving this for anyone who may suffer the same predicament.
