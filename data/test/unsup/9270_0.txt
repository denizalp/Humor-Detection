The Iced Tea was so good! I love it, but that's not all I went for. I first called before I ordered and she was so inpatient on the phone. When I showed up to order instead it seemed like a nice place minus it was not very well lit. My order of Orange Chicken wasn't too good. Its my first time but I'm sure the chicken shouldn't have been that crispy that it was almost burnt. I didn't finish it. The rice was also over cooked. First time here and most definitely my last!
