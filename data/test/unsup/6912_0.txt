Came here yesterday with my parents. This was the first meal in Canada for all if us and it was pretty disappointing. The service was okay, our waiter would always come over but then leave in the blink of an eye. She should be a magician. I ordered the French onion soup. That was very good! I also ordered the fish and chips; gross. The fries are thin and cheap, and served cold. Along with the fish, the crust fell off because the fish was so slimy. So overall only come here if you are really dying.
