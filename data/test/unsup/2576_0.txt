Couldn't be more pleased with the job that Rani at Attic Salt did on my company's re-brand and new website. As others have said - he is so creative and talented and took our branding way beyond what we could have imagined. \n\nIf you need brand\/logo\/website work, call them. They aren't the cheapest but their price is fair and their work is some of the best I have come across. Thanks Rani!
