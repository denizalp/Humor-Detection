Everything about this office is awesome. I hadn't had my teeth cleaned in years due to life happening and also the dread of laying there while someone picks my teeth and gums. There was absolutely no pain with my teeth cleaning and I actually look forward to going every 6 months! Everyone is nice and they make the dental experience enjoyable if you can imagine that!
