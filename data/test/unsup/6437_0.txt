The food is great! The breakfast special #2 is the way to go!  It's a huge plate and you can chose your sides to suit you style! Our server was Jessie and he was great!  The coffee was hot and it was not weak! \nSunday's are a little crowded here but it is worth the wait! If you want to take it to go they have a drive through! Bon app√©tit...
