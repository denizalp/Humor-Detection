We have always loved and given our business to Oishi. Lately it has not been so phenomenal. The last straw was when we tried to make a reservation for THIRTEEN people to celebrate a birthday. They would not take the reservation, said the wait would be long. We were planning on coming from out of town for this specifically. Non apologetic nor were they polite about it. It's okay. We'll take our what would have been over a $450 bill to a different place of business.
