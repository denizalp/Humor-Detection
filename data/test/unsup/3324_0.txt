Nadia helped my roommate and I find condo in Toronto. She was very helpful in taking us around to the different places. She did a great job in tailoring our search so we didn't waste time going to condo's that didn't fit our specifications and was very organized so our search went smoothly. She was also very good at responding in a timely manner and giving us insights into things we should consider as we hadn't lived in a condo before. Overall Nadia was very professsional and I recommend her to all my friends.
