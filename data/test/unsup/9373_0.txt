Sadly...an over rated Brunch spot.  Although waitstaff was nice, the food was blah at best.  I had the Zucchini appetizer and it was soaked with what I'm assuming is vegetable oil.  The Omelette I had was similarly soaked in butter.  I feel that they should add \"Heart Attack\" to the name.  The decor makes you feel like your eating in 1980s restaurant.  Pass on this one unless you like feeling like you're in the Goonies movie.  \"hey you guys!!!\"
