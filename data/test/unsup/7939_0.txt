All of my dealings with this pharmacy have been via phone and it's been so pleasant.  I was so pleased to find a compound and \"regular\" pharmacy all in one.  Everyone I've spoken to has been extremely helpful and you can't beat the free delivery.  I got a delivery this week and the driver, Sam, sent me a very friendly text to let me know it had been delivered.  Customer service seems to be the top priority and as a refugee from the big drugstore chains, this is extremely important to me.
