I'm picking up a to go order on a Friday evening and only one person taking orders both at the counter and on the phones. The poor girl is alone, working her butt off and needs help. Management needs to staff correctly for peak Friday evenings. Craig rd location is so much more organized. Will not be back to this location. Not the cashier's fault, management get it right.
