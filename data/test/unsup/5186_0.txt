Loved it.  The hefty half pound Mesa Burger had me at hello:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=GShF_l6J5D4PBiC2D5GE1g\n\nA horseradish mustard came along for the ride and was just spicy enough, went great with the caramelized onions.  A nice cup of smooth coffee had me bright eyed and ready to go and see a show afterwards.  Service was quick, careful and friendly.  The atmosphere is light and open and full of people.  Not particularly expensive.  Come to Caesars and hit this place up, you'll be glad you did.  The best Vegas celeb chef restaurant,  Bobby Flay you're the man.
