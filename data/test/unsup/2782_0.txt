Was a little hard to find on the backside of the shopping center.  This place makes me wish I was more of a hockey fan.  We came here for the comedy show on a wednesday night.  \nThere was plenty of different types of beer to choose from.\nNot really the place to go if you are a little jumpy or get startled easily because of the pucks hitting the plexi-glass. Every time you just about forget about them playing hockey,  WHAM!!  you get reminded.
