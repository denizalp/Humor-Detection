Dinner: 4.5\/5\n\nDomA was good to great on everything from service to taste. I can't say anything was avg. But nothing was mind blowing, though there were some candidates who did come close. We didn't do the tasting menu. The menu changes regularly. \n\nPro-tip: Sit by the window to see folks getting turned away from Pinky's Ca Phe across the street :p
