Pretty much everything you need to snack and get hydrated, and possibly even more drunk when staying at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas.  Situated at the base of the elevators to the  Paradise Tower, this little 'convenience  store' has everything from energy drinks, to snacks and even condoms ... Should the situation 'arise'. \n\n4 stars because its extra over priced,  though I found that 4 beers and a mini sake at its sister satellite store was only around $20 a compared to paying closer to $8 beer at the bar.
