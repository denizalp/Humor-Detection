Um, yeah. See, I wrote this review about an hour after eating lunch at Sushi Hut. Earlier I had a sneaking suspicion that something might be wrong with the spicy tuna roll I ingested, but I dismissed my fear as mere West Coast prejudice. Another hour or so after writing this review, however...well, let's just say I stayed in for the night. \n\nThanks, but no domo arigato Sushi Hut.
