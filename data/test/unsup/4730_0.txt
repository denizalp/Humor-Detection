This is [was] my local spot!  Years ago, you would have caught me here gambling the night away at a 21 tables, but the times have changed, I'm older, SOBER and married so now I stay away......\n:(\nOh well, such is life!\nOn a lighter note, I love and still enjoy how UN-crowded it is, the food court, Starbucks, the movie theater, the restaurants, and the insane amount of parking!\nGreat employees\/customer service and a CLEAN place!\nI'd give 'em 10 stars if I could!
