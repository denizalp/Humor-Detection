What a great place! If you want some down-home cowboy cooking - this is the place! They offer live country music most nights and the view is spectacular! The prices are a little high for the steaks, but, we thought they were worth it. The portions were just right and the service was friendly & efficient.\n\nThis restaurant is definitely a must see! It is half tourist attraction and half road house. Give it a shot cowboy!
