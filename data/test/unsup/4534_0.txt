Very unprofessional ! I called the day before I went in and asked a few questions. The day I went in they gave me false information. I asked to talk to the general manager Dave and they said he didn't feel like talking. Dave was very rude and unprofessional. They address customers by saying hey, wassup homie. I was working with Steven and he was eating chocolate while he was negotiating with me. So unprofessional. I walked out.  I WILL NEVER GET A CAR THERE! They will not get my money treating me like this !
