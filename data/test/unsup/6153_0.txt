Came in for lunch yesterday and Tracy my server was amazing! She was funny and so attentive. I had the pulled chicken with coleslaw and fries. The spicy BBQ sauce and red sticky sauce were freaking phenomenal. The chicken was so juicy and so good! I live right up the street so this will be my new go to for a lunch spot.
