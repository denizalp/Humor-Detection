I am giving them a 3 to help them out.  I was on hold for 20 minutes to speak to someone in Pharmacy, but when they finally answered, they quickly hung up before saying hello.  I called back and was on hold again for another 25 minutes before someone picked up.  That's just crazy!!  ... Or maybe I'm crazy for calling back!  I think both!!
