RUDE! DISRESPECTFUL! ARROGANT! \n\nI wish I could have better words to describe this \"new\" establishment. Most of the bartenders and bar backs were nice, but one in particularly semi bald and doesn't know what a simple drink like a Bay Breeze is. Plus over priced for a bar that is competing with many Many MANY other gay and straight bars with 1000x better personal. It's kind of sad really. But if the owner wants to higher rude bartenders far be it for me to stop her.
