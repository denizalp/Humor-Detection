Sandwich was slightly below average. The shops in California are 10x better. I can taste the West Coast Love that is put into every sandwich back in California, whereas in AZ, I can taste the Zona hate. The lettuce was soggy, bread wasn't well maintained (as it fell apart in my delicate hands). I am not happy with the sandwich but the service was great. Would not definitely come back here again!!!!
