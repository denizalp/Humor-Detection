Came in on a Friday night to have dinner with the family food was ok, nothing to write home about.   Avoid coming to this place on the weekend if you want to have a conversation with your guest. The tacatacas and karaoke dj make it impossible for you to talk and enjoy your food. Its becomes a bar full of  depressed fat girls singing songs that make you want shoot yourself. Also, make sure you check your bill the wait staff tends to over charge. Too pricey for South Phoenix.
