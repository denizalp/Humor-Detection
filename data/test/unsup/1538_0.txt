Found this restaurant on happy cow so I decided to check out their vegan Chinese food. The menu has a great selection of vegetarian mock meats. I told the waitress that I was vegan and she recommended me the meatballs and the beef noodles. Ask for no eggs.\n\nOverall their food is legit and delicious. Big portions so don't get carried away! Nice, spacey decor. Friendly service. Cash only. Overall great restaurant and surely worth a try.
