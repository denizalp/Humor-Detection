this place does not deserve any stars. i had to put one star in order for this review to get posted.\n\nplease beware of door pushers in this hotel!!!\n\nif you decide to stay at this hotel make sure your doors are closed all the way & all your belongings are stored & locked away!! \n\nworse customer service ever!! it's not worth it to stay at hotel where you don't feel safe. please please please do not trust this hotel. you can find better hotels with better security.
