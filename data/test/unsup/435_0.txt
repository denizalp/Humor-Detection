I purchased a LivingSocial voucher for their cleaning services.  I tried calling several times and never reached anyone.  Well, once someone picked up the phone but hung it up without saying anything.  I left messages on the voicemail as instructed, but no one ever bothered calling me back to schedule.  It's been weeks of dealing with this and I've given up.  Apparently they can't handle the increased business from LivingSocial or they just don't care.
