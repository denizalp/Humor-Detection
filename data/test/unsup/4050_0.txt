Nice deli sandwiches.  Have been stopping by a few times this summer and you can't go wrong.  Great sandwiches with Boars Head meat and cheese and Mancini bread.  You can pick up some fresh made pies and deserts.  It can get a little crowded and only about six tables for 2 in the entrance area, but at this time of year I get take out and find a nice spot outside.  You can make your own or order some that are listed and named after some customers.
