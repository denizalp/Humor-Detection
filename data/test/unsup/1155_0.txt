I was trying to find somewhere to get my acrylics fixed and I ended up coming here. I am very very happy I came. Linda did my nails and did an AMAZING job. I have tried going to so many different nail salons and none of them ever satisfied. Coming to this location was a breath of fresh air. Not only was she doing a good job, her and I were talking the entire time. \n\nThis is where I'm coming from here on out.
