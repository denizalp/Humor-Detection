EDC was in the house just our luck! Love love love\n\nAt first we were not impressed cause there are so many different floors and all the other rooms suck only the main floor is good.  But then at like 1am ish EDC came on and rocked the house and me and my girls were in a trance.  No longer did our feet hurt or were we tired from the second night of not sleep and partying.  Love LOVE love.  \n\nLine is LONG and crazy.  Get a name or something!  or go really really early.
