Dated hotel. The Bathroom was tiny, with a sink that's raised way too high, outside of the tiny bathroom. I'm an able-bodied agile guy, and could barely close the bathroom door without getting in the way. Can't imagine someone older or larger could handle the squeeze. \n\nNo WiFi in rooms, just Ethernet! LOL. And make sure you park in their non-secure lot across the street from the Conference center, as they don't own the lot directly behind their property. What a pain, Sham-pain.
