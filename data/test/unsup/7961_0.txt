This place is a legitimate redesigned sportsbar\/deli located right in the heart of the Wynn. I remember when this place used to be a poorly ran deli. Now, it's very welcoming and the food is pretty freaking solid as well. It's proximity to the Wynn sportsbook makes it a great spot to grab a sandwich and watch the game. Overall, not too shabby! \n\nLegit-\nFriendly staff \nLarge portions \nGreat drink\nSelection \nProximity to the sportsbook \nWell lit and welcoming \n\nMeh-\nLoud \nService can be slow \nA bit pricey
