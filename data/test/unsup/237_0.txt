Our experience at Mesa Grill was absolutely amazing! The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable and the food was simply some of the best Southwestern cuisine we had ever tasted. I had the pork and my wife had the black bean chipotle quesadilla. I highly recommend the Partida Margarita up in. Martini glass from the bar!  Do yourself a favor and make sure you put Mesa Grill on your agenda for Vegas!!
