This place has a crappy location and hardly any parking. The employees are kinda snoody, which was kinda expected. The cupcakes themselves where actually good. I had the banana one and red velvet. They both were good. The price is borderline retarded. They are not even big cupcakes for $4 a piece. For $4 the cupcakes should be as big as a F'n basketball, but nope just normal size.
