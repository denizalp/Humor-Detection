We were there for a group event and it was the most awkward night out. Empty restaurant on a Friday night. Drinks weren't good...too sweet with syrup. Starz Ballroom dancers there were creepy and owner just bumped and grinded all night long and not once said hello to our group. I love to dance but it was a creepy dance scene. Place is beautiful but they need some serious help with the atmosphere.
