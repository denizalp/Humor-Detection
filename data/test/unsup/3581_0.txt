Yesterday, their shop at the red rock casino. I decided to take advantage of their anniversary special on the..Bobbie for $4.... this was a full sandwich..I also purchased a pastrami, full size...Guess What...no signs posted for the special on the Bobbie...I had to ask them to get this..Bobbie... at the special price....Guess What....a few scraps of turkey, compared to the huge amount on the pastrami?????\n\nIF YOU ARE GOING TO DO THIS...WHY NOT SELL ALL YOUR SANDWICHES FOR $4... WITH SCRAPS OF MEAT...DUH..\n\nSHAME ON YOU
