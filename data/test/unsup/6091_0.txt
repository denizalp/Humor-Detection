I'm a food critic journalist In tour in the USA from Italy for a book I'm writing about the culinary experiences around the world.\nI only have one thing to say about this unfortunate accident that forced me to meet somebody in this disgusting place.\nWho was the criminal that put the word restaurant to this pile of junk??
