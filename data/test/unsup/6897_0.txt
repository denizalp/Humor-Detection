The Big Apple Coaster is a pretty neat tourist attraction in Vegas. It's a bit shaky and old, and now that I've done it once I can't say I'll ever need\/want to do it again. \n\nYou buy your ticket, stand in line, then board and go for a short but fast ride. There is a longer line to stand in if you want front row. \n\nThere are a few fun loops that you go upside down during, and a big drop at the beginning, but aside from that it's a pretty tame coaster.
