I went there 2 weeks ago for the first time when my hair stylist wasn't available. I was greeted promptly when I walked in. The shop had apparently recently been renovated. Everything was very clean and the staff was very friendly. I showed Justin a picture of the cut I wanted and he was able to duplicate it exactly for me. I got a wash and a cut for $18! Same price as House Of Lords around the corner, but in a much nicer, cleaner, friendlier establishment. I will definitely be going back for my next cut!
