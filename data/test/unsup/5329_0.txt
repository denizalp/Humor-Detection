$0.39 tacos?! Yes please.\n\nIt's not gourmet. It's cheap and it does the trick. Only a few blocks from the Premium Outlets, it's become a favourite spot to grab a quick bite when I'm in the area.\n\nWhat I love more than anything is the Del Taco Inferno hot sauce. I use it at a clip of one packet per taco and take some for the road.\n\nFast and cheap. If you take a cab, be sure to offer your driver a taco or two!
