Came here shortly before a $50 groupon expired. Nearly forgot I had the darn thing. The burger is a mite pricey. A great thing to order if you're here with an aunt and uncle visiting from out of town and they're picking up the tab. Hardcore whiskey drinkers will be, I think, impressed with the extensive list. Service is great. Dark and intimate.\n\nIt's fun to pop over to the Shopsy's side and check out all the old photos, back when I guess Shopsy's was something other than a crap place to get a crap sandwich. Henny Youngman? *tears*
