This is by farthest the best Charley's I have ever been to. Not just because of the amazing food they make, it's also the outstanding service Charley's has. The servers are very sweet, and social. They make you feel welcomed, and amazing service beats every other restaurants that doesn't have great service. This is the reason I drive so far, not only for the food but the service is never disappointing.
