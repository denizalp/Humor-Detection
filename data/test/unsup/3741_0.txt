Food is excellent but they're a bit understaffed. The server is also the chef (not permanently probably) and service is slow. Decor is lacking, they should dim the lights\/play music\/etc. to make it more inviting. But food was very good (spicy, authentic), so will return. A few people were ordering dosas and appams (crispy rice pancakes) and both looked fresh and delicious.
