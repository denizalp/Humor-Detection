Great happening atmosphere! \n\nOrdered the black and Bleu cooked medium, but it was still dry. I wonder how it would be if I had ordered well done?!\n\nThe tilted Buffalo flathead was pretty good. I especially liked the celery bits that were in it. \n\nAll in all, it was an average experience. I have no reason to run back here.
