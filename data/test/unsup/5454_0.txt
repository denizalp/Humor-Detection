Super delicious, great service and most of all amazing displays with all the dishes! The martinis were good as well! (I don't typically order martinis but these ones made the cut) I tried many items here ranging from; duck, to crab, to shrimp and some drink dessert after that tasted like black licorice (forgot the name). Our waitress had a great sense of humor and yet was very professional!
