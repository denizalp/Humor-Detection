Heath called to confirm the appointment I made and showed up on time. Always a plus with a repair person.  When I made the appointment and described what was wrong, he gave me an estimate with what he thought and what could be worst-case scenario.  He fixed the blinds quickly for the rate he quoted. \n\nDon't throw away your blinds - it's well worth it to have him come out.
