Great portions and tasty lunch.  We stopped by after an appointment nearby.  I had an open faced chili cheese burger and my partner had a NM green chile burger. We also split a larger cinnamon roll. We totally enjoyed this neighborhood comfort food place.  Next time we're in the neighborhood we are stopping by again.
