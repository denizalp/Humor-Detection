Everything was really good for the most part was great service was even better & I plan to go again soon\nI got the fried chicken full plate white meat, it came with 3 sides\n\nFried Chicken - Pretty good,  crunchy, well flavored would definitely get again\nMacaroni and cheese - Good flavor just dry a tad disappointed because I live for Macaroni & Cheese\nCabbage - A tad sweet which threw me off at first but it was pretty good I liked it\nGreen Beans - Easily perfect\nKool-Aid - Also perfection
