\"One of the best steaks I've ever had\" seemed to be the sentiment of all 4 people in our golf trip group that visited Bourbon & Bones during our time in Scottsdale. Ambiance is upbeat compared to most steakhouses, and the food is second to none. Filet was cooked perfectly, we all shared mashed potatoes and mac and cheese which were both individually great.
