Sandwiches were delicious but my roast beef and Cole slaw was good but would have been out of this world if I could have had it toasted. Also this place is not for kids. They had NO high chair, only a booster seat and unstable chairs and their bathroom had NO changing table, I had to change my son in a hot car.
