Worst place for trying to relieve pain!!! All they want to do is give injections that don't work, they do not listen to you, I was suppose to and paid for sedation each time and hey would start the procedure and I wasn't sedated yet and I let them know and they just continued with the injections I was in tears they didn't care .. Just like cattle in there !! I would never recommend this place to ANYONE.. If I could leave no stars I would .. Just beware they are only in it for the money
