\"Holy moly donut shop\" the flies were flying and dead ones on my chair when we sat. Moldy bread was served then replaced.  Like most of the area the place needs to be cleaned then recleaned... new chairs as well!  Been coming here for years... need that clean  loving country grandma feel back. For now it was pretty scary.\nToy should be disinfected as well with EVERYTHING in that TOY bucket gift holder for every kid, my child's toy was sticky from what seemed like syrup.
