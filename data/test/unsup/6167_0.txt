You know what I like? \n\nFREE Samples.\n\nSimple simon is no cheap mofo when it comes to this. I sampled a couple hundred dozen before buying. They were all just so deadly that I couldnt decide. I got pumpkin, coconut pecan and something else that I cannot remember for reasons unknown. Oh yes! the roofie-colada...mmm, taht explains the lack of memory.\n\nGo buy a simple simon pie frozen, heat it up when guests are coming, pretend you made it.\n\n5 Plum thumbs out of 5
