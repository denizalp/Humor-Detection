Behold! Kate has arrived at the South Outlets!\n\nThis girl is extremely happy! I absolutely love her style and pizazz when it comes to handbags.  That have such a fun and fresh look with quality that I desire.\n\nThe store layout is beautiful and eye catching.  They coordinate the displays with the optional accessories available.  It has a clean contemporary appeal.  \n\nThis location offers great customer service.  The sales associates have been very helpful as far as pricing and sales.  \n\nA girl can never have enough handbags. My Kate collection will continue to grow!
