I don't use the drive thru much but I was in a hurry to drop off my rental car and parking was non existent. \n\nMy order a Angus burger combo and a apple pie. The burger was good, only exception there was excess mayo.. The fries were cooked perfectly - crisp and yummy. I've always been a fan of the apple pies at two for .99 or the same for one. Ended up getting only one.\n\nCan't go wrong with McDonald's if you're in a hurry for fast food and they offer healthy options.
