Went to Butterfield's because the average good comments here, but it was a horrible experience.\nWaitress was friendly but forget the milk for our coffee. My hubby ordered the  Mexicana Omelet and I the wildberry bliss crepe. Both were NOT fresh made.     The omelet was dry and hard. The mascarpone inside the crepe was... horrible. Overall, both dishes were not warm enough.\nI do NOT recommend this place. In our eyes, only good for people who just want to eat... for eating.\nThe upcoming days, we will return to Butters Pancake Cafe.
