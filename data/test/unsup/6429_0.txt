We stopped in last week to check out the new BBQ restaurant in the Valley.  The staff was so welcoming and appreciative of the business. \nI enjoyed the mac bowl with pulled pork - super rich, but very tasty.  They had already sold out of the brisket, so I am sure it is super tasty too - next time!
