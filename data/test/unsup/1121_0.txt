Our absolute favorite bar in Vegas. We stopped in several times a day during our 4 day trip. No matter what time you visit, day or night you will find fun people, great service and a good time! They play great music very loudly but it goes with the atmosphere. We will def be back. If you can't have fun here, you're not going to be fun anywhere.
