Completely LOVE this nail salon!! Brought my daughter for pedicures on a Saturday morning-- they were open at 9am so we could get in and out & on with our day-- Fabulous service- very friendly technicians- we had Kevin & Jennifer & they were amazing!! I absolutely love that they use tub liners & all tools were sanitized for each client. We will be back regularly here!!
