I have stopped here two time already this winter while visiting Vegas.  I have fallen in love with their corn cookie.  I think it is just a unique flavor than your typical chocolate chip cookies and I usually pick up three with a crack pie and soft serve with cereal topping.  All very unique and delicious.  Last time my friend and I bought 1 container of 10 cookies each.  Waiting for this summer to pick me some corn cookies on my way through Vegas!
