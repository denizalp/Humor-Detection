Very disappointed.. It was my first time trying Brazilian steakhouse and my work had a 2 for 1 deal so I figured why not. Bad idea. My boyfriend and I did the surf and turf rodizio; the meat was dry (not much of a selection), seafood was okay (I'm stretching the okay), salad bar had very few choices, and the hosts are rude, especially the shorter girl.. Will definitely not be coming back!!
