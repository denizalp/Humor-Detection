Two words: Thirsty Thursdays! Instead of those other bars in the area come here for happy hour.  $3 for all drafts (I had the Brew Kettle White Rajah, boyfriend got the Celis Grand Cru) and $3 Whole Wings.  $18 for 2 Dozen Wings and 2 Craft Beers is an absolute steal! Plus you get to drink\/eat all this in a beautiful setting. What more can you ask for??
