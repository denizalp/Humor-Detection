It's amazing to take a vacant building for 25 plus year and make it a fun vibrant space. Every detail is masterfully placed. The bar makes you want to stay all day, but the real treat is the food. The guacamole is the best and the ceviche is extremely flavorful. The main course meals are matched in detail by the place. The spices are perfect (not too hot and not too bland). The typical and traditional Mexican staple- the beans- are great.
