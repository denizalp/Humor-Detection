I come here a few times and my experience is always amazing !!! Tonight we had ozzy and he was soooo nice ! He always came at the right time when we need something. Super attentive and always made sure we were happy :) Zach also came by a couple times to check up on us for extra napkins or drinks, etc! Both of them made our experience at GEN phenomenal ! :)))
