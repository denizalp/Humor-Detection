Love this location and have been coming here for a few years, but since the implementation of self checkout I dread shopping here. Bring back the staff that got me checked out in no time. The wonky machine that requires a person to scan your mobile phone PC Plus points barcode is horrendous. Don't get me started on the \"Please put the item back in the bag...\"message. It's enough to make someone go bonkers. Disappointed with Loblaw. 2 star rating stays until I see those checkout lanes lit up with staff again
