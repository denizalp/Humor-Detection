Always consistently good here. Nice selection of proteins, carefully prepared guacamole. VERY good vegetarian selections if so inclined. Try the beet and goat cheese taquitas....EXCELLENT FLAVOR. Margarita's are tasty, some good flavors ...red bell pepper is a favorite, as well as cucumber. Prices are fair and plenty of food. One of our favorite casual places to get some consistent food .
