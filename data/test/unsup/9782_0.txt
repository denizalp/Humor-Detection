Ditto. Wonderful ambiance, good place to bring guests, worth the drive. I've had the Seafood Enchiladas (3.75 stars) and the Pollo Fundido (4 stars). What brings El Encanto up to a solid 4 stars overall is that ambiance. Relaxing, romantic, quaint, peaceful, blah blah blah.\n\nOnly sour note is that both times I've been, the service\/servers weren't that impressive. But not horrendous enough to keep me away.
