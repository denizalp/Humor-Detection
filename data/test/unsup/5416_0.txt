Fell immediately in love with the dark and floral decor. Ordered the dark chocolate chip cookie, and the vanilla tea latte with oat milk. I didn't particularly like it. My friend ordered an iced chai tea with oat milk and it was flavorful and delicious! We ended up trading haha but we both loved their chocolate chip cookies, I highly recommend those! I will be back for those little devils! Their Blackout cake was good too! It's basically a chocolate cake with vanilla icing.\n\n(P.S. - everything, and I mean everything is 100% vegan.)
