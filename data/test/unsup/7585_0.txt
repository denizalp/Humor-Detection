Beware....if you cancel service they will send you to collections.  This small outfit  didn't come to pick up their equipment, and then sent me to collections.  They never returned my call to schedule a time to get their equipment or send a letter....However....I must admit, for a small outfit they did provide a quality product and I was satisfied with their service.
