This place was really disappointing. We ordered a pound of ribs, a pork sandwich, and various sides. The meat was average and underwhelming. I was really not thrilled to spend 50 bucks here - the quality was something I'd spend 20 bucks on at the most. I think they have the food priced to pay the bills; it's not priced based on the quality.
