A lap dance was pretty much forced onto my boyfriend. Not worth the $20 that they charged. \n\nI had found a deal online saying free limo and drinks and free entry. yes the limo was free, and the entry was free in theory. We ended up paying $33 for two drinks a piece, which excluded drinks with more than one alcohol. \n\nNeedless to say we were there for less than an hour and we would not go back.
