What a great restaurant!  Wonderful service, great food and a lovely menu. Very easy location right outside Fashion Sq near a lot of other great restaurants. Great fish, so fresh and such a great selection. Really nice atmosphere and easy to get into on a Friday night. Definitely should be put on anyone's list for seafood in Scottsdale.
