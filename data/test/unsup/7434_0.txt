Been here twice during my visit to Vegas.\n\nMy brother got the All You Can Eat, I got California roll with brown rice, and chicken teriyaki, and hubby got the beef teriyaki. Chicken teriyaki was mediocre at best. Dark meat and SUPER fatty chicken. I will pass next time. Hubby said beef teriyaki was good. Brother's pieces of sushi came in two pieces, the shrimp option looked pathetic. \n\nThere is a good chance I will come back since it's pretty close to the strip, and prices are good for it being Vegas. But I'll stick with just sushi next time.
