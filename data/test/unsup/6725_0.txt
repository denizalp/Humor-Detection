I'd love to review the place.  Got there at 9:03 on a SATURDAY night.  Place was jammed.  But they were closed!  Apparently, the owners aren't aware that folks are flooding back into town.  Drive thru Cave Creek.  You can't move in the town on a Friday Saturday night it's so jammed!    Missing a lot of business!!!
