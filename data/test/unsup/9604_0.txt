My husband is pretty handy but you have to have a back up!  I had an emergency brake problem and they inspected it ASAP.  Bumped me to the top of the list.  Not only did they see me as soon as I screeched in but since it was a simple fix (a slipped pad clip) they didn't charge me.  WHAAAAA!  Honest, nice and helpful.  Not words I use for all car places.  \n\nThanks guys...you are my go to back ups when the hubby is out of his league or out of town.
