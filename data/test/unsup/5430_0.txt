Decent selection and prices. However, the checker told a racist and fatphobic joke about sitting between an Indian woman who supposedly smelled like curry and a fat man who smelled \"bad\" in some way.\n\nIt's *possible* that this actually happened, but the way he framed this was \"lol Indian lady\" and \"lol fat man\", which makes me very uncomfortable and seems unwelcoming.
