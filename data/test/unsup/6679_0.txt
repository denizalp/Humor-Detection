We were in the area craving Indian and found this place on Yelp. Drove past it and had to turn around so be mindful of that. Servers\/management are very friendly and attentive. Lunch buffet was pretty freakin good and it comes with champagne. I decided to have a King Fisher instead and they didn't charge. If your I. The area check it out.
