I was liking this place but the handle was so hard to push down I did it and it hurt me when it came up.  It feels bruised and it almost took me away from eating but wow they need to fix that, I don't like it and it's not safe for little kids to be doing that.  \n\nThe yogurt is nice, I like all the selections they have, and topping are neat too like brownies, crushed cookies and marshmallows. \n\nStaff is nice too, but my hand still hurts.
