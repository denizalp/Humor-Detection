I decided to give the restaurant another opportunity to change my opinion . The waiter was friendly\nBut  there was no bread that came out as a appetizer . The service was slow. I tried their green fried tomatoes poorboy with jam . This was tasteless.  The gumbo again had no vegables and was too salty.  I ordered a cup and just got the side .This place needs a lot or changes
