When you're on the Las Vegas Strip and someone says they want nachos - where do you go?\n\nNacho Daddy.\n\nI'd never been to a nacho themed restaurant before. 10+ nacho varietals is pretty unusual - everything from traditional to buffalo\/ranch. There's even a gluten free section of the menu! \n\nI would not recommend the tacos. Stick with the nachos and a beer or margarita. Safe and easy. Even on a busy night it's pretty hard to mess up that order. \n\nDefinitely not fancy. Definitely not classy. Definitely good enough.
