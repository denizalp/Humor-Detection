It was about 3 years ago,\n\nthis restaurant made me wait 2 hours for a cold dish that they serve to us on the patio outside next to the dumpsters... when I complained to management about the location of our table near the dumpster, he told me and my guest that we should try this place when it's not so busy if we want nice seating.\n\nnever again will i be in this trough...\n\nI have blacklisted this place and use it as an example of poor customer service.
