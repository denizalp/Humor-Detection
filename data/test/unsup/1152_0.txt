Have never visited the Gym or Vegas, however I will be taking a trip to Vegas in Oct and I hope to at lease get a chance to see and take pictures since I'm unable to get in. Big fan, I have followed Mayweather since he turned pro. I even went back and watched him in his amateur fights. Not only is he the best pound for pound, he is the smartest when it comes to building his brand. Mayweather have set the standards for those following his footprint.
