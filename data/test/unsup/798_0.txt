Went here on a Saturday night around 9 PM. At first there weren't as many people but as the night went on there were more and more people. Had a plate of nachos and honey garlic wings. Wings were not bad had a lot of sauce and nachos were just like any traditional nachos. If you lie watching live sports there is a sufficient amount of TV all around the restaurant. I am just not used to eating in very dark environments so if you enjoy eating in dark environments this is the place for you :)
