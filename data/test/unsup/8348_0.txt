Changing the name from cabanas to the Prescott does not change how bad this complex is. Unless mark Taylor is planning to gut the property and redo everything it's still the same horrible complex with a new paint job. Fire, flood, broken Ac, no screens, bugs, threats of towing for having an old car. Worst place I've ever lived.
