After a long night at Body English, the remainder of our group stopped by here to grab something to eat. Think of it as a little break before we headed to the after-hours club Drais :) I wasn't really hungry, so all I had was the red velvet cake. Sad to say, it was way too sweet and rich. It was also so moist that the texture of the cake was that of the same as the cream cheese frosting. Yuck.
