My wife and I went there on Sept 7th while visiting Henderson.  This place rocks. The staff was so helpful, nice and polite.  They recommended what would be best for us to order since we weren't familiar with the menu. We got out food, I had Beef Ribs my wife had Pork ribs,  both orders were huge and priced. The Ribs were to die for, DELICIOUS!!!!! The side dishes are delicious as well. I would highly recommend this place , you cant go wrong . Thank you to the staff and Chefs.
