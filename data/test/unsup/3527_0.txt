The most awesome banana nut muffin is what you must have with your breakfast...you can get regular ol' toast anywhere, so don't waste the opportunity. Great selection of breakfast items and I especially like the whole wheat or buckwheat options on their pancakes. Christian served us swiftly, with humor, and an awesomely entertaining  (Jersey?) accent. We've been here twice, so far, and from what we see...all the servers are amazing. And for us, that's just as important as good food. \"Glad we had this talk.\"
