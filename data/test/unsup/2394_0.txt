The food is okay, nothing stellar but what put me off is that they refuse to drive one block away at lunch to do delivery. Really? If you're going to do delivery, and I know it's busy at lunch, but guess what, it's also an order! I took my business elsewhere who were more than glad to deliver my order. Don't say you're delivery if you're only delivery after 5pm.
