The food here is just ok. My children love this place. It's family friendly and works for us at times.\n\nFood- ok. I usually order a guacamole burger which has guacamole, bacon and cheese served with a juicy beef patty. You really can't go wrong with those ingredients. \n\nService- good. The servers usually try to please my children and that makes me happy. My children love to end their meals with a gummy burger from the bar.
