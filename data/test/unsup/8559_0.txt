This place is pretty good, as long as you know what to expect.. It's just bar food - don't have crazy high standards, and you will be pleased! The wings are pretty good and so are the apps and the \"food truck\" items. The most surprising thing is that the salads are actually pretty good, too (I've only done the build your own salad). Drink prices are decent, and Music bingo on Tuesday nights never disappoints!! It's a great late night spot, and one of the better options in the area.
