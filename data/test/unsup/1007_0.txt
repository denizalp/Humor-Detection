**********voyeur shower*********\n\nVery nice hotel.  They are still working on a few glitches,  but the staff were very gracious and accommodating.  \n\nThe shower is fantastic.  Be forewarned though that the showers have a full length,  floor to ceiling two-way mirror in them.  If someone is in the shower,  and another is in the bedroom with the lights out,  they have a true voyeur experience and can see everything!!
