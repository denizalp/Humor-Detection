the $9.99 steak and lobster special got us in the door.  It was actually better than I thought it would be for the price!  The only real issue is the wait.  Not only are you waiting for a table, but the waiter stops by once in a blue moon, so order your entre as soon as you sit down!  We finished our meal and still had to wait about 20 minutes for a waitress to give us our check so we can leave.  We still gave her a good tip though.
