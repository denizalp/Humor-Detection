My husband and I had a chance to see this show a couple of weeks ago and we loved it. We thought everyone performing did such a fantastic job.  There was a lot of talent on that stage (especially Gabriel Burrafato, \"aka\" Dean Martin)!  The energy onstage was great and the music was awesome.  I couldn't help but \"dance\" in my seat and sing along.  I'd definitely see this show again the next time I'm there.  If you are a fan of the Rat Pack era music (...even a fan of music, in general), then you won't be disappointed!
