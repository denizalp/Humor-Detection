Stay here if:\n\n1. You enjoy being solicited every time you walk through the door or head for your room.\n2. You love the stale smell of vintage cigarettes from 20 years ago.\n3. You like housekeeping that does not respect your \"do not disturb\" sign\n4. You like beds so cushy that your body sinks down and pillows so fluffy that your head is perpendicular.\n5. You do not have extra money to spend and have exhausted all of your other options for accommodations.\n\nEven despite #5, just go stay at a hostel or couch surf.
