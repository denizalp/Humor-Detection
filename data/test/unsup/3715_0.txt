Great prices, fantastic bagels and a very friendly staff. Even at 6 AM on a Sunday morning.\n\nIf you want the bagel equivalent of watching your kid graduate from college, go visit the Bagel Man. Your only disappointment will come when you realize that you just ate 13 bagels in one sitting and now you have no leftover bagels. \n\nBut seriously. I ate 13 bagels in one sitting.
