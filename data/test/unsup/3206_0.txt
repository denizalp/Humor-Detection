During my 11 day work trip to Las Vegas (where I managed not to kill myself), I visited this Cheesecake Factory location a couple of times. \n\nOh wait. This isn't another Cheesecake Factory? It's actually the Grand Lux Cafe?\n\nWow. This place had me fooled.\n\nRegardless, this place features a friendly staff, good food, decent prices, and very flexible hours. Had I came here drunk, my rating might have been 4 stars.
