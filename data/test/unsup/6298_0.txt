There are two or three other little grocery stores closer to my place, but I always walk a little further to get to Carload.\n\nThey've got a better organic selection, cheaper prices, fresher produce, and a bigger selection of flowers. Oh, and they accept debit and credit cards, which saves me a trip to the bank.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, it's the best choice for produce if you live in Bloor West Village.
