I just had my third tatto done here and I must say I am beyond satisfied. I walked in randomly at noon on Monday with a friend of mine, told the guy what I wanted and he had it drawn up in less than 15 minutes and drawn well at that. Although, getting a tattoo isn't always the most pleasant of experiences, this one was a good one. The artist was professional and did and exceptional job and I couldn't be happier with my latest piece and I definately plan on going back for my next one.
