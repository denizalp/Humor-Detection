Used my 2 for 1 deal McCafe drink coupon. Can't argue with that deal.\n\nOrdered and paid for 2 strawberry and cream pies but found out they only had one :( so the manager offered me 2 apple pies instead to make up for the snaffoo.\n\nVery good service during this drive thru visit and nice recovery once the mistake was realized.\n\nThanks Ronny! I'll be back.
