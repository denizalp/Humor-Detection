I am not sure who put the reviews up but when a company charges $49.00 just to come out and give you an estimate of work I say watch out! Beware. There are other companies who do not charge you at all. The whole reason for a free estimate is to allow the customer to price shop. Makes me wonder if the have people doing the reviews for them.
