The wait was quick since we decided to sit at the bar.  But it was Fathers Day so there was a long line.  I like how the place wasn't smokey.  The smoked is sucked into the grill area rather than a vent above the table.  The food was good! They ran out of the Kalbi style meat though.  The appetizers were good.  The salad was simple and light.  They don't have much dipping sauces (brisket sauce and sesame oil) was all they had.  But over all good for the price.
