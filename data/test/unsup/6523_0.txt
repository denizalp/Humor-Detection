I love love love Shortleash hot dogs. The hot dogs are big and they will fill you up. The most wonderful thing about Shortleash is that you can replace every hot dog option with a vegetarian option! Completely veggie friendly. \n\nThe prices aren't bad and last time I was there they had $2 beer specials. Any kind of beer you could want, they have. It's super casual with a laid back vibe. One of my fave casual restaurants in downtown Phoenix. Plus the patio is pet friendly! I highly recommend this place!
