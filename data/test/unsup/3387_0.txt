Well it's a good thing that Fat Boy is located across town from me. Otherwise, I'd be a regular and that could be very dangerous. \n\nI don't know what's better, their burgers or the cheesesteak sandwiches? My husband and I usually get one of each and split them. Plus, you can't beat their prices and who doesn't love cheap eats?!?\n\nWriting this review is making me hungry, so I might have to go clear across town for one of their juicy burgers. After I go to the gym, of course.
