I love Beard Papas!  Had it in Hawaii, San Francisco, and Thailand.  My favorite is the strawberry filling. Fresh strawberries and aromatic. Waiting to have it at this location.  Last night they only had vanilla filling.  The original puffs were buy one get one.  About $3.50  Love! So light and not too sweet. So happy to have it in Vegas.
