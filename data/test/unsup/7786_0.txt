This is such a great little tea shop! I took my friend on a lady date and we enjoyed our lovely tea flavors with tasty Japanese mochi and matcha cake. The prices are very reasonable and they even sell imported Japanese tea, along with the sweetest teapots and tea accessories. The owner is so sweet and friendly. She prepared our tea for us and was very informative about each type of tea. Definitely coming back here, and I want to recommend this place to everyone :)
