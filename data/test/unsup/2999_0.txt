You had ONE job: We ordered online spicy buffalo & got 2 diff flavors instead. Luckily it tasted okay, but NOT what we ordered. Not as crispy as I'd prefer, either. \n\nI also requested the \"no napkins, trying to save the earth\" option you get on Grub Hub and instead got a shit load of napkins. Seriously, paying attn to detail would make your customers happy.
