This is an excellent facility.  Both Dr Cellars and Dr Hehn are great vets and very professional.  Their prices are reasonable and its relatively easy to get an appointment.  They have always given my dogs excellent care and take time to listen to all my concerns.  I highly recommend Desert Hills Animal Hospital.
