Early dinner at PTs tonight. We ordered the finger an fry bucket , which was pretty good, probably could've put more fingers in the bucket, but it's cool, was very tasty. Than we ordered the spinach dip with garlic toast an chips, which I loved very much! The atmosphere is mellow, not too noisy, very clean and our waitress was very nice\/pleasant. \nI enjoy this bar for it's location, cleanliness and tasty food. \nWill I go back? Haha I've been going here before yelp was taking reviews! Of course I'll be back!!
