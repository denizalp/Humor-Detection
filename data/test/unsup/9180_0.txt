My husband & I enjoy Coral Sushi for, well, the sushi. We love that they offer a new sushi roll every month, to change things up a bit. And their soups and edamame are very good, too. But we are not fans of the hot entrees this place serves. The owner & her employees have always been very friendly & accommodating. The only thing we do not like about Coral Sushi is their limited hours open during the daytime.
