So simple, so easy to order, so delicious. Those red and white sauces are cracktastic. It is good food fast so don't go in there expecting fine dining like some of these people writing reviews. The guys working there are courteous. They fry those french fries up on demand and I LOVE some good hot crinkle cut fries.
