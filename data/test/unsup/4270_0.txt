$18 for a haircut that is close to a Magic Cut\/Supercut quality.\n\nPopped in today for a cut...\n1) sideburns trimmed not levelled. It wasn't until I got home that I noticed they were a good 1\/2 \" off to each other. Great...I was THAT guy walking around Yonge St. today....\n2) back of my neck not shaved properly...had to break out my electric trimmer and do it myself\n\nI guess you get what you pay for when you spend all of 10 minutes in a \"stylist's\" chair.
