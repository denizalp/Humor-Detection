Let me first say they're very nice. But the room was no where near the quality and fun as others I've done. If I am doing an escape room, I expect to be locked in it. There was a curtain between our room and the hall way. Twice an employee came in and asked how we were doing. Very distracting and not something we wanted. Context of the clues were subpar and not challenging. Story didn't make sense. Won't be returning.
