Grody!\n\nI walked in and was overwhelmed by a really unpleasant smell, but I soldiered on.  Then, while at the sushi bar, I see the sushi chef putting fake crab on my plate.  I immediately stopped him, confirmed the crab was fake, and got the hell out of there as fast as I could. No, no, no, no, no!
