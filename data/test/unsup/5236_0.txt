The sister property of Wynn Las Vegas, this place is an extension of the Wynn's crown jewel.  It shares many of the same qualities as the other property.  The towers look identical from the outside, but the rooms at Encore are slightly better than Wynn.\n\nI like to take clients and associates here for dinner or drinks as it is a great place to conduct business and have a good time.\n\nWill I return?  You bet.
