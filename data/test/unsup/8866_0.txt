This subway location is brand new and it's open until 10pm. Its a small subway, with four tables inside and three outdoor seating tables. Eveything is very clean. The sandwich bar is really fresh, no nasty lettuce and old tomatoes! I checked out the bathroom too and it was clean. The staff is really nice and friendly.\n\nThis location is conveniently located right next to a Starbucks too. Right on the corner of Flamingo and Eastern. They did a nice job preparing my $4 lunch special black forest ham 6\" sub. I will definately be back :-)
