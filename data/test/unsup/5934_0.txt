I was really delighted with this meal!  The restaurant is very nice looking for starters, my martini was excellent, the ceasar salad and onion soup were great, but the filet mignon was prepared so excellently that I was able to cut it with a butter knife!  It also tasted amazing.  The service was great too.  I did not have dessert so I cannot comment on that.  I would undoubtedly return here next time I am in Vegas.  Other meals I had were at Wynn and Encore, and this one was much better!
