Placed an order online for delivery, and it had an option to tip driver via credit card or cash, chose to do it in person with cash. Guy makes it to our place and calls us and mentions that we did not tip them online, as if we had to anyways... You guys get paid minimum wage, not 4 dollars an hour for starters... And secondly, you don't rudely mention that we should tip you, even though we planned to anyways... Poor service everyone.
