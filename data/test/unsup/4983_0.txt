I would rate this branch lower, if I could.  My account has been with this branch for 15 years.  Went in at 9:30AM this morning to get a notary to sign a paper.  Only 2 other customers in the bank.  Customer service person that greeted me was learning how to use her IPad.  Told me I needed an appointment for the notary and no appointments were available until the afternoon.  I walked to the next bank down the street, Compass, and got the document signed right away.  If you want good customer service, avoid BofA.
