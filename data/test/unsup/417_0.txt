I love this hotel. The rooms are huge, the bathrooms are huge, the service is great. We've stayed all over town and it's our favorite. Rooms are much bigger than the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth and the Ritz. \n\nThe bathroom is huge-a-mongus. Deep whirlpool tub, separate shower, huge counterspace, flat screen tv... \n\nComfy, fluffy beds you just want to wallow in all day.... \n\nThe only downsides... $15 per day Wi-Fi, expensive daily valet $32. \n\nYou can find good deals online and often they have hard to beat specials. We'll keep coming back!
