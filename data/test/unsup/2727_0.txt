Overall - Food was good, but the wait was brutal. \n\nthe place has a very herbal alcoholy smell... this is probably from the drunken chicken hotpot which a lot of tables were ordering. \n\nthe food has never really failed here.  however, getting a table was hard.  Its hard for me to complain about the situation but basically we were waiting for a long time.. and people who came after us got tables before us.  albeit, they were very elderly people. Out of respect, i didnt want to complain.
