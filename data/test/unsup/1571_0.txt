Food was really good and even the half portions were large enough to satisfy 2 hungry full-grown American men. I enjoy having my awesome nephew visiting me, and we ate well. The lobster, crab & artichoke dip was superb (maybe a little more dip). The cheese & bread fuzed together in my french onion soup, so this was the ONLY soup I ever needed a knife for.
