This location isnt always in my route but when im not too far i make sure to do a quick pit stop :) i will buy some meat for my home and ofc a sandwich for the road. Their filet mignon is sonething else ! Straight from heaven. ..I find the employees nice, friendly and hard working! The only little downside if you are planning to buy big quantity of meat is that they do not accept credit cards !
