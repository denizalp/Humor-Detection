Wonderful atmoshphere and pleasant staff.  There is an excellent variety of choices on the menu and all seem to be prepared with quality in mind.  I can't express strongly enough how amazing some of their desserts are, especially the white chocolate brownie ala mode.  \n\nGreat place for business dinners.
