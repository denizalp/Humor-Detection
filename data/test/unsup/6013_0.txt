Crappy chain resturaunt.. Crappy and annoying. Crappy souvlaki, crappy falafel that always hurts my tummy afterwards. Crappy music they torture me with. I'm amazed this place gets so many positive reviews. It must be from the same people that rate Olive Garden as authentic delicious Italian. Go opa yourself.
