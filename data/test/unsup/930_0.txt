Eh, it was an okay experience. The girls are alright, some hot and some not, but I mean that's all in preference. What I didn't like was that we had to pay to get in and that even by Vegas standards the drinks were a little pricey. \n\nWith 5 girls, it was a blast to sit around the stage and show the ladies some love. Ahhh strippers, what the world would be without their low morals and fruity-vanilla scent? I hate to even think about it.
