We have been to this place several times and it never disappoints us! I love the freshly made pizza dough & hand picked ingredients! The authentic food is why we keep returning and not to mention the homemade ranch dressing is the best!!!\n\nThey also serve locally brewed beer, but you can also order other types of beer & drinks they have a full bar! The atmosphere is great laid back with outdoor sitting! The staff is really nice along with great service!!\n\nI recommend if you come to NoDa check out this spot - you can't go wrong!!
