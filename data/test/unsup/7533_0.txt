I really should explore not-so-attractive strip malls more because some of them have hidden gems like this one. After you are seated by the gracious hostess, you will have the challenging task of choosing from so many tempting dishes listed in the menu. The food is VERY flavorful, the curries really rich (watch for the heat, though; even \"mild\" packs a respectable kick), and the prices are great! Four and a half stars, probably going up to five with future visits.
