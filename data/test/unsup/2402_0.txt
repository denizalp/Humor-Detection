This is a late post from December 2..\nI had been dying to have a Christmas design on my nails..so when I went to Johnny with my idea he didn't hesitate to come up with this awesome xmas design.. I've gotten so many compliments. .Leslie and Johnny both are so nice and accomodating the shop is quiet and relaxing, unlike another shop down the street I won't name. Trang is awesome with the pedicures as well she is so detailed and meticulous. . I love coming here
