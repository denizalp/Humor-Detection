OK people...not sure what's going on here. So many mixed reviews makes me wonder if people want to write just to test out their keyboards.\n\nHere's what's up: La Paz blows major goats.\n\nThis place serves college cafeteria food and charges 20 bucks for it slopped onto a plate. Authentic my ass. If this is Mexican food, then I'm a Baptist preacher. I've had better tasting Mexican in a jar.\n\nSeriously La Paz, meet me over here at camera 3:\nYou can' t even make your own chips. That is weak.\n\n\nOne Star for You!
