Good, but not great. The service was exceptional, the food was good...but not great. All of the items were plated well, and served in a timely manner with the appropriate wine. However, there was nothing about the meal that left me with an unforgettable experience. George is definitely a great place, but shortly after you leave it all becomes a distant forgettable memory...
