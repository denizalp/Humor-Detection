Cute little bottles of Boris, appies for every taste and a super friendly bartender made my first experience here a positive one. The vegetarian quesadilla and the dumplings were fab, but the shrimp skewers need some work as they tasted fishy and the mango topping was bland. Sitting at the bar is extra fun as one of the bar tv's is a direct feed of the outdoor patio: was fun watching the patio folk get sloppy and almost knock over tables and think no one noticed.
