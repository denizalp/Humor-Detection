The interior is modern with a bit of a cold feeling to it. \nThis is decidedly not not a \"homey\" chill out place, and the music was horrific. As I sat down they were playing Justin Bieber (I'm not lying) and they followed it up with some like-sounding pop pap. Good god, I hope this isn't what our future neighbors are going to be like. \n\nThat said, my caramel latte was actually pretty good.\n\nI guess if you hate all of those \"crazy\" \"artsy\" places in the neighborhood this is your place.
