My boyfriend now calls me the shave ice snob because now all shave ice has to compare to Snowflake Shavery.  I consider that a complement.  :)\n\nMy last visit I got the medium size and had the extreme chocolate on one side and coconut delight on the other.  I think the pineapple overshadowed the coconut flavor though so next time I will have that left off.  It is such a great treat and at good protein boost too from the milk used.  \n\nI am actually craving more today....
