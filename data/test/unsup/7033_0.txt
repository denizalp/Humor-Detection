My friend and I went here today and used a Groupon for a manicure and pedicure. We had a great experience! The staff was so friendly and professional. The location was very clean and nice. I would definitely go back, even without a Groupon. The prices were very reasonable. The pedicure was heavenly. They massaged my legs for a LONG time and used hot rocks. We both loved our experience and walked away very relaxed.
