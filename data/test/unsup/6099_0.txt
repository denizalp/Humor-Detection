This place is great. Aside from the fact that it's a super local alternative from the questionable produce at Shur Save, it's always a great experience with a store full of ripe produce for low prices. What really makes this store great is the owner. She's always so enthusiastic and just happy about her store and your experience. Definitely check this place out.
