Toby's to me and many others is an institution of cheap beer, an oddly eclectic crowd, an oddly eclectic menu, and fantastic wings. These wings are half priced every night of the week except for Friday and Saturday (or perhaps they are just double priced on those nights), but basically you can get a pound and fries for $5. Or two pounds and fries for $10. And they're very good. And they come with a carrot stick. So how about that. Vegetables and meat...together. For $5.
