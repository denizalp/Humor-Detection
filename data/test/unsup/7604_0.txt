The parking structure I don't like. But that's like most the casinos. Some food is pretty dirt cheap & others aren't so cheap. They fool you by putting up other store prices but don't put the store's sale prices. I'm a super saver shopper so I know. The store feels cheap inside like Food4Less. Also they don't take credit cards. I really don't like that because I get 5% cash back on grocery with my credit cards. \n\nThey take cash, debit & ebt.
