My boyfriend and I frequent Gen multiple times a month. We always get great service, but Ozzy was outstanding. We brought my parents here for the first time during dinner and he was very approachable, attentive, and made sure we were having a good dining experience, especially for my parents visiting from out of town. My boyfriend and I will be sure to ask for Ozzy every time we come for dinner at Gen. (P.S. we also love Damien and Shea during the lunch hours).
