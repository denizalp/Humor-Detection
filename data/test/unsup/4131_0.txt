I am from Reno where AYCE is not only abundant, but incredibly fair priced and delicious. My fianc√©  and I have been trying to find the best all you can eat sushi in Vegas, and we may have just found it. \nThe rolls were good size, the customer service was awesome, the food came out super fast, and we liked the variety. We will definitely be back.
