Had a dealfind coupon so, I would have liked to have eaten at Casa Latina and given a review but arrived to an empty restaurant with a sign on the door \"vouchers not accepted on weekends\" which was not on the coupon. Went in and suggested that since the restaurant was empty they make be able to accomodate us- lady went back to the kitchen to check and the answer was no. Drove way out of our area to get here but won't give it a second chance - unfortunate.
