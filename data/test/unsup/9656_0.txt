The martinis are delicious and creative, but the food is lacking. Like other reviewers, I was hoping for a few more chocolatey choices in their entree selection. That aside, it would have been nice if the apps and entrees they do serve were better than mediocre.\nI might come here for drinks, but probably not food.
