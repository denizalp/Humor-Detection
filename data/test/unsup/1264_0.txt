Big B's Texas BBQ is the place to go for some great barbecue selections. I am not big into meat, myself, so I opted for the side choices. The corn on the cob was good, The smoked mac & cheese was great, and the cream\/cheesy corn was phenomenal. If you're in the Henderson area you should check it out, if you're anywhere else it's worth the drive.
