asked for towncar pickup from airport, got limo.  got comped since I shyte so much money here.  Suite.  Didn't stay in the room much.\n\ndon't take anything from the fridge or minibar.  there is an RFID on every food item.  If it is \"undocked\" for longer than 60 seconds, it will automatically charge your room.  \n\nrest of stay is pretty blurry.\n\nIf anyone wants a coupon code...I gots them!!!
