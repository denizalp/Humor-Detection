Sure you're pushing $7 a slice after tax on a piece of pepperoni pizza, but guess what? You're totally getting 2.5 slices in one. \n\nNot only that, but it's a damn good crust and requires far less of a hike than Secret Pizza if you are just wandering the strip! Located right outside of Planet Hollywood. Extra easy if you're intoxicated and feel the challenge of distance is too great to overcome. \n\nThey serve Diet Pepsi products and of course, Red Bull and beer. Not sure what type of Vegas establishment this would be otherwise...
