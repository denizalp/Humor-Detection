I booked online.  Driver was 15 minutes early.  I received a text confirmation of his arrival and a link with coordinates, in case there was confusion.  I had a great experience.\n\nRemember driver tips are not included in the Super Shuttle Fee.  I recommend this service.  Allow time in case they have to pick up others.  I had the van to myself.
