I have been going to Jamie Lee Metz for some time now for my treatments and I've never found anywhere else where you receive quite the same service. From the moment you walk in the door until you walk out, it's a relaxing and enjoyable experience. Leslie is my aesthetician and she's very experienced and performs a wonderful facial and massage. All the staff are helpful, thoughtful and polite. If you are looking for a reliable location to consistently go to in order to receive great service and procedures then this is the place for you.
