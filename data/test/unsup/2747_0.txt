I stopped here for lunch last Saturday as I was walking up Yonge towards Lawrence. This IS a nice place to hang out. It's a cozy and welcoming space that draws you in (as long as you open the outside pub door first).\n\nI ordered a pint and some fish and chips.  I'm not the biggest fan of deep fried fish, but the batter was fresh and everything (including the chips) were very crisp and delicious, and with no greasy aftertaste.  The coleslaw was also fresh. The service was also friendly, helpful and quick.
