A four star hotel? Really? the rooms felt like a high class motel ... dark and definitely past it's prime days. If this was an \"upgraded room\" I wonder what the original must have looked like !!!\n\nat least it was clean and comfortable so can't really complain except it's not worth the star rating at all!
