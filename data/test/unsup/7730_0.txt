What a lovely place to spend shopping and browsing. Great layout and helpful staff. Their selections are unique and well made. As a teacher, I am always looking for something to make my life easier and for attention holding products for my classroom. It is the must visit teacher supply stop. My children even love going there because they have games and activities on display for little hands and expanding minds. Be sure to check out the coupons because there are some great deals!
