So not Las Vegas, but in a good way ! Delicious sophisticated sharing plates, tapas style, so many rich flavors very hard to find in the US kitchen , it felt like our small miracle! We had the beet salad ( small and gentle), colorful cauliflower (strong and biting), grilled artichokes (best we ever had! Excellent marinade !), portobello flat bread (fabulous) and Ox tail risotto (sooo rich), brownie fudge butter bacon ice cream. If only they've had an espresso... Fun music and atmosphere, very friendly service, highly recommended, we'll surely come back !
