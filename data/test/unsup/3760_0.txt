Modern, spacious, and clean looking inside, yet there a faint smell of cigarette smoke in here for reasons unknown. We ordered one of their eye-catching unicorn kiss boba teas for the kids, and it looked very appealing, but really just tasted like a cup of sugar. I've had better boba tea at better prices, but I get it - Westgate isn't cheap to rent at, but this just wasn't an experience that has me wanting to go back. Nice looking place and drinks, but pricier than usual with a casino-like scent.
