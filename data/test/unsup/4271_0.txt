We decided to splurge and go to L'Etoile for my birthday, especially since Chef Tory just won the Iron Chef competition.  It was everything we expected.  A beautiful table by the window reflecting the city at night.  We did the a la carte menu and each had the appetizer, main dish and dessert.  Each course WAS presented like a painting on a canvas, and tasted delicious.  Highly recommended for that special night out.
