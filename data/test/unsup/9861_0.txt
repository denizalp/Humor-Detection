My friend recommended this place so I went on Friday evening and was welcomed by the staff and they accommodated my friend getting a manicure to be able to sit next to me as I got a pedicure, which I appreciated.  the essential pedicure is $32 and included a beverage-- they had a selection of teas and wines. \n\nNo massage chairs, but the staff were all very friendly and attentive to me. The leg massage and scrub used for my pedicure were fantastic!
