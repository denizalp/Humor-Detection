We stayed at the Arizona Grand for a sales meeting and had 'the rooste' one night... I was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the reviews. The St. Louis Spare Ribs were tasty and the view and atmosphere was great. It IS very touristy but that goes with the territory. Plan a sales meeting in Phoenix and be sure to book here. What a great time!
