Dr. Manny is a wonderful dentist. He's very gentle and very kind to kids and the parents. He's very thorough and doesn't rush you out. Also his staff is really great. Every single person in his office is very cheerful and patient. I am so glad we found him. I would recommend him to anyone who has kids.
