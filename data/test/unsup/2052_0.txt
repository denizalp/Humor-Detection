Been here a bunch of times.  Lately Ive been here more because its a central spot to meet family coming from all over.  Food is good.  Server girl are always awesome but last Saturday they were out of steak and bluberries for Bumbleberry.  Last time (after and Irish funeral)  they were out of Powers.  I dont drink Jameson.  Thats for sloppy frat boys.  The servers on both occasions said they had been out even the day before.  With an Aldi right up the block what does it take to get blueberries and steak??  And the whiskey?  Thats just unacceptable...
