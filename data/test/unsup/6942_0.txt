Service Department is very accommodating and informative!\n\nAfter a horrible experience with Don Miller's service department (you can read my review if you google them) I headed over to Russ Darrow and Chris was more than accommodating and informative about what was happening with my car and the process needed to correct the issue. If you are debating between Don Miller and Russ Darrow for service, I would hands down 100% recommend Russ Darrow.
