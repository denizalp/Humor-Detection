This was a great tour of the Valley of Fire! We went there last month and couldn't fault the day. Our driver was very friendly and right on time. We had perfect weather and got to take some great photos which I will upload when I get my camera back! The visitor center offers some history and insight into the area and had some nice souvenirs!
