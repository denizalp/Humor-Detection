Cool vibe inside. Picnic benches and chill music. Warehouse feel to the inside. The garage door stays open in the summer to let in a breeze and fresh air. Gets crowded but not overblown and not too noisy for a good convo. \n\nThey also have some good items that are good and some desserts. Option to sit at the bar too with a couple or large screen monitors with sports on. On a Saturday they show euro soccer.
