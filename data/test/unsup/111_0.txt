**Beer and fun review only**\nMen's room over by OSSO 8:57 PM, exited at 9:01 PM - \"Hey, wait a minute, where did everybody go?\" Cricket - cricket -tumbleweed. The Yelp party was unplugged.\nAn impromptu after party started at Texicali - couples dancing and swirling - watch your toes or you might lose them. Very loud. \"What's that?\" I said, \"it's very loud in here\". Good beer selection. Fast and frosty. Was too stuffed from party samples to eat anything else (but their \"street corn\" was quite tasty). Maybe I can make it back and try something off the menu.
