I was at the bar next door for a Seahawks game. The lady in the picture standing next to tow truck is reportedly the franchise owner. This lady insists on harassing the patrons of the bar about parking in her lot even though it is not full (See Picture). To be fair I also took a picture of the sign she has posted. I could fine two but none in the main lot.
