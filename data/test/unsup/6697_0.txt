We've been here a few times now and overall it is amazing. The BBQ chicken wrap and hulk smoothie are my favorites. It's also a plus that they serve breakfast all day so a late lunch can include pancakes or an omelette. \n\nThe only thing I haven't enjoyed was the sweet greens juice. It was incredibly bitter and made me sad. I usually love green juices but I would not recommend this one. \n\nThis place is definitely worth a try if you've walked past and wondered about the constant line that is often times nearly out the door.
