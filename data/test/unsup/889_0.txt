Loved it loved it loved it! Thank you Yelp ; ) The biggest shrimp cocktail ever! Love the inside, the staff was very friendly and attentive. Food was great ; ) and the decoration inside is really nice. So cozy! It wasn't so packed when I went so I hope they are as attentive and professional as they were when its more packed. Will deft. try this place again ; )
