It is defiantly one of the healthier options around this area. I saw a movie and my friend and I got smoothies. She didn't find any that interest her, I got the peanut paradise. It wasn't thick when you drank it, and feels watered down. But as I kept drink it it seemed to thicken a little and get more flavor. I might come here again after another movie (ps Panda Express and Starbucks are next door)
