This is our first visit to Pepper Mill and our last!! Service was horrible, waited for for 53 minutes to just get appetizers. There were 8 of us and only a few received their dinners  at a time. The manager was made aware of the situation but was too busy on his cell phone and going out to smoke. He never came over to our table but made his way to the bar!
