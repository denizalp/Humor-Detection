2 hour wait for guest list line WTF. \n\nMarque management needs to do a better job at crowd control. Bouncers are total douschebags.  We tipped the bouncer and we still had to wait...\n\nI dont care how nice it is inside, all I know is that IM NEVER COMING HERE again!\n\nThis 2 hour wait is ridiculous.
