I'm not going to repeat what everyone already knows. This place is delicious and by far beats their competitors. No ice crystals, no powder concoctions. Just all natural and fresh ingredients. My favorites are green tea and strawberry, but cantaloupe is my new love. As for toppings, it's usually mochi, strawberries, mango, boba and condensed milk. I'm glad they set up shop in China town. Their Henderson and Decatur locations were both equally 11 miles from my house. Now I only have to travel 8 miles for this yummy treat.
