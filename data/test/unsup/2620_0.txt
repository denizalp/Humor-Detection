Don't waste your time or if you insist do not order the blend 'Flautas', no taste. The menu states guacamole and refried beans. Instead All three orders on my table came w\/o guacamole and a bed of rice. Asking the waiter if there was something missing she said no. When I asked about guacamole she said she COULD bring me some. That's fishy. And the price tag for the dish: $16. So if you are craving Mex go to Edgar Tacos 4 blocks down. You won't regret.
