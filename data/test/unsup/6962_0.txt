Went here last week to pick up some pad thai on the way home and all I have to say is the place looks cool but the food is pretty bland..\nAs most have said, nothing special about this place.\n\nService was pretty good, I didn't wait that long for the food.\n\nNot sure I'd recommend this one. Save your $$
