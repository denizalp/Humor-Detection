Oh man! So good!\n\nI always get the King's Ramen and it has a rich, deep smokiness to the broth that is so addictive. I also love all the components; different kinds of seaweed, tea egg, fish cake etc.\n\nAlso; Octopus Bals are yummy pillowy marshmallows of savoury-sweet deliciousness.\n\nThis place gets some pretty low ratings which I really don't understand as it is certainly the best Ramen I have had in the city.\n\nAlso; last time I was there, Marc Thuet and his wife snaked our table the moment we got up to pay. Conviction Kitchen!
