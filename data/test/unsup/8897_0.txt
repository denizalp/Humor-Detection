Great service! Our waitress was very attentive and nice. The food was super good and after we ordered it was a quick turn around time to it being served which is always nice when your in a busy restaurant. I would say to put yourself on a wait list before you actually get there because it was extremely busy on Sunday morning. I would definitely go back!
