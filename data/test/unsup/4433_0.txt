I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. My husband's family was visiting from out of state and we decided on The Spotted Donkey for dinner. We approached the hostess stand and asked for a table for four. The hostess asked if we had reservations and my husband said no, and then asked if we needed them to be seated. She laughed in his face and replied, \"Well it would certainly help!\" We turned around and walked out, deciding to eat at Cartwright's instead.
