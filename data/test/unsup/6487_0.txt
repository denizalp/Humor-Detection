Believe it or not, the customs process I experienced during the exit from Canada into the United States here was worse than what I experienced traveling to\/from Mexico. Chaotic, unbelievably long lines and an inadequate number of staff. I arrive two and a half hours early before my flight, and was so glad I did because it took over an hour to get through the process. As an able-bodied, young woman, I was exhausted standing in line for so long, so I can only imagine how unpleasant the experience must've been for the older folks waiting.
