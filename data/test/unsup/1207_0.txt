Some friends and I were in Phoenix from So Cal visiting. My buddy who lives there said we should check this place out, super cool vibe; music, atmosphere, drinks and the staff were all spot on! I travel a lot and have never ran into a place quite like this. Great service from all the staff there, especially two really cute girls who worked at one of the bars by the door( Briana and Maddy) if you decide to stop by, Deff look out for them! I'll for sure stop by next time I'm in town!
