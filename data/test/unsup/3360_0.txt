Super fresh bagels and awesome selection of cream cheese, cheddar chive is my personal favorite. I can't give 5 stars just because of how long you have to wait sometimes, especially on weekends. I've waited for upwards of 15-20 minutes for a bagel sandwich when it doesn't seem like it should take that long. Food is very good though, parking is a bit tricky but usually you can find a spot on the street.
