I really wanted to like this restaurant but I feel like they try way too hard. The hipster ambiance is played out and unoriginal. I ordered the beet and goat cheese salad. Unfortunately it had pink store bought mini marshmallows scattered across the top. The \"whimsy\" they were attempting to add to the dish was just gross and out of place. Not impressed. There are much better restaurants right down the street.
