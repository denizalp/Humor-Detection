The people who work here exceed in friendliness. If this rating were based just on their efforts they would receive 4-5 stars.\n\nThis lower rating is due to the out of date airport. As I sit here in Gate B, not to mention my walk through the airport, I am rather bored with the surroundings. The carpet, chairs, paint, entertainment, lack of art, and subpar food are all surprising for being the gateway to Las Vegas. This airport is as bad as Oakland's before their makeover.
