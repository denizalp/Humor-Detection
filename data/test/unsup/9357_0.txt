Called in to ask if they could check my AC because it stopped working all of a sudden... They checked my car as soon as I got there. Customer service is excellent!!! I forgot the guy's name that helped me but he helped me out a lot and I was really blessed with his kindness! I apologize for not remembering his name... Having no AC running in your car is no joke at all especially here in Vegas!!! Thank you again!!!! Your help was greatly appreciated!!!!
