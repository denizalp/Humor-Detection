OK This is usually where I go for a car wash because it's convenient.\n\nNO matter how many times I tell them not to mess with seat position they always do! \nAlso they never lock my floor mats back down after vacuuming??? \nI don't get it ,they know they unlocked them and moved them around ,why don't they have the decency to lock them back into place?\n\nAnd my car is really never clean enough either, Why do I still waste my money you ask............... Well I'm not gonna wash the damn thing!\n\n2* and half stars
