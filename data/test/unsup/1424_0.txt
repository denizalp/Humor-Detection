This place is soooooo good and reminds me of Japan! It did take a bit long to get our orders but once it came, everything was great! I got the pork tenderloin pork katsu while my bf got pork katsu curry. Mine was so tender and crispy without being too oily, and I also am obsessed with the salad dressing! Can't get enough of it.\n\nMy boyfriends curry katsu with cheese was also amazing, the cheese adds an extra creaminess that was perfect! I don't feel guilty after eating this even if it's fried which is a plus!
