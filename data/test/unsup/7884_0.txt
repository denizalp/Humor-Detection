Okay even with Groupon giving 60% off you still have to spend $200 to use the $100 certificate that cost $40 so we wound up spending  $175 with tip for 3 of us and the food was nasty! The service was awful Texas de Brazille is much better this was no bargain it was the cheapest cuts of meat and for the first time I agree with most of the critics on here!  Waste of money! avoid!
