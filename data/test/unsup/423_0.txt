Ordered a pizza for pickup for dinner with my parents.  Good customer service, but we were not that impressed with the pizza.  The toppings were pretty good, but the crust was so dry!  Now we did try the thin and cripsy crust, so I guess that's on us, but I really do not recommend that style of crust unless you want a cracker crust.
