Good service & bad food quality:\nI ordered a thali tray, the chicken drum stick came cold from one side?? and too dry to make u think it's cooked on the same day, so was the soup, cold. After notifying them I had it replaced. But only thinking whether ur eating something that was probably a reheated  leftover from the night before (and I bet with chicken u can always tell!) plus a cold soup made me give them one star\/5, I made it two just for the sake of the good service that I got.
