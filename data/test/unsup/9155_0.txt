Dr McClammey is the most emotionally erratic doctor I have ever experienced. For whatever reason, his head was not in the game today and he was unable to explain logically why he was electing his course of action. Halfway through a procedure he quit and said he didn't have time. \n\nThank god I found another endodontist that was able to help me out in just 1 hour and he was pain free.
