This place is across the street from Axis-Radius, it tends to get very crowded inside, especially when it's cold outside.  In fact, it was so crowded on my 23rd birthday a few years ago, I managed to puke all over the floor and no one noticed.  I feel kinda bad about it, but hey it was my birthday.  All in all a cool place to sit and talk to your friends in the patio area before heading out to another club.
