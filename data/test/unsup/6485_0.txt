Ever since this resort was featured on the show Hells Kitchen in 2007 (where the winner became the executive chef of the fine dining restaurant in there) I've been anxious to check this place out & I finally did!\n\nIt's one of the cleaner, neater, non-smoker friendly , swankier \"local casinos\" in Las Vegas.   The casino floor is huge. Multiple wings with chock-full- of Slot machines ! Plenty of table games also. \n\nPlenty of food around - from \"food court\" quick fixings to  buffet to restaurants.  \n\nOutside in the immediate area is plenty of shopping and restaurants.
