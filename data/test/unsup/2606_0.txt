Just Celebrated my Sisters Birthday here, and we all had a Fabulous time !  they had a Great Band!  the food we had was greasy and good !  the Smores were the best, not too many Restaurants offer Smores, also it was a thursday night that we went, and they had a free Dance Lesson, which was so much fun, would difinitely recommend this place for a FUN time !
