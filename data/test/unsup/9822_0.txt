This place smells like a scam. The windshield repair guy just made me laugh, trying to sell me on a practically invisible chip that will never be seen by anyone. That alone made me want to leave but I still tried the car wash, which was substandard and overpriced. From now on I wash my own car, not worth keeping places like these open. I don't know how these guys sleep at night.
