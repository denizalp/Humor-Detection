Comfort food at its best. Located in the Colonial Arcade it looks like vintage 1950's Americana. Formica table tops and a kitchen that consists of a grill and a fryer. The atmosphere fits you like a familiar old coat. The service is exceptional and the food. Roast Beef, Liver and Onions, Meatloaf, and Breaded Pork Chops are all done to perfection. Mashed potatoes like my mother made with the best brown gravy ever. Apple pie for dessert. Try it once and you will be back weekly. It's just that good.
