This place has a nice little racket going on where they hire promoters on the strip to do their dirty work for them. What is their dirty work? Lying to customers about what club they'll be taken to, and then shuttling everyone here, to Treasures. And when you realize the bait and switch? They berate you for wanting to go elsewhere. If this is how they treat potential customers on the outside, one can imagine how they treat the trapped souls inside.
