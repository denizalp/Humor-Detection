The food here is fantastic, my group ordered ramen dishes and compared to Monta it's more flavorful and less salty. My one real issue is the slightly awkward papers saying the restaurant is #1 plastered 5 times on the wall along with messy looking menu. Service was good, asked us for water and smiled. Overall it was a good experience.
