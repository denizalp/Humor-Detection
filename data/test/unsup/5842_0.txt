I am a huge fan of Fresh n Easy!\n\nI frequent this location due to it being close to my work and it is a good one thankfully. It is slightly small, but I think they have all you need for the most part.\n\nTheir veggies, which is the main reason I come here, are usually always fresh and you can't beat the prices! Their own brand of foods is quite good and well priced which helps. Other brand name foods are fair compared to other stores.\n\nKeep a lookout for coupons in the mail for about $5-$10 off.
