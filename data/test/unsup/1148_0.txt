Yea we all get and have to buy omiyage from TJ when in vegas.  All their snacks are really good and the next time you go back they have something new, which I really like.  I haven't had a bad items here yet. \n\nOne thing I can't believe is the fiji 1liter water is 1.99. LOL  I love fiji water and this is such a deal vs paying over $5 in hawaii.
