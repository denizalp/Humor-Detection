I HEART Sakana, I have been going to Sakana since my 16 year old was in a high chair. It is by far the best restaurant in Ahwatukee and the best sushi to get in Phoenix. \nIf you need something to do with valley visitors take them to Sakana for the sushi & Tepan tables. \nPrice is fair, they do have a happy hour menu so one can try new things.... \nGO FOR IT!
