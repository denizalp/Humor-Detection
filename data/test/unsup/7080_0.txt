I'm sitting in this restaurant and it's my first time. The service is extremely slow and it gets better. I'm a lover of noodles, etc .\nI ordered Ramen Noodles with vege and I was disturbed and shocked they served me packaged ramen noodles, you know the kind you make at home.\nIt was pathetic!! \nThe Sushi worker saw my face expression of disgust and we even asked him if it was packaged and he said YES...WOW\nThe worker took it off my bill and I expressed what happened.\nI will not return!!!
