.... well, maybe my expectations were super duper high from all the good things I had been told about it.\n\nHonestly, the ones I ate were SOOOOOOO SUPER DUPER salty.... \nand also as I take each bite I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack, or even that my sugar levels are rising! hahah .... booooo....  \nI don't think it's anything special... I bought frozen ones and still have quite a few in my freezer.\n\nMaybe one day i will try a dessert pie, but then again, maybe I won't.
