I needed an air cleaner vent tube for my 2014 FXDL. (Dyna Low Rider) Tucson HD dealer told me the only Harley dealership around with vent tube in stock was Arrowhead, so I phoned them to please ship said tube to me in Tucson. I'll give you my Visa CC info........\n\nUh....no!\n\nI was informed by parts person that Arrowhead does not accept Credit Cards for parts purchase over the phone. \n\nOkaaaaa. I had to order it from my local HD dealership that took my CC in 2014 for a new bike purchase.
