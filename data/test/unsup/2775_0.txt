The boy wanted this...not me.  I see the the name \"Feast\" and pretty much have figured out that id you have had one \"Feast\" buffet, it is going to be the same as any other \"Feast\" buffet you visit at any other Station casino.  With that said, I am not hating...FB will do when you want to graze on A-OK edibles with other humans.  The sushi was A-OK.  The salad bar was A-OK.  The desserts were A-OK.
