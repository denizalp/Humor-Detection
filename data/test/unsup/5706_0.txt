Sophia and Nikki were great on Friday the 30th. It was so nice to see the place jammed packed, and Nikki just jamming out plate after plate. Nice to see experience and hard work there at Kosta and Vics. \n\nThanks Ladies, for keeping a customer very happy after all these years. Tell your boss George he should be working there in the morning. Get-em out of bed will ya?\n\nTell Arelene, I'm circling back! She can't hid forever....
