This was our first and probably our last time coming to this restaurant. The foods was OK, but the live music was so loud that you had to scream across the table to whomever you were with. You couldn't ask the wait staff any questions, because you couldn't hear them. TERRIBLE!!!!!  It was just as loud as being at a rock concert front row. You couldn't enjoy your time with family, because you couldn't hear the ones sitting next to you. The management needs to get it together.
