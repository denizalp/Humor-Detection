Beautiful decor.  Good sangria.  Excellent duck tacos, or was I just very hungry?  I must've been since I remember enjoying the rice and beans... Tried my friend's enchilada... did not care for it.  Thought that my duck tacos were much more flavorful.  Friend thought opposite. \n\nIf I were a drinker (I'm not), I'd come here for the sangrias and the atmosphere.  It's very sexy, yet not intimidating, in here.
