The owners of Platinum Rides really went above and beyond what my expectations were. The level of customer service was top notch and their fleet of vehicles is my opinion the best in Phoenix.\n\nI rented a party bus (Big-City) for a family function and till this day I am still getting compliments on how awesome it looked and sounded. I will continue to refer Joey and Frankie to ALL my friends and family! They will do a GREAT job for you!
