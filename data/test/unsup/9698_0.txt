So they no longer serve Captain or any type of \"highend\" drink for the $2 u call it specials. It is now $2 Well drinks. \n\nThe well drinks are still a decent heavy pour but your taste buds tell you go back to the Captain. \n\n#Word of advice for the ladies, watch your yourselves, watch your drinks and watch out for who buys you drinks. #
