Dropped off a rental truck at 7th street and Thunderbird. Around 10pm figuredd i would call Uber to take me home. 2 different attempts the driver just drove by the place snd abandonned the call. My phone died after the last guy bailed on me so i had to walk to a convienance store where they called me a taxi who showed up promptly.\n\nErased Uber app from my phone won't use these losers again.
