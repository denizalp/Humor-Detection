Almost $100 for two bowls of two bites nothing reminiscent of ramen noodles. All of it was horrible. Table was waddling back and forth .. Napkins had stains... I had hair all over my napkin & service was rude and non attentive. \n\nSave 60 and go off strip for real ramen! This place is a RIP OFF! Horrible food ! Horrible service ! Horrible prices!! NEVER AGAIN!
