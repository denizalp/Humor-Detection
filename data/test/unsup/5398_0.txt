Food is good and is a ok place to hang out. I've been there several times but actually got in only twice. They seem to have little space for a family or friends of 4 to sit and hang out. It's always full. Sounds good right but actually I think it's because they have a lot if tv's within the eating areas abc people just sit around watching tv.
