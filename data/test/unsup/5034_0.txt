I'm giving this Carl's Jr. one star for every Carl's Jr. out there.  Back home, Hardee's is THE place for breakfast.  The best biscuits in any fast food chain for sure (even better than Bojangles!)\n\nI pull up to Carl's Jr. this morning expecting to be greeted by a menu chock full of delicous, biscuity breakfast goods.  No dice.\n\nI told them I hated them and drove off, vowing never to return again.\n\nAnd I still haven't gotten my fast food buttermilk biscuit fix in Vegas.
