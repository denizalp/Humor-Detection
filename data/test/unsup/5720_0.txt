Have you tried a Sonoran hotdog? Well even if you have, you need to try one at El Guero Canelo in Phoenix. Fully loaded and smothered with tomatoes, beans, mayo, mustard, and a spicy jalape√±o sauce make this a dish to remember. The carne asada plates come with tortillas made on site. Top your dishes off with cucumbers, roasted or pickled onions, or a variety of salsas at the salsa bar.
