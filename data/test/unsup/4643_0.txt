FUN!!!Excellent example of why it's so important to buy your kids an experience, rather than another toy for the floor. We're going back soon Finding a fun time for a high energy group at only $5 bucks a kid?!?! Well worth it. The owner of the business was working the front counter; love supporting stuff like this!
