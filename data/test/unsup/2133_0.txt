The worst place I've ever eaten !!  Windows haven't been cleaned In years you can see scum on them. Every chairs  ripped and  rest have tape on them . Waitresses are slow  . The sodas watered down   the food  is less then average  our waitress was right behind the counter picking her teeth  within 6 ft of the serving area  .. The restrooms look like gang city broken mirrors    tagged up ceilings . Just a mess avoid at all costs !!!!!!
