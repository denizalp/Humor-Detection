Went here for the first time with Mom and we will definitely be back! The dumplings in chili oil were delicious, as were the Xialong baos (soup dumplings)! They don't have as much soup in them as I would like but decent by AZ. standards. Come here for authentic Shanghai dishes, as well as the more westernized dishes like sweet and sour pork, orange chicken if that is what you prefer. However, it never hurts to broaden your horizons. You will not be disappointed. Try something that is way out of your comfort zone, it may just surprise you!
