Unfortunately, the baked goods look better than they taste. I found the donuts to be bland and the texture was completely dry. Absolutely nothing like how a donut should taste. On top of that, the prices are unreasonably high. $3.09 for a teeny tiny donut is excessive - especially since the quality is not great. \n\nIf you're looking for delicious gluten-free desserts, I would recommend Gluten Free Goat. Unfortunately the prices are comparable but the donuts are phenomenal.
