I have been attending this church for the past 4 to 5 months and really enjoyed it till today.  In fact today I have decided to longer attend this church. After the Supreme Court ruling on marriage I expected church's to rise and support God teachings on marriage. For what ever reason today not a single word was spoken by pastor Lee in supporting God teaching at such needed time. I can't support a church who apparently is more to staying PC than gods word
