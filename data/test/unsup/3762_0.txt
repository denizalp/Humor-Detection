Came in today to replace my battery. It was a little busy but I didn't have to wait long. Stephan asked right away if I had been helped. We found the correct battery for my car and he informed me about the mail and rebate. Very helpful and professional. He even assisted me with switching out my battery in this horrible heat without any hesitation. Sweat dripping and all he took care of it in a jiffy! I was in and out of there in no time. Thank you for turning an inconvenience, into a simple and easy errand.
