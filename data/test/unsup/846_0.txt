Drove by today and decided to check the place out.  We ordered three pieces of candy, buttercream, amaretto cream and chocolate mousse. The flavors were a bit bland, honestly, we couldn't tell the amaretto and buttercream apart. Also, they have a chalky-dusty taste to them. Probably won't be going back again, was underwhelmed.
