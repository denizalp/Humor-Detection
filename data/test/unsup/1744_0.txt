This place was great!! We tried the 12 course meal for $40 and every course was delicious! Service was outstanding. The servers were always checking on us, replacing plates and refilling our water. \nThe chef even sent out some cool candies and snacks for our son, so nice of him. Will def come back again! \n\nAnd to the guy complaining about it being too much food, are you crazy?! That's like complaining about getting paid too much or a buffet having too many selections. Just plain crazy especially since they box left overs for you to take home.
