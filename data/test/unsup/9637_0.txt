Are you frightened by the ridiculous line for Steve's Gyros? Then take 20 steps away and enjoy some of Maha's Falafels!! The service is friendly and quick!! I love getting the hot falafel wrap with hummus. For less than $5, you cannot go wrong with this savory and filling item! They also have an array of other items to choose from, like philly cheese steak (yupp, super random). I'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu! :)
