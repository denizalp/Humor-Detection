Finally a answer to our nail prayers in the southwest area! Prices here are competitive to other salons if not better. This establishment was very clean and sanitary. Cindy my nail tech opened all new tools in front of me. Customer service is also a plus! They squeezed me in without an appointment. All the staff is very friendly and very polite. They definitely make sure you're comfortable.. As far as their work goes I have no complaints I got exactly what I asked for! Smooth nails no bumps, gaps or lifting. Flawless pedicure!  Baby soft feet :D
