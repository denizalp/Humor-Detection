Brought our friends here for lunch and the decor of this place has been upgraded, new menu, bright decor and just more attractive and comfortable plus they take credit cards besides cash now.  We ordered the kalua pork plate, the local plate and the garlic chicken.  The portions were humongous!  Food is tasty but the macaroni salad was alittle on the bland side.
