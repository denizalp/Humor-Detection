Have been living here for the past 2 years. I absolutely love it here. The community is amazing and the facilities are great specially the gym and the pool. I love how quickly the maintenance issues are taken care of. Just renewed my lease till next June. As it is right next to boca park it is very convenient to go to restaurants and shopping.
