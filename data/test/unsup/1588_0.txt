The worst fast food organization I have ever been to. Horrendous invisible management. I have never been there before and I was asking questions about the food. The manager looked away and gave me one word answers. They forgot to give me the rice in my order. When I get home I called them and they told me they'd CATCH ME NEXT TIME. I will NEVER go to this restaurant again!!!!
