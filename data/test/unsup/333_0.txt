The place is great ! But like any other place its finding the right stylist that works for you. Sonia is my Barberista ! She is a perfectionist like myself and does an amazing job on my hair and beard every time. Ive tried others there when Sonia was not in and have learned my lesson that I dont need a haircut that bad to go to anyone else.
