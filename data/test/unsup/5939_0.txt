Overall, this airport is okay.  Bathrooms are decent.  The nicest bathroom airports are at ATL, they were very new and modern with surfaces you expect to find in luxury homes.  \n\nThere are slot machines galore if you're into bets with terrible odds.  There's also a decent selection of restaurants.  We ate at Pei-Wei, it was busy, prices were ok, food was decent.\n\nThe Southwest terminal doesn't have a lot of chairs with power outlets.
