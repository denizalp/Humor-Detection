Had a great dessert experience here. Our server was Tony and he was great! He was very friendly and attentive. We stopped by for dessert and tea. We shared a slice of the Sugar Free Lemon Mousse and loved it so much that we ordered a 2nd one!!!\n\nI can't say anything about the actual food but the dessert and tea we had was amazing!\n\nI highly recommend the lemon mousse!
