Very beautiful restaurant and super friendly staff! We came for Sunday brunch and I ordered \"eggs benedict\" and oh how fabulous they felt in my mouth...very impressed with the quality of food and service. And I must admit, they have some hot waiters in there! I love when a restaurant hires good-looking men!
