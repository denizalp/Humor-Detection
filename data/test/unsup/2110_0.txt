Our original waitress took our very first order and that was it! I then asked the waiter Joe if he could take our next order and he very gladly helped us out for the rest of the night while the other waitress didn't even show back up once! We have been here a few times and Joe is by far the best waiter we have had! The food is amazing as well! And Joe was outstanding
