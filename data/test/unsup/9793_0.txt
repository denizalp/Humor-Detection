I really liked this hotel. I'll say they only bummer was the pool. We went at 10:30am and their was no sun in sight. I was hoping to get a little tanning in before I started the day but that did not happen at all. The pool is surrounded by really tall buildings so if you want sun with your pool I'd stay elsewhere. However everything else was great. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was really entertaining.
