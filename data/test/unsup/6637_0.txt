Kinda expensive, kinda creepy...kinda a guilty pleasure. Located inside of the Venetian, they encourage you to take photos with your favorite celebs. You will see Celine Dion, Justin Bieber and Liberace...all in their very surreal glory. At times, they looked so real that I thought they would start moving\/talking ( that's the creepy part for me). This attraction takes about one hour to get through but you may take longer if you take your time. I would say it's a nice diversion from the business of the Strip...a good way to pass the time and meander the various rooms.
