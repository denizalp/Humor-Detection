I will be back\n\nToday, I went to Stein Mart to look for a Christmas gift for my sister.  I was hoping to find a purse that she might like, at a reasonable price. \n\nStein Mart definitely offers a wide range of prices and most are wallet-friendly. I was able to find a purse I know my sister would like that very well at Friendly price.\n\n I will definitely be back again to look around when it's not Christmas time, and the store is less crowded.
