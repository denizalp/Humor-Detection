Had rare beef pho ($5.25) and spicy beef papaya salad ($3.85). The place is like a food court. But the service was really quick. The food was ok - not so good but I wouldn't say it was bad. You get what you paid for. This is a good place when you are a little hungry but not in a mood for a big lunch or dinner.
