The food was overly fantastically delicious. The portion size was great. I had the bacon and egg plate with potatoes. Other people at my table had omelet, French toast, pancake and waffle. I had a nibble taste of their food and it was also good. The service was great. I would make this a regular when visiting las Vegas.
