I am sure everything Pierre has stated is true however I do know somebody who lives in these lofts and they are incredible! They remind me of something out of New York and although there may be a \"parking situation\" there are museums, restaurants, bars, chase field, and the stadium all within WALKING DISTANCE. Sometimes you have to take the good with the bad and when did walking ever hurt anyone? Are people who live in Arizona really that lazy?
