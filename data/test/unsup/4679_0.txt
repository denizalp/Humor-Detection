Being from New Orleans I'm never ever impressed with \"cajun\/creole\" resturants outside of Louisiana. Going in my expectations were very low and I expected bland commercial cuisine. I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. The flavors were well developed. It wasnt just bland heavily spicy food. It has nothing on resturants in New Orleans. But generally places outside of the Boot don't. But I'd recommend it to a friend.
