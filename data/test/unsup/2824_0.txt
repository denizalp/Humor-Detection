1 word to describe Daryl and his services. LEGIT. Amazing attention to detail and provides the best customer service I've seen in a long time. His product is amazing. My car looked amazing and I definitely got my money's worth. I was so happy, that I scheduled my other car to get detailed and am rescheduling for 6 months down the road for clay service. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
