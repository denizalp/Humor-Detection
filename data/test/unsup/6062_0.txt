Came here recently for the yelp event and I loved it! Brought my niece with me and though we ran really late for the event we still were able to enjoy everything and watch the imax movie. We were able to afterwards and tour the entire center until closing time. Everyone I encountered that work here were really polite and helpful. I haven't been here since I was in middle school which was a long time ago, so it was nice coming back.
