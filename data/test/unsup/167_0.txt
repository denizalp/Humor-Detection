Terrible.... went in to get my eyebrows cleaned up. I normally get them threaded in Monroeville but decided to get cleaned up while I was in Robinson. Bad move :(\nNot only was the clean up sloppy, they trimmed up the shape I had been working on the last year. They rounded off the inner sides of my eyebrow. Will never ever go to this place again
