Went here on Friday night - first night in Montreal...the food was great - the house wine was nice.  I ordered the lamb shank which was nice - but the most amazing thing was the creme brule - served in one of those flat ramekins - so there was tons of that fantastic, tasty, crispy coating, the right amount of custard (and all for $5) - don't miss out!  The live jazz band was nice too, I'd go back again for a glass of wine and the creme brule!
