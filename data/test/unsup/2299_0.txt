Came here at 9:00 for the pharmacy. Their house? 9:00 am. I was standing there, coughing my face out, with a prescription in hand. The pharmacist was just staring at me..... taunting me through the little bars. Apparently, according to his time zone, just three feet away, the pharmacy wasn't to open until he was done with whatever he was doing... which was staring at me and drinking his coffee. Boo.
