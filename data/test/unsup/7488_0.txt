This review if strictly for Zumanity\nwe watched last weekend.\n\nWhat in the world was I thinking\nwanting to spend part of my bday\nin Sin City with the temperature\nof above 105 degree and rising?\n\nBut...if I am guaranteed to be in a \ncomfortable temperature-controlled  \nenvironment and to see a show,  I\nam soooooo sold!\n\nZumanity was awesome.  Loved it.\nDefinitely a group of very talented\nperformers sang and danced on \nstage and up in the air with a mix\nof comedy flair, made for a very\nentertaining show.\n\nExuberance.\nHumorous.\nSexually entertaining.\n\nWhoot whoot!
