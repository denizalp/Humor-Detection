Was craving pork belly and after a quick search decided to come here. I want to marry these buns and have their babies. I ordered the pork belly bao buns and the potstickers and my friend had the special of the day, salmon alfredo linguini, which she said was really good.\n\nService was incredibly friendly and nice as well as efficient, and I got a slice of pie with a candle on it because it was my birthday. Caramel apple pie. So frigging good.\n\nWill definitely be back.
