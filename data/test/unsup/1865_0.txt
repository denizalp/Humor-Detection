Absolutely got blown away by Josh today at Hopdoddy. I went to order and realized I forgot my bank card at work. Called work and co-worker couldn't find it. I had $10 cash and asked to discount some of the items I had ordered and Josh tells me the entire bill is on them!!! He totally comped my entire bill and told me to pay it forward!!!! So freaking crazy! I've never in my life had anyone in customer service do something like that. I already love this place , but now I love it even more!!!
