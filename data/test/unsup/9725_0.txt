Don't you love when something that was always good just got better. I wasn't partaking in the food this time but Friday night the kitchen was hopping and families were enjoying themselves  the sunroof is a super addition. For an old smoking venue these guys turned it around and you have to climb to get in the joint. Although I think the descent is sometimes the more difficult venture. Cheers it's a great bar too!
