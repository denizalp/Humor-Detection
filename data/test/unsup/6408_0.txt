Bobby Flay you Bastard!! I really wish this place was cheaper.. If it was I would totally give you 5 stars... Ive only tried 3 things on the menu because thats all I could afford...\n\nThe Southwestern Fries were the best fries I have ever had..\n\nTiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale was fun to look at and even more fun to eat..\n\nThe grilled Lamb Chops with the Chili Chutney...  *tear* \n(40 bucks well spent)
