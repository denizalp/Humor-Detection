Carnegie Kitchen, how I love you so. You always make everyone happy in our party of 8 or more. \n\nIts pretty simple: Prices are great for a Downtown lunch and the choices are always unique twists on classic favorites. (The chef must be a real chef!) Fast service, yummy bites, and any mistakes on orders are actually taken extra care of by the staff. \n\nSo good - I always opt for desert at Carnegie!
