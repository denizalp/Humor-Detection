Amazing experience. Our first time there and it was for our anniversary. Louis was one of the best servers I have ever had. He made sure everything was perfect, gave us a history of the restaurant and went above and beyond to ensure our evening was perfect. The food was incredible, the views breathtaking, and the atmosphere great. This has become one of our favorites!
