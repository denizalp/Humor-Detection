I just finished getting an anti-aging facial with Karen!   It was fabulous and my skin looks radiant.  Karen has a very gentle and soothing manner that really adds to the healing benefits of the facial.  I can't wait for my next facial.  Wonderful atmosphere. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. A visit to Hawaiian Experience Spa on McDowell would make a wonderful gift for anyone you really care about, especially yourself.
