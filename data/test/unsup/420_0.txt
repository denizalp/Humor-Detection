This review is based solely on the off-menu Gambler's Special. For $7.77 you get a juicy steak, three barbecued shrimp, mashed 'tatoes, and a decent-sized salad. Well worth the money.\n\nWent at lunch on a Friday and were seated immediately. Service was expedient and enjoyable.\n\nHard Rock Hotel\/Casino provides a great, relaxed atmosphere for this small restaurant, and I will definitely be coming back every trip for the Gambler's Special.
