We were on a cross country road trip and stopped in here because it wasn't a chain restaurant. That said, when we saw the menu we were scared because usually a menu that is 5 pages long means nothing is fresh, but we were wrong. The wings were made super fresh and were delicious. Everything was super tasty!
