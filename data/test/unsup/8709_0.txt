Wow what a nice theater and in such a great outdoor mall like Tempe Marketplace.  Really impressed with this place on a Saturday night in February when the weather literally is perfect (I know during summer this is probably Hell on Earth).  The theater is way on one side of the mall, so if you're eating at Thirsty Lion, expect a nice WALK.
