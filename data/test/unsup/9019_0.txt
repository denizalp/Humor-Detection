Been to this location a couple of times, and it is always fun! Got here on a Saturday night round 11:30 pm and the place was full, stayed until it closed. THANK YOU for having multiple Sam Adams on tap!!! Arizona is tough to find Sammy A. Place is just always fun, girls are always nice to look at. I believe what makes this a 4 star instead of 3, is that the hot bartenders actually can carry a conversation with you and not just stand there and be hot.
