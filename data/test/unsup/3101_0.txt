I bought a down stem for my water pipe from here and the bottom of the stem doesn't fit through any water pipes. Out $15 for a useless down stem. Called and asked the store for some type of discount the next time I shop there and they only offered a 10-20% discount on another $15 down stem. Disappointed with this place. Will not shop here anymore.
