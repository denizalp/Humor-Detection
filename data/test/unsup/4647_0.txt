Hotel is nice. The pool is closed during construction and In the winter. The spa pool and steam room is available to hotel guests. It is worth it and amazing. Favorite part of the trip for sure! We stayed in the resort the entire trip, no need to go to the strip. There's no dancing or night life but the happy hour at Hank's was great. Dirty and pear martini's were excellent and strong. The staff their do not crack smiles not even a little bit. We would go back for sure!
