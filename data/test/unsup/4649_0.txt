Can't really leave a fair review as they were out of like 75% of the food menu. Strike one\nWhen food was ordered SOMEHOW part of the order was missed (even tho the cashier answered a specific question about the food that she forgot to order) Strike two\nCouldn't access half of the place due to a private event. Strike three\nThe drinks were ok and the atmosphere was pretty laid back. Not enough to bring me back again tho...I'm sure there are plenty more patio bars around
