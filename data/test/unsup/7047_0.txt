Learn from Dunkin Donuts and label your damn cases.\n\nThe old lady with the glasses needs to smile or go...she really tests your patience, and I never thought I'd fall to a level of hurling obscenities at a woman purely over donuts.  She should just be in the back finishing the donuts.  Or making a sign telling me what the donuts are because she's such a b*tch and won't tell me what they are.\n\nDonuts are high quality and tasty.
