$5 Sake bombs, a fantastic deal on the strip! Location is great, tons of seating both in and outdoors. Nice decor and ambiance. Great beer and sake, both a generous pour and fantastic service all around. I didn't order any food but what passed by looked and smelled amazing, I will have to be back for more!
