Not quite a fan. It is nice place. You can get drinks and food. It is pretty chill.\n\nI have noticed there are pool tables on the way in. But I have only played in the arcade and games. They have nice collection, but it misses all the ones I like, it would not hurt to have a gundam or more rhythm games. =p My cousin likes the Jurassic Park game, it is old school and even better, you can play together.
