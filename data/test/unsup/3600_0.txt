That celebrity chef, Claudio, unbelievable in comparison to what we view on television. I had to get up and leave with my sons seeing the behaviour he displayed by the patio bar. Yelling at his employees in front of customers. The food is nothing to brag about. All it is, is the hype people make of it and his celebrity friends who've given his restaurant the 5 star reviews. You're not missing out. Go elsehwere and enjoy your meal without unprofessional employer distractions and harsh working conditions from what I witnessed. I wouldn't tolerate that for a second!
