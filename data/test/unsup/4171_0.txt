Trying to have breakfast with some friends and we like to get separate checks to make it easier. Well, there is a big tacky sign on the front door saying they won't separate checks. \n\nSo we kindly ask the waitress for a one time exception because we didn't know, and their answer is no, no way. \n\nStupid idiotic policy that really upsets me. I will not be back. Oh, the food sucked, too.
