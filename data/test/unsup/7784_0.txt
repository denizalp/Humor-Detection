Staff is nice, however, they desperately need to clean the kids play area.  I noticed how incredibly dirty it was when I was waiting for my car to get serviced and thought, if I had kids, there is no way they would be playing in there.  It was super gross.  They do have free water, juice, and popcorn while you wait for your vehicle.
