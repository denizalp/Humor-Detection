Saw the 2+ hour buffet line and decided to try the Cafe instead. The first thing we noticed is there's natural light. They actually have windows that look out to sun ! Its away from the casino so its quit. The food is pretty good. I got the fish and chips with a sour apple tartar sauce. The crab cake, not the word cake not cakes is good but a little pricey. Overall I was happy for the money. And it was nice to have some sunlight and no casino nosie during the meal.
