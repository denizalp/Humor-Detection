I had my wedding at this place.\nThey gave me a set price and it includes everything you could ask for.\nEverything was included such as limo, flowers, bouquets, candles, photography, full open bar, buffet. I mean everything and anything...\n\nI had a great time here at this place and i love it.\nI would definitely recommend this place for people who wants to have an intimate wedding. very private...unlike stop and go chapels...
