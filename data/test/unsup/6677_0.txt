I love this place.. the pizza here tastes like it did when I was a kid.. back when pizza had a certain mystery and allure.. the smell of cooked pepperoni and not being able to see over the counter to tell what the smell was. \n\nEvery time I eat here it just takes me back to being the fat little kid I was and kind of still am.
