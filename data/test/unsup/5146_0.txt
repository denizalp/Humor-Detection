Very disappointed. Tasted more like an Italian beef than a cheesesteak. Price way to high for the value you receive. I do have a question for the business. Is the meat cooked on site or precooked prior to arrival ? Meat tasted soggy and my bread was already soggy after 20 seconds of giving it to me which was very strange.
