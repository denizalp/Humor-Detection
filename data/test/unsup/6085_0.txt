Delicious and worth the wait! We had a farm omelette, Monte Cristo and farm breakfast burrito. All were so yummy! The biscuits were mouth watering too. To add to all of the yum is the surrounding farm where they get their vegetables. There is so much charm to explore while waiting for a table. You have to try it!
