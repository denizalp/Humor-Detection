A very nice,theater which is up stairs in a entertainment center where there is a bowling ally and a large room for bingo,the theater staff was nice and helpful,it was clean inside( maybe the first showing had something to do with that) even the carpet and seats smell kinda fresh,the food was like LA theater food rocket high,so bring your own in.
