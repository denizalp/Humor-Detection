They only get business because there's no closer bar to the Trunk Space. The lady that's always there is really rude, skimps me on vodka in my vodka+cranberries, and last time I was there she stole money from me!!! Literally!! Bought a $4 drink, gave her a $10 (after she angrily repeated the price to me in a crowded loud room) and didn't give me my change back. Tried to get her attention but didn't want to make a scene. Never going back.
