Found this gem after reading the reviews on Yelp. Marci does a fantastic job to clean up both my brows and my upper lips. I come in about every 3 weeks by tweezing a few stays (not many) because she is so through and really gets in there to shape you up!  Super nice customer service and easy in-and-out. Recommend it :]
