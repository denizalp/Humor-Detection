Burger Lounge, your service was a delight and just what I needed after a long night out! However, the breakfast itself fell short. I wasn't paying close attention when I ordered and didn't realize the sandwich didn't come with scrambled eggs. I didn't care for the way the egg was cooked and the whole sandwich was over cooked.  The fries were good and I made it through ok, but was disappointed.  I will try again on my next visit to Aria.  :)
