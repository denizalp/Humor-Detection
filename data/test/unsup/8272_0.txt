We got a few slices to go at NY Pizza Lovers.  We tried the veggie, pepperoni, and a sausage combo.  I have had frozen pizza better than the pizza here.  I highly doubt I would return.  I didn't give them one star because I only tried their pizzas; it's possible something on the menu is worth eating- just not the pizza.
