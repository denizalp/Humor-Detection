Incredible ramen! I always get the spicy garlic one, and it's the best ramen I've ever had. The staff are very friendly, the atmosphere is loud and fun - this is one of my favourite places in Toronto if I need to grab dinner with a friend or two.\n\nEven though I always get their karaage (fried chicken), I wouldn't recommend it - I find their isn't enough seasoning and it's a bit rubbery.\n\nRegardless, I expect to come back many times over the next year just because of the taste of the ramen and the atmosphere!
