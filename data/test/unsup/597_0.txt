This is my preferred pilot location. Generously large space with clean and refreshing interior. It feels like an upscale coffee shop in The Path. \n\nHighly recommend the misto and the latte but the house blend is average. \n\nThey also sell food and canned drinks here.\n\nFriendly service and will always be back.
