Is there a way to insult the great culture and food of Mexico any more than just the existence of Taco Bell, El Pollo Loco, and Del Taco already have? Why yes, there is. The chocolate nachos at El Pollo Loco. And yet, I have given it 3 stars, because it is marshmallow and chocolate syrup and served to me in my car and I am weak. I understand that I deserve your judgment, but try to forgive me. It's marshmallow sauce in the car for under $3.00.
