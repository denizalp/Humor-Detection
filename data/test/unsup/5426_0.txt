This was my worst and last visit here. The cover of $50 is ridiculous and just gives entrance to a club with no available tables, unless you want to pay $500 for a table. Just to get a drink was $20. We were tools repeatedly we couldn't stand in the only available standing areas and that we had to get a table. We left 20 mins after arriving minus $350 for 5 of us to do nothing other than get a poorly mixed drink.. terrible experience 0 stars.
