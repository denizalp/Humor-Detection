Hands down my favorite restaurant! I've had just about everything on their menu and love it all because it's not your traditional tasting food. I'm not sure what type of wood they cook with but that alone makes your mouth water! \nTry the fried chicken and gravy over the spicy sweet potatoes with the Desert blossom tea!
