Seating was slow even though there were many open tables and the front end staff didn't seem to have it together.  Table staff were good and professional but service was slow.  Prime rib was ok but I wouldn't go back for that dish.  2-3 stars based on the slow seating service and mediocre food.  Gave it three as the caesar side salad was really good as were the hot rolls, prime rib just ok.
