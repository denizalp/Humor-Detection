Went on a Friday. It was very crowded during happy hour. We were not offered a happy hour menu and had to wait 10 minutes before our server came by to offer drinks. We were just there for drinks and appetizers. The taquitos did not have much beef and the beef was extremely dry and not flavorful. I am not sure if the hype is because this is a new restaurant but I do not know how it stays so crowded.
