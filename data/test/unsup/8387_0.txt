We walked out with a full bag of groceries for under $25! Yes, a whole paper bagful (not a little bag, a BIG one). This place just didn't live up to its reputation of \"whole paycheck\"! \n\nI really liked the organic, healthy eating options available here for groceries, and it is convenient to home with loads of parking. What's not to love?
