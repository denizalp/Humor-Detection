We go here at least once a week and take all our out of town guests when they are visiting! Green and red chiles are unique and flavorful...the smoked meats are always good. Adovada and New Mexican Platter are our go toos. Mimosas are 5 bucks. Specials are delicious. If you're looking for uniquely special food and ambiance this is a great place!
