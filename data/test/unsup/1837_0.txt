3\/15\/15- Recommended by a local Montreal chef. Best food during this trip hands down. We had the chef of Taverne pick a few items for us. AMAZING! Korean Beef Tartar, Pok Pok Crispy Shrimp, Albacore Tuna on Tostada, Mac n' Cheese, Butcher's Choice Steak, is some of the dishes I remember. After the meal, we ordered shots and had them with the Chef. An evening to remember.
