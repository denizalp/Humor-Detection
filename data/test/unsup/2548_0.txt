I been coming here a lot lately for late night after the gym meals and I always order either the chirashi bowl or $50\/$75 sashimi specials. I'm a big fan of AYCE sushi but I also appreciate quality places like this. Seafood is fresh and they are not stingy at all. It's just a let down when I don't get uni in my chirashi lol.
