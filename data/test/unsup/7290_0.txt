I love this place!!! It is the cutest place and super convenient if you are trying to buy items straight from the farm\/home. It can be so difficult to buy fresh items as you may have to visit multiple farmer's markets or stores. This makes it so easy, everything is all at one place. Best of all they have regular hours like a store, unlike a farmer's market which typically only weekly. I will be a frequent shopper. Couldn't love this place more.
