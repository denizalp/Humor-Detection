I wish I can give this place no Stars . \nIt was so easy to sign up for my membership, Due to my health I had no choice other than cancelling my membership, this was back in March , it is now 9\/17\/2015, EOS is still charging my account. The managers are incompetent. They are honestly a Joke, as far as the 1800 number they have no control over the transactions. This is Illegal! I have proof I cancelled my account and yet they still charge my bank every month. Please don't go here.
