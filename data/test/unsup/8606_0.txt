Found out that their grooming is actually a stolen business from someone else! That speaks for itself. I am very disappointed that scruffs would back this kind of Behavior. My family and I will no longer shop there do to these poor decisions. This is true because I am a customer of Dolittles and was contacted by them saying they moved to scruffs when they actually are beside Auggies! Please do not support this company because we need to make a stand and show our community we will not stand for such immoral acts!
