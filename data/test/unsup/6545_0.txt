Love this place the owner is a old record charming record store clerk grouch .olace is Unassuming and people usually know it's off the usual trawl. Dark subdued and with amazing music you feel like you are in another city like a dive bar that's actually really chill and not jocked out with unoriginal clones..ok I've said too much already don't go actually haha forget I wrote about it ..
