Beautiful location with obviously a high rent reflected in the prices. Chow fun was good but needed to be a larger portion for the prices. Seriously ... they're noodles !! Noodles are cheap and the portion would have been acceptable with a larger portion of noodles. You could skimp on the chicken and shrimp with extra noodles. It's not rocket science. Mongolian beef was good but also pricier than most restaurants. Eggplant dish was so yummy but I recommend cutting the eggplant differently than they do. Plus it was a bit overdone.
