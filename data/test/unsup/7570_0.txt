Too much money for too little, bad tasting, food!\nMy 3 teenage sons & I tried Tommy's tonight. Not one of us liked it! The patties are so thin I don't know how they stay together. So thankful I got my burger without chili, I tasted a forkful of my son's and it had the consistency of paste. Maybe that's how they keep it in the burger? lol\nFries were meh and the interior is like a small generic In-n-Out.
