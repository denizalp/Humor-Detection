My wife and I used to purchase our fuel here on a regular basis. At times we would use a perk from K-Mart that saved us approximately $.30\/gal. You have to go inside to enter a code. The owners of this BP belittled my wife inside the store and in front of other customers because the code did not work. Do NOT attack a person because a program that your parent company participates in is imperfect. And, do not think that because you can belittle the women in your culture that you can belittle women outside of your culture.
