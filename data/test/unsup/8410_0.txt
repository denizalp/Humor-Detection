Pawn Stars!\n\nI always wanted to come check out the store after getting hooked on the show. \n\nThey have a big private parking lot. I was lucky it was not busy when I came so I did not have to wait in line to go in. The store is a lot bigger then it seems on the show. You only see about 1\/4 of the actual store on the show.\n\nThey have a picture\/signature area in the back for fans, but no one was there when I came. =(\n\nFun to come see!
