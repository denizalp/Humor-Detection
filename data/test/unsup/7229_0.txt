My new favorite restaurant. One of the more creative menus in town. We couldn't decide what we wanted to try so we ordered 5 dishes for 2 people. 3 would have been plenty but I'm glad we tried more. \n\nI'd give a breakdown of what we ordered but I'm certain everything here is amazing. Friendly staff and great service as well.
