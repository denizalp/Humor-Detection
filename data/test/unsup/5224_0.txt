Beautiful building with lots to see for free around the lobby.  You can pay to enter the exhibit and just check out the main lobby, which is free and worth checking out for some brief history of Pittsburgh.  Didn't pay to go in so don't have anything to compare it to or state if work h entering.  However, at least it is worth a pop in to the main lobby.
