It has been five days since I left a voicemail for the General Manager of the hotel.  He has not returned my call, nor did he reach out to me in any way.  Just confirms my earlier assessment of this hotel:  MGM needs to retool this hotel and find out why so many customers complain about how its run.  MGM are you listening?
