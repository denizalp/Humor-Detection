We were very disappointed after our lunch today. We come to this restaurant everytime we visit Las Vegas, which is almost every month. The reason for our disappointment is that they changed the saimin noodles. They have a weird texture. We will not be returning to this restaurant again unless the saimin noodles are changed back. *The one star rating is for the saimin noodles only. Service is great*\n\n*UPDATE* They have since changed the noodles back to the original :) Very ono!
