when i go here i feel like im too white and shouldn't be there. but i can handle the white girl stares from all the asians for some of this delicious overpriced drink. \n\ni love thai tea and they have it! i could order like 5. \nyesterday i tried the milk honey tea w boba and it was so good!!! \n\nim not a fan of the writings on the wall, i think it looks dirty.
