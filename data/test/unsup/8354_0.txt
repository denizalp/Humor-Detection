I went when it first opened and thought it was pretty lame. I was very excited about it and expected more. My friends had not been yet so I gave it another chance tonight. It's still just as cheesy as the first time and you can tell everything is fake but it was fun with our group of 7 after drinks. :-) Definitely not worth the full price or the locals discount. We found an offer at vegas4locals.com which made each ticket $17. That's a fair price for the 15-minute \"scare.\"
