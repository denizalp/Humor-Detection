I often lament the decline of the family owned record shop. \n\nThen I think of the owner of this place and the scads of attitude he heaped on me, and I think to myself \"Maybe iTunes isn't so bad after all...\" \n\nSave your money for Madcity Music Exchange. Or B-side. Or light it on fire. Just don't give it to this self-important idiot.
