Came to this place on the good faith of the 1 other review... And I wasn't disappointed :) aside from being overly touchy with my face (personal preference), she shaped with tweezers & cleaned up with thread, this didn't bother me as the results were great. She even stopped half way to ensure I was happy with shape.
