This lawn service company does the bare minimum. They are hasty, they dont even clean up the grass clippings after mowing the lawn. If there is any trash or papers they just blow them all over your yard. The weeds that grow on the brick patio are just getting longer and they have to walk on the brick patio to get to the yard, they mow. They are sloppy and not friendly at all. If you want a lawn service who takes pride in their work, DO NOT HIRE SNAPPY.
