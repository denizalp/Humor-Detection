They served me steak to me almost raw when ordered medium, it came back dry on second attempt.  They boast about their steaks but clearly didn't know how to cook them.  I wouldn't have been as hard on them if their service was ok... however I server made mistakes and blamed it on the kitchen and bar (drinks being empty, mushrooms on plate that were asked to be left off due to allergy, etc)... Try somewhere else!
