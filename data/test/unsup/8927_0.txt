Absolutely the worst service I've ever had anywhere in Champaign-Urbana. After waiting 45 minutes for our food( with no drink refills) we inquired what was taking so long. A server( not ours) came back and said they were just getting ready to start our ticket. There were literally 5 other tables in the entire place. This was on a Wednesday night at 7pm. We left after my husband paid for the drinks. I just wanted to scream. Awful awful awful!
