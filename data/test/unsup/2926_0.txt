Hungry and realized it was lunchtime and had to fuel up to continue shopping.  Decided on shrimp tempura udon but most people were ordering the stir fried meat.  I felt like something comforting but had to wait as they had to cook the noodles. Got 3 shrimp and 1\/2 hard boiled egg with bamboo shoots, green onions and udon
