Great place for a business meeting. All too often I find myself agreeing to meet at Starbucks but prefer to find locally run coffee houses to meet at. The service at Lola's has always been great, the coffee has always been good, and that translates into better business meetings for me.\n\nI highly recommend meeting at Lola's when in north central Downtown Phoenix.
