I stopped by Razzoo's Cajun Cafe for lunch and I ordered a Blackened Po-boy sandwich and OMG was it delicious! It comes with fries and hushpuppies which were yummy too! \nSydney was our server and she was on point! \n\nThe food came out hot & fresh and the portion was great! I'll be having the second half for dinner! \nOh yes, you have got to taste the raspberry ice tea, it comes in a large mason jar and it's flavored perfectly!
