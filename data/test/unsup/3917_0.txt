Guess this is no surprise, should've checked the reviews before walking in , I came in to ask for an application (which takes 2 seconds to grab by the way) & was cut off by one of the tellers saying I'll have to wait behind a customer, for an application? Are you kidding? Her tone told me exactly why there's a \"NOW HIRING\" sign in the window and from previous reviews , it obviously spills over into their business. Oh well. If you're thinking of working or doing business here... just don't.
