I walked in there with my white cane and explained this was my 2nd phone - I had bought one the day before.  I got an error message so I don't trust the automated.  She (Hispanic lady) told me I had to pay $25 for her to do it.  I told her the problem I had with the first phone still no offer to do it.  If Boost doesn't want a customer fine.  No customer support to even be a customer - that is what I call terrible customer service.
