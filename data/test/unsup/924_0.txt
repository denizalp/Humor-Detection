It's 2016, \"Cowboys and Indians\" is not OK. All the gogo dancers and (incompetent) bartenders were wearing offensive and appropriative headdresses. And maybe I'd find it less distracting and off-putting if it weren't for the horrific treatment of the actual indigenous people at Standing Rock right now. But it's really hard to relax and have fun when constantly being reminded of genocide. \nAlso, the drinks were clearly and obviously watered down and the vodka was definitely not Titos. Honestly, after ordering drinks at the bar, bottle service suddenly seemed like a reasonable deal.
