Heard a few good reviews from elsewhere and decided to give this chicken katsu curry a try.  It was not spectacular.  There's nothing bad about it, but there's also nothing good about it.  The curry tasted exactly like the ones you can make using those japanese curry cubes, and just add your own vege and meats.  For $10.95, i'd say it's way overpriced.  The portion is huge though, and comes with a side salad.\n\nAlso, this place is CASH ONLY.\n\nThe guy who gave 5 stars is insane. The rating is 'As good as it gets'.  REALLY?   I've had better.
