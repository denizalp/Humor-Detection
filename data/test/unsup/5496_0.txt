I've been here a few times with friends and we've ordered most of their appetizers and quiet a few main dishes. Notable items: sugarcane shrimp, Vietnamese rolls, vermicelli noodle bowl, thick crab soup and the green curry. The atmosphere is clean and quiet and the staff are excellent. Service is always quick and the food is delicious!
