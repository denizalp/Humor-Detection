We've taken our puppy here about a half dozen times and he always gets plenty tired and doesn't want to leave. He's already figured out that when he leaves in the morning with me, he's going to Camp Bow Wow and it is going to be a great day. It's a very useful tool for us when we have car-rides, visitors, or long hours at the office. It usually takes him a day to recover from the intense playing.\n\nCons:\nThe cameras reduce my productivity at work.
