Working weekends sucks. My boss didn't believe me when I said I'm allergic to working at such times, so there I was, a sap.\n\nThe highlight (Other than going home) was lunch. Spot On was nearby, so all of us saps stopped in.\n\nThe inside is laid out well. Lots of room the move around, and clean.\n\nDecided on the meat lovers scrambler. It was great. The cheese sauce gave me a Costanza moment, because I think it moved after tasting it.\n\nThe server was terrific and very quick.\n\nTo put in the clich√®, this pub was spot on.
