I got to be a background shopper on Season 4 episode 70 while my friend filmed for the show.  It was cool to go through the whole filming process, I got to meet Rick, Chumlee and the Old Man.   I even got a free T-shirt too whoohoo haha.  The shop was way smaller than I thought.  About 1\/3 of the shop is designated for Pawn Stars merchandise.   They have Pawn Stars everything, key chains, full size posters, mugs pretty much anything you can put a logon on.  It was a cool experience.
