The lunch price is a few dollars less and you get more food! I can go for lunch, fill up on the won tons, soup, and tea and then pretty much take my entire entree home for dinner. One of my favorite places to get Hot & Sour Soup. I always order the Sun Devil Chicken, which is (not breaded) chicken and jalapenos in a yummy sauce. To add a bit more flavor, I add vegetables. DELISH!  Also, the placemat with the Chinese Horoscope is classic!
