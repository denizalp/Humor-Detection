This place is really cool if you love rock and roll. The museum has many escalators, so you never have to worry about mobility issues. It also have a few elevators. The food on the second floor is very good, but it is a tad bit overpriced. We felt very welcome here! This museum is really interesting! Hope you enjoy!
