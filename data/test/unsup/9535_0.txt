Horrible service. I sat at my table for 15 minutes after the host seated me and not one person came to take my order. At least 4 different servers walked by me and nobody said anything. The restaurant had maybe 6 tables, it was 8:30 pm on Monday 24 April. \n\nAfter the remodel I would think the staff would be on their A game to win back the customers that went somewhere else to eat during the weeks that they were closed. \n\nI will not be back, they lost a loyal customer. Sad
