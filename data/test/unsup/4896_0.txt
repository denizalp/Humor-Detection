Rude lady.  The place was nearly empty and they pointed me and my wife to a tight corner table with a bench that has nothing to lean back on.  We asked if we can have the adjacent table. \"NO!  That table for customers with 4 people!\", then walks away.  We were a little taken back by the crude response so we left and went to Nem Nuong Bistro right down the road and received great food and service.
