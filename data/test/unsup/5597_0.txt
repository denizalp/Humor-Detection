It's like a giant community picnic!  (Bring some lawn chairs or blankets, the benches fill up fast)\n\nI enjoyed every second of it.  So many food options and it seemed like you couldn't go wrong with any of them.  I don't know if they rotate, or if it's the same food trucks every week, but my favorites are: King of Pops (Raspberry Lime..yum!) and Tin Kitchen.  \n\nParking is difficult, but hey, walking is good for you :)
