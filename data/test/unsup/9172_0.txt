This place never disappoints. I come here EVERY TIME I'm in Vegas. The drinks are cheap and the bartenders aren't UNION jerks like you'll find on the strip. There are no clove cigarettes allowed or cigars allowed. Also, no photos!\n\nThe first time you'll walk in here you'll wonder if you're at the right place...you are...don't worry. No one will bite and if your lucky you'll get to sit next to a steel worker. Those guys love this bar! \n\nThis place is a great time and just remember to tip your bartenders well..!
