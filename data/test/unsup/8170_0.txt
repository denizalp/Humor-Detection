Love this nail spa.  I've been coming here every two weeks for the past two years on the recommendation of a friend.  Pretty sure I owe her a pedi!\nLinda is my favorite, but they're all great.  \nIt gets busy, especially on the weekends, so make an appointment, and be a bit flexible.  It's worth it!\nPolish always last the full two weeks (probably longer, but that's my preferred schedule) prices are competitive.\nSterile tools and great bath liners, which I especially appreciate.
