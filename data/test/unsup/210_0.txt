No people of color on the wall.\nThe food is good american Italian food. Nice salad options, good pasta and sauce, well cooked meats. The service is good. The portions are very large and it's a great place for groups. This restaurant is HUGE. The decor includes over 5000 pictures of white people. No people of color on the walls however you can see some celebrities on the \"Wall of fame\" in the lobby. Noticing this fact made me very uncomfortalbe. I wont be back.
