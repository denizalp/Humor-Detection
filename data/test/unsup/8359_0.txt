I recently took my family for Sunday breakfast and it was very good.  This Casino is so nice and clean.  Pleasure to walk thru.  The staff in the buffet are the best and their secret is out.  The lunch special at the new Farm Cafe is awesome..so fresh.  if you are in that area check it out.. definitely worth the time to visit.
