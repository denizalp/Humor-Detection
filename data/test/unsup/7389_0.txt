I called this company because of already great reviews, they were also the only company that were willing to come the same day and at 6:00 pm. Then when I got home the fan must of defrosted and started working again. I could not believe the office still answered and were so polite when I requested to cancel. I didn't even have a service done and I would recommend this company.
