Its not too often I review a dentist. Let's be real, NO one likes the dentist. Dr.Hylan and his staff are phenomenal though. They made me feel so comfortable in a time of fear of a procedure new to me. They explained everything to me. I understood all that would happen (no surprises). They were gentle and kind. They know what they're doing and they do it so well!!! If you need an emergency appointment, you get one.  They are so accommodating. Love them! Highly recommend.
