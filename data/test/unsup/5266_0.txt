WOW. The guy that handles the drive, he must really hate his job. I feel bad for you, I'm sorry you aren't happy with your current place of employment. HOWEVER, that gives you no reason to be disrespectful to the people that are paying you, the customer. I seriously have never in my life had such a HORRIBLE experience, not even at McDonalds !!!! He was such an asshole.
