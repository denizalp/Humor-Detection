Totally not impressed!!!\n\nJust got back from having a dinner there. Kinda, hungry now. Humm... What can i eat around here. Ohh yes, anyhow. There is nothing specifically wrong about it, just does not feel right. Crispy pizza was soggy, feta cheese was overpowering, they skimped on basil leaves, and even huge piece of Tiramisu was so alcoholy i would have probably gotten a ticket if i was pulled over. \n\nFor the amount of money we paid it should have been way way better.\n\n\"I like. NOT!\"
