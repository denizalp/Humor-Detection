Well, was pleasantly surprised that the entrance was free the afternoon we went there. I forgot what day but you can look it up on their website.\n\nGreat place to spend the day. Lot of great exhibits. My favorite were the dinosaurs. I thoroughly enjoyed the Greek and Roman artifacts as well. \n\nBeautiful architected building as well.
