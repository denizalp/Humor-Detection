I went to The Richmond Rogue twice, had some wings (I'm black) and a poutine.  There was a big round table and yeah, THATs about it for the positives... Except, the wings kinda sucked so omit that from the positives. The gravy was too creamy; they added way too much badger milk.  This place is MEH. Oh yea, also the poutine was not a positive experience either so omit that, and also the big round table shoulda been rectangle.
