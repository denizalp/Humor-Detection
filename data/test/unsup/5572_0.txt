If you love peanut butter-- the Haboob smoothie is really, really good in addition to being healthy.  My daughter had Yetiberry and loved it.  I fought off cancer by making my own juices\/smoothies-- but, Yeti's are so much better and easier!  (And no cleaning up the machine!)  Brought Citrasaurus home to and I LOVED THAT also!
