This show is SO outdated! I can't believe I actually spent money for this show. I would have much rather loose the money on the slot machines. \nHe has the biggest ego, he has some \"comedians\" pop in and out throughout the show and the jokes are so tasteless. You can tell this was not produced by Curque du Soleil and Criss Angel poorly produced his own show. Please save your money
