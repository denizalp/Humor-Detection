Great breakfast spot! It's a very nice ma and pa diner place that was packed when we got here, but very efficient so we didn't wait long. Lots of good small and medium (and large) options for very appropriate prices. My 2 eggs, 1 bacon, 1 sausage, potatoes and toast was $5.49 and cooked perfectly!\n\nLadies waiting on us were friendly and fast! If you're ok with country-diner type places you will not be disappointed.
