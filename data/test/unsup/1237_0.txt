This review is for the bar area.\n\nDang, this place sure is pricey but tasty. If you want to enjoy the place without breaking the bank, order an appetizer and keep eating the free bread they offer.\n\nI ended up ordering the shrimp scampi, but I wish I went with the meatball sliders. They looked much more filling. But in general, the appetizer portions are small. \n\nThat being said, the food is good and nicely presented. The service was pretty good, too. When I have more money to spare, I will definitely come back.
