I am a foodie and have been a connoisseur with various dishes, this restaurant is by far the best I have tasted in authentic kebabs, biryanis and meat based dishes. It's simply awesome. Try any meat based dishes only, you will really fall in love with the taste. It caters to Indian\/Pakistani taste buds. The dine-in facility is small but neat, forget the sprawl and focus on the food... I would definitely recommend it
