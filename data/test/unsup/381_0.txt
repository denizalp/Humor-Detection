I have to be honest and keep an open mind cause I saw a yelp average of 3 stars. But the food I ordered tasted good, and that should be first and foremost. Experience was good as well. Burgers tasted great, and my wife said shrimp scampi was delicious. Despite busy Sat lunch hour, service was excellent, and prompt.
