Come on?  Really?  Just because Oprah thinks there great, does not make them so!  Mine are better and they come out of a box and you don't have to wait in line for an hour! \n\nI visited Cupcakes at there Beverly Hills store and thought they were ok - but nothing to write home about - in fact, they weren't moist enough!\n\nWhen I saw the one that opened near Fashion Square all that came to mind was really?  Why?  And how the hell can there pay the rent selling cupcakes!?!  Hey, I am not hatin' just asking!
