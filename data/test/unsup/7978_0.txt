I've been to this spa\/clinic many times now for over a year, close to 2 years I think.  I always have a nice experience.  The staff is friendly, the RMTs do a great job.  Some are better than others, but that may be subjective due to the type of stress I'm feeling and what I prefer compared to someone else (pressure, technique, etc.)  Overall its always been good.\n\nI recommend this place, the rates are reasonable and the atmosphere is clean and quiet.
