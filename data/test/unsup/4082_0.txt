To start off - The doors to the bathroom's are left opened which is fine.. what is not fine is that from sitting at the bar you can see staright into the Men's room and see the sinks.  This allowed us to see the Kitchen staff go into the bathroom, then walk out without washing their hands..  Need I say more??  And this happened a few times while the owners were there so clearly this place is dirty and does not enforce rules.
