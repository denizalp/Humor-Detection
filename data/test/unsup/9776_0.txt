The third salt\/pepper shaker on the table is cayenne. Not cinnamon. I don't recommend putting your finger in your eye directly after screwing the top back on to the cayenne. I actually don't recommend putting cinnamon in your eye either.  \n\nI had the Clock Work Orange to drink - like an orange Gin and tonic. It was delicious.\n\nI ordered the Greek Goddess or something like that for dinner, and it was delicious!\n\nBoth times I've been here, it's been QUITE a wait for tables, but if you're not in a hurry, then go for it. The food is excellent.
