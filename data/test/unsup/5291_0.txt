I have read all these reviews, pretty bad looking, however I would like to post that my service with APS has been fantastic.  I spoke to Chad today and Chad was friendly, answered ALL of my questions AND made helpful recommendations for me.  I would recommend calling them.  They were very nice and very short wait time to be helped.  Thank you Chad!
