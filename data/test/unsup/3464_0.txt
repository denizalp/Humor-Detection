We held our company holiday party at the Croft this past Saturday and it was amazing. Red carpet rolled out to the street and two spacious open rooms allowed us all to mingle without being on top of one another. Because, hey, we're not that kind of bank. \n\nChef DeMarco's catering team served up plenty of different foods, and I hear it was fantastic.\n\nETA: There is a washroom in the building. Solid.\n\nThis truly was a venue to remember!
