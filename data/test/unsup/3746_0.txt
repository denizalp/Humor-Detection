All I have to say is WOW!!!! Our server was Sydney. She was super attentive, told us about the new menu items, an made some great recommendations! It was so nice to have a server who actually cared about her guests experience! We ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes, and theminced ham an egg. Every thing was delicious!!! Me and my girlfriend are definetly making this out new breakfast spot!!!!
