This Sushi place was opened today 15th March 2017. The first one hundred customers were given a free meal. \n\nThe food was excellent. The customer service was the best, very friendly staff.\n\nThis is a kid friendly family restaurant.\n\nI would recommend this place to all who love Sushi and to those who are skeptical try it who knows you may like it.
