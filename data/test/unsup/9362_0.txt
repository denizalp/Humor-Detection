If I could give it zero stars I would!!! STAY AWAY from this location! Not only will they mess up your entire order, they will be rude and STEAL your credit card information! And these people want to be paid 15$\/hr!? What a fucking joke! There are cretans that work here, go to any other KFC but this one!
