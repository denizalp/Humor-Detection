Stay away!  Classic bait & switch!  I saw a truck I was interested in advertised on line and then I called the dealer and provided the stock number.  The dealer told me the vehicle was available at the price I saw online, so I went.  I got there and suddenly the vehicle wasn't available.  They told me it was a loaner and conveniently out on loan.  The salesperson showed me a vehicle that was about $8,000 more than the one that was advertised.  I left.  I'd rather deal with people who I believe are honest and have integrity.
