I own multiple rental houses and I've been searching for a good plumber I can trust.  I decided to give Number One a shot when one house got a small shower leak.  For the 15 minute job installing an inexpensive part, they charged $225.\n\nI heard from the tenant that the plumber that showed up was very polite and efficient, but that isn't worth $800 \/ hr.  Number One foolishly priced themselves out of lots of future business with me and my family.
