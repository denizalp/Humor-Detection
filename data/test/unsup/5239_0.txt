Brace yourself folks because I'm talking about underwear.  I've had the most luck at this particular Bay location with finding bra sizes for little women, if you know what I mean.  I'm also thankful that they carry bras that aren't loaded with underwire and padding like most other places because I have no desire to look like Dolly Parton when I'm actually okay with embracing my Kate Hudson-ness (in her original form).
