First date... the guy was nice and we had a good time. The view was beautiful. But, the waitress was unprofessional and made me feel uncomfortable by flirting with my date several times. She even went as far as to stroke his arm several times throughout our evening. She ensured his drink was made right and not mine- two times. I definitely thought it was very unprofessional, disrespectful and inappropriate. I would be hesitant to come again because of the behavior of the staff.
