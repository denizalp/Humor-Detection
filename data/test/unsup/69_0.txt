Went here for a party, because my friend found the atmosphere to be perfect for him from a past visit. From what I see, it's quite a flexible one, with being able to do things like play music from your ipod on their stereo. Oddly enough, the biggest customers isn't Ryerson students like you'd expect given its location, but International students from Japan, as seen by the menus offering Japanese beers on the relatively cheap and maps\/flyers for them. Might come down here again for their $8.50 schooners of decent house brew.
