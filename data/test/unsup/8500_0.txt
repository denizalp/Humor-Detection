This urban hardware store is conveniently located but DO NOT shop there!\n\nThe owner is rude and actually VERY hostile.\n\nI always want to support local  businesses... especially because I don't want the Home Depots of the world the take over but this man does not deserve your hard earned money. Shop somewhere else..
