I would not recommend this place at all we were charged $50.00 for table reservation.  And waited still for one hour to be seated. It seems that Todd English has to nickel and dime customer to get them in to eat at his restaurant. There are alot more better service and food then this place in Las Vegas. We were all disappointed and will not ever come back here. AND OLIVE IS OPENING UP IN DOWNEY, CA. Don't go, go somewhere  for better food and service . The food is served cold.
