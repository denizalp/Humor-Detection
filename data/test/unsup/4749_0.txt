I don't understand why people give this place a good review.  This place is a rip off.  There is nothing here.  Everything is pricey and nothing taste good.  There is no place to park.  They are trying to get dumb people who has no clue what prices are to come here and rip them off.  You can get everything here elsewhere for a fraction of the cost.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  It's not worth the trip.
