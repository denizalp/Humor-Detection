Too bad I didn't get to enjoy the 9 for some evening of Irish music and fun.... =(  I did get to eat here for lunch and really like their Irish Banger Dish... bomb sausage and mashed potatoes with goat cheese! Then order a pint of Black Velvet to go along with all that food!  It's also cheaper than Wolfgang at the MGM.
