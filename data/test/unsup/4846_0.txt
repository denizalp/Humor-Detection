I absolutely love the chakra yoga class led by merriliz. I love the focus on chakra alignment and the way she speaks to the class leaves the room feeling uplifted and powerful. I truly believe as I come weekly I am able to leave feeling refreshed and rid of things no longer serving my best self. I would love to see more chakra yoga from merriliz here at the summerlin studio.
