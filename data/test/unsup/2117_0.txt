I have been a customer of Charlie's import auto service since 2002(exclusively). Sam, as well as being a knowledgeable and trustworthy mechanic, has become my good friend as well (he and his wife Jacky). I am one of the most frugal people you will ever meet, however..I actually enjoy bringing my vehicle to Charlie's for servicing because I know that they are good..honest people, running a \"small\" business, which I am happy to support. They do business the right way!
