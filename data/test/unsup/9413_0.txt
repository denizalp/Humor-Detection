Perfect Scoop's ice cream & boba is not only homemade but it's delicious! The store owners are amazing. Genuinely amazing. I left my wallet that had a lot of money and important stuff here & not only did the owner retrieve it, he attempted to drive to my house to drop it off many times. That is called over and beyond. I love their service and everything they have there taste so good and fresh! I definitely recommend this!
