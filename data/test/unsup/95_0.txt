First off, you get your money's worth at this place! The lunch specials come with a good serving of your entree, 2 big scoops of rice, an egg roll, and some fried wontons.\n\nThe food itself was okay. The beef and broccoli had a lot of flavor, the Orange chicken was way too sweet, and the sweet & sour sauce was nothing special. I also had a cup of wonton soup that was very good! \n\nOverall, the food was just alright, but with prices this good and quick service, I will be back for lunch to try something new!
