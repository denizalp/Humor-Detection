$20+ for all you can eat meat, seafood AND appetizers?! Probably one of the best deals for an all you can eat Korean bbq. I do agree tho that the banchans are lacking. But they make up for everything else you can order. Service is top notch too. It's located as part of the mall, but surprisingly we were able to get a seat right away.
