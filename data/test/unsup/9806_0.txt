The best Greek food in town! We ordered grill octopus, grill whole sea bass, Greek salad and Greek yogurt with honey. Everything was sooooo yummy! The price is very decent. I have been other fancy Greek restaurants in vegas before, such as Milo's. Can't even compare to Mer√°ki!\n\nMake sure you call ahead and make sure they are not running out of grill octopus !
