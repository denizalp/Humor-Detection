Excellent Food. Decent ambiance. Poor (no) air conditioning but hey, we're not in US anymore \n\nWe had steamed pork belly buns which were out of this world, seared duck and braised beef which were excellent, and laksa (a curry soup with chicken, egg, tofu, sprouts etc...) which was interesting but not quite my cup of tea. The owners were courteous and the service efficient. Definitely worth visiting. \n\nP.S. My French vocabulary consists of 3-4 words and I was not immediately demoted to a second class customer. That in and of itself earns this restaurant an extra star
