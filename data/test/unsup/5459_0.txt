I really wanted to go to Piola as I love Italian food.\n\nAlas, was in the area last night and decided to eat here for dinner.\nWe waited, then waited, and finally waited for some more to be seated. Interestingly, 2 employees saw us.\n\nFinally we were seated.\nSame story.\nWaited, waited and waited.\n\nLost my patience and then left.\n\nThe End
