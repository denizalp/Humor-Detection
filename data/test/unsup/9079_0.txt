Jessica...youre responding 5 months later with a load of B.S. and we both know it. I stand by every single word of my review. Business mist not be so great if you feel the need to respond to my review and flat out lie as a way to defend it. Funny how it took you this long to fabricate a rebuttal.  Good luck!
