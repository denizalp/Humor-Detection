Unsweetened iced tea and water served in a mason jar? You've won my vote! Hank's might be a no wi-fi zone, but the space awakens the creative juices. Mixed with the peace and quiet in the mid afternoon, I just can't help but want to sport my finest linen pants, sip my iced tea and breeze through some work. The space reminds me of the west coast - an airy feel, untreated floors and light wooden tables, but I'm getting the sense that the menu reins from the south. A meal here is definitely in order.
