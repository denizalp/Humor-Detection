I ate here with my 11 year old daughter.  The food was delicious.  We had a side salad, fried motzerella and a pizza with pepperoni and meatballs.  Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert so we will have to come back.  Also there was so much to choose from.  I'd like to come back and try something else on the menu.  The service was very good.
