I'm addicted to their Seafood, Lobster and Clam bake!\nTheir drink prices are great. Service is good, with a fun atmosphere.\nMy husband got the prime rib special, and a cheeseburger another time both were \"meh\"...he did get the Steak sandwich on our first visit and he loved it.\nWe also split the nachos, the app was HUGE but we've had better nachos.\nAnd we split a Cap't Jacks Buried Treasure desert, another huge portion...very sweet but delicious.
