I loved this place. And I'm sad that I am just now writing a review on it. \n\nSure the service wasnt great and some of their arcade controllers are broken, but I loved the music, loved the vibe  and loved the fact that I can get f*cked up and beat everyone's asses in video games. \n\nBRING IT BACK! BRING IT BACK!
