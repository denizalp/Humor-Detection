I really liked encore. The minimum bet for Black Jack was 15, but the manager lowered it to 10 upon request since it was a slow night. BALLERS ON A BUDGET  YEAH\n\nI ended up winning 180, and losing 260 after. Oh well Vegas, I go big and went home. \n\nThe hotel is very clean. The rooms I'd say was basic compare to some other suites around the strip. The wifi isn't free. \n\nThe thing that stood out of the most is, the hotel is gorgeous.
