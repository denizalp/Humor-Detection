We just bought a used Yukon Denali that Land Rover had on their lot.  From the minute we walked in the door everyone treated us with great care and respect.  They made the whole purchase so easy - and everything was exactly as we discussed.  Paperwork was done and signed in less than an hour (they had it ready when we got there).  The GM, Bobby Perich, was great and our salesman, Caelen Armijo, could not have been more professional and friendly.  Thank you for making a \"nervous-ing\" process so very easy and comfortable!!
