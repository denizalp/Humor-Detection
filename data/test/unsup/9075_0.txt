We got a cappuccino and a house blend coffee a egg cheese and ham bagel and a bagel with cream cheese I was super excited to see they had blue agave! They have a chapters for charity donate a book take a book ,book stand. Staff was friendly. The coffee shop supports heartforthecityaz.org. Helps with kids programs, and community programs. It's got a really nice whole full vibe inside. I highly suggest this coffee spot.
