Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Get the English Sausage Rolls and side of cheese! Too die for! \n\nI'm hesitant to give it 5 stars for fear that word will get out about the gem of a dive bar. I've never been disappointed by any of the food or drinks we've gotten there. We go regularly for happy hour or late night hangouts. The bartenders are always friendly and they work hard to earn those tips for sure. It's never very crowded and the regulars are a hoot.
