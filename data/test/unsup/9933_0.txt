This is the typical, fun when its super new but loses its \"hype\" too quickly. The food is not that great and inconsistent. If you do eat here, I highly recommend the baby lamb chops. Drinks are a miss and would suggest ordering what you feel you are happiest as your standard. The service is not great either. I always try to find the servers I know personally. It has a great terrace but in winter its terrible, its a tent, and its gloomy. I wish they would have better music after hours.
