Don't tell anybody, but I got a little scardzz.  You walk thru this maze and a bunch of rough & somewhat handsome guys in suits shake you & the key words are \"...I don't know nothin about nuttin!\"  One room is computerized and I spent about 2hrs just listening\/ viewing the history of LV Mobsters. If it wasn't for them, Las Vegas would still be a desert of nuttin...
