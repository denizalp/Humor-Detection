Awful experience.\n\n- Waitress got the order wrong and did not apologize\n- Drinks were empty the entire meal as the waitstaff did not come to refill the water\n- Brussels sprouts were soggy and definitely not fresh\n- Waitress slammed down the food at the opposite end of the table and walked away\n- There was bluish\/green detergent pooled at the bottom of one of the dishes (side order of chicken)\n- Got a terrible case of food poisoning shortly after the meal\n\nWill not ever be returning.
