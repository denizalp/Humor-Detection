Had lunch here today and enjoyed the meal for sure. The location seems larger than other ones I have been to and is designed well. Staff were all super friendly. As for the food, I knocked out the beef and cheddar and it was very good. Barbecue and cheese, what a combination. Overall, a very good experience.
