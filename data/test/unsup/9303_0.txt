If there's another place I can play ping pong undisturbed in a giant gymnasium while sipping all the Tecate I ever wanted AND ALSO head inside the lobby bar for legitimate cocktails and board games in a comfortable lounge...I am not aware of it. \n\nI may not have stayed at the Ace, but somehow I still overstayed my welcome. Go figure.
