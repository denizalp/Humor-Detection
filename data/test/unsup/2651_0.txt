I used Amelia C & Co for my wedding day makeup and for the bridal party. WOW! WOW! WOW! I had Alana G and she was spectacular. I've never felt so beautiful. I'm very natural (never wear makeup) so I was worried it was going to be too dark or too heavy but she made me look natural. She gave me exactly what I was looking for on my wedding day. I couldn't be more pleased with how professions Alana G was or Amelia C & Co as company. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything!
