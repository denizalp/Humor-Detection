Will not return. Rude employees from the start. I would have left but we already did valet and were meeting friends. The ordering system is not ideal nor the food pick up. Non alcoholic drinks are pricey and there are no refills. Served in small Mason jars. The whole set up was confusing and its hot and humid inside. \nFood was okay but overpriced. \nTried the Mac & cheese deals and they were awesome - that's where the extra star on my review came from.
