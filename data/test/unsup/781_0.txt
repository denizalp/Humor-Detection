So far so good with uber! Every experience has been convenient and awesome.  The one thing that can be very inconvenient is if you do not have cash on hand and need a ride you cannot tip on the app. I really hope to see uber do something about this.  Other than that,  I love the service. Every driver I've had had been great.  I love that you can see where they are on the app add they are driving to you.
