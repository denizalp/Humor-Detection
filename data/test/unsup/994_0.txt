We parked on top of the New York New York building and saw the largest view from the very top. New York New York casually plays swing music in the elevator she inside the lobby. Once entering in, it's connected to a large arcade, restaurants and bars and casinos. The bright sight of their logo shines real big and catches eyes. The building is connected to most shopping centers and you can spot the rollercoaster from underneath of the casino. It's one of my favorite buildings in Las Vegas.
