I'm going two stars. Sorry Dan.\n\nHad our meal ended after the appetizers (and before the \"Water Show\") I might be inclined to give it five.\n\nAs it stands though, the waiter upsold us on entrees we  didn't need, telling us our apps \"won't be enough.\" Not sure what sort of behemoths he thought we were, but clearly he thought we had been without food for weeks.\n\nThen the show started. Wow. That was hideous.
