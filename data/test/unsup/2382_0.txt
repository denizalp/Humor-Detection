This place is disgusting. I ordered a chicken quesadilla. The chicken looked like slop. More like pull pork but more wet you could squeeze a cup of liquid out of the meat alone. It had no flavor, very bland and wet. The food looked like it has been sitting there all the day. The vegetables has gone bad and the sauce was spoilt. What a waste of money. I should have gone back for a full refund.
