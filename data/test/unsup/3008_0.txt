I have come here twice and I will continue to come here whenever I stop by Kensington! A great little Mexican stop with amazing tacos. The Al Pastor tastes very authentic and has a nice sweetness from the pineapple.\nIt can get a little busy but it's worth the wait. The price point is pretty decent as well. \n A must try! :)
