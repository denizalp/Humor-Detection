So ever since I was little I have wanted to get on this ride... My dad never let me, so FINALLY I get to go to Vegas 13 years later as an adult and YES, I went to ride this ride..... My excitement is going through the roof!\n\nIT SUCKED!!! It hurt like a MOTHER! My shoulders still hurt from it a week later! It is rough, bumpy, and annoying.\n\nI guess sometimes dad knows best!
