Stay AWAY from this gym!!! Before you even consider signing up with them, beware that they are running a billing system that I would consider fraudulent. The electronic forms you sign do not contain the price they promised, and then they will charge you whatever they want. The manager, Chris, is an a**hole that will back out from his words. I would recommend NOBODY to this gym.
