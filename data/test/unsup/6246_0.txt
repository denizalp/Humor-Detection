I was introduced to this place by my cousin, and man was it good and all-you-could-eat.  Everything I had was tasty.  I highly recommend the sashimi salad (or whatever it was called, it is raw fish salad) with spicy sauce.  Wow.  I want to come here everyday.  The only con I have, but not to ding it a star, is it gets crowded, so get there early!
