Rude ass people!! I pulled up about 655pm. & when I get to pay, the guy says the vacuums will be off when your done! Like who the fuck cares I came here to wash my car. Then I go thru the wash and it was soo shitty I asked to redo and he says he closed the gate. It's not closed you just put two cones on the entrance. Never coming here again! I would give them no star if I could've!!!
