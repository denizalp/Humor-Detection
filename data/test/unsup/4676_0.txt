Ordered online and was very disappointed as compared to dinning in person. Bolognese was a smaller portion, and the lasagna was tiny and drenched in sauce to cover it up. The bread sticks which typically are good were hard, greasy, cold and covered in an insane amount of garlic. Honestly it feels like they forgot about the order and through something together quickly and grabbed old bread sticks. We threw a majority of the meal away and are unsure if we'll return.
