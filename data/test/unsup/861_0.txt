Great pizza place in Kannapolis! And the wings are outstanding too! We loved the garlic Parmesan, sweet chili and standard buffalo wings. SO GOOD! We also had two heros that were ok but the sausage and pepper pizza and plain cheese pizza were great! Nice family friendly atmosphere. We will be back. Thanks!
