Tried to edit my review but deleted it instead along with the very inappropriate and rude response from the owner. I've had Virgin cheese and it's not worth $12. Also... don't waste your time supporting a business that says and I quote \"maybe it's too expensive for you\" - super rude and unethically priced. But you're not allowed to say that to her Vegan cult followers. I'll never buy again.
