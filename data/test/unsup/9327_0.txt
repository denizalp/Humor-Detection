Interesting little boutique with dressy-casual clothes, lots of jewelry and accessories, and even a cute pet chinchilla! Space is open and bright, style features a lot of tunic topics and maxi dresses. I headed right over to the jewelry selection, which was a little pricier than expected. Favorite items were the stone bangles ($45-60). They also carry an interesting line of lotions and cosmetics, but I didn't care for the scents. Staff seemed really helpful about suggesting styles and finding extra sizes for other customers.
