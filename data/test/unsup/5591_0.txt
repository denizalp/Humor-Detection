The complete opposite of Petco. Not in the game to inflate prices, but to serve the consumer. They have nice employees and a wide variety of healthy products for your pet. To find the highest prices in town, go to Pet Supplies Plus. For the unhealthiest products for Fido, shop at Marc's. Marc's should just be called the duty free of China annex. \n\nMy dog gives it four paws.
