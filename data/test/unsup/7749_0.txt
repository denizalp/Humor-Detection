I don't normally understand the hype around burgers - you've had one you've had them all - that is until I had their speciality Cabernet Burger. It's a 1\/2 pound beef patty flavored with cabernet wine, topped with swiss cheese, bacon jam, caramelized onions and onion aioli served with some of the most phenomenal french fries I have had in some time! The paninis were insane as well, crispy and really flavorful!\n\nService was great - drinks were never empty and waiters were friendly.  The decor is cute and french themed. Worth checking out if you are in the area!
