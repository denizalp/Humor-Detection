This is a fun place and you must go while you're in Vegas! It is busy and loud and fun! All the food is traditional German fare. The light little cucumber salad is a nice palate cleanser after all the rich food. Our waiter was just adorable and charming! The tables are long and you'll sit with fun people. I recommend the Jager Schniztel and spatzle. I wish I'd had room for dessert, but the portions are quite large. If you have a larger group you can share a cheese plate and a dessert. Enjoy!
