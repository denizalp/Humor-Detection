I love the casual and friendly atmosphere here. The portions are huge and the food is hearty. The waiter convinced us to try the beef carpaccio and it was ...interesting but delicious. Also, the grilled squid and octopus in chickpeas was really good. I had a burger that wasn't very memorable but I did leave satisfied. While we were there, the Bellagio water show started and we totally wished we were sitting by the window, so try to get a table facing the fountain!
