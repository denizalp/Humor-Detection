Amazing popcorn! I loved the Butter and Caramel flavors... but they have a bunch more that you need to try out. The store is tucked away in the Miracle Mile but relatively easy to find (right next to the first \"roundabout\" when you enter from the Strip).\n\nTheir popcorn is also a nice present for yo' folks back home.\n\nPopcorn galore!
