Like any major airport, check-in can be a cattle drive. But professionally run. Fresh furnishings and quite new looking in much of its appearance, especially the exterior structures. Interiors almost feel like a smaller town's airport terminals waiting areas, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. A major plus, was the close bathroom and dining options proximity for awaiting passengers. Like directly across the walkway from you.
