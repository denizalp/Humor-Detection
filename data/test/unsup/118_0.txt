Best pizza in the area by a long shot! The crust and sauce are made fresh and are AMAZING and the toppings are all fresh (not pickled) and are really high quality ingredients.  Pizza is cooked to perfection and the owner is pleasant, friendly and generous. I discovered the restaurant just a few days ago and have now gone back twice! Don't let the negative review below dissuade you, give this place a try :)
