My dog got a paw infection, i drove by and stopd in @2:00 on a sunday. They were open and i was in a room in minuits. The Dr. was a nice young man who had exelent bedside maner and seemd knowledgable. He took nyjel back, made his paw all beter and sent him home with cone, 2Rx and paw wipes. Total visit was $186. Thats waaayyy less than my usual vet costs and i hate my usual vet. This will be my new go-to vet :)
