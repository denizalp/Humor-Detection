Blue Banana is awesome because it's flippin' GINORMOUS. \n\nSo yes, it carries the same type of stuff as a lot of the other quirky Toronto gift stores (Outer Layer, Propaghanda, etc) but the awesome thing about Blue Banana is it's 20 times bigger with 20 times the inventory of all the smaller shops. Yet it still has that independent\/local shop vibe.\n\nGood place to browse, kill time and find unique gifts. \n\nNot a lot of staff so it's somewhat annoying to actually find help.\n\nHot sauce selection is out of control!
