Very lovely little boutique store in Rock Hill. Cute place for young women to shop. My only complaint is that these new trendy shirts and dresses are all polyester, which I think sucks! They are clingy and staticy. The prints that they sell are very trendy and cute. They have lots of jewelry and even some shoes.  Fun place to check out!
