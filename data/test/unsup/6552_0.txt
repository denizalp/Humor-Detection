New, smallish, clean, excellent service, great coffee. That is what we come here for. Also serving sandwiches and baked goods. \nA little hard to get into and out of the location. This is in the old Blue Spruce Pool area which is bbuilt up as a new commercial space in Murrysville.\nOne other good thing, if you like it, is they have a drive thru.
