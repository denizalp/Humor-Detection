Tried almost all of there ramen :) ! My faves are kogashi ramen and tan tan men. There karaage is so yummy too crispy and juicy. The Japanese chef always delivers excellent food. I gave it 4 stars because \"some\" of the servers take long to get orders and when you call them they ignore you sometimes which I don't like :(
