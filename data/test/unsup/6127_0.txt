No wonder America is so hated, horrible throngs of white trash pack the sidewalks. The canvassing, immigrants thrusting prostitution advertisements into your space every few feet.. The incredibly LAME action figures overcharging for pictures.. Most of all the horrendous design, you can't walk the strip without escalators and detours that force you into casinos.. And of course tons of obnoxious drunken teens and 20 somethings..  Head downtown, it's a lot better!  Las Vegas might be the BEST and worst place on earth...
