Don't use these guys.  I used them for a change of locks when we bought a new house, and the guy took forever.  He refused to put on the type of lock I wanted, and when it was done the lock was really sticky on the front door.  I thought it would loosen up over time, but I was wrong - a month later, my key broke off in the lock!  When I called to have them let me in the house, they refused to come until 10:00AM the next day.\n\nDon't waster your money - call someone else.
