Oh my goodness, this place is a serious addiction! My husband and I come from New England where the pizza is right up there with NY pizza and this place trumps every other pizza joint in the valley.\n\nUnlimited toppings, THAT ARE FRESH, such good prices, and friendly staff. You really can't get any better!
