Went here on a mini road trip to T&T Middlefield. Ordered three dishes: shrimp in salad, pan fried taro cake, and ham sui kok. \n\nThe taro cake tasted blah and when it cools down it is even worse. \nTheir crispy shrimp with salad is excessively oily.  I had to take out the skin.  \n\nTheir ham sui kok had a weird smell for their meat.\n\nMSG levels are off the roof at this restaurant as well.\n\nNever coming here again on my own next time.
