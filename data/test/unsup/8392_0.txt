Om Spa is located inside Moksha Yoga Thornhill.\n\nWhat's better or more zen and relaxing than having a Thai Yoga Massage after a vigorous yoga practice? And you don't even need to leave the building!\n\nOm Spa has other services that is standard as other spas I have been to: Manicure, Pedicure, Waxing, Facials and even a half day spa packages!\n\nYoga, Spa, Yoga, Spa.. I can do that everyday!
