Went there for a work social.  I was surprised that this place was like a sushi Hooters.  Don't get me wrong, if I could pull off what the girls were wearing, I probably would.  My taste is just a little different & I was under the impression that it was classier.\n\nLoved the bar and the seating area they provided for us.  The sushi was great, as was the service.  \n\nProbably won't return.
