Okay people, you're all on crack!  I would take a double double anytime over this place, it's just an average burger joint...nothing special.  \n\nHere's a tip:\nFor $1 extra to add cheese on each burger you order, just do yourself a favor and order an extra burger and put on the cheese yourself at home since the burgers are small.\n\nA successful business makes it by word of mouth, value, and customer service...\nnot by jacking up the prices!
