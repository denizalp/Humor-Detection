** Nightclub Review**\n\nOverall the club was very fun.  I like the fact they have seating in the back, which is great since you don't have to buy a bottle to sit down.  The music kept everyone on the dance floor all night.  The place is pretty small and the line does form early.  The ONLY down fall, beware of the bartenders charging differently.  The first bartender charged us $22 for two drinks, but the others charged $25.  It was weird.  Overall, I would go back.
