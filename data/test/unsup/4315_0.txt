Pros: Food and service were decent.\n\nCons: On a not-so-busy Sunday afternoon, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, although many empty tables were available. A lot of the tables weren't cleared off. Maybe they were understaffed.\n\nOverall, we had a good time - not amazing, but not bad either.
