This place is OLD.  There's not much to this place.  The rooms are small and outdated.  Nothing special here.  They do allow pets, for an added fee of course.  Other than that, there really isn't too much to say about this place.  No amenities.  Only one restaurant (which was good, but SOOO slow).  No reliable wifi.
