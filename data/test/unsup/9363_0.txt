Came by for dinner the night and was pleasantly surprised as this is a chain!\n\nStarted off with the butter lettuce that Yelpers suggested and it was fresh, light and tasty! The waiter made my salad a half order as apparently others eat this as an entree?!?\n\nThe ribeye this year was fresh, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The mushroom topping did help out the flavoring!\n\nThe broccolini was also decent, fresh and flavorful as well!\n\nService was okay, on par with a chain Americanized restaurant.
