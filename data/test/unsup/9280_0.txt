This place came highly recommended and didn't disappoint!  The first thing you notice when you walk in is the wonderful smell of wood smoke and BBQ.  The next thing you notice is the friendly staff.  The owners, Paul and Sandy, take real pride in their restaurant (which they started as a labour of love in their retirement years) and it shows in the quality of the food and service, which are both outstanding.  I will be a regular customer!
