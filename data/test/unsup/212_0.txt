Went in tonight with my family and the two girls who worked there were really friendly and helpful! The store is sooooo cute and I want to have my daughters 2nd bday party there! I read a bad review on this place on the way over in the car about how something they got was stale or something but my boyfriend and and sisters boyfriend got treats and they said it was so good! Very fresh, tasty and fluffy:) will be coming back soon!
