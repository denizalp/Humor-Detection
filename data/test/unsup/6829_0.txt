This restaurant epitomizes why I feel sorry for vegetarians.  I am an omnivore and I am neither afraid nor put-off by the idea of an all veggie meal. \n\nI will say that the restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly but the food tends to be either bland or odd tasting and the service is painfully slow even when it is not busy. \n\nThe only redeeming quality is that they cater to vegans (who don't know any better than to rate this 5 stars).  I guess it's working for them though.
