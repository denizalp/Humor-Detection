Wow-fantastic! First time staying at the Kimpton Tryon Park and it is definitely as good if not better than some of the other city center hotels we have stayed at. Great service at check in. Valet parking-pretty pricey at $32\/night. The park is right across the street. Waking distance to lots of great restaurants and bars. Rooms are well appointed. We didn't bring our dogs this time but animals are allowed at no additional fee. I would consider staying here again.
