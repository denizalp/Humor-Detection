My colleagues and I ate here on our lunch break. Fast service, nice staff, and the food came out quickly. I got the Carne Asada bowl which was amazing. My coworkers got one of each of the tacos all of which were fantastic, and a side of mac and cheese which had cheetos sprinkled on top. Very good! The salsas are all really good and we also enjoyed the chips. Great spot!
