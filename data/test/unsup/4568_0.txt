This store is so cute! Need some HK? Anime? Trinkets? Asian Doo-Dads, and more??? This would be the place to go!\n\nPrices are a smidget higher than you'd expect for some items but it's a great place to go to if you don't want to drive all the way to China town or any other far, far away place that isn't in the Southwest.\n\nAfter reading Callie's review, it's pretty upsetting to know that they sell fake goods. They really mark up items that are pretty popular so, I will be on the look out next time I am in.
