Most enthusiastic service I have ever received! Those who work there are passionate about their food and are proud to serve it to you which made me so excited to try it! \n\nWe ordered the falafels, hummus, and gyro, all delicious! The falafels were freshly made and came out piping hot with a perfectly made tahini sauce.  The hummus was also freshly made and served with homemade pita bread.  I don't eat meat so I can't speak for my husbands gyro, but he nearly inhaled it!  \n\nCan't wait to come back!
