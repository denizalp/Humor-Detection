Bad service at the bar 5\/17\/16 shortly after noon from the older gentlemen bartender. Stood there for 5 mins before I was greeted by another younger bartender who showed up from the back room who then said the older gentleman would help me. And even then, the older gentleman ignored me and just shuffled things around in the counter.  Left as I was in a hit of a hurry.
