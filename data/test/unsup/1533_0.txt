First time here and overall it was a great experience. I was seated and my order was taken right away. Ordered #52 and a side of shrimp and pork spring rolls. Spring rolls were ok, pork tasted undercooked but the main entree (#52) was amazing! The entire mix of it all was delicious down to the sauce. Definitely would eat here again.
