Welcome to the neighborhood.  Tasty, friendly, and just good. the plantain chips with chimichurri were good--a nice start.  The gumbo was delicious.  The menu is small but seems to be so well executed.  The service was super friendly.  There is a small outdoor deck but the weather did not cooperate for us to use.  Looking forward to a return trip to try some of the other items on the menu.
