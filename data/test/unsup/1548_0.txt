$12.99 ribeye dinner. (Did you hear me???) $12.99 RIBEYE DINNER. You get on awesome deal right there. The ribeye was very flavorful without a lot of fat. It was cooked to a perfect medium and the sides of mashed potatoes and broccoli Were enough to make you more then satisfied.  The most awesome part is the $12.99 ribeye  deal is available 24\/7. I'm gonna stop writing before the food coma kicks in.
