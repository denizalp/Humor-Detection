Amelia C & CO is AWESOME. I had the pleasure of Melissa for makeup. She was so wonderful. We had so much fun the couple of hours she was there. My makeup looked amazing, I've never felt so beautiful in my life.  I got so many compliments that day. Someone even stopped me walking through the hotel to compliment my makeup. My bridesmaids, mother and sister in law all had theirs done, and they couldn't say enough good things. Highly recommend!!
