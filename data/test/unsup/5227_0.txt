First of all I spoke with Tram Tran, who was very helpful getting me abs my large party to decide MIX was one of our must hit clubs while in Vegas and I am so glad. \n\nThe place is amazing. The views are breathtaking. The drinks are delicious. There is a patio that's just insane. We had a great time.
