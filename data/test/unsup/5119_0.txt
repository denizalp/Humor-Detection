This definitely isn't a place you can come to when you are in a hurry to eat, because there's ALWAYS a wait. All you can eat sushi for $23 totally worth it! Rolls are delicious and flavorful. If you are a sushi lover i do suggest checking this place out. Kind of a drive for me but so far this is the tastiest sushi ive had in Vegas. Prices are Normal. Service is average.
