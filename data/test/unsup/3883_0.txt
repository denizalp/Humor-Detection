Service: made our months ahead reservations, restaurant was half empty, the host was going to sit us all the way back. People who doesn't have reservations for better table than us. \nFood: they use to serve clams on salad bar, but not this time. They charge us extra for grill pineapple (before was part of our meal. No fruits on salad bar. Parmesan chicken wings was terrible taste. We have to keep asking for certain meats.\nOverall: we been here for the last 4 years. Next super bowl we are not planning to come back anymore.
