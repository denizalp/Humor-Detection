Great atmosphere and friendly service.  First time visiting but not the last.  The menu was easy to navigate and our waitress was very helpful when asked for suggestions.  We had the sticky garlic wings and porky pine pizza, out of this world!  Next visit I need to try that ruben sandwich with pale ale sauce!
