Just a visitor from out of town. Food was wonderful but there was no English menu and some of the servers don't speak English. No vegan options that I could see but ended up having a bagel with jam. The bagel was good but server didn't even bring peanut butter as asked. Bring a friend who speaks French otherwise you won't get much help.
