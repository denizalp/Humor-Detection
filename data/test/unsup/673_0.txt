Govig are headhunters:  they don't care about you, they want you to fill a job so they can make money.  The recruiters have to fill jobs every day, every week, every month.   If they don't do this, they don't make money.  It's ultra competitive.  Todd Govig is in charge.  How did he get to the top?  His mom and dad gave him the job - they started the biz.  Look at the website.  There's a video of Todd skiing talking about how he's the luckiest person in the world.  Neptism's always wonderful.
