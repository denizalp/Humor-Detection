This is the best bar of all the bars. You can wear sweatpants or you can wear high heels--you can be your own Taylor Swift song, and sing it too on karaoke nights. You can trust Brandi to make you an outrageous and delicious drink and you can trust Tom to make the best wings in the history of chickens being eaten by people. If you ever wanted to have a bar that felt like your bar, this is the place for you.
