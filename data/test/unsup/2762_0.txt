Hot damn, frozen custard is delicious!  I love the stuff and they sell it in one of the warmest climates this side of the Mississippi!  My friends and I walked from the Stratosphere to Luv-It to devour some delicious frozen custard.  The neighborhood is a little sketchy but you know it's good when people eat it in their cars with the A\/C on.  Made fresh daily.  Cash only.
