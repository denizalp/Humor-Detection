I moved in to Camden Tiara almost a year ago and have had a great experience.  The staff is always helpful - Blair in the office is really great and the maintenance staff (Eddie,  Hector & David) always have service requests taken care of promptly.  My neighbors are great as well. I also love the technology package they offer! I'd highly recommend moving here if you're looking for a spacious apartment at an affordable rent.
