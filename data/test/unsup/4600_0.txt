Happy, Happy, Happy. I'm hoping every visit here will be as good as our visit today. We ordered, for our appetizer, the Salumi & Cheese board; for our meal, the Chicken Piccata & Broccolini; a side of Meatballs; the Margarita Pizza; & a fabulous dark beer ( Left Hand Stout). Our waiter Tony made our dining experience exemplary, as did supporting staff. The view of City Center shop was nice too. Price averages out to around $50 a person for dinner. We'll be back. :)
