I love this place! It is super clean and cute! The staff is amazing. Leslie and her husband are super sweet. They will patiently wait for me while I take 3 hours to pick out a color and they never complain when I request some crazy designs.  Their pricing is very reasonable and they do an amazing job.  I never leave their salon disappointed. This is my favorite salon by far! Highly recommend!
