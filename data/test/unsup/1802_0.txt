One of my favorite markets to shop at because they sell such unique and healthy items. You can even buy flowers here. There is a section in the back where they rotate free samples of different things. It's different every time. \n\nHawaiian, tropical themed market and I love the decor inside. The employees are always serving with a smile and the lines go by quick. Don't forget to use a tiny shopping cart if you have a bulk of items that you want to buy!
