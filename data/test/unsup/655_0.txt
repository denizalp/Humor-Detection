Great service and fantastic food!  They do not stiff on portions here.  My hubby and I had the calamari appetizer, FUJI apple salad, small side of brussel sprouts, crab fried rice, main dishes were Chilean sea bass and the sole dish.  To compliment the meal we also had a bottle of Proseccco and the bananas foster for desert.  Better believe we packed it to go and will savor the rest later.  EXCELLENT!!!
