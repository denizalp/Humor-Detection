Each time I visit Vegas I try to visit new places but as Identify members I was trying to stay within the Cosmopolitan.  Unfortunately this one left me disappointed. My husband and I were really hungry and just wanted a burger.  It was ok but not worth the hype in my opinion.  I've certainly had better burgers. Service was good but it was slow.
