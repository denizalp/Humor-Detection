Bikini: Where everybody knows your face. Or they should know it if you go there twice or thrice a week on average. And why shouldn't you? It's practically a tropical island oasis with flowing pitchers of delicious, cold, golden Blue Moon. Or Bud, Hein, or Pabst...if you're crazy like that. They painted th bathrooms recently. There are always christmas lights twinkling  in the eyes of the goddesses behind the bar. Aloha.
