Garbage prices and never have stock for the items I'm needing ever. Receptionist was very rude to me when I called in about possible item availability. If I was in charge I would have fired her but thank god the lady deeston helped me out to getting to the right department to at least inquire about an item. But I will never come back due to my experience thanks to grainger
