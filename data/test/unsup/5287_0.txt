Isaac has done a great job with this shop. When he first started coming my son had quite a bit of anxiety about getting his haircut. Isaac has done a great job in getting him more comfortable. I love that Isaac does a good job of sticking to his schedule. We rarely have to wait more than a few minutes. I also appreciate the professional environment. In addition, my kids love the reading nook that he has in both of his shops. They look forward to going to the barber shop. I would definitely recommend Isaac.
