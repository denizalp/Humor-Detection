I've had my hair cut all over LV and i have yet to find a salon that ive liked more than this one. From the staff and stylists, the atmosphere and style to the location and product they carry, this salon emits class from top to bottom. Every hair cut ive had here has been top notch, exactly what ive asked for and exceeding my expectations. Jen is a great stylist and a real asset to your company! 10\/10 would return.
