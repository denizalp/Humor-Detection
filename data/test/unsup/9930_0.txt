As an avowed heterosexual cis-male who normally doesn't care for clubbing, I must say: these guys know how to party better than anyone I've ever seen. Advice: Don't show up sober; drinks are expensive. When I went, I got served free hot dogs and overpriced Molson Ex by a drag queen in a cheerleader outfit with a Texas flag (the theme was spooooooooorts, if memory serves). Love the roof deck, too.
