Where oh where to begin!\n\nThe burgers are out of this world. Forget 5 guys and Smashburger. This place has better quality and is cheaper, which is amazing considering the quality.\n\nThe special sauce is delicious with a bacon burger with cheese. The fries are delicious and I like to mix the special sauce with ketchup which gives it a nice kick. \n\nI haven't tried their other menu items yet. I just finished with all their burgers and I have never had a disappointing experience.
