This was our second time coming to Vapiano! The first time was 5 years ago and when we returned to Charlotte, it was on our MUST DO list! The food is excellent, fresh, and properly prepared! The chefs make sure to answer any questions you may have. The atmosphere is great for date night, girl's night, or any occasion for celebration.
