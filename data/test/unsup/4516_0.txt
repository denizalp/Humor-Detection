If you are looking for a combination sports\/semi-dive pub - this is the place! They have some large flat-screen TVs, decent pub style food, and the staff is friendly. They also offer karaoke!\n\nThe age group of patrons while we visited ranged between 35-70 years old. This is not a night club for the \"clubber\" 21-25 set! This is more like a neighborhood watering hole.\n\nI had their fish and chips - delicious!
