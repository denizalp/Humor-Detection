The drinks are alright. It's way too sweet\/sugary than other boba places. I love taro boba, but this place isn't my favorite. \nPros: it's open til 2am, they offer vegan treats and ice cream \nCons: they only offer large drinks, boba drinks are way too sweet... I think the guy who works there is like a dictator for his female employees, he treats them like they're servants, I've been there a few times, and he's a rude to them every time..
