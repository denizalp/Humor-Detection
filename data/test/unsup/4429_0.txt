A long wait here for your order. The only bonus was I knew my meal was fresh.\n\nMy husband and I split a personal pan pizza and breadsticks. The breadsticks had been sitting there for awhile and was missing that delicious garlic butter. \n\nI guess for an overprice \"fast food\" meal check it out.
