After giving this place a 5 star rating, I will back off a bit and say that my night there was 5 stars... The club itself, though? Empty. 15 people there. Maybe. \nDid we have a BALL anyway? \nYou bet!\n\nI could have fun here just looking around. Love the velvet wallpaper, the chandeliers, the staircase, the bench seating..... The decor here is right up my alley. \n\nHad a great night. Will return soon.
