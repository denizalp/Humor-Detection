The coolest part is the architecture of the museum itself. Watch the video that runs through the history of rock.  Some pretty cool wax figures of stars ranging from Axl Rose to Brittney Spears. I was disappointed that there was not more Van Halen memorabilia the last time I was there.  Maybe there is now that they have been inducted into the hall.
