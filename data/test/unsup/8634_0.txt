Surprising.  Went for Winterlicious.  Carpaccio was great.  Cacciatore Pizza (they let you choose the type at Winterlicious which is nice) was excellent.  Dessert was good.  The person I dined with took completely different apps, pizza and desert, which I tasted, and they were all as good as mine.  I don't understand how this is only rated at 3.5 stars.  One of the best Italian in the city.
