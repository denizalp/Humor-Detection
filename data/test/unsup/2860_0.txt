This pool is baller status!  Sharks & stingrays with a water tunnel slide that goes through the pool! Genius.   The pool & the steak house here are the only reason I'm a guest!!!  I love the old part of vegas naturally it's the oldest part in the city.  Def has energy, not like the strip.  It's nostalgic in many ways!
