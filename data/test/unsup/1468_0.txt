My wife and I love this place. We have lived in Uptown for a long time. We have been eating here since they opened. We just finished a late lunch there I have to say this was one of the best burgers I've ever had. We were able to order ours medium rare since they grind their own meat. Bottom line is the food, buns, and service are awesome. Did I say service? The staff here are awesome. Highly recommended.
