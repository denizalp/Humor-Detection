o sole mio.. o sole mio... \n\nI forgot what I ate, and I forgot what I drank..\nSays a lot about this chain restaurant.  While it does not dissapoint, it is not memorable at all.\n\nThe hostess was kinda grumpy. We had an extra person , and she had to move us.. and she was all huff and puff.. I was like, lady, the place is empty.. why you mad?\n\nAnyway, i totally cannot remember what i ate here..
