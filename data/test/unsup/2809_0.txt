Great location in Downtown Phoenix. Ambiance is good and the music selection is fun. The doll collection downstairs is a little creepy but a fun attraction! We only ordered from the appetizer menu but everything was great! The table next to us was raving about the flatbreads they got, Ill try them out the next time we come.
