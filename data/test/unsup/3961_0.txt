I'm all about the free chips and salsa. The chips are warm and light but really filling that I could only eat a little bit of my entree. The venue is really big! You could throw a party here. I loved their xmas tree so pretty!! My friend had a burrito really generous portions and I had a tortilla salad. Both were good  but nothing amazing. Great value and great portions for value. I used a groupon and I would be back :)
