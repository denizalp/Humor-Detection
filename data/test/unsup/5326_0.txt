Okay place and the employees are very friendly and helpful.  Great customer service and outgoing.  This is one of the lowest pricest vape shops, unfortunately with low pricing comes low quality products.  Their ejuice is made in front of you and I brought it home to steep (set) and waited a week and vaped it, their ejuice is bland.  Go buy great quality eliquid\/ejuice elsewhere.
