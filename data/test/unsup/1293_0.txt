I'm applying for a Medical Marijuana Establishment license and boy oh boy has it been a pain in the azzzzzz process. The state couldn't make up their mind and didn't give as clear of answers as you'd of hoped. B&D was always available to answer questions to the best of their ability and even stayed past closing to take care of me!
