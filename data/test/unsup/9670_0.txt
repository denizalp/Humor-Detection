We were super excited to hit up this buffet... However our excitement quickly faded AFTER we paid to get in and observed the options kind of sucked. The sushi\/sashimi looks frozen\/not fresh at all, the salmon was disgusting, and eh, well, everything just kind of looked college cafeteria like... The only things I found decent were the turkey (carved), hummus and cherry tomatoes so I loaded up on those. I will definitely NEVER come back to this place, not quite the feast I'd ever want to eat again.
