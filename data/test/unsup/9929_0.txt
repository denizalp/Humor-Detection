While the room was nice and ready on time, I booked this resort solely for the amazing pool\/patio that it boasts.  Sadly, when I arrived at 2:15 pm, I was told that the entire patio and pool were closing at 3:00 for a private party and would not be available during my stay.  The website does not mention that the pool may not be available.  After 10 days of hiking in the Utah desert all I wanted was to soak in a beautiful pool.  I would have done better at LaQuinta!
