We ordered 30 wings and a large 2 topping pizza with a 2 liter. My husband got home and when we looked at the order we realized that they didnt give us the right pizza. I called to let them know and the manager on the phone tried to convince me that they gave us what we ordered. Not to mention they didnt even provide the soda they upsold us on or THE RECEIPT! We did not spend almost $50 there to not get what we ordered! We will NEVER order from this establishment again.
