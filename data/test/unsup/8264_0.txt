I'm so disappointed. Called on Friday and specifically said the word MASSAGE and the happy hour special for both my husband and myself. Show up, do the 45 minutes in the salt cave come out and surprise there's no massage therapist here and it's not scheduled. \n\nTook off work and everything.  Happy mothers day to me.  Yay.
