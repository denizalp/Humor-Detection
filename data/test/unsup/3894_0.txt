What a little gem! I found this place through a yelp review for another sushi joint (that had a poor review & the person said vips was the best in North york) & went with a friend Monday evening. \n\nTwo teeny tables but we snagged one and had the loveliest waitress, service was impeccable & food is sooo delicious!\n\nWe had three rolls, one thing is reviews are accurate when they say they are HUGE! Fresh fish & delicious spicy mayo. \n\nWent back today for a lunch take-out, was once again NOT disappointed.\n\nIt's a must try for sure!
