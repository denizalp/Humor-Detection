i have had quite a few brazilian waxes in my time - every month for the last 8 years. and dorothy is the quickest, almost painless waxer i've ever experienced- HANDS DOWN!\n\nwhen she told me that it'll only take 5 min...i thought\n \"hmph...yeah, fracking right\"\n\nbut seriously it didn't take much longer than that. she's been doing this for 20 years and she's super nice!\n\n+ the wax was $26! that's the cheapest i paid for. so to recap:\n\n*super inexpensive\n*super quick\n*least amount of pain =\nwinner!!\n\ni'm definitely coming to dorothy every time i'm in montreal!!
