There has been nothing that I can say has not been delish so far. The beef ribs are huge and amazing, but no one can live without the soy garlic wings.\n\nThe only reason for 4 stars is that it takes a long time to get drinks and service at the bar. However, this is purely because it is busy and it is hard to staff a lot of people behind the amount of space they have to work with.
