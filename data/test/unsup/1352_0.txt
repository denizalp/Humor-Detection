Excellent neighborhood joint for hot or cold sandwiches.  \n\nI go here for the fried chicken sandwich.  Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside breaded fried chicken with creamy guacamole and chipotle aioli.  This baby is perfect for lunch and a good late afternoon 'snack.'  Warning:  this item sold out often.\n\nZero ambiance, but who needs it when they have a rad jukebox playing classic, old school tunes.\n\nStaff is always friendly and super nice!
