This is probably the sorriest excuse for a new gray bar on the boulevard. It's been open for just over a month now and there's no customers inside I don't 12:17 AM on a Friday night. I don't know when people will learn that lesbian bars just don't work - even if they're all inclusive. What's even more sad is either the Bartender or the owner is standing outside begging people to come in. Just open a slam bar here, and get a full bar. It's really sad.
