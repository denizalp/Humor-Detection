One of my favorite end of bike ride stops. (BTW its happy hour at all times if you arrive via bike) The owner\/operator is connected with cycling in some way. Note the art work composed of bike parts, jerseys etc. You can literally ride in to the out door section where the bike rack is inside the enclosure. \n\nFood here is upscale bar food. The deviled eggs with bacon and truffle oil are great!! Great beer selection. Super friendly service. This place has a local central corridor following and is often crowded.\n\nDo go here and ride your bike!!
