I got to try this food truck at the Food Truck Fest at Costco.  Woody, the owner, is extremely enthusiastic about his business and it's contagious!  I tried the siomai (shumai dumplings) and the chicken bbq.  Both were excellent.  The siomai comes with a nice sauce that isn't too spicy.  He has sriracha if you need more spice. The chicken bbq, cooked on a kabob, is nice, juicy, and flavorful.\n\nThe truck is spray painted instead of the normal wrap, which is a nice, unique touch.\n\nI can't wait to track down BBQ boy down so I can try more.
