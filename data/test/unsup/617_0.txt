Not too shabby for an airport! They are generally quick with baggage which is a big bonus for me as I usually don't get in until ten pm and want to party ASAP. Workers are pretty nice and helpful. I once lost my boarding pass and they were able to print out another one for me. Oh and if you're in the mood to gamble upon arrival, there are slot machines right as you step off the plane.
