I needed a RV wheel bearings grease repack and brake inspection and found this local businessman with excellent Google reviews.  His price was very reasonable and he used all new parts that are \"consumables\" such as cotter pins and seals.  I liked that he used a torque wrench on the lug nuts instead of using an air chuck and the entire procedure was done carefully and completely.  He also measured the brake pads and drums for wear, and checked proper emergency brake operation.  I will be a repeat customer for sure.
