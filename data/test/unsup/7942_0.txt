Aside from the food poisoning and resultant vomiting and days of stomach upset that ruined my entire last 2 days in Vegas, this place is the bees knees!\n\nBut bees don't have knees and I don't have a positive review in me for this place. 1 star for service, though. -2 stars for the awful DJ and exceptionally loud music. -countless stars for the fact that I'm still barely able to keep food down a week later. \n\nAlso, the red velvet milkshake was terrible. The worst.
