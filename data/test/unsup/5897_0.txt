We just bought our house and had a few broken pieces on our wood shutters. Our handyman said that we have to replace the whole shutter. Then my wife called Ricardo and he fixed the broken pieces and noticed that there were a few more that were cracked so he came back and replaced those for free as well we are very pleased with his service
