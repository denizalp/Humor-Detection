Good atmosphere, good snacks, great drinks! \n\nBartender was on point, and made some really tasty cocktails and had great wine recommendations. \n\nCharcuterie was good. Ordered empenadas, but were out of them; we replaced with the croquettes, and manager came over to apologize for the confusion and comped the replacement croquettes. \n\nRelaxed atmosphere, good music, unique food selection - would go back!
