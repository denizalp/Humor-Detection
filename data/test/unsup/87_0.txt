I first got turned on to FHS when we had lunch catered here at work and fell in love right away.  I was a fan of Subway for a long time, like most people, but these FHS are much more tastier, it has to be the meat.  I haven't ate at Subway in 4 yrs now, nothing against them though, FHS are to die for.
