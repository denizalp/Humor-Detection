Recently got my nails done by Kimmy! Let me say, she's wonderful. I told her I wanted French tip gel. And they turn out beautiful. Perfect shape I ask for :) next time I'm definitely getting a full treatment because she takes her time and its worth my money. Even if I gotta drive about 40mins. Reasonable price, especially in Scottsdale\n\nP.s. the shop is well maintain and it's very open! I believe she remodeled the whole place. Looks great though!
