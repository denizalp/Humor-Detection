I've been here several times since my initial visit.\n\nThe food has stayed decidedly mediocre. If you've got a craving for fry bread this place will fill the need. The variety of toppings is good if uninspired. \n\nI haven't had a \"bad\" meal here, but nothing brings this place to mind unless I'm already craving fry bread.
