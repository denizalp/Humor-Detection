You've got a friend in VOLOS. \n\nThe huge interior is white, airy and sweeps your mind away to Greece. This sort of pleasant atmosphere lends itself to tranquility, shared plates, and drinks with lunch... and there ain't nothing wrong with that. \n\nI have never had Greek wine before, so when the server recommended a glass of Greek sparkling ros√© I was hesitant, but quickly won over. What a crisp glass of bubbly! Beyond the wine, favourites include: flaming cheese, the unmatched-in-freshness Greek salad and the octopus. \n\nOpa!
