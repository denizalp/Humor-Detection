While I was waiting for my hitch install,I observed EVERY customer who returned a vehicle did so without issue.For about 30 minutes,there were about 8 customers dropping their keys off. IF I ever need a vehicle to move something larger than what our vehicles can handle,I would visit this U-Haul location to do so.Nice job on the hitch installation that required a little customization.
