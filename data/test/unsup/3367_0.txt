I've been a member for a month now, and I guess I'm able to get my workout done. I do find myself annoyed how cramped it can get by the weights. Like most of the reviews mentioned some of the equipment is older, but it suffices. I worked out at the LA Fitness on 3rd\/Bell and it was AMAZING! It was so clean, nice, and new--tv's on EVERY cardio machine. When I came back to this location I felt BLAH.
