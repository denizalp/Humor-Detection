This place is a disaster. I have never seen more indifferent service. I watched two women who came in after me get fed up and leave. Then, after it took 20 minutes to get a beer and I was listening to my server tell everyone at all the other tables how lucky they were to be leaving now because the kitchen is way understaffed, I got up and left also. Do NOT go to this place if you expect to be served food. There's about a 1 in 5 chance of that happening.
