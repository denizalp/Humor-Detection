great place if you are a student, not great if you are not. \n\nThe fries were HORRIBLE!  I think I ate two fries and left the rest for my friends to eat. They were all very worried about why I wasn't eating them (I friggin' love fries) I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong with them but I knew they just tasted funny. One friend concurred but others managed to enjoy them.
