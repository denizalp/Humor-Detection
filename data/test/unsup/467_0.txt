I've seen a lot of magic shows, this one seemed extremely amateurish. What a huge disappointment after being a big fan of Mindfreak. Most of the performance on stage you could see cables suspending him. Other tricks you can tell we're staged or just corny. It really lack the professionalism and illusions that was portrayed on Mindfreak. Truly disappointed!
