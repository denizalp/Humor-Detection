Cab was late.\nThe cab smelled like horrible body odor, cigarettes, and food.\nDisgusting.\nI could smell the cab drivers armpits from the back seat. \nMy total came out to $15 and leaving the car the driver told me it was $20.\nI asked \"why\" because the meter clearly said $15.\nHe said because when you call for a taxi it's an additional $5.....when i got into the car, the meter started at $4.50 I believe. Wtf? \nHe basically charged $9.50 just for me to get in the car. \nWorst.\nGet an uber, save yourself money and time.
