DO NOT go to these people.  According to \"THE DOCTOR\" which is not a doctor, she is a \"Cosmetic injector\", when told the product didnt work she got very upset yelling and degrading me for calling the manufacturer of the product to inquire if they stand behind the product.   Product being Revenese.  I spent approx $1500 to get zero results.   They should be shut down in my opinion.    They don't return calls unless threatened.  A disgrace of a facility with zero ethics.
