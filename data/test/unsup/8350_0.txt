I love this place!  Food and atmosphere is great...especially when it's cooler outside and you can eat on the patio.  I love that they serve healthy, organic food.  Their lunch specials are very reasonable, but dinner can quickly get costly.  The downside is the service can be slow and sometimes it feels like they are understaffed. However, even with the shortcomings the quality and taste of food is great.
