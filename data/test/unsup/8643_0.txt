Maryanna taught my husband and I choreography for our first dance at our wedding. It fit the song perfectly, and practicing every night was a great way to de-stress from wedding planning. We went to some of the group dance lessons as well and everyone was always welcoming, kind, and quick to teach. Highly recommend to anyone looking to have some fun and learn to dance :)
