Come for: good service\nSkip: the food\n\nThe sauces and broth were bad but the noodles were good. Portions are extremely small. Don't be fooled by the size of the bowl, the amount of noodles inside barely covers the bottom and that's for an average of $17\/bowl. You can also skip the shu mai even with gold on top, it tasted so bad. Service was nice but I wouldn't come back for sub sub par food.
