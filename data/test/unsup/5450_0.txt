I started bringing my daughter here after purchasing a Groupon.  This studio was the closest to us, and I am so glad we gave them a shot - we've now been here for a year and a half!    They are all wonderful with kids and play to their individual strengths and weaknesses.  My daughter loves the entire team!   Would absolutely recommend to everyone.  :)
