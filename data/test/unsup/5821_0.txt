Pretty good ice cream. I mean it's definitely over hyped and I wouldn't go out of my way. I felt like the cone tasted like bread which I did not expect. \n\nThe size Is big and most cones are $8+  and they have a good selection of variety. The wait isn't that long either. \n\nI got the blueberry white chocolate cheesecake. I liked the toppings.\n\nWe found that ours melted very fast when we were indoors. So we had to finish eating before it got messy.
