AWESOME prices on food and they brew their own beer!! Usually an older crowd (from my experience, anyway). They have a pretty big menu and a different special every day (call to find out what it is and GET THERE EARLY - they run out of it!). If you're a craft beer junkie, it's a reasonable place to have something other than a Bud Light.
