very disappointed with the new staff at sands . I was a  long time customer until recent I took my mom in to buy a car . she was promised all kinds of incentives . didn't receive anything I was told I would get a referral check . I didn't get anything . it's been 3 months now and nothing except lies . be careful with this place now
