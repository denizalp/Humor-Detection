1.5 star\n\nExpectation was set pretty low even when I stepped inside Tin Tin. \n\nOne good thing about the Wonton Noodle Soup ($4.50) I ordered, portion size is huge. \n\nBut the wontons though big and the shrimp is the bigger ones with a good bouncy bite.... but there is ton of uncleaned intestine.. \n\nI was thirsty and this dry mouth feel afterwards. A little heavy in MSG. \n\nBut Tin Tin might be perfect match for the area as it is right across York U. I still remember my University days that I was on a tight budget and always hungry!
