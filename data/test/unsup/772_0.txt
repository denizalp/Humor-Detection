This is the best Starbucks ever and it's all because of the employees. The night shift employees are amazing! Super sweet, friendly, and go out of their way to make your drink, and your day. I always leave here laughing and in a better mood then when I came. ( call them my new best friends) and not because they make my iced caramel to perfection;) also very clean and fast, nice airport location with tables. Thanks guys, see you in a few hours!!
