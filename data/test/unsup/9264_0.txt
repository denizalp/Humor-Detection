My wife went here today with our daughter and her friend.  The girls are 8 years old.  Beforehand, my wife called and confirmed the price for the girls.  Then, after the manicures concluded, this salon charged twice the amount of the over-the-phone quote and then flatly refused to honor that quote.  Instead of making a scene in front of  the girls (who are having a great day otherwise), my wife decided not to return to this salon again.  Also, Lisa was \"extremely rude\" when confronted with the bait and switch pricing.
