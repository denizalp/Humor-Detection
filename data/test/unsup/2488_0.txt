Though chain restaurants are not much of my thing, I like this one because of the friendly service, the well-stocked bar and the wide beer selection from which you can order flights, and good food (tip: if you can't decide what to order and you like pizza, get the BJ's favorite!) served in generous portions. For sports buffs, the big screens are a big draw as well. The restaurant is one of the establishments on the periphery of the Chandler Mall, so location is convenient and parking is never a problem.
