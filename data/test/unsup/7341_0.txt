Maybe its just me...I've never had buffalo wings that have ever blown me away.  Most of them are done the same way everywhere.  I honestly can't tell that much of a difference between this place and any Buffalo Wild Wings although the wing meat at Mac's was pretty dry and some of the drumettes barely had any meat on them.  Definitely a one and done place for me.  Not worth the trek from SW Vegas for.
