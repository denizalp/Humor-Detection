Great tasting pasta and pizza! Had linguini with meatballs and Deluxe Pizza. The meatballs were very soft and the sauce had good flavour. The pizza was a little soggy. We actually ordered it as a panzerotti, but the waitress messed up our order... I was mildly disappointed but didn't want to waste the pizza that they already made, so we didn't send it back. I still want to try their panzerotti though... so I'll be coming back!
