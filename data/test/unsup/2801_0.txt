Definitely get your money's worth here. I got the Haddock and chips and it was massive, and the Halibut is pretty good-sized portions as well.\nGood fries (a little greasy but...I'm not looking for health here!) and great gravy. I'm getting hungry just writing this. \nPlaza has plenty of parking and my order didn't take too long (I got take-out). Pretty sure they took debit, which is always a bonus.
