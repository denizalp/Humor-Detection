This is one of my go-to spots for out of towners. Its a bar meets arcade meets lounge. Pretty awesome concept. With old school games such as Ms PAC Man and Galactia you can find something that will release your inner 12 year old. With dance music blaring and a neon bar it touches all your senses. The bartenders can be pretty moody at times but with the amount of people in the place you don't really notice. On the weekends your looking at a pretty long line and long waits for drinks, but its totally work checking out.
