This place is over the top awesome! They hit a home run from friendly and quick service, clean and new decor, and incredible food and portion size. For $10.99 I ordered the chicken and beef shawarma- it's served with Greek salad, basmati rice and hummus with pita bread. This could easily feed 2 people or be great for left overs!! To make it even better, they unexpectedly delivered a piece of baklava for dessert at no charge. Go check them out!!
