Love this place!! Whenever we are in the area, we always stop by. The tandoori chicken wrap is to die for!!! I hear lots of other stuff are good there, but since we don't live close by, we stick to what we know is good. It is not necessarily fast food (as in the service) but the food is made with love and it shows!
