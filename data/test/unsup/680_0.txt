Vegas is terrible. This airport is not so terrible, so that's a win at least.\n\nIt's fairly clean, and in case you're desperate to gamble at the slots before your plane, they have machines dotted across the terminals. \n\nThe biggest negatives are....\n- Extremely long lines for checking bags on weekends\n- Very average and expensive food\n- Delays have been common in my experience\n\nThis is a pretty common hub for flights out of places like New Mexico, and not the worst place to kill an hour.
