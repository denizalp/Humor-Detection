Let me start by saying if Joe Rogan needs to do another fear factor show he should look no farther than this joint.  I think i ate the same pancakes as Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr did back in 1952 and im not joking.  I dont think i could feed this trash to the wolves.  The price is pretty cheap but a stomach pump is not.\nJust my two cents.
