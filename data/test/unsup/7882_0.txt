This is my football destination on Sunday's. Awesome Bloody Mary bar and drink specials daily. Great bar food that adds brunch items for the weekend and daily specials that are awesome. Hands down the best and hottest staff in Charlotte. A must for any sports fan. Multiple bars and plenty of outside seating as well.
