I am a HUGE fan of Pollo and will continue to go there, food is fantabulous, but this location needs to get it together! The last 3 times I've gone my orders have been wrong. SUPER annoying.\n\n1. no chips when I ordered chips and guac\n2. ordered shrimp tacos and got chicken\n3. no broccoli in my bowl when that's literally the staple\n\nLol. What the frank?! Anyways... word to the wise, check your orders!!!
