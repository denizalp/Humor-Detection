I wish we had a Trader Joes in Hawaii!! But unfortunately for me they don't and that is why \"I Love This Place\". \n\nReasons:\nEasy to find.\nGreat quality products at great prices(Cheaper then Hawaii)\nClean and well stocked store.\nFriendly staff.\n\nMahalo! Trader Joes for cutting down my list of things to bring back for friends!
