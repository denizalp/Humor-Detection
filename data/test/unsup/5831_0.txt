We got gift certificates as wedding presents. The location was beautiful, the food was pretty good without anything being particularly memorable, the hosts were great. Wine was flowing all evening, and the fee is all inclusive, even gratuity. The experience is similar to going to a wedding where you don't know anyone. You're supposed to socialize with strangers, it's not a romantic date night alone with your SO. We got lucky and enjoyed the company of the couples close to us, but 2.5 hours sitting and doing small talk can be a bit... exhausting.
