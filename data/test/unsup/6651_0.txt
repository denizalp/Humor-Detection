I had the softshell blue crab with the chicken noodle soup. The food was pretty good..I was surprisingly filled at the end of it and you better believe I ate every last bite of that blue crab haha. The bread tray was good and they gave us a complimentary amuse-bouche from the chef.  They even gave us an extra 15% or maybe 20% off card when we first sat down. The pinot grigio was also a good topper :)
