Needed to fuel up for the last push in to Mesquite. Looking for something close to the strip and just happened in here. Less than a quarter mile from the freeway. Easy in and easy out.\n\nMany pumps so mo issue waiting in line. They have a convenience store that has everything from snacks and drinks to light meds. Good stop glad I found it.
