My lease was up and needed help moving out kind of last minute. I found Dignity Moving on Facebook so I called them. I spoke to Daniel who gave me a reasonable price, and was flexible with the date. They were there on-time and moved quick and efficient! Really impressive men!! They stuck true to the price; I paid cash since they have a 5% processing fee for card transactions. Would definitely recommend!!
