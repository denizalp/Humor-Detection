Definitely check this place out. Great vibe, great owners, GREAT FOOD! Everything is made in house. The hummus and pita bread was great, schwarma was very tasty, and a huge selection of alcoholic beverages. Great for lunch or for a lounge atmosphere with a few late night comrades. \n\nThank you guys! Keep it up. Can't wait to see what the future holds. \nZak
