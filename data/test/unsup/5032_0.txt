My yoga class meets in this really nice venue, which is  located in the middle of a large but quiet commercial complex and is easily accessible with Mill Avenue and Baseline and the main cross streets. The main studio is spacious and well-equipped with spare mats, blocks, and belts. The large space and high ceiling somehow makes for a sense of relaxation not easily obtained in smaller cramped spaces.
