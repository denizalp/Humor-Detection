This is seriously the best Ice cream I've ever had. We were looking for ice cream and typed it in to our maps and this place popped up. I got the Cookie Monster waffle sandwich (YUMMM) and my boyfriend got the chocolate ice cream waffle sandwich (ALSO YUM). Our apartment is only a few minutes away and we had completely finished our ice creams before we got home.   This is a MUST TRY in Phx!! I highly recommend it!
