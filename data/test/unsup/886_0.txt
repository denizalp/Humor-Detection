literally just ordered from this place via postmates. terrible experience and will never order from them again. they care very little about the costumers. i order french toast and they give me no syrup, theyre whole store is about pancakes and waffles and french toast...why dont you have syrup?!? the food is terrible and made with no effort. Couldnt eat the rest if my food, throwing away now.
