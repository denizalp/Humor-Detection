Great spot to get breakfast! Only $4.79 for two eggs however you want, bacon\/sausage, breakfast potatoes & tortillas (soft or corn)! It was a great deal and really good food. 99 Cents!! For Bloody Mary or mimosa. Can upgrade to a pint for only $2. The staff was great and didn't take long for the food at all. A very cool spot, like old Vegas, to get good food & good service for a good price.
