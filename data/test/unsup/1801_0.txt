Bartender was to arrogant for me. Whenever someone spoke of knowing about the place he had to continue overstating that they don't advertise. We get it, the place is like everything else in Ohio city\/ tremont. Best thing I tried on the menu was the scorpion punch ball. The pineapple daiquiri tasted nothing like a daiquiri, just strong liquor and simple syrup.
