I came here for a Christmas celebration called Festival of Lights. \n\nThe Festival of Lights was great. Very enjoyable. There were vignettes with choir singing in between telling the story of Mary & the birth of baby Jesus. \n\nThe lasts about an hour. Then the sermon came & told me I was a sinner and I would never measure up to Jesus. \n\n I had to leave the premise because this was not my cup of tea. Others must think it's theirs though because they have 2 huge parking lots. \n\nUp to you. You choose & decide.
