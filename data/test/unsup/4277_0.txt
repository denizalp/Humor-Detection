If I could only go negative stars. \n\nI went here based off these very reviews and they may have had an off night but man I felt it immediately. Most everyone in my party had upset stomach causing everyone to rush home. \n\nThe food was sub par and most of all the customer service was terrible and argumentative. Which is odd for a party that walks in with 9 people. You'd figure with that many people running up a decent sized tab, they'd be more attentive but no. \n\nThis place is on my no go list.
