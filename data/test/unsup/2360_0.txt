Service was slow.  Ordered an appetizer, found out it wasn't available 15 minutes later.  Burger was way over done and had no fixings.  Just cheese, jalapenos, and very little aioli sauce.  Salad was fine.  Took me about 40 minutes to get my meal at 12:40pm, not exactly what I expected out of an office \"themed\" pub.  \n\nDefinitely wouldn't recommend to anyone.
