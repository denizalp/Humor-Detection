This place is quite overrated.  The food was rather bland, and I was wanting ketchup and hotsauce.  The coffee was pretty bad too.  If you are wanting a lot of food along the lines of an average diner or Denny's, then you might like this place.  Service was good.  For me, it was definitely not work the effort of traveling into the Strip.
