I love this place! I spent a few hours working here and met the owner. He shared with me their coffee making process. Here's a though: coffee is pretty much 98% water. Water itself is a key ingredient in coffee. They have a machine that's equally as impressive as their espresso machine that produces high quality water for their coffee.  Overall, super friendly staff, adorable interior, and fantastic coffee.
