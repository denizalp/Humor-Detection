\"Hey Stella!\"  \n\n\"Hey Stella!\"  \n\n\"Don't you ever leave me baby.\"\n\nI had to get the Tennessee Williams\/Marlon Brando quote out of the air there before I could move on with the review.\n\nI tried Stella's with my daughter last weekend and it was good.  I'll definitely be keeping them in mind when I'm in the vicinity.\n\nSolid coffee, good lookin' pastries, friendly service, nice atmosphere. \n\nA winner.  Or should I say \"winnah\" since the owner I met, Don, moved here from the Boston area like I did.  Chowdahheads can spot each other easily.
