Super dope spot. I went last weekend (1\/28) and we enjoyed the live music they had and the drinks. I love the craftsmanship they use for their drinks. The use of fire, the sphere ice cubes, etc. for someone who enjoys the \"the extras\" and creativity I'm not easily impressed but this place impressed me. We will definitely be back to enjoy again and we're looking forward to the rooftop once it's warmer.
