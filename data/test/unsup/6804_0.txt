Wow. This place was amazing. My girlfriend and I been wanting to try Ruth's Chris and we finally gave in. We got Filet Mignon (medium rare and cooked perfectly, 8oz), Lobster Mac and Cheese, and Brussel sprouts. Everything was absolutely delicious! It was well worth the couple hundred dollar bill (wine to drink). The server was really nice and checked on us occasionally. A photographer came by and took a couple photos of us that we bought after dinner. I will definitely be coming back here every time I am in vegas!
