Man was so rude to me,  cut me off on every sentence and said I \"wasn't smart\"  for asking if there are different heel tips,  he spoke while I was speaking and said he knew what I was going to ask,  but when I asked what he thought I was going to say..  He was wrong..  \nHe was very distasteful,  very rude,  I would never go back to him for him to try insult a customer for inquiring.  \n\nI would NEVER recommend anyone here.
