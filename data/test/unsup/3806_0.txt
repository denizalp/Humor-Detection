This practice is heartless... I spent 3 weeks in ICU almost didn't make it and I owe them money ... They had no desire to work with me on payments ... The hospital gave me a 84% discount after research on my income... Middle class people seem to always get the bad end of then stick ... Some people should really not be in the medical field.... My lung is scared for life and they don't care and send my account to collections ...
