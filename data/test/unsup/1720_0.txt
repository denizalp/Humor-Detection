This place is incredible.\n\nFirst, you should know that the place doesn't have typical table service. You order at the counter, but they will take it to your seat. The server\/cashier that was working was incredibly helpful.\n\nThe food was excellent. Everything we had was very flavorful. For those who fear that Latin cuisine is too spicy, know that everything we had was well seasoned, but not spicy.\n\nFor dessert, I recommend the rice pudding.\n\nIf we're ever in town again, we will definitely stop by.
