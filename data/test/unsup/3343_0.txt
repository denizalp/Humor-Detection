Great view of the fountain. Delicious food, the braised short rib was super tender and the accompanying green beans were perfectly crisp. The lamb chops were a bit fatty and unctuous, but still delicious. The lamb ravioli was tasty but not a huge portion. The big OMG was the beef carpaccio - the table favourite for sure. The charcuterie board and the beet & pear salad were nothing special. No room for dessert unfortunately. Would return.
