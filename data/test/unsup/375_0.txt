Friendly service but the food was just meh. Had the two meat plate with Barbeque beans and Mac & Cheese. Had the pulled pork and beef brisket. Pulled pork was OK but was flavorless. The sauces didn't really help as they all tasted too vinegary and watery. Beef Brisket was probably 40% fat which turned me off. The Barbeque Beans though. Whew! I could eat those all day everyday. Fresh Lemonade was amazing and they did give me A-1 service with a smile.
