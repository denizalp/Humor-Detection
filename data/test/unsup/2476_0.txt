I go to breakfast here around 2 days a week. Great & friendly staff. If you're going before work sit at the bar and the food comes out very quick. There's free wifi so bring your idevices. \n\nFood is good. I don't venture out beyond eggs and bacon much but the couple times I've ordered waffles or pancakes they've been good.
