On my way to vegas, I was craving poke and decided to look on yelp where to go. I stumbled upon this location and thank god I did. This was one of the best poke places I've been to. They gave such a friendly serving with a great fresh fish. They staff was really helpful and very friendly. I'm really sad this location is in vegas because I would love to be a regular here!!!!!!!!
