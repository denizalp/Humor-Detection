Lunchtime playlist at Angelo's:\n\nAll Night Long -- Lionel Richie\nYou Spin My Head Right Round -- Flo Rida\nPower of Love -- Huey Lewis and the News\nCome To Me -- France Joli\nHurts So Good -- John Mellencamp\nLonely No More -- Rob Thomas\nRich Girl -- Gwen Stefani\nShe Blinded Me With Science -- Thomas Dolby\n\nIf I were to name this as a Pandora station, it would be \"Obsessive Love.\" Not bad when paired with pizza.
