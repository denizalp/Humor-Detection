We love Terrace cafe! It's delicious for brunch and really good service. My husband typically gets the chicken and waffles, and I normally get something off their daily specials menu. We always have a very nice server and the food comes out pretty quickly. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it seems a bit overpriced for what it is and the portions are less than generous. Other than that, it's delicious!
