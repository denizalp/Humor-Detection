This location is very disappointing to me. I ordered a pizza and hot wings for delivery. The delivery was on time but the pizza was disgusting and uncooked. The cheese wasn't even melted. It grossed me out . The money I paid was not worth the $30.  I would rather the delivery be a little late than have uncooked pizza. They lost a customer
