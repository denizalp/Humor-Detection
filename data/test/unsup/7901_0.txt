I have only been seen here three times and Dr Caleb Lauber is the best Dr I have ever seen he pays attention to detail and goes over everything there is no time restriction he answers all your questions and is genuinely concerned about you as a person as well as a patient. the only down fall is his assistant she is rough around the edges not an inviting spirit, she doesn't make you feel comfortable and she is not friendly, other than that a perfect setting everything a patient could ask for.
