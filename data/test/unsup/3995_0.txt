I needed a suit jacket altered for my sister's wedding and was under a tight timeline. I made the right choice by going to see Van. She is clearly very knowledgeable about current men's styles and put me at ease regarding the suggested alterations. The end result looked even better than I had imagined. I will definitely be returning in the future.
