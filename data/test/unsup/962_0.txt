I am giving a 1 Star because the Margarita was good. \n\nThe food was not good at all, lacking in flavor. I had the shrimp tacos, the other 2 people in my party ordered the mahi mahi dish and the salmon dish. \n\nThe salmon was actually good, but the mahi dish and taco dish needed help. \n\nI won't be going back and would not recommend this restaurant if in Vegas.
