UHM OH MY GAHD.\n\nBEST. HAMBURGER. MELT. I. HAVE. EVER. TASTED. IN. MY. LIFE!!!\n\nIt was sooooo fackin' good! It's a toasted with a Parmesan bun, with melted cheese, caramelized onions, and Thousand Island dressing. I want some now too. OOH! So good.\n\nI asked the waiter to have them make it well done..a couple of bites in, I notice that it was still PRETTY pink inside. I let him know, and he gave me a brand new one....MORE FOR ME :D \n\nTheir ranch was also perfection. Very nice staff..good delicious food..I MUST come back for more!
