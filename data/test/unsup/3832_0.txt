Great place to shop. Never a wait for checkout unless it's the weekend before a major holiday. Love to be helped by the endless amount of employees that offer. The little old man in the produce section always hooks me up with the freshest produce from the back when I need itZ \n\n\n I would give this store a 6 star rating if it was an option. Shop here!!! :-)
