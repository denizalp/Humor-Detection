Have eaten here several times. Service is good and food amounts and quality are excellent for the price.  Try one of the combination meals for a surprising treat. Only draw back to dining here is the lack of readable marked handicap parking so to access ramps are often blocked. They also have good lunch time specials. Happy dining.
