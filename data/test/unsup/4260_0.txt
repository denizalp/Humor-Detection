My hubby is Cuban and very picky about his food. This place is legit delicious and portions are perfect. So far everything we have eaten is well seasoned and cooked. Can't beat the price $5 for a meal. Some food is cold others are made to order.  Very welcoming environment. Would c9nti us to dine here!
