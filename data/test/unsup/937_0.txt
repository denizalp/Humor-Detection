If you come here, I'm telling you just get any pho combo and you won't be disappointed. The soup base is SO rich in flavor!! It'll definitely make you come back for some more! The summer rolls are also a must get! They make it fresh on the spot. My husband got the grilled pork vermicelli and it was also as amazing!! It comes with a grilled shrimp which you don't get in N.Y.
