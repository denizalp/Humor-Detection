So this is a tiny native, same species and decent happy hour. Service is hit or miss, bartenders pour very tiny shots, so you are better off with the beer. Wings are very good, and they have a lot of flavors, love the chili lime  and regular hot. Thumbs up for potato skins, thumbs down on the mozzarella sticks and zucchini. Overall a decent spot.
