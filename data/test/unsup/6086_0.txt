Nice little shop with friendly employees.  Stopped in for a piece.  The crust is sour dough and when baked gets very crisp and thick.  Fresh and tasty toppings.  You can build your own or choose from a couple of well crafted styles of red or white.  There are a few beers and wines available.  And some Leona's ice cream sandwich for a sweet finish.
