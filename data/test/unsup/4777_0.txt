I have had very good experiences with both Dr. McRae and \nPhysician's Assistant, Corey Seguine.  They ensure that medications are refilled on time, they discuss different options on medications and do not try to force your to take medication you do not need.  Corey is very easy to talk to and listens to our concerns.  Highly recommend seeing Corey anytime you have an issue.  Both the family and urgent care are best in Gilbert.
