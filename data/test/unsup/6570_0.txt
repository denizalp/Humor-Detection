All-You-Can-Eat Sushi?  \n\nMore like All-you-can-bare-to-wait-for-because-the-service-was-so-damn-slow sushi!\n\nI swear we only got like $10 worth of sushi in the hour and a half we were there!\n\nWe were able to watch Dances With Wolves and listen to November Rain in between each order we got!\n\nBoo on them!\n\np.s. - Was this really my 200th review?  Damn.  What a waste of a milestone.
