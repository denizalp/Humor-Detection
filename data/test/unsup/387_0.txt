Came to Cleveland from Vegas to visit family and wanted to go to a new hot spot. In Vegas, celebrity chef restaurants usually aren't that good, but decided to give this place a try because the reviews were favorable. I had the half rack of ribs and the kielbasa... I cleaned the entire plate. Not since Giada's opened at the Cromwell have I left a restaurant completely satisfied. I was also impressed with the kielbasa because as a Clevelander of Slovak heritage, I judge kielbasa on a very harsh curve.
