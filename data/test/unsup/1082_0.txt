As of Aug 2017, resort fees included access to their AMAZING spa facilities and NO PARKING.  Main pool closes earlier than spa pool, but main jacuzzi remains open late into the evening.  super relaxing pool area, rooms feel like you're in Santa Barbara, but casino does have a lingering smoke smell.  easy access to outdoor District shops & restaurants.  will be returning!
