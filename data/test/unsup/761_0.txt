This casino is nice but you must beg to get a comped room. I think they concentrate more on their promotions then the gambler. If your a local and a loyal gambler they don't really seem to care. Most people that work there are pleasant but just go threw the motions. No one seems to ask any update questions ever. Example New email phone number so forth. Just wanted to give the real gambler this is not your casino. This is more like a resort with gambling included.
