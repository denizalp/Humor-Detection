What's up with the name White Squirrel?  \nI don't know, but my girlfriend spotted a little brown mouse there yesterday.  \nMaybe they should re-name it the \"Brown Mouse\".\n\nAnyways....good coffee, wonderful ice cream sandwiches, rodent friendly environment.\n\nIf you take away the mouse, I think I could really enjoy this cozy little cafe.
