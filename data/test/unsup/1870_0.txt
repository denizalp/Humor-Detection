Was heading back from the gym,and decided to stop by..who doesn't like beef jerky?I met Catelyn,who remembered me from a visit a long time ago.Also helping was Leydis..who had me try multiple samples,while finding out what I liked.I bought 3 bags.This is a local,and family run business.I support locals..and these are nice people too.Great product..I will be back.
