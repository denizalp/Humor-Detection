In town from Florida and stopped by for lunch on a recommendation from a friend.  I had the pretzel bites for a appetizer and BBQ burger both dishes excellent! The manager Nick Cromer came by my table and it turns out he is from Florida too, what a nice young man, very knowledgeable on the area and sports. I am bringing my family back up right after Christmas and will be sure to stop back.
