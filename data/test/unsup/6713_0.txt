The food was very good.   Our waiter was slow though.   A big hit for travelers is that they don't want to split checks.   However the manager was very helpful in getting it resolved.   She turned what was an unfortunate owner policy ( of course the computers can split the checks) into a good ending.  I would visit again if I knew separate checks would not be a problem
