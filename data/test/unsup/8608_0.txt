We used to take our year old Havanese to a differ groomer, and his cuts would always look so choppy. We took him to Bev, and he came back looking like an Instagram dog! We were very impressed. His fur is fluffy and soft and expertly cut into (bear) shape. Bev and her staff are caring and thoughtful, and we won't go anywhere else now!
