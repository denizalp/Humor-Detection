What a disappointment!\n\nI came here after work, excited to try this place that I've been hearing about. \n\nMy hubby ordered me the combo platter which is chicken and beef. The meat didn't have any flavor at all. Half of the dish was lettuce and under the meat is rice. \n\nReally this just tastes like generic fast food.\n\nI am usually not too picky, but I couldn't even finish my food. THIS PLACE DID NOT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE!
