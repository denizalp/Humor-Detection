Using the monorail is pretty convenient especially on super hot days cuz on the trains, there is AC. It's very clean and many stations to go on the strip. If your stay is long, get the multi-pass tickets. The train comes every 9 minutes. The only bad side, it's in the back of the hotel so you still have a lot of walking to the strip within the hotel. If you only need to go once, it's not worth it if there is a lot of you. Its $5 a single ride. It's cheaper to take a taxis then.
