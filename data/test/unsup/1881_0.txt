The Soups draw me in, especially the Broccoli Cheese and Black Bean. They are amazing and come with a side (chips, apple, or bread), which I suggest ordering the side of bread. It is a nice piece of a baguette, perfect for dipping.\nUnfortunately this location is very limited in parking and during lunch seems to be overwhelming. Although good, be prepared to take a few extra minutes to park and wait in the LONG line, as thing seems to be a convenient hot stop, in Myers Park, for many area businesses.
