Excellent if you got a craving some something different. Staff is extremely friendly, portions are well worth their price.\n\nThe Combination Platter is an excellent starter cant go wrong with it, and any of kebob dishes are winners.\n\nThe only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the Samosa isn't exactly what i'm used to and sorry to say but a bit on the bland side.
