Called first to see if they still have the car we wanted.   They said there are (4) still available.  Drove 50 min to get there and they had none.   They just want to get you there so they'll try to sell you a different brand car . BAIT and SWITCH car lot. \nStay away from this place!!!   It's GHETTO !!!
