RECOMMENDED \n\nI'm obsessed!! They have an old fashioned refrigerator that is prosecco ON TAP! It was delicious. Also they had a sparkling ros√© on tap, it was dry and also very pink and perfect. \n\nWe sat outside in the shade and played cards for a long time. It was so absolutely relaxing. It started to fill up around 6. I absolutely love this little place! You can bring in your own food since they don't serve food.
