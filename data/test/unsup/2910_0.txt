You can't tell someone from Chicago that \"this is the best pizza you've ever had\". You just cannot. \"In town\", perhaps. I've had Angelo's three times now and I gotta say, it's not the best pizza in town. Don't get me wrong it's better than average, but it's not life-changing and I can't imagine craving it.\n\nThe crust is that great mix of chewy inside and crispy outside, the sauce is good but I keep hoping for less sweet and more spice, the topping options are numerous too (what's up with the banana peppers?) but yeah, it's not the best.
