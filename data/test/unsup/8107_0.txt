Affordable dim sum? Look no further. However only some of the regular staple of Chinese dim sum are up to my \"tasty\" standard. Tasty: ha gao (steam shrimp dumpling), siew  mai, fung jow (chicken feet), ngao yuk (beef ball) and cheung fun (rice roll). The rest are ok; better at other dim sum places. \n\nIf you don't want to wait for a table on the the weekend, come before 10am. After that it starts filling up!\n\nThe free homemade soy milk, is a nice touch. Always get myself a cup.
