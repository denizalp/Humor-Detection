My hubby and I had been searching LV for a good KBBQ place and were disappointed until we came here. This was our 5th time coming here and I'm sure we'll be back for more! Not only is their food excellent but their service is too! Big shout out to Ozzy who kept us happy the whole night through. Anyone who can keep my husband's glass full deserves high praise. Thanks Ozzy and Gen's for a fun night!
