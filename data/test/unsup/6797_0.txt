I recently had a few small problems that I took my car in for (hood sticking up for unexplained reasons, door stuck shut because it had been stuck open and I thought I could fix the problem using wood screws. Note to self: only use screws on the material for which they were named.)   Anyways, the guy didn't make fun of me too much and had my car fixed by the end if the day for not as much money as I thought. I would definitely take my car there again.
