Came to get a late night snack after walking around Las Vegas strip with a friend. The order was for 3 carne asada burritos and the #12 combo of 2 tamales.   They said the burritos were delicious and very well seasoned. My tamale combo was great! The red sauce that they poured over them had a very unique flavor.  I am not sure what they did differently, but I practicality licked the plate.  The next time I am in Vegas I will come back to eat here.
