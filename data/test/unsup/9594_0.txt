This place is so expensive for what you get. I could kick myself for going in here again! They put a ton of greens in your salad, then a tiny little portion of everything else! I asked for extra onions and she charged me a dollar for like 6 little tiny squares of chopped onion! When I brought it up to the girl she just laughed!  They have these little tiny scoopers that, after they shake it off, ends up being about a half teaspoon. This place is ridiculously skimpy and the workers are so rude!
