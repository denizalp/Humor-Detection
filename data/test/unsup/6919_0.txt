Mr. Lucky's is a great restaurant with great customer service, as well. We were immediately greeted when we walked in and although they were busy, got taken care of and seated quickly. Chef Felton was very friendly and courteous, as well. Overall, excellent location and place to grab a bite to eat after gambling at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino!!  Plus Chef Felton is a Chicago Bulls\/Chicago Cubs. My man!!!!!
