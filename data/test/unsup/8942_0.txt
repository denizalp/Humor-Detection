2.55 Stars\n\nHong Kong Bistro is one of those restaurants that is nearby and I thought I had already reviewed it.\n\nThey are a pretty basic Chinese restaurant with decor one step above the typical hole in the wall joint.\n\nExpect average quality and prices, no more, no less.\n\nThe people here are friendly.  I have nothing else to say about Hong Kong Bistro and you may consider that a reflection of my experience here as much as anything else.
