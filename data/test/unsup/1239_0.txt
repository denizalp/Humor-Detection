Loved this place in the Cosmopolitan Casino.  Cutesy Cow motif atmosphere with super friendly service. We sat in the lounge area and had \"lunch\"  First meal of the day but it was 1 pm.  Anyway I digress....  I had the Spring vegetable salad and cohort had the burger.  The salad was good: asparagus, peas, thin slices of red potato, etc.  \nHowever the piece de resistance was the Donutella shake.  It had me at Nutella frosted donut.  \nThe shake is pricey but you get a lot!! Plus there's alcohol in it.  Save room for one.... you won't regret it
