Horrible!  It's dark & cold.  I initially had red polish on.  When the technician removed it, she smeared it all over the sides of my fingers and didn't clean it up.  Then she proceeded to do my manicure and put nail polish beyond the nail, and didn't clean that up either.  When I left, it looked like a 3 year old did my nails.  I provided pictures, but they can't do justice to the horrible job that was done.  I gave at least 1 star because that's what was necessary in order to be able to post this review.
