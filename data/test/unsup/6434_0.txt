Deep S*** Pizza -  Fooled me twice, I feel shame! If you like your pie to be made on a thick piece of drywall, have so little cheese that the mozza looks translucent, pizza sauce like a bleached out crime scene - no evidence of red anywhere, and have toppings so sparse that it looks like confetti on a church floor from a wedding that occurred a week earlier, this is the place for you!
