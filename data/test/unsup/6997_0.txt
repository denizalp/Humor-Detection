Jonathan was awesome!  He truly hustles and ensures all my bases were covered.  I had strict requests and he always fulfilled my home search needs with a positive attitude and energy.  Always available and had great care for my family's needs as well.  He also works with top notch partners and I ended even going with his loan officer referral.  I would highly recommend him for you home purchase or selling needs.
