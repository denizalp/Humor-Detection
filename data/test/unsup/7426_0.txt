Made it out to spokes yesterday to catch up with friends. Such a cool place. The patio overlooks Spirit of yoga's pond which makes a nice view. Service here is awesome! The bartenders really know their brew and the appetizers are tasty. \nThe patio is dog friendly and I immediately had regrets for not bringing jasper. \nThe unique variety of beer on tap is exciting and there is a cool lounging area to watch the game. It's bike themed so all the small art detail is wicked cool. \nThanks for a great after spokes staff!
