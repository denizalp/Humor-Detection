Although I checked their website before making the reservation - there was no notation regarding attire, specifically that men were not allowed to wear sleeveless shirts. The hostess suggested that we buy a souvenir t-shirt - no thanks, the sleeveless shirt my husband had on was way nicer!! Please update your website so everyone is aware of this dress code.
