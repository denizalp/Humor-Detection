The wings were really good. I took my girlfriend out on a date here. We only met an hour ago. I used this dating website called Craigslist. She was really nice and I made her get just the salad cause I was cheap. Ok enough about myself, the food was absolutely amazing. I would recommend this place to anybody who is bringing a blind date. \n\n\nPS just kidding my 3 year relationship girlfriend would kill me if she found out that I posted this review lol
