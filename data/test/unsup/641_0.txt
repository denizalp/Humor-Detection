My girlfriend and I went here for date nite and it absolutely exceeded my Axe-pectations. The staff was friendly, funny, and very knowledgeable. Even if you have no experience throwing axe's they will make sure you feel like a pro by the end of your session. It is worth it to buy the smash boxes that have a guaranteed prize in each one. I would definitely recommend this to all my friends.
