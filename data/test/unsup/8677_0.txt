Pass on this place! Much better Thai in the area. My wife and I tried Thai Emerald since we were right there and were very disappointed. The chicken Pad Thai was awful. It was extremely bland, no flavor at all. The worst is that it smelled terrible. My daughter said it smelled like dog treats and that's pretty spot on. Not appealing at all. Two pad thai dishes for $30+ also...a tad procey for noodles. Sorry Thai Emerald, but you just lost a customer for good and I hope more stay away from your place. You've been warned people.
