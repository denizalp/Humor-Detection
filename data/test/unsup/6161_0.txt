-Nice selection of Vintage duds.\n\n-Some things seemed reasonable priced. Diverse selection of cool retro stuff. No FUNKY smells either.\n\n-Cool little old house (circa 1930's or 1940's???) that is now a store...totally fun to walk through.\n\n-Friendly service.\n\n-Parking is ok, but a concern to back out into the busy street. Park in the back, by entering an alley off one of the side streets.
