Cute hipster spot for sandwiches with just little bistro seating in the shop and group seating outside.  The staff mentioned they were going to be opening a full service restaurant next door.\n\nMy friend and I got different sandwiches (salami and vegetarian) and they were very good.  The bread is freshly made at the shop and you can see them pull them out of the oven.\n\nI liked it a lot and thought the vegetable soup was good (more of a stew really).
