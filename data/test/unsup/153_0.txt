This was a good deal and location for the strip. I didn't like how the room didn't come with a mini fridge or microwave. We booked on Hopper and got a price we thought was super cheap but to be honest an extra 100 and we would have stayed at more luxurious hotels. Pool closes super early, even the adult pool. No free shows or events\/specials for hotel guests which was a bummer. Over all good place to sleep and just spend most of the time on the strip.
