If you want a certain doughnut then you should call and see if they can hold it for you like the Lake Mead store will. This one runs out of doughnuts real quick in the mornings. The chocolate bars here are very good. My favorite is the Fat Elvis with peanut butter filling and chocolate and a caramelized banana on the top. The glazed doughnuts with sprinkles as simple as they are taste great and if you like raspberries then you should give the filled one here a try. The prices are good for what you get.
