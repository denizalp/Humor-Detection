I'm surprised this place stay in business. I'm not sure if the owner and staff know much about instruments beyond the student level. Stories abound about $3K instruments appeared at $500 and $1K instruments being purchased by the store for $3K. The repair staff is ok, bur very inconsistent in the quality of their work.   Unless you're looking for very basic stuff, skip this place.
