I am surprised that there are only low reviews for this place! I experienced excellent service today and my brownie batter blizzard was of the same quality that I had last summer, and it was tasty. The cashier was patient with me as I was indecisive. The store is tiny and only had a few booths, but it seems to be kept clean.
