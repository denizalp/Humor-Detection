Absolutely amazing clinic!! They take great care of my 3 year old pittie without judgment and are always so excited to see him. They call with updates on shots and treatments. Recently, my dog Hudson broke his toe and they squeezed him in the schedule and got him in right away. Very accommodating and AFFORDABLE! I highly highly recommend this clinic.
