This place is a gem in the desert city of Las Vegas. I go here to get my skin treatments for acne and collagen treatment to get rid of my acne scars. This place helps bring my confidence back. I use to wear lots of makeup just to hide all these scars and acne. Soon I will no longer wear makeup which is better for your skin in the long term as well. Prices are great. The staff is kind and personable as well. Would definitely recommend this place.
