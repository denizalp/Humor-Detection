Very slow service. Was overcharged for clearly marked items by Chef Sara herself, who then couldn't (or wouldn't) print me a receipt after the fact. \n\nReally disappointed. The food was fine but I'd never go back based on the level of service I experienced from the chef\/owner and the way she talks to her employees.
