Ugh, this airport is SO CONFUSING. There are so many damn luggage carriers and it's always so difficult to find the right one!\n\nThis airport is definitely not up to date, but I guess I give it 3 stars just because there are slot machines in it... and because it's Vegas and when I land in Vegas, I'm suddenly THAT much happier.
