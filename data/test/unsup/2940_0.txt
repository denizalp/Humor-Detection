Polished is the only nail salon I will go to. I've been going there for 3+Yrs. I get  hard gel nails. They have an amazing selection of colors As well as the latest colors from  lines like rockstar. The nails techs are super helpful with color choice especially when you can't make up your mind . The finished product is amazing. Flawless. Gels are done with 7 coats snd stay on for a good 3-4 weeks on nails and 6+ weeks on toes. I won't go anywhere else because I'm never as happy with the results.
