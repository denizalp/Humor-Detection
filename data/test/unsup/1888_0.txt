My brand new Prius mysteriously suffered a huge scratch and dent on the side panel. I called these guys up and the next day Tom and David repaired it right in my garage. I was surprised at how good the result looked and my seafoam green prius was not an easy color to match either. A little bit pricey for $350 but worth it for my peace of mind.
