Dear Grand Lux Cafe,\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you. When I've stayed at the Venetian or Palazzo you have always been there for me, arms wide open, 24\/7. I am pretty sure you've saved my life at 6 am after a long, long Vegas night on more than one occasion. Sure, you remind me a bit of the Cheesecake Factory, but when my heels are in my hand and my eyeliner is smeared all over my face I just want a goddamned sandwich... and you're always there to hook me up. \n\nThanks for that.\n-Lexie
