Amazing food! Great service! I went there twice this week. I went on a Thursday evening (7:00pm) and Saturday lunch time (12:30pm) at those times I went it was not busy and I got a table right away. The servers there are friendly. The food didn't take long. It took roughly 25-30 mins to come to my table. Definitely will come back.
