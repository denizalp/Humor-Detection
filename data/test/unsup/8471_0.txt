THE place for a burger, beers, live folk tunes and people watching after a nice long Harley ride in the Sonoran desert.  Sunday afternoon is best.\n\nIt has changed over the years as it seems to be frequented with more phony provincially ordinary Scottsdale wannabees\/yuppies\/rubs\/hipsters\/dipshits that try too hard to impress one another with their ignorance and a splash of attitude.  This joint is no longer pet friendly but still an awesome hangout with your riding partners and a good Cohiba.
