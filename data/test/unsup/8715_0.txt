I was very impressed at first seeing how Tiger Lily seemed to be the only floral shop on this side of town still taking corsage orders 3 days before homecoming. The guy was very nice and when I had to change ribbons day before they accommodated. Now the bad part...THE CORSAGE DIED 3 HOURS INTO THE NIGHT. My son's beautiful date who won homecoming queen had wilted, brown, pitiful roses on her wrist before even making it to dance. Embarrassing to say the least. My family will not be going here again.
