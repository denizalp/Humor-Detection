A hole-in-a-wall restaurant that would satisfy you're ramen soup cravings. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen miso, it was very good. Without adding extra toppings, it was enough to fill me up. Also I tried the karage (Japanese fried chicken), it was crunchy and tasted like a large popcorn chicken. The menu items are inexpensive and affordable. The place is small and it gets crowded during the dinner rush. I would go back here and dine again when visiting Vegas.
