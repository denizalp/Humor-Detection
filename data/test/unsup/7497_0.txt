Oh, how I missed the tofu soup and bulgogi combo in this cold weather.  The best combo deal you will find in a Korean Restaurant.  They have excellent dishes that will warm your body and your tummy.   My other favorites are bibmbap in the hot stone pot,  Korean BBQ, Chap Chae,  Sul Lung Tang, Mandoo Gook, Katsu plate (huge), and seafood pancake ( it should be an entree instead of an appetizer).  They offer excellent lunch specials for less than $6.00.
