I had the misfortune to have to talk to a very rude unprofessional office staff witch.  You know one of those people who won't do a thing for you and is disgusted that you dared to ask.  I was only trying to get my medical records!  I rate this office very poorly because of her attitude.  She was unbelievable!  Don't go here because if you ever need to get something other than care from the doctor you may end up having to talk to this very rude, uncaring, unprofessional person!
