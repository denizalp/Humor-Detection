Grabbed a latte before the doctors. It was ok, I wouldn't drive up here just to get it though. Friendly and quick service, parking was minimal like others have said. Better than Starbucks and cute interior, I'd want to hang here and piddle around online. I liked my cream cheese coffee cake more than my latte; grab one of those to go with your coffee!
