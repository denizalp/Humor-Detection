The food was pretty good at Joia.  Although I would say I'm a bigger fan of Zefferini's veal dish.   I had a veal scalolpini dish.. My husband had a penne with sausage.\n\nI think that next time I would go for pizza and salad there next time.\n\nWe had bruschetta as a starter and we both really enjoyed that
