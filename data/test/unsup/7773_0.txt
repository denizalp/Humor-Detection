This is a pretty nice club! I liked it better than Omnia and really enjoyed the view. I would definitely come back with my friends next time!\n\nWe were on a guest list and were able to get a wristband for open bar until 11pm so I really enjoyed my experience.\n\nThe staff was nice and very considerate and the bathrooms were clean. I highly recommend you come here! I had a great time.
