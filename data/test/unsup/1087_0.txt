The selection is pretty good but damn... It all means nothing.  I have been here four different times, even bought a bunch and EVERYTIME I have tired to just brush off the rude customer service . What a bummer. You would think as the owner of a small business you could be a little more pleasant or helpful?  I just can't handle the aloofness and arrogance anymore.  Won't be back.
