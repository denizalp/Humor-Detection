We love it here!! The atmosphere, the experience & excitement now that football is back!  Went there for my birthday on 9-20-18 and it was awesome!  Jared H was not able to wait on us so we sat at the BAR and TIM took care of us!!  Amazing, friendly and knows his stuff!! Made our drinks PERFECT! The food was great and my birthday desert was awesome!  Locals or visiting Las Vegas, come hang out at the Yard House at Town Square, South Las Vegas Blvd!
