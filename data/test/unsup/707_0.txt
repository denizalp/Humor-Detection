My father always gave me a pearl of wisdom as follows: \"Son if you cannot  say something nice about someone in public, don't say anything at all.\" I shall make an exception in this case. This place looks inviting and with a reasonable price. At the end of the meal we got a ridiculous bill for over $75.00 for food and drink that were not great. I would describe this restaurant as \"a tourist trap.\"
