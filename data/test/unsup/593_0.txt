It's like an old style diner. It's cosy and friendly and has a very large menu.\nWhen it's not busy this place is great. Unfortunately it is understaffed and unbearable when it is busy. The seating area doesn't leave much room and there seems to be the same number of staff despite the crowded restaurant. We've been waiting over a half hour for our order to be taken and it's debatable wether we will even stay to see if it happens.
