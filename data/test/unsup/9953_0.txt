Had dinner here tonight with wifey. Food and service as always was top notch. They have a new pretty cool system for you to see when your table is ready. Your fish, on a big screen that looks like a fish tank, gets bigger the closer you are to getting a table then a net comes down and scoops your fish out when your tables ready. Fun to watch. Had to do video in slow motion to reduce the screen glare.
