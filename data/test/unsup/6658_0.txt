Apparently, I ate the wrong dishes here.  I regret about not checking the Yelp reviews prior to the visit.\n\nSteamed mussels: Sold out\nCalamari: What a mess\nPasta with eggplant and tomato sauce: Totally \"Barilla + Classico\"\n\nI should probably give it a second try, but my first experience with Greenbush was pretty sour.
