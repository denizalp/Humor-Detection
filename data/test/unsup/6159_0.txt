Came in here looking for pho. Can't b that bad right!?!?!\n\n1. The place looks like a sh*t hole\n2. Kids toys in the restaurant? (Little tikes big toys that should be outside)\n3. The place in general is a run down\n\n-the main disappointment was we were a party of 5 and we got this lady yelling in her language and instead of helping us get seated. This place is the worst. will def not come here ever again. And FYI who put them on the food network? ??.and gave these people a yelp sticker? We need to take that off!!!
