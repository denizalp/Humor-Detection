Sierra bonita rocks! I love their bacon wrapped shrimp (everything is better wrapped in bacon). Their green chili pozole is awesome and has just the right amount of heat. The buttermilk chicken is juicy tender and I have to hold myself back from licking the gravy off my plate. And their Sangria is awesome, not too sweet, perfect blend of wine and brandy..mMMMmmmmHmmm!
