This place is awful!   Seats are broken in the theaters.  Half the seats are so close to the teen you can't see the movie.   And the popcorn with Fake Butter gloving a is just gross!   We couldn't even eat it, and to think we paid $14 for a Diet Coke and crappy popcorn, it really shows how they are struggling for survival and profitability.
