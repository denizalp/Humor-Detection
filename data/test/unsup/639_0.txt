I got my synthetic oil change here. I didn't want anything else done. At the end they told me my air filters were really bad & I needed new ones. I didn't think they were right, & went somewhere else right after & asked. My air filters were almost brand new. I felt that they were being dishonest & trying to take advantage of a girl who knows nothing about cars. This location isn't convenient for me anyways. I won't be coming back.
