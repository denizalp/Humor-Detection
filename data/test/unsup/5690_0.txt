We selected Dr. Hodapp as our daughter's pediatrician because we heard he was great.  We finally got to meet him since we had to take our daughter in after she was born.  Dr. Hodapp was professional, knowledgeable, and took the time to explain everything to us about our newborn.  He was very friendly as well.  The waiting room was huge, and we were helped right away upon checking in.  The staff were friendly as well.
