After a year of tormenting my hair (bleached blonde, red, brunette) I decided to go back to my natural color.  The last time my hair was colored I had an allergic reaction, so I was nervous to color again.  I saw Torrence and she gave me a head full of foils. She was very careful to keep the color off of my scalp.  My hair looks and feels fantastic the color is perfect and has lasted without fading. She also have me a great cut. I am so happy to have found this place!!
