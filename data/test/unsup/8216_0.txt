Cool - yes\nHip - yes (love the music and ambiance of the place)\nAmazing - YES!\nMy dog Bo's first time at the Groomery and what a wonderful experience!\nLawrence, the owner is obviously very experienced and loving to the dogs and very concerned about their well being and type of cut that suits their style \nA definite reccomendation!
