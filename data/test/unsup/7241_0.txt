Arrived last Friday on a rare beautiful Cleveland day, so we wanted the patio.  Somehow, no dice, even though it was early.   Seated and neglected while other patrons were seated, and served their drinks and apps.\nNot prepared for a Friday night dinner crowd.  Staff not up to parl.  What a shame cuz we are regulars.  Won't be coming around any time soon, cuz we are still sore about the treatment.  BTW, we complained to the hostess as we left, who didn't seem to be too upset about it.
