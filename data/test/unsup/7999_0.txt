Drive for 2 more minutes up north to Kim tao.  This place doesn't compare.  Soup base is the most important for hot pot,  but all 4 I tried was bland and tasteless..  Sour and not spicy Tom yum soup?  Definitely not worth the extra 5$ you have to pay for.   The best part of my meal is 15$\/dozen oysters.  How can you screw that up?  Well the oysters was covered in sand so whoever shucked it didn't wash the oysters or the knife.  Selection for food sucks.  Never again.
