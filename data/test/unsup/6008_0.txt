Hourglass Cleaners are the absolute BEST cleaners in arcadia\/biltmore! They are extremely friendly, priced appropriately and convenient and fast! Brad and Sunhi are the owners and work there all the time. They have a real neighborhood feel to the way they run the store and remember customers. They were able to get candle wax out of silk without any change to the fabric or pigment, and alter clothing for a custom fit! Always do everything I request! Highly recommend from a gal with lots of high end clothing and difficult fabrics.!
