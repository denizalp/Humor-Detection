I have only came here once & was disappointed. \n\nThe prices were too expensive for the food.  The food tasted like I could have gone to a fast food place & the fast food probably would have even tasted BETTER than the food here at Hamadas. \n\nThe service was decent & attentive but I would never come back here again.
