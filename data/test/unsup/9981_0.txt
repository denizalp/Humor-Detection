My friend recommended taking my clothes to Tapestry to consign. With my past few unpleasant experiences with consignment stores, I was pleasantly surprised. They were very willing to take in all of my items (and donate whatever they don't want), and they pay you out in store credit or cash without an appointment!\n\nI also browsed some of their items - they do sell some new items which are pricey (Mexx). Overall a cute store, and friendly service.
