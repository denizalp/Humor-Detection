I am in laveen all the time in the morning and there is nothing in laveen as a breakfast restaurant. I always have to drive about 10miles away to a over packed IHOP or Denny's. I found this place on yelp and tried it out with my mom and it was amazing. It's kinda hidden but worth coming to. The food is good and owner is super friendly
