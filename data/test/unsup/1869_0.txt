This was my first time, ( I know impossible to believe) that I have went to a Philipino restaurant I had  stew that was slightly spicy, don't want to know what all was in it , but it was very , very good, it did include beef and potatoes. I also has the pork that was simmered in a brown gravy, very tasty dish. So if you in the mood to try something different , I would recommend this place.
