Food was delicious, but a little pricey for what you get. The atmosphere was a really chill area (see pictures) which would be great in the summer. The turkey sandwich was really good and fresh. My family got the reuben which were very flavorful.  The downfall of the place is that there are many ingredients on each item which could not be good for picky eaters. The service was really good, but the waiter kept taking away our drinks when we still had a 1\/3 of our drinks left. I hate wasting.
