horrable place!!!! They were so rude that we walked out. They completely ignored us when we walked in, didn't even say hi or anything. The employees continued to sit around and talk while we were standing there. They couldn't even answer their phone because they were too lazy to get up and do something. If I could rate this negitive 20 I would!!
