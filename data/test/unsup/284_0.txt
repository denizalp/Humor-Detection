GOT BIKE?!  \nThis is the perfect place to take the ride!  (motorcyle, in case of any confusion)  \nFor some reason i luv sunday's best - 5pm. (ck out the rows of bikes :-)  Great to hook up, meet, go with, take. someone.  Luv the casual attmosphere - not normal @ scottsdale!  \nSo put on your leathers, your bike gear, or your cowboy boots, hat & belt, and get ready to pull up a picnic table bench seat & meet new friends!
