Five dollars and thirty cents for a pulled pork sandwich with a side of sauce? Sorry, Honey Bear's, but I'm not feeling you. Why, oh why, did I go on a day when they didn't serve catfish, which I love from here. Perhaps when I blow off some steam over a sandwich this small with no side dishes costing over $5 I'll return for your fish fry. Until then, see ya.
