Went in for lunch today and had a great time with the bartender\/waiter Joe. Good service but it was only surpassed by the food. A good variety at our table. The fish taco special was very good, the Mac and queso as also very good. I had the pork adovado wrap with green chilies.  What a treat.  Will go back here without question the next time we are in the area.  Thanks Joe for a great lunch and a fun time
