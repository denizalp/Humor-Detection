Really enjoyed this place and their take on Middle Eastern\/Israeli food. \n\nShared the following dishes with the young lady:\n\nLamb Ribs\nLabneh \nBaked Fluke\nJeweled Rice\nTurkish Dumplings\n\nMy favorites were the lamb ribs and labneh, perfection in taste and presentation. \n\nOur server was awesome. Not only did he go over the menu in full detail and provide recommendations, he also went out of his way to give us a list of some of his favorite bars in the area.
