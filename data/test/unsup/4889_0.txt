The food is very average. The cake is usually very stale. I have bought about 3 slices of chocolate cake so far and it was stale twice. They made a mistake with our order one time and asked us to pay extra if we wanted what we ordered even though we were told earlier that we did not need to pay extra for substituting one side dish with another. So experience was blah.
