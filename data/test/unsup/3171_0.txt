Picked up a bunch of school supplies here for the Yelp donation event and found the store to be neatly laid out, organized and just about exactly the same as every other Dollar Tree I've been to.\n\nI do like Dollar Tree. This is the chain where everything really is a dollar (though some things are 50 cents).
