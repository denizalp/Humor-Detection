Pretty standard all you can eat sushi. There is nothing special about it but they have some pretty slow service. Even though you order through an iPad the server still need to come over and a risky confirm and send the order so there isn't much of a point for the iPad. They also always forget some of the orders and sushi always comes in individual little plates which take up so much room.
