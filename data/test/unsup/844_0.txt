Nancy Megia has been cutting my hair for years while she worked for a national chain of salons that doesn't accept appointments. She's the quintessential hair stylist--years of experience, efficient,  friendly, and a good conversationalist (but not too chatty!).\n\nNow she has just opened her own full-service salon and it's great!  Bright, clean, spacious, with a calm atmosphere. \n\nToday was my first visit to her new location. I got to make an appointment--no waiting! And it's hard to beat $13 for a men's haircut. \n\nHighly recommended.
