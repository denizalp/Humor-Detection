Dont dont dont go here.  Went for gel fill in and pedicure, it took 2.5 hours, no uv light used to set gel, and every one of my fingers had cuts on them from the girl filing my nails.  The paint came out mediocre at best, and my nails were so bumpy and uneven I had to go the next day and spend another $30 to get them fixed.  They can have one star from me for being open, but I'd rather not have given any.
