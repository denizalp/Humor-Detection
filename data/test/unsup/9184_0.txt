normally I would say I love Chick-fil-A's but this location is hard to find a parking spot first and then every time that we're here it is I pretty dirty place it's not so clean.  I'm not sure if we show up during lunch time or this is the standard they have because of the volume due to downtown.  Of course the food taste the same and it's always good but just to service missing.
