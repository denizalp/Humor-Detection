i had a great experience with the food. i took my boyfriend there for his birthday. I had the chicken and waffle, side of fried green tomato  which was amazing. He had the red velvet waffle and sausage. Everything was perfect but the waitress. she was extremely rude and no help. the other waitress were very helpful on their tables. that was the only thing that wasnt great.
