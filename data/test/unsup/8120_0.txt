Fresh breads daily....what more is their to say.  I first bought the blueberry peach loaf, and was hooked.  French toast made with the apple cinnamon loaf was a hit for Mother's Day.  I enjoy sampling the different types before buying.  The Toffee Bar and Mississippi Mud Bar are great additions to fresh breads.  I've nearly completed my loyalty card, with a free loaf coming my way.
