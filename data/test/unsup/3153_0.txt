As good as it gets for us New Yorkers out West!  I brought my wife here and we make it a point to dine here at every opportunity when we're in town.  The service and the ambiance are amazing.  We both love the pomidoro sauce.  It is the most flavorful tomato sauce I've ever had.  The seafood selections are superb:  I've had linguine with clams in the past which reminded me of back home.  This time I had one of the specials of scallops and linguine.  The scallops were yuge!  This place never disappoints.
