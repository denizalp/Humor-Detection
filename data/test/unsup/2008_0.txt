Stopped in after seeing the beer bitburger advertised by the main entrance. I asked a lady bartender about the beer, she didn't know what I was talking about. She directed me to the owner and the owner lady said she didn't know what I was talking about either?? So I asked to show her and she didn't want to get off her hind end so I could show her the advertisement she had. Terrible customer service from the owner. Won't be back -terrible clueless  owner... Has no idea about beer
