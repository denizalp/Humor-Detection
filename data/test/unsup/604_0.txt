College and Spadina seems to have become land of the hot dog. Let me help you make your decision: CHOOSE LET'S BE FRANK! They're the best option! I had the Doritos Taco Hot Dog, large sized. It was amazing. I did takeout and it was the most enjoyable takeout of all time. The hot dog was so well put together and the taste, disgustingly delicious. Everything you ever wanted in a hot dog. They are often empty and that's brutal because this is going to be a go-to for me from now on. Yes, it is THAT GOOD.
