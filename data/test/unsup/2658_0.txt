Very decent food with good selection. And with a CA DL you get 5 dollars off!\nLove the crab legs and the ox tail soup. I drank a lot of the ox tail soup! Yum!\nThe steaks are ok. But still, rest of the cuisines are great!\nWe went there on Friday night and there was not a big line, so we got in fast. I would say it's the best in Vegas recently. Good price, good food and good service!
