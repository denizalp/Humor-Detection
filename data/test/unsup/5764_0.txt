Second time here and it was just as amazing as the first time. Food is always delicious and the service even better! Justin helped us out tonight, like he did the first we were here. He is awesome and would definitely recommend him to all my friends looking to get their KBBQ fix! He even has the same birthday as me, so we gotta be friends by default! Lol Thank you, Justin, for an amazing experience once again! Keep up the great work my bruddah!!
