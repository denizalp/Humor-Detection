The Mix Lounge is fantastic.  I really liked the vibe in the place and the ambiance.  And major 5+ stars for the bathroom view.  As you are sitting on the toilet doing your business, you have a floor-to-ceiling view of the strip.  Amazing.\n\nAll else, standard bar-schmar stuff.  Expensive, but good (strong) drinks; good mix of folks, and it's dark, so if you are either: ugly; wearing clothes that are a size too small; or wearing way too much make-up,  your date can't tell.
