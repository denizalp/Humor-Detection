We were told that cats \"have the dirtiest mouths of all animals\". And that if our cat bit the groomer that \"she'd be out of work\". Wow. A simple, \"sorry we don't groom cats\" would have been sufficient. Slightly overpriced too, which I'm normally willing to overlook when it comes to supporting local business. But the snotty girl behind the counter was way too much of a turn off for my wife and I who just moved to the area. Terrible customer service.
