Third times (not) the charm! This place is bad. The food is mediocre but the service is the worst. The waitress was rude to our table and the food took forever. The service staff stand around flirting with eachother and pay little attention to customers who need drinks etc. Maybe they need a reminder that they work for tips. I hate going places that act like they are doing you a favour by bringing you out food. Won't be coming back here ever.
