This was my first time at this Taco Bell. Sometimes, I just really crave Taco Bell. Anyway, they were open before their open time, and I went through the drive thru which was super fast! I'm not sure if it's cause I went a little earlier (but there was still a line), but this has got to be one of the quickest drive thru restaurants I've been to. And my food wasn't messy or anything. I will be back to this location soon!
