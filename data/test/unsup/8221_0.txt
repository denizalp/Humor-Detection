Great view! but the food and drinks are pricey - cocktails are $18-25\nCame here for the skyline view of Toronto. Well worth it.\nDownside - Once you sit down, you can't see the view - They should get high table and chairs...\nService was A-Okay. \nI recommend you sit on the outside patio. Ask for some blankets if you get cold - they have big heater too. \nWalk around Yorkville before or after for some shopping!
