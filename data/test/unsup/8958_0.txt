The nautical paintings that adorn the walls of this very slightly smokey establishment are what really sell the experience when you eat here. \n\nThe service is very good and while the food ranges from almost very good to just barely good, the price makes dining here a very very good value. Especially for breakfast or brunch. \n\nYou'll likely enjoy a good meal here, if you're okay with the slight tinge of smokey air.
