Just perfect!!! The Filet Mignon is to die for! It is coffee crusted with an ancho chile sauce! Yum ! Lets talk about the appetizer! The avocado with onions finely chopped and the cotija cheese dipped in a red chile and the freshly made tortillas! Now the drink, , it was a sweet cactus pear margarita! Definitely recommend and will be coming back!!!
