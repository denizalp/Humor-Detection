I used to enjoy your pizza, but upon my last visit noticed a \"no firearms\" sticker on your door. While it is asinine to believe that a sticker would keep bad guys out, it is within your right to decide not to welcome customers who legally and lawfully carry firearms in accordance with local law. However, since my right and ability to protect myself and family is more important to me that your pizza, I will no longer patronize your business, and actively discourage friends and associates from giving you their business.
