Shelbi was our server and she was absolutely incredible - personable, charming, and very attentive. They made a very good Bullitt Rye old fashioned for me and my wife enjoyed her glass of Pinot Noir. The squid ink pasta with shrimp & calamari was very good. I'd definitely order it again but beware, it is spicy! My wife's salmon was perfectly cooked. Kids had Strozzapereti & chicken parm... Both were also excellent. Overall, a great low-key dinner with delicious food and superb service.
