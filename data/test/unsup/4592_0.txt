When it comes to the caliber and quality of food and service Scaramouche is Fantastic.  However when you see the lack of attention to detail in the men's room, I am truly shocked!  This is not what I expect.  Fresh flowers in the mens room, but the hand towels should be in a quality basket along with the tissues should be covered with a quality basket cover.  This in the end disappoints.  Luxury is always about attention to detail.  This needs to be fixed before I can increase my rating.  What a silly way to loose a coveted star!
