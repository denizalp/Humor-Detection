For the money.... there should be a variety of BBQ sauces that pairs with each expensive meat! Cleveland this place is not kid friendly!!!!!! I asked the server what do you have for kids to drink his response was \"we have coke products\"... what good parent give their 3yr old coke products.... Shame on you mr. Simon for taking advantage of the hard working people of Cleveland with your ridiculous prices and condescending staff. You already lost me and my family from eating at Bspot now from Mabel's! Shame, shame!
