Had the brisket and the ribs with a side of poutine. Everything was well prepared and tasted great especially the poutine. Only complaint I have is the price. The food was good and I'm OK with small portions but at that price point the food should knock me off my feet. Had a quarter pound of each meat plus the side and a soda and it came to $24 and I was just barely satisfied. Overall good experience might go back with friends I think the prices lower in higher quantities.
