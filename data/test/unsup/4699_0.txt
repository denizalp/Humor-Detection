The restaurants in the Simcoe place are all pretty terrible. But this one is really one notch below bad. The chicken was so firm I couldn't cut it with the plastic knife. The pea salad tasted of mold. The curry was cold. Everything just tastes bad. And industrial nan breads.\nIt's also expensive, for a meal between $10 and $14. I never do that, because I hate to waste food, but everything ended up into the garbage, where it belonged.
