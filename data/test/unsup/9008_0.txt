One of worst vegetarian Indian food i have ever had, being vegetarian and from india i believe have enough knowledge of good food.\nTried 3 times and all 3 times had the worst food.\n\nWould rather go and eat frozen veggies than eat here.\nWould not recommend for Indian food especially for vegetarian food.
