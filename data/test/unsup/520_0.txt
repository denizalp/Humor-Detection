Pros: location is pretty good, equally between the airport and Mill Ave for all restaurants and bars ect..  most rooms have cute patios that have a view of hills.  Pool is pretty nice.  \n\nCons: shower head and pressure were terrible, fluorescent white lights in 'renovated' rooms; it's terrible on your eyes. Needs to be a warm white light, it would make the room and decor look so much better.
