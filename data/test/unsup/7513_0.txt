What can I say... It's Starbucks, they have this place down to a system, guy who takes your food order, guy who takes you coffee order, guy who rings you up. You will probably be in the photos of many German families who are taking photos of this American institution. Just outside the front door of Treasure Island so very convenient for the morning walk of shame ;-)
