Nice-looking mellow bar with odd videos playing on projector screens. I wouldn't go as far as call it the hipster bar of Pittsburgh but it does draw a crowd of funny-dressed people who like to talk about their latest art piece they made while going through a breakup with yet another boyfriend. Drinks are okay, the downstairs bar gets packed fast and is small, good luck finding a place to stand without getting constantly bumped. And I have not ventured upstairs.
