Overall, for Pittsburgh, this is as good as it gets. They sell the basics, rice... vegetables, frozen beef\/pork\/seafood, ramen, rice cookers, tofu and prepared side dishes. I would have to say, the freshly made Kimchee is by far the best tasting in town. Usually thursday and saturdays are the best days to shop here since they receive a delivery from DC or Chicago. \n\nThe parking situation is really tough. You can park in the back but the road is not paved very well and the spots are tight.
