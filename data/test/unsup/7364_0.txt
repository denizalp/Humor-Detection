Love\/hate relationship with this place.\n\nLove the fitness classes\/hate that I have to get there a half hour early to secure a spot.\n\nLove the insane number of machines\/equipment to choose from\/hate that unless I'm wearing lululemon or a pound of makeup I stick out while I'm using them. (Whatever happened to showering AFTER the gym?)\n\nLove the size of the locker room & the supplies within it\/hate the RIDICULOUS membership fee that makes me feel like I need to shower there as often as possible to attempt to get my money's worth.\n\nI rest my case.
