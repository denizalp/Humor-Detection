Love this place. I keep it light and just have the Shortrib grilled cheese. Fantastic. But the real treat is the Pork Belly Bao. They are currently in my top 5 favorite food items. Absolutely incredible. \n\nI usually get this through Postmates, and they've been pretty good with the orders so far. Highly recommend, but you are not doing it right if you're not getting the Bao.
