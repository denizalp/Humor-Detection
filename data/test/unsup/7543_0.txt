Wannabe Miami South Beach nightclub -- but alittle too discriminating for my taste. I am taking off one star because both nights I was there I witnessed what I felt was unfair racial and gender profiling. Women and minorities in particular couldn't get in unless they were dressed to kill, but White males got in with flip flops and cargo shorts. Wtf? I preferred the top level with adult slow jams. Lower level got a little too crowded for my taste . . .  a fight broke out. Kudos to the security staff for breaking it up asap.
