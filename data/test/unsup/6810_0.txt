When we arrived, the hostess did not seat us but said simply to \"sit wherever you want.\"  We chose a small table inside.  Then we waited.  And waited further.  We looked around.  We waited more for someone--anyone to show up at our table to serve us.  We thought of food.  We thought of drink.  We thought of other places to eat.  So after further waiting, we got up and left.  The hostess said \"have a good night!\"  Sure, we will, somewhere else!
