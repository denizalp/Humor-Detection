Killer made-to-order sandwiches had me visiting this deli more than once during my recent assignment across the street.  The deli section has more meats and cheeses than most delis I have ever been to that are twice the size.  They also have stromboli's, calzones and pizza.  I could have made a meal just out of the free samples while waiting for my sub to be made.  To top it off, a very appealing meat counter and a produce section puts this deli over the top.\n\nBonus points for the easy-on-the-blinkers gals working in the store and their mid-western accents!  Nice!
