Amazing chicken! Our favorite spot for chicken literially every Sunday after church! We bring everyone there! But recently the customer service hasn't been very pleasant. The 2 new cashiers that we encountered the past 2 months have been very rude & aggrivated with their job. The back of the house guys are always good to us and personable. We recently missed a Sunday there bc of their service. We hope that it'll change soon or they will lose us.
