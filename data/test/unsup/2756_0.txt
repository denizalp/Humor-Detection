People are great, store has a lot of games you cant find anywhere else.  My only complaint is that their online store, they said they do no go by that, as it has not been updated in over a year and said \"do not believe anything on their\" when relating to price or stock.  I was a little upset I had drove out there and had to pay almost $20 more than advertised online but other than that, great place!
