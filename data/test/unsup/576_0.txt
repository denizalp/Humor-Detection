Rushed over to ship a package sold on eBay and they closed 10 minute early.  I leave for an international trip for work tomorrow.  Their closing early screwed me big time.  Thanks for following your hours. Gotta drive across town to hopefully find another store now. Door says they are supposed to close at 5.  Please change it to 450pm.
