If you want pancakes, look no further. This place delivers a good variety of pancakes, check out their menu. \n\nI came with a group of pancake snobs and we all agreed, these were some good pancakes. The toppings and sauces are really good and creative, it is truly a nice meal. I had some eggs with potatoes and these were nicely seasoned too. Coffee was also good, and service was fast and friendly. Rounding up to 5 stars, no problem.
