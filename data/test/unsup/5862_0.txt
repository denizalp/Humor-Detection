Met some friends here Sunday afternoon. $10.90 entrance fee....why the $0.90??? \n\nWe grabbed a beer and walked around. There was lots of people for sure and some long lines. I didn't see one truck that interested me so I didn't purchase any food. \n\nThe carnival and games were a bit lame. I know parents need stuff for kids to do but maybe better served eliminating some of this and layout the food trucks in better order. \n\nI prefer the food festival at Sunset Park. Better layout, and better selection of food.
