damnnn man. can you make the boombox room BIGGER please?! or move it into in the main room?! you can't even dance in that room it's sooo packed and it was as hot inside as it is outside. yuck!!\n\npeople wanna dance to hiphop NOT trance music. the boombox room is the best room there but geez. i was there this past weekend and i couldn't even breathe in that room or even dance. we were packed in there like sardines.
