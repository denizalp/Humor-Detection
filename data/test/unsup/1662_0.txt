My wife & I ate here many occasions, since the last review. The service is friendly, polite & efficient. \n\nTheir Pho Dac Biet (house special beef noodle soup) is above typical, with the broth pretty savory. \n\nThe vegetarian lo mein is full of flavors, yet lighter than the version with meat. \n\nWe will eat at this restaurant again when having the opportunity to.
