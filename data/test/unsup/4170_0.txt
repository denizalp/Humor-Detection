Great AYCE, lovely management, and the lunch specials are inexpensive while filling and tasty.\nI love the service here, even when it's busy the staff are quick, accommodating and polite.\nNot a fan of their miso soup but their fish is incredibly fresh and the entrees are always ample. Plus the prices are very reasonable.
