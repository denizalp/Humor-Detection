Awesome place!  And a total hidden gem in this city.  I highly recommend.  Went here on Saturday when they had live jazz music and it was really crowded so there was no where to sit, but the music was great.  Drinks were tasty and had the turkey burger which was great.  \n\nLove the atmosphere and feel of this place - I'm definitely going to check this place out again and hopefully get there a little earlier so I can get a seat!
