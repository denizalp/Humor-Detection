Giving them one star is actually being very generous, I come from the LA area where we have a large Asian population and let me tell you their food does not even compare to anything in LA. Matter fact some of their food is tasteless and some of it I almost barfed up. I ordered glazed walnut shrimp I don't know what they gave me but it was definitely not glazed walnut shrimp. I know what chop Suey stands for noon pig food in the stuffed and doesn't even qualified to be that good.
