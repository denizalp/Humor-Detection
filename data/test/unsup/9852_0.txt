Beautiful pool area and bar!  Super clean rooms and restful atmosphere.  Casino on-premises.  Full conference center available with shops and restaurants within walking distance.  20 minute cab ride to the strip.  Ask for a pool view room to avoid casino parking garage or interstat e view.  Can walk to plenty of shopping and dinner options - the locals come to this area to shop.
