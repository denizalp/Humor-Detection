I visited for the first time last week and I love my nails. While I'm used to a typical salon...rows of pedicure chairs and nail station, this shop isn't that and it's okay. She only does nails so I will have to someplace else to get my pedicure and eyebrow waxing needs satisfied. Ashlee is conversational and creative. I also loved the hand exfoliate that she uses. My hands felt and looked amazing when I left. I will be back!
