Not really frozen custard...more like just soft served ice cream =\/ the burger is okay -- the California style burger is like a single cheeseburger from In N Out but I do like their fries...crispy and very thin. The menu is mostly ice cream and sundaes. \n\nNothing very note worthy of this place...kinda cheap, has drive thru and big sit-in area and friendly staff.
