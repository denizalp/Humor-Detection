If my mother ever cooked like this I would have fired her. \"My Mother's\" is bland as I am white. I had bland Lasagna with hard spice-less garlic bread and a limp side salad. The only item that saved My Mother's was the pie. The Chocolate Cream Pie (pictured) was heaven. The contrast between dinner and desert made me wonder if My Mother had someone else bake the pie.
