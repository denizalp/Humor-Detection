After the 5th day of being in Vegas we were venturing around to the park and such to run my dog and decided we needed a snack and some red bulls to push us through the rest of the day.  There is plenty of parking, neatly stocked shelves, hot food options to go, plenty of beverage and snack options and the store is very clean.  Getting in and out at the intersection was fairly easy as well.
