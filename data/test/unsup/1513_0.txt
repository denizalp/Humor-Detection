Do you find that sometimes really, really simple food should be the standard?  I had lunch yesterday and it was enjoyable.  The menu is not impressive in terms of variety or creativity.  I ordered a cheeseburger and fries...and was pleasantly surprised.  Thick juicy burger cooked exactly as ordered - medium rare.  The bun was toasted and was amazingly  fresh.  Fries were crispy on the outside, soft and warm in the middle.  Simple food prepared well.  I'll be back.
