Would've given 5 stars had the salad not been just a few pieces of wilted lettuce. Also if you're going to offer salad, put it in a separate container. Also, the chef forgot to put the potatoes in my breakfast order.\n\nBesides that, fair value (I was using a coupon) really great service, smaller place than I expected. May or may not go back. Do enjoy that they have the freestyle Coca-Cola machine.
