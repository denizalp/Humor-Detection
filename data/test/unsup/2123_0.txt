This has got to be one the WORST medical offices I've ever been in (Mesa). The wait was in excess of two hours (felt like an emergency room). Waiting area was crowded and dirty. The staff was not rude, but not helpful either. The Doctor was only marginally interested in my glaucoma. The contract eyeglass store had a young women who chewed gum like cow chewing a cud helping customers. Who ever the office manager is should probably be fired. This place is clearly more interested in quantity not quality. Never coming back here.
