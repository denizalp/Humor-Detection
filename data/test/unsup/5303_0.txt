My boyfriend and I walked inside and waited to be seated, after a few minutes of standing around a waitress finally made eye contact and told us to seat ourselves. We sat ourselves near other customers and waited for 15+ minutes as waiters and waitresses walked by never once stopping to offer us menus or drinks. The music was very loud and after being ignored we got up and left. Very poor service. I would give 0 stars if I could.
