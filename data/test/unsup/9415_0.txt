Ordered the pho tai $9 for a small bowl and bun bo hue $11. Both were pretty good but I definitely have to say the bun bo hue was fantastic! Generous portion, variety of meats, full plate of assorted veggies, and flavorful broth. This definitely hit the spot after a night out around the town! \n\nGood food, quick service.\n\nCheers
