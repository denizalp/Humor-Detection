Service was great, price was reasonable and the food was delicious. Like the environment and love the sweet potato fries even without sauce. Rib eye was yummy. Lobster garlic noodle was tasty. Turkey pot pie was huge!!! It's bigger than your face. However, our sliders were a little bit dry so I gave 4 starts....\n\nOne more thing we like yard house is they have some unique dishes like Kung pao calamari and duck wings. We will definitely try them next time
