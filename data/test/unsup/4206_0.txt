Don't come here if you're planning to sleep before 4am. I was here for an investment conference, and on the 26th floor, I could hear the incessant pounding of douchebag club music. \n\nAnd this for a hotel that calls itself \"a Five Star hotel.\"\n\nPathetic. I would give it negative stars if I could.
