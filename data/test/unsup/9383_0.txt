This is the best AYCE joint I've eaten at.  Fish quality may not be up to par with the best sushi places in town, but as far as AYCE goes, this place can't be beat.  \n\nNigiri is delicious.  Good quality fish, nice cuts, and perfect rice.\n\nAlso, love their rolls: Harry Potter, No Name, most everything on the menu for that matter!\n\nOnly downside to this spot is that they do not accept reservations.  I've waited as long as an hour at peak times to get seated, which would be ridiculous if this weren't so good.
