We had lunch here today.  We were there at 11:00 and was promptly seated. We had the gyoza and they were perfectly done. I had the thin noodles and she had the thick. The broth was heavenly and the pork was delicious. We both slurped our bowls to the bottom. This is a great little hole in the wall close to home for me so my return will be soon.
