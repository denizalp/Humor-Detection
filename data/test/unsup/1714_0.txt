Pretty Average Pub Food here, with a normal boring beer list - nothing to really stand out at all -  The ribs are very average, with the cheesy potatoes being fine, if coming out a bit tepid\n\nI would certainly not recommend it, based on this meal and looking at the menu I would guess if you do not have adventurous tastes and a bud light palate you will be happy here - If you are looking for something more than average American cuisine - move on
