I had two different rolls as well as a deep fried jalapeno, and all were just \"meh\".  I had take-out and tried to use a groupon, but they wouldn't let me, saying it was for dine-in only even though the groupon didn't specify that.  The rolls had almost no flavor and the jalapeno had the taste of being deep fried about an hour before I ate it.  Overall, disappointing experience.  And I still have the groupon. :(
