This is a pretty fatty thing to say, but as soon as I cleaned my plate of Sittoo's Combo, I seriously wanted a second one - it was that good! \n\nThe salad and rice was among the best I've ever tasted, and the grape leaves were DEFINITELY the best.  All the prices were very reasonable, and the service was super friendly and fast. \n\nI can't believe I have driven past this place a million times and never checked it out until recently. I will definitely be back, and often.
