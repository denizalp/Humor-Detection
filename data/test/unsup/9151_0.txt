This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had! Open the door and bugs on the wall. Go to  the bed and kick a block holding up the frame. Getting deeper into the room, I smell death coming from it. So, turn on the tv but oh no it's broken as well. So I pick up the phone and of course it's not working.This was the most miserable place I have ever been. I wouldn't go back if I was paid to.   BUYER BEWARE STAY SUITES OF AMERICA...BUYER BEWARE!!!
