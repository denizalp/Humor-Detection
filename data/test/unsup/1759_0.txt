If you are in Vegas and want some great Pho, visit Viet Noodle Bar. The food here is delicious and served fast. They serve oxtail Pho here. \n\nI was surprised on how large this restaurant was. It had a nice decor and there were tons of seating so there was no waiting for tables. There are able accomodate large groups.\n\nThe service was great. They are prompt with taking orders and they constantly check on you unlike some Asian restaurants.
