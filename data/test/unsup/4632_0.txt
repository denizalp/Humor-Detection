The food here is spot on. It's a really fun menu, with some incredibly creative dishes such as pinenut sorbet between arugula madelines. This chef is solid. The place itself is fun too: loud, young servers, nice look and decor, and excellent bartender. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the whole meal was insanely long. Normally, I'm ok with a really long meal, but the dishes came out in weird spurts and then there was a really long time between the next dish. The timing needs to be adjusted a bit.
