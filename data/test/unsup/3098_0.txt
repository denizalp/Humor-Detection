Let me ask you this, Bakehouse: Do you WANT me to get the sugar diabetes and have to take insulin and get my legs amputated and shit? Rude. Your beautiful treats are going to kill me. You and your fucking scones. WHY!? Just when I think I'm out of the woods I spot a gorgeous ham and gruyere croissant and start having impure thoughts about it.  Have you ever considered that there might be kids walking by and they might see all of your pies and galettes? Think of the children!  You'll be hearing from my lawyer.\n\nlolololjkluvudoe
