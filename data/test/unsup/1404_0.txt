I was here two years ago when it was managed by a different company, and the Sheraton gave the hotel a face lift.  It's much nicer now!\nOn the down side, this was the first time I've ever asked for a room, and been given an occupied room.  Though I think it was more of a surprise for the person I woke up at 2am when I opened the door.  They were very apologetic about the whole thing, but I'm still not sure how that kind of mistake happens.  Anyway, overall though it was a nice stay.
