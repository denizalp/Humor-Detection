Every time we're in South Point I make sure to go to the Garden Buffet. Love their dessert offerings especially the gelato. The best thing I've had here is the biscuits and gravy. I've been craving to eat them again, maybe when we check in tot heir hotel and make it down to breakfast. I also love how the menudo is seasoned to perfection, imho. For those who don't enjoy the beef tripe, try their carnitas in green chili. The salad bar is also a good choice for a lighter fare.
