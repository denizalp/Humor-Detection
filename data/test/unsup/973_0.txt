December 26th, 2016\n\nFamily Vegas trip with my mom, brother, sister, baby, and fiance. Came here for our breakfast and the food here is pretty good. I ordered half of the menu and tried everything. Though I find it super heavy and dense, I would still eat all the dishes here. Hey! I'm on vacation, I deserve to eat what I want.
