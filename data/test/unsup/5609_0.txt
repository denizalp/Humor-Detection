I hate that I have to write this. Earlier this evening- I had a choice between Mexican and Chinese- a dear friend sent me down the China route and I ordered Bo Loongs. First timer. Utter fail. Like- the food is in the trash.\nThe noodles were... just.. wow. Can't even discuss. Pot stickers as well... yikes.\nI will not continue because I think I need to take the trash to the dumpster.\nAs for my dear friend... she's on food decision probation. JS.
