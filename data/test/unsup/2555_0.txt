Inspired cooking in Vegas remains the exception, not the rule.   So lets just acknowledge that Todd English's Olive stands out in Vegas.  Yes tucked away in Bellagio's mini-mall-GASP.....but also a spacious patio that sits on top of the stunning dancing water fountain Duhhhhh....  Who wouldn't  want to enjoy life here.  For food lovers and cocktail goers this is for you.  Mediterranean cuisine that is skinny jean approved.  Best Negroni served at the bar.
