We travel to Arizona 3 times a year to visit family and Nosh Cafe is always a stop we have to make! These are the most flavorful, fresh and tastiest bagels we've ever had! The lattes and freshly squeezed orange juice are such a perfect pairing to our savory breakfast sandwiches! The service is great and we're always so pleased with our stop en route back to California! Can't wait to be back in March!!!
