I love this place.you walk on in and see you can go in a buffet or a fancy room or a little diner and the food is great and for a good price. Then once you are done you get to have the best desert of you ever had in your life.  You get to gamble at the end of the day and have some fun at the museum and the gift shop. So one day i would like you to go there.
