I had the worst rice bowl I've had in any sorts of Asian restaurants. I had prawn, chicken and beef rice bowl and it was the shittest ever. 2 pieces of cucumber and little shred of carrot was all veggie I got. Other places I've been, I had really good amount of veggies and meat. The prawns I had here were teeny tiny and meat was dry. My friend and I were VERY disappointed and my friend who suggested to go here even apologized to me. Maybe their sandwiches are okay but rice bowls were total waste of money.
