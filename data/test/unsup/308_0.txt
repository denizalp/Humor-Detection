I met with four clients here for Bfast. We met around 7:00 and they were already open and quite busy. I heart the free Wifi offered and parking was convenient.\n\nMy order the Cabo Bfast burrito - four eggs, chorizo, green chilies, onions, tomatoes and and cilantro stuffed into a flour tortilla. My side of choice was the potatoes and was garnished with sour cream and a slice of pineapple.\n\nOverall service was good and considering how busy they were, the staff performed flawlessly. I would absolutely recommend this location for a business meeting or personal meal.
