I really loved the exhibits at the royal Ontario museum. There are interesting exhibits from all over the world, from many different eras. I loved the cast collection of dinosaur skeletons and the bat cave exhibits. What I enjoyed the most was the whale skeleton exhibit. I support the museums message to conserve and protect the wildlife and the environment.
