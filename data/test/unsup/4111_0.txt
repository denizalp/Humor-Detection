The Butler's Pantry is nothing fancy, but it sure is cheap, tasty, and reliable. You can get an entire meal with a drink for about $15! It's a great place to go if you're not feeling up to making dinner, but are trying to curb your spending.\n\nMy personal favorites are the curried vegetable pie and the zucchini pancakes. Their salad dressing is pretty decent as well. They only have one location these days, but it's never too busy so the service is always great.
