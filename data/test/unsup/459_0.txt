Spencer's has changed. I wouldn't let anyone younger than a teenager in here now, with the whole wall of sex toys and lingerie available for sale. As well, lots of drug and booze references that younger ones will hopefully not understand.\n\nBut for the older teenagers and the young adults? Yep, it's all cool.\n\nLooking for gag gifts? How about black light posters? Or T-shirts with snark on them? Beer funnels and shot glasses and beer helmets. Yep, it's here. Also some of the things you might expect for a head shop.
