Why 3 stars? Because I didn't understand the Peameal Bacon.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI was very excited to try something I'd never had before, but ended up pretty underwhelmed. It basically just tasted like a dry pork chop sandwich. Maybe it's a nature vs. nurture situation -Â had I grown up eating Pemeal Bacon sandwiches with my Grandpap, things maybe would have been different for me. But without any sentimental attachment, and a purely objective viewpoint, the Peameal Bacon sandwich is what 3-stars were made for.
