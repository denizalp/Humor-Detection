I almost hesitate to write this because I don't want Eddy's to be overrun next year when I come back, but alas, my duty is to inform you fellow yelpers and give credit where credit is due. This is the absolute best place for apple picking! Forget Patterson's- its always overrun and crowded.  Eddy's is your close by, less commercial alternative with expansive open orchards.  \n\nWe had the best time here and picked some delicious apples.  I can't wait til fall rolls around again to come back!
