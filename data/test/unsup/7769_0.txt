Fam, this shit gets the job done. Not a lot of variety for a Chinese buffet, but what they do have is on point.  Favorites are General Tso's and sweet and sour chicken.  The veggies are really good. Their fruit game is not always on point and their soup's are weak as fuck.  But for 8 bucks the lunch and 9 the dinner, this joint the real deal.
