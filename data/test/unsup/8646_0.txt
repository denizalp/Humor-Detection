Most of the times I have been here have been on weekdays. However, when I was first introduced to this place, I was told that it was a cool pregame hangout on weekends. To my disappointment this place is dead on weekends.I guess it used to be but not anymore. It's better if you come with your own crowd. Now, the wine & food are great. Good wine selection...and my favorite dish, the Press signature sushi roll. A must have! Overall, a nice little wine bar.
