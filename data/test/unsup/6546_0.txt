Never had anything bad here. All the food is very good, however I will never return. My husband kids & I went on a Friday about 11am & I guess they were having their fish fry Friday & we litteraly waited for over an hour for our food. No one apologized for the wait or anything, pretty rude if u ask me. Plus there's a werido waitress here who's totaly on something & for some reason I'm always in her station!
