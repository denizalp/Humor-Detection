Great locals casino! \n\nIt's a beautiful property with lots to offer like great restaurants, a movie theater, bowling, pools, nightclub, gaming & very comfortable rooms. It's located in the heart of Summerlin and there's lots to do outside of it as well. \n\nIf you're staying on property there's a shuttle that'll take you to the airport and strip which is a great perk! The grounds are beautiful and they also have a great spa. I'm a big fan of this resort and casino!
