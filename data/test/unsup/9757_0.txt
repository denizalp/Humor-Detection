The best 2 hour massage I had  in Vegas. Chai was very thorough and used a variety of techniques, deep tissue, thai and hot stone massages. He listened and concentrated on my problem areas ( lower back and calves). The individual rooms are clean and the staff were accommodating. Just make sure to book your appointment. I shall definitely go back to this establishment when i am in vegas.
