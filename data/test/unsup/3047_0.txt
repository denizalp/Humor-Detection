30 minute wait at 5:30 pm even though about 15 tables were empty and we told them we has 7:00 tickets to Jersey Boys (a dinner\/theater package).  Extremely slow getting waiter to take our order and long wait for food (told him we has tickets for the show.  Had to take dessert in takeout box at 6:50. Very noisy and okay food.
