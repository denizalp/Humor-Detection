I love it when tech companies make continuous efforts to improve the user experience, and TÃ©o has done exactly that since my first ride in June. There is now Wi-Fi, a headrest-mounted tablet, and a charging port on vehicles which is like wow, thank you for being so considerate. I also had the chance of getting a Tesla once and I appreciated the water bottles and fine chocolate, complimentary of the ride. So I hope you enjoyed reading this review half as much as I enjoyed the ride, because I had a ball.
