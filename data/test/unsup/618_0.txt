Dammit all! All was fine these past few weeks...But then they did it again (I swear to Buddah its the same woman every time fluffin' up my order)! No s-n-l at all in my iced coffee this morning *pukeage* \n\nI had to pick some packets up on campus, my little detour to the cafeteria cost me study time, I wasn't a happy camper!
