I bought 2 of the fish and chip meals for my sons. They were ok, but not good.\n\nI  asked them for 2 ice waters to go with the meals. They told me there would be a charge for that. If you are charging paying customers for water in Arizona, in summer, and think you will get repeat business You are very much mistaken.
