We came to stay at sams town. Brought my wife and daughter. The breakfast buffet is so bomb. The reviews arent the best, but people expect too much. This buffet is bomb. Even if we didnt have the free voucher the price rang up at like $22 which for 3 of us would of still been a great price. Yes theres no crab or lobster but its breakfast come on people
