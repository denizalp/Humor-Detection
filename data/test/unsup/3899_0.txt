I just love this place!! the food is great and the service is amazing. ever since the first time i went in there i have never had a bad experience!! the last time i went in there i was a little confused on what i wanted to order and the server helped me choose the best meal and  i was happy with it!! this place is near my job so when ever i have time i just take a break to have breakfast there!!\nI recommend this place to all breakfast lovers!!
