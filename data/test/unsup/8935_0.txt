It's your basic. The food is what's be expected of American-style Chinese food: saucy, salty, and flavorful but unoriginal.  Empress court serves crispy vegetables with watercress and sticky rice-based dishes best.  My meal was neither over nor underwhelming, but rather just as predicted.  If one is looking for standard Chinese food, Empress Court delivers, but do not expect anything out of the ordinary.
