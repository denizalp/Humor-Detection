The only reason I am not giving them ONE star is because our waiter provided excellent service. The place has an unpleasant fish aroma...\nthe swordfish was good compared to the over cooked and bland Ono fish I ordered. \n\nour tuna appetizer took 20 minutes to finally get to our table but at least our waiter offered us bread while we waited. \n\nThe best thing about this restaurant was the YELP offer ( $1 for your first drink if you check in on Yelp)
