Ok, I've been coming here for a couple of years now, always getting a different stylist because like everything else in Vegas, they come & go & you end of spending WAY more than you expected.   Well this time I tried to do it myself & instead of looking like Katie Holmes or Posh Spice, I now resemble Lord Farquaad....guess I'll make an appointment.
