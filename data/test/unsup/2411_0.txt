I came three days in a row. Their Hawaiian BBQ Chicken plate is standard in terms of quality but quite the bargain for the price. The BBQ Chicken Musubi is really good. The Shrimp Garlic Noodle has enough garlic to kill a Las Vegas vampire. A vampire in this context is a hooker. The BBQ Salmon is a really good dish too. I will become a regular to support this small business owner and to see the cute island girls.
