The good: excellent choice of colors. \n\nThe bad: I was waiting 15 min after my appt. I only get a cut down on my fingernails, and my right hand was a lot shorter than my left. And all my nails were uneven. My thumbs looked like Bobby Brown's haircut circa late 80's. I'm annoyed. I won't be going back.
