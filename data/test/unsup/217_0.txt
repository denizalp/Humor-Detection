Went there yesterday, I already knew the place on Mont-Royal, and it is the same. Same menu, decor and service. Nice menu I really enjoy their eggs Benedictine, especially the chorizo and the spinach\/goat cheese, but if you like big brunch the\"bon ben j'me la prend toute\" is made for you. Everything is good, go over there for a nice brunch :)
