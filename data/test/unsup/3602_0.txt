Ordered potato rolls, shrimp scampi, and chopped salad. Let's just say, my mom and I had plenty of leftovers! So much delicious food! The service was beyond excellent, and I enjoyed the romantic darkened lighting, and it was enjoyable to be able to watch the gambling through the wide open entrance. Definitely will come here again, when I'm back in town! Oh, and killer Arnold Palmer! Yum!
