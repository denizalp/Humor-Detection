Look, I admit it that I too thought it was a little strange to back up to a random lady tush-first and ask her to jiggle on the belt loops of my Arizona jeans and have her call me \"A HUSKY BOY\" but my mom was out of town and she won't give me her login and password for her amazon account so here we are. Your security was very professional in removing me without touching me and who knows, I feel like we all became closer friends that day.
