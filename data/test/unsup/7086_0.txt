The place feels like a really nice 100 yen store in Japan.  Prices weren't bad for the stuff.  Just look at it like an import fee.\n\nPicked up a few things we needed for the kitchen like a sesame seed grinder and long chopsticks for cooking.  It was fun walking around having a laugh over the anime\/manga\/otaku stuff they had.
