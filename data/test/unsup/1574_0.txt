I had a small dent on my bumper irritating to look at. I finally found the time out of my busy schedule to go searching for an auto body shop that'd fix my car up quickly. Every shop I visited had a wait time I couldn't believe and an unreasonable price. When I drove into Tom's shop, the family welcomed my car and welcomed me. They fixed my car within an hour at an affordable price. Tom, Ron, and Art are the guys I recommend you go see for all your repair needs..
