Where do I start. The young ladies that sat us were really nice and beautiful young ladies. The wait staff was very knowledgable about the menu and giving suggestions which was super helpful. The waiter we had checked on us and I never felt forgotten. I try to always hit a steakhouse in Vegas and this one I'll return to.
