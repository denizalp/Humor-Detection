Sonic, oh Sonic, why are you the devil? \n\nI love your cherry limeaid and the inconsistent way you deliver it to tease me. Sometimes I get more cherry sometimes it's more lime. \n\nIt's a surprise to see if you gave me that perfect maraschino cherry or that slice of lime in the bottom. Even if you don't, the next time, I may get two.\n\nIt's all perfection and I crave you. Everyday, I try and avoid you but that cherry limeaid keeps bringing me back in.
