We celebrated my wife's birthday with 16 other friends.  The food and drink was good and the wait staff was attentive but they over-charged us $800 on our hotel folio despite having signed a receipt at the restaurant that accurate.\n\nThe worst part of it all is that they are fighting us and American Express over these over charges.  We won't go back here or to Caesar's again...it's a real shame.
