This is a nice sub shop. It's on the East side of 35th Ave, just next to Rolandos. Good food, decent prices. I've got to say the right-wing stickers are kind of stupid, and are probably going to piss off a few potential customers. I say this as a middle of the road, conservative leaning type. I mean, what's the Republican party done for Arizona except turn it into the laughing stock of the country? Anyway, the hours are 10 or 11am to 9 on weekdays.
