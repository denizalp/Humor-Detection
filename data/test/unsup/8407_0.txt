Two things in life are hard to find. A good man and a good hair stylst. I found one at Norterra Salon! :-) Tamie did a fantastic job on my hair. They were able to accommodate an appointment the same day as I had a very important job interview the next day and needed a fresh look. Thank you Tamie! I will be seeing you again!
