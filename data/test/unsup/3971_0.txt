First, full disclosure, I am not a vegan and second I don't understand why all the tofu and fake meat. As a non-vegan, if i go to a place like this, I'm here for something different and the vegan experience not for meat substitutes. If one is vegan, why would one want to eat fake meat. That's like eating a vegetarian hot dog, why eat an imitation anything.  Anyway, back to green earth. The food was only OK and laced with too much tofu as a substitute for meat.  I wouldn't go back...
