This place is awesome. Discovered this location shortly after I moved here. All you can eat Korean BBQ. Friendly staff every time I come here. Their may be a wait at times, but overall not too bad. The place is very clean at all times and has a modern style environment unlike other Korean bbq places. Check it out!
