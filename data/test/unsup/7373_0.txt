Don't trust these guys.   I had my mother-in-law drop off my car while out of town.  They must have seen dollar signs with an older lady who obviously doesn't know about cars.\n\nGave us a ridiculous quote on a simple solution.  Then tried charging us 175$ just to diagnose the issue. Ended up paying $100 after a debate.  Should''t have had to pay a dime.\n\nIssue was a fuse.\n\nPretty sad.  Any mechanic with some integrity could do well in this city, too many con artists out here.
