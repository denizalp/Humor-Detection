It was delicious!  Excellent service and a great wine selection. The oysters were amazing!!!  They have a one of a kind bar too. Only con for me- I would've liked some steak and seafood combos without having to get two whole separate entrees, like steam topped with lobster- but that wasn't an option when we went.
