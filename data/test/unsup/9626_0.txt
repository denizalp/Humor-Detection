We were so hungry after I arrived at the Venetian. After checking in, we went looking for places to eat. We didn't have much time as we had to catch our show at TI later. The Grand Lux looked grand, so we went right in. I took the server's suggestion and got chicken pasta with mushrooms - it was good! Wifey got fish and chips which didn't have much kick to it. We went on another day late night and got a dessert. A little pricey but got variety of food.
