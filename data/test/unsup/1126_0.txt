Ambience (indoors) was really nice and the service was great.\n\nAs for the food.. I had the short ribs and frites.  The meat was succulent and fell right off the bone.. pretty good flavor as well.  The accompaniments were just weird though.  Firstly, the fries were arguably the worst I've ever been served.  Just a wilty luke-warm mess.  They were also covered in some sort of green semi-fried garnish that just did nottt suit the dish.  My date had the chickpea veggieburger and salad and she seemed content, albeit not glowing with praise.  2.5\/5
