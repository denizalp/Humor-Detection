I am saddened.  I purposefully stopped in to grab food from the deli and bakery for lunch yesterday and there were no menus posted, no prices and not an ounce of ready-to-go food aside from baklava.  It was 12:30pm.  What the heck?  I decided to wander over to the bulk food section and as I was browsing, I saw a moth flying around in one of the nut containers.  Gross.  That has turned me off enough that I'll never darken the doors again.
