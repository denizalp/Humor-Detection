WTF?!?! I haven't reviewed this yet?!?!\n Well, let's get this done. I'm not going to get all wordsy or long winded here....\n    If you love ethnic European food i.e. Schnitzel or Paprikash then you NEED to try Das Schnitzel Haus !! Period. The end.\n   No, seriously, what the hell are you waiting for? This has got to be the best Schnitzel in CLE. Hands down! This time I had the Jeagar Schnitzel and the wife had Veal Paprikash. Both were AMAZING!!!! \n    If you don't try this place, too bad. You've been told what you're missing.
