I recently got my eyes checked by Dr. Perrino (sp?) at Per Spectacles and I thought he did a fabulous job.  He took the time to listen to my concerns, and I felt he was very knowledgeable about what he was doing.  \n\nI purchased my glasses here as well.  Not sure if David and I meshed.. His style is not for everybody.  But I got a nice pair of glasses and I'm very happy.  My husband got a great pair as well.
