My family and I are always hunting around town looking for good spots to eating in hopes of finding that diamond in the rough. Let me tell you we didn't find much here, the ambiance was  cold in feeling and an eye sore, it was a clash of better homes\/home and garden meets  Santa Fe living room... nothing to do with good Mexican food. Anyways.... To the point... The food was just ok. Nothing I haven't
