Nacho Daddy gets a well deserved 4-stars. Some reviews comment in higher than average pricing. I respect this point but counterpoint the quality of food is above average.\n\nCase in point: people in my party ordered different plates that contained what appeared to be similar pulled pork. But each plate was true to their descriptions and had distinctly different taste.\n\nThis is worth a stop if you're walking the strip and want good Mexican eats.
