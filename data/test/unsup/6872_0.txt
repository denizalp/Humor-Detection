They give you a good bit of food I guess but the taste is mediocre at best. The food taste like it had been sitting out and then warmed up in the microwave when I ordered. I had bold honey BBQ wings and jalape√±o poppers.  My friend had fish and shrimp she says hers were good but she says that about everything LoL.
