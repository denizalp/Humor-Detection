This place it the BEST.  They are very flexible, and their office team is more like a family not only to each other, but to their patients as well. \n\nI have my whole family going to Paul and AnnaLee and once my toddler needs to start going to the dentist, I'll have her go there too.\n\nDefinitely one of the best offices I've ever came in contact with and I've had my share of greedy-money-grabber dentist in the past!\n\nI'm sticking with KRUYER DENTAL   :)
