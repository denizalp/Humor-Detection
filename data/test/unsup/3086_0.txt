My kids are 2 and 4 and I took them both to Kids First Pediatric for their first dentist appointment. I was so nervous because I didn't know how they were going to do at the denist and predicted screaming. To my surprise they did amazing! They even got my4 year old to sit for X-Rays and through the teeth cleaning. We saw Dr. Travis, but I heard both doctors are great. I highly recommend this office and I am so glad that a friend recommended them to me!
