We only went here on our anniversary every few years because it is pricey. However, the food is spectacular. You may not know exactly what you are ordering, but don't worry, it will be incredible. The owner is also committed to supporting local farmers and suppliers and what he does with the menu is divine. The portions are small and gourmet works of art, but this is fine dining at its finest and your mouth will be very happy. Savor each bite.
