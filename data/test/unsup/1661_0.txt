The worst massage I've ever received in my life. The lady who didn't give me her name was basically \"lotion\"me instead of massaging me. It did not appear she had any type of training in this profession. She also demanded $10 for her tips in the end like other yelper mentioned. I typically tip $15 if they are decent, but she didnt deserve even $8. The 60 minutes were so dreadful. I DO NOT recommend. My friend didn't care for hers masseuse either.
