I was dancing with a girl and this chubby big guy is barging his way through the aisle and nearly shoved my partner pretty hard, so I instinctively block him off and counter-push his weight off. He turns around and I realize he works here, with his staff polo shirt. At this point hes yelling in my face asking if I want to get kicked out of the club for shoving... Wow.
