Summer Palace is my latest go to Chinese Massage place. \nIt's clean, quiet and not as busy as some of the other places. \nThey also have old school Chinese pop music! Think 90s Chinese karaoke. :)\n\nAll of the therapists are good and offer deep pressure, but I prefer Amy. \n\nI would recommend this foot spa. \nCall first to make sure there's no wait.
