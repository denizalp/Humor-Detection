**No rice paper**\nWe love coming here because it's closer than Korea town, they have all their appetizers included in their AYCE price and the meats are pretty good, so it's very worth the price. But the last few times we've gone here, they have told us they \"don't have RICE PAPER today\" and this has been the case for the last 2 visits. It's an off menu item but we absolutely love the rice paper and I'm afraid they no longer serve it. Someone please let me know if anyone's come more reverent and have had it!
