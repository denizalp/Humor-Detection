I came here to watch Date Night last week and had a craving for some Sour Strawberry Belts. As I was filling up my bag, I could tell that they were old because they were hard. When I went up to pay, I made a comment to the cashier about the candy being old and hard. He just ignored me and said, \"that will be $7.20.\" I figure he probably hates his job so I left it at that.
