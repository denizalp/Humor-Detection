Everything was good , I love the build your own pizza concept for one price.  Put anything thats available on it.  Fast, inexpensive night out with the kids eating what we love PIZZA. \nThe downside is they had these little annoying flies everywhere.  GrOSS! \nThe staff is nice, a lot of young ppl working.  Chase was the team member that was on the floor tonight and he was pleasant.
