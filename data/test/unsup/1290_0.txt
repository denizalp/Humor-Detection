Definitely in the top 3 for best Hawaiian restaurant here in Las Vegas. If you're looking for authentic Hawaiian food, then this is your spot. The prices are unbeatable and the portions are huuuge. I never leave this place unsatisfied. The staff are always super nice. Sometimes they can be a little slow especially during lunch rush but its definitely worth the wait.
