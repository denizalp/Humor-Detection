I went to Erika for a shellac manicure on the recommendation of my sister. After enduring the crappiest of all manicures at several places around town, I can say I feel saved! Erika is very skilled and thorough, and friendly. Not once did I have to wait for a personal phone call, a co-worker yakk session, or any other shenanigans.  I will definitely go back to Envy. \n\nThe 4-star review is in reference to the receptionist, who could stand to be a little more friendly.  But overall, I am quite happy and my nails look fancy!
