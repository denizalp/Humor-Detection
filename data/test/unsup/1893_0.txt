Scott and his coworker were amazing!  My car looks so beautiful :)   I haven't seen it look this good since the day I bought it and I actually think it looks better than that day.  My car was filthy ... and they made it look so sparkly.  He's very professional and friendly.  I would recommend him in a heart beat.  Engine \/ Leather \/ Radio ... everything looked great.  Amazing Job!!!!
