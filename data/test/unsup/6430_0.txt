Nostalgia.  They do some big cuts of prime rib here!  22 ounces of Alberta beef goodness.  We ended up sharing a plate of it, the second person pays $8.95 for access to the salad \/ soup bar.  Pretty good value.\n\nI really like the ambiance indoors - feels medieval.  Eating steak out on the patio was chilly, but we didn't have a reservation on a Saturday evening so that's where we got seated.
