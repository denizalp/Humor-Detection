I wanted to do a lion clip on my Blizzard a toy American Eskimo Dog  She was matted and she would not let me brush her and it was summer.  What I immediately liked about this place -KNOWLEDEGABLE!  She knew that Eskimos don't grow back as nice and warned against it.  I assured her we don't do it often but it was time.  She looks SO CUTE that I did my larger Eskimo the next week. They know dogs and do CUTE CUTS!
