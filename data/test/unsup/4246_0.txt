I always feel good about myself when I am purchasing products similar to what Mad Mexican offers:\n\n- prepared in Canada\n- ingredients locally sourced\n- All Natural with no Preservatives\n- Handmade\n\nAnd if you have special dietary requirments, you should know that all their products are Gluten Free\n\nTheir Salsa Verde is one of the better ones I had in Toronto as it has a strong taste of cilantro... which I love. \n\nYou can found their products in most of the better food stores in the GTA area like Pusateri's and McEwan!\n\nCan I just served it and pretend I made it? :)
