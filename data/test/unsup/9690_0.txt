What's not to love about the airport that's 20 minutes away from the Las Vegas Strip? You can gamble as soon as you get off your flight OR take a taxi straight to the casinos. \n\nWhile the Strip may have all the glamor in LV, the airport, among other airports, can hold it's own. Kind of big but not too big you're fearing you're going to get lost. \n\nGift shops are top notch and another reason for you to leave whatever money you have left in Vegas.
