Menchies offers up a rotation of 10 or so flavors and a massive array of toppings allowing you to craft that perfect frozen yogurt. The style of Menchies is more akin to traditional frozen yogurt than to that of the modern Pinkberry and Red Mango. I had the Irish mint twisted with dark chocolate froyo and topped it off with Andes mints, mochi, and a dab of caramel. Healthy? No but definitely delicious. With a wide variety of flavors and toppings, I'd definitely recommend Menchies for that froyo fix.
