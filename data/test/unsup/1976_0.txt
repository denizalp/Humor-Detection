The only pro was that this is way better than studio movie grill but nowhere close to ipic. I'm so glad we had a gift card because I would've been pissed if we were spending our own money. \nCons:\n1. The seat I was in had tears which made it totally uncomfortable in my shorts. \n2. They were out of the espresso mix\n3. It took 30 minutes to get an iced tea, water and popcorn\n4. The servers are not very well versed in customer service\n\nOnly way I'm going back is if we have a gift card again.
