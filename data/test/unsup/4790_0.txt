First time trying this place today almost looks like one of those hole in the wall places from the outside but going inside its nice, me and the wife ordered the mozerella tomato basil sandwich....sooo good the bread is amazing the sandwich is so simple but works so well together. Definitely recommend this to who haven't tried it.
