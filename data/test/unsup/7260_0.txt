Highly recommend!!! I was introduced to Sovereign a couple weeks ago for brunch and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. I had the breakfast bowl and a latte, then they made us a French toast with strawberries (I'm not doing it justice, it had a fancy glaze, etc). Service was great and it's worth the drive for me to go again!
