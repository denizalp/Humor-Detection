The worst stripe club i ever been to. They make promises that they can't keep. You pay more then they tell you.\n\nThe two drinks they give at the club and you have to pay for is one regular drink and one shot. They forget to tell you at the door when you pay.\n\nI would not recommend this club to my worst enemy.
