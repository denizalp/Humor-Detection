This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, very authentic food, large portions, good price, excellent service. The important facts: white queso is very good, chips always come out hot and fresh, they have a \"soupy\" salsa that is good with not a lot of heat, they also have a shredded cabbage salsa that is more \"chunky.\" Highly recommend this place to anyone who wants some authentic Mexican food in Charlotte.
