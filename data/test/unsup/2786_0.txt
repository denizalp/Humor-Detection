Definitely have to submit a review for this place because it's new, and would suggest you try it out in a couple months so they get the hang of their product and service offering, and staff are fully trained on serving the food and prepping drinks etc. The flavours are not bad but because the price is a bit expensive I don't really think it was worth it. The experience was sub par.
