After reading all these rave reviews, I decided to give Parlour a shot a few months ago. \nI have long, very thick\/ wavy hair so I decided on Courtney. The cut was good, not spectacular. The student discount was great. Overall the whole experience was a little underwhelming. I mean, I left happy, and my hair grew out well but it was by no means the best cut I've ever received. One big meh.
