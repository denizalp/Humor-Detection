I order via post mates however this review is completely for Griddle cakes. My first time ordering and I'm it sure if I'll order again.I ordered the Philly skillet, which I was excited about.  However all I got was scrambled eggs with shredded steak and cheese. Completely disappointed. I'm pregnant and hungry and wanted my potatoes!
