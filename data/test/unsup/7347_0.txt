We went here for our second time today, and as always it was great! We did the restaurant week special, but our friends ordered the ribeye! She asked for more of a chuck cut instead of the sirloin, and we were pleasantly surprised that the head chef came out with 3 ribeyes and let her choose! What amazing service!!! Thanks for making my husband's birthday dinner so delicious with such friendly service!
