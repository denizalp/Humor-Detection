\"Shots shots shots shots shots shots\nShots shots shots shots shots\nShots shots shots shots shots\nEverybody!\"\n\nWe came here for a girls date night and enjoyed really really yummy food (3.5\/4 star Yelp quality because this is Montreal and it's really really competitive to get a 5) but our waiter kept stopping at our table to hand out drinks! That's never happened to me in Montreal before, so yes! a big 5 for great service! \n\nI will definitely be back!
