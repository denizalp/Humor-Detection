DSW's clearance rack is pretty much what I envision heaven as being if it exists.  I can not tell you the way my heart leaps when I see a disgustingly ugly pair of shoes (my favorite kind) with that purple 70% off tag on it.  Sometimes I think I might cry.\n\nSeriously, their usual selection is great - If you can't find something for you at DSW you don't have feet - but for the frugal shoe-lady in me their clearance department can't be beat.
