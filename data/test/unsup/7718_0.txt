I don't venture into Manulife Centre much.... I might go to Bay Bloor Radio... I might go to Indigo... but on this rainy day I ventured inside and I found\n\nPeople were walking their small dogs around Manulife Centre, apparently dogs on leash are welcome.\n\nPlease don't let my dog knows about Manulife Centre, if not I might not able to leave him at home. Or maybe he can run away and find a new family that would take him shopping in Yorkville!
