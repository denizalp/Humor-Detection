Seriously! Bed bugs woke me up at midnight! Caught 5 of those little bastards.\nThe hotel had someone drop us off keys to a new room. Didn't bother to send a bellman to help with the luggage and offered us a free breakfast buffet. They said they had to have someone come in to verify the bugs before they could do anything else! Ugh! And they put us a few doors down! Not happy at 1:00am!
