Went in to satisfy my curry craving. And the staff there was really nice to me. I got it to go and when I got home I couldn't believe how good it was. Once I finished I ended up wanting more because it was so good! Second time I went, I dined in and it was  a LOT! Almost felt like I was going into a food coma. I love the pork and the hottest curry they got. Its a great place and the food is super good definitely a must for all the curry lovers.
