Amazing Paella. We ordered it with shrimp, scallops, and lobster. One of the yummiest dishes I've ever had (I felt bad for the lobster though; it waved at me on its way to the kitchen). \nThe service is fast and the staff are very friendly.\nThe place is small and cozy, you can barely notice it walking down the street, but is worth a visit.\nWill definitely return if I can.
