This is the sister restaurant to Butters and every bit as good. The problem is that it's so good, the wait is usually a minimum of thirty minutes so don't be in a rush. This is a no fluff straight forward breakfast, but they do it right. \n\nI love the eggs Benedict and just a straight up eggs, bacon and potato combo. Fresh OJ is a must. They are best known for pancakes and waffles but I don't like sweets, so I can't comment. My kids love them though.
