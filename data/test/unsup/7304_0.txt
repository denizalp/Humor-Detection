I'm a fan of Nobu.\n\nBeen here twice this year at this particular location.\n\nYes it's on the pricey side but if you're in LV chances are you're here to celebrate something.\n\nSo dress up, splurge on an amazing dinner here and dream of the next time you'll be dinner at a Nobu location in the future.
