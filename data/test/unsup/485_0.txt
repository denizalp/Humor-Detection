This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. I was on a huge chicken fried rice kick for a while and I ordered from a bunch of Chinese places, and this one was the best. Plus the delivery was pretty quick and I live in Centennial hills. I ordered from other places that were closer and it took longer and their food wasn't that great, so China hot wok is my go-to! I usually pick up some food before class during the week! I love it here! Enjoy!
