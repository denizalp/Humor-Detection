I had been wanting to try out Mario's BBQ for awhile but never got a chance till now. \n\nI walked in on a Tuesday around 1 pm. \n\nI stood there for 5 minute, looked around and the grill was cold and no one was at the counter to sell me any food.\n\nBut I was kind of glad as the chicken on the grill looked sad.\n\nI just left and went somewhere else for lunch.
