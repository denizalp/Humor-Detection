What a disappointment. I haven't ever been here before. Set up an account thru yelp and an appointment thru that account...when I went in for my appointment the place was completely empty, the gal at the desk told me that I was not showing up on the system and she had no openings to fit me in. She offered to call other locations that were not nearby. I left from there and went to Sunshine Nails and Wax on Higley and Southern...a friend recommendation. They were very busy but, gladly fit me in and did a great job.
