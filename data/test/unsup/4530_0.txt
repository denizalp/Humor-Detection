Popped in here for a late night snack the other night.  It was a lot smaller inside was my first reaction, but not overly crowded so that's fine.  The patio however looks to be a great spot on a cool night.\n\nThe corn dip left a little to be desired and the bruschetta wasn't what I would consider typical in presentation or taste.  Left me with a big ol' plate of MEH.  \n\nThe pizza (Supreme) came out and they were instantly redeemed!  Great pizza and that alone will have me coming back.
