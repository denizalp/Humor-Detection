Where else can you walk around drunk and play slot machines or get a lap dance in between flights.\n\nOnly in Vegas, baby. \nOnly in Vegas.\n\nJK about the lap dance (What. Did you forget kids fly too?)\n_______________\n[TIP] : Hurting your wallet doesn't just stop at the casinos, spas, or hotels, ..NOOooo it's ALL of Vegas, so that includes airports. Wouldn't be the epitome of Vegas if it wasn't. Shuttle to the Palazzo- $12... Cab to the Palazzo- $18... slice of sbarro- $6... 6\" Subway sub- $7 (that's a $14 footlong --gutDAMN!!)
