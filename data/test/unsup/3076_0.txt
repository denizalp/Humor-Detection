$40. $40!! \n\nOne large pizza with two toppings, a small cheese. and eight of the smallest wings I have ever seen in my life. Seriously, neighborhood lizards are missing their arms. That's WAAAAAAAY too much to charge.\n\nThe large pizza was cut all funky so we ended up with four huge slices and four baby slices. The cheese placement was jacked up too... half of the pizza had a 2\" crust and the other side had a 1\" crust. It was weird.\n\nWe will not be ordering from them again. What a waste of money!!!
