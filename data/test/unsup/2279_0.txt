Well it's pretty much the late night drive thru must grab for the Phoeniz area.. Is it good Mexican food? hmmm.. Will you get the mud Butt the next morning..Probably.. However if you are drunk and it is past midnight in Phoenix you must grab a burrito, Nachos, Carne asada fries everything you get for $10.. eat it and then pass out.. If you are sober I would probably pass.
