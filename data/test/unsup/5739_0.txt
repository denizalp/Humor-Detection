I called Bob at 9 am and by 9:30 he was in my house.  I had a toilet leaking, an issue I've had with another toilet in the house.  He quickly assessed and repaired the problem for a VERY reasonable price.  As I mentioned, I've had the exact same problem with another toilet, and I had used a different plumbing company to repair it.  Bob charged over $50 less and did a better job on the repair.  I will not be using any plumber but Bob in the future.  He is experienced and knows what he's doing.
