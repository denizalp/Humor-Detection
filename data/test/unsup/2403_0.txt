I DON\"T UNDERSTAND WHAT EVERYONE IS REVIEWING.\n\nThis is the equivalent to average pizza place food.\n\nMaybe the garlic bread was decent and someone else wrote favorably about the crazy alfredo -- But if you're in the mood for chicken parmigiana or eggplant parmigiana -- You will be wildly disappointed.\n\nChicken Parm - BLAND, FLAVORLESS CHICKEN, FLAVORLESS SAUCE\/GRAVY, FAKE CHEESE (Not real mozzarella)\n\nEggplant Parm - TOTAL MUSH and hardly any flavor in sauce either, FAKE CHEESE\n\nDo I really have to spend $$$$ to get decent Italian in Vegas??!!\n\n:(
