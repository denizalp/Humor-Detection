I appreciate the Science Center being here. I really do. \n\nHowever, it could be and should be so much more. Everything is broken, run down, and just plain boring. I think that maybe, just MAYBE, they should have commisioned actual scientists when designing\/setting up this place. There is a dire need for updating and tweaking -- I'm sorry to say that it is a sad excuse for a \"science\" center. \n\nThe IMAX is pretty cool though.
