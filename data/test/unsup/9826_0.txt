I like it. Don't judge me. Nice outdoor area and spacious indoor area.\n\nFound it randomly when I had just arrived in Vegas (and the Wynn was still a new property). Comfort rules over style for the actual trek to this city, so I was in Chucks and a t-shirt. They let me in regardless. \n\nMade me feel like a celebrity being under-dressed at a Vegas lounge at what was *the* hotel at the time.\n\n...then Hulk Hogan walked in. No, really.
