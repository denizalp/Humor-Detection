Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad place. I was just surprised to get there and find a regular greasy diner. It got so much praise here on yelp that I felt this had to be a place to stop while visiting Cleveland. \nIt's a small cute place. The menu has the same stables you would get at any diner. Omelette was good but my potatoes were too salty to eat.
