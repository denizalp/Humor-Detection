Went back to Ferris for Valentine's Day dinner. As usual, the service was great and my steak was flavorful and delicious. \n\nEven though it was a very busy night, being Valentine's Day, neither the service or the food suffered. Also, the piano music in the dining room is at a great sound level and not too loud.
