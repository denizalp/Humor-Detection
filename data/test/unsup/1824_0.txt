What kind of business does NOT answer the phone????? I've been calling so many times. :(\n\nP\/s be careful to do the service in this place. If you wrote a bad review, they give you a Sh*t. The rudest, unprofessional service that I've ever had. Refund $30 which is voucher $89 without give me any option for exchange. (I understood that voucher is no refund but exchange) \nDon't waste your $$$ even it's cheap here. I learned a lesson.
