Challenging location\n\n\nNot the best location\n\nThis location always seems to be short of staff.  I waited in the drive through line for over twenty-five minutes and going inside is no better. \n\nThis location lacks the proper amount of staff to accommodate all its customers. This a constant problem with this location. They either need to hire more staff or close this location.  In addition,  the customer service is always lacking.
