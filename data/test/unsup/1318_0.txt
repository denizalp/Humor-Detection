I have been so happy with all the Doctors @ the Surprise location and they are very professional and knows just what you need. I have had several knee surgeries which throws my back out of alignment but no matter how much pain I'm in, they are always helping me heal step but step even telling me what to do at home. I did have several migraine headaches but no longer since they do adjustments on my neck.  Please, be kind to yourself and go to THE JOINT TODAY!!!\nDee M,
