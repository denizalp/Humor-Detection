This is a scenic stretch of water in the metropolitan area - something I wish we had more of in this desert region. Even if you aren't into rowing or sailing, the Town Lake is a great place for biking, jogging, or bicycling because of the concrete paths on both the north shore and the south shore of the lake.  You can also have a picnic here, or just sit down and enjoy the breeze. The lake shore areas also provide a venue for numerous cultural and other community events throughout the year.
