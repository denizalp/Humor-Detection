I shuttered when I saw the name. Vegan business traveling is challenging, especially when you have to get up super early every morning and the only quick breakfast option is The Buttery. I had vouchers for pre-fixe continental meals none of which were veg friendly. Luckily, the restaurant honored the vouchers while allowing me to build my own vegan-friendly breakfast: Home fries, fresh fruit, toast with jam and a bottomless cup of black coffee. Service is curt and professional--the waitress quickly attending business travelers while also lingering over long time regulars.
