Food was absolutely amazing. First time here, I ordered the snitzel combo which was one of the specials for today and got a liter mug of beer. I'm not usually a beer drinking but I loved the beer! The live band was pretty amazing as well. Overall the atmosphere, the band, the service was great! I will definitely be coming back again!
