Got in right at 12 for lunch so I expected fresh and fast but they had no chicken made, I had to wait 9 minutes for mild or 6 minutes for spicy. Luckily I had a little extra time for my  lunch break so I waited. The food was yummy once I got it. Staff was nice and the establishment was clean.\nI like Popeyes so I will probably return to this location.
