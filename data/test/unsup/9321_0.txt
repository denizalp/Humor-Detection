I must say, my experience with North Italia (Scottsdale) has always been impeccable...down to the servicing staff and just the all-around customer service is top-notch.  \n\nEveryone says \"You go there all the time\" then I take them and then it's \"When are we going to North again\"!\n\nYes, I can have salad, pizza, and a drink anywhere else but WHY? \n\nThis place is by far my go-to when I have a gather with friends, entertain family or just a date night with the hubby!\n\nPlease continue the great work of making my experience an exceptional one each and every time!
