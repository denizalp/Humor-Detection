I didn't have enough time...\n\nI wandered into Shelf Life Books too close to closing time. As I browsed the shelves, I quickly discovered that I was a special independent bookstore and felt a certainly literary nirvana that I had last experienced at Powell's Books in Portland. The selection was thoughtfully curated and was strong with the Canadian Author force. Around every corner was a new thought-provoking discovery and a desire to linger and explore further. Then it was time to go....\n\n.....I'll be back.
