Delicious Gem in the middle of Hard Rock Hotel.  Open restaurant that gives a view of the Casino and Bar to really make you feel like a part of the Vegas thrill. Ordered the \"Chicken Parmesan\" and it's was phenomenal. Garlic bread and spaghetti were amazing, not to mention the chicken was cooked just right. Definitely recommended!
