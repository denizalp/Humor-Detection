This used to be my goto Chinese place over 10 years ago. Well let's just say my tastes have become more sophisticated 'cause it's just your average run if the mill Chinese\/American food with no surprises or intrigue.\n\nThe Chow Fun was pretty good and the Tofu was acceptable I just cant imagine how this was my goto place so long ago.. was I really that blind? I was still in my twenties, what did I know?
