ordered 2 phillys with double meat either they forgot or their phillys have the least amount of meat I've ever seen. Either way $20+ for 2 sandwiches with very little meat even if ordered double.. I'll pass ..sucks too cause would be decent if the cheesesteak actually had steak...shoulda took a pic it was an embarrassingly empty roll.
