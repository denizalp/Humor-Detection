Fiesta- it this word not Spanish? Perhaps there is a similar hindi translation, but this is no combo Indi-Mex food, No. It's strictly run of the mill Indian fast food.  It's decent and not a bad lunch option for people in the building.  Fiesta India moved into Island Food's old spot and is a nice complement to round out the other independent restaurants most of which focus on some sort of Asian cuisine. When you get tired of the fiesta in your mouth from Mission Burrito, head on over to the curry fiesta. Best- Palak Paneer.
