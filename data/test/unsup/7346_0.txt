While I love the chain, this is by far the worst Benihana's in the world. I have eaten here 4 times and it just gets worse every time. The rise was under cooked and dry, my tuna was supposed to be medium and the chef tried to give me super rare because he didn't read the ticket. Overall the food is bland and the restaurant lacks the atmosphere I have grown to love at other Benihana restaurants. I won't be back.
