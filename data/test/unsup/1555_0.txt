We went around 9:45am on a Sunday morning... oops? 30 minute wait, but definitely worth it. Fantastic food, even if you don't get the pancakes. Our server was on the ball, refilled my coffee cup 3 times without me asking, and was clearly working hard, taking care of all the other tables in her section. I got the smoked salmon scramble and it was perfect. The bathroom was clean, which is always important to me. The only thing that didn't make it perfect was the three ladies at the hostess counter. Not exactly a personable bunch!
