Dear Rockhouse Bar,\n\nThank you for making my birthday weekend as pleasurable as it could be.\n\nWhether I was at the mall or just poolside, it was your huge drinks that kept me buzzed or blacked out all day....everyday.\n\nThank you.  \n\nAnd get rid of those annoying ass whistles you have your slutty mcslutterson workers blowing each time they sell something.\n\nAll my love,\n\nVince
