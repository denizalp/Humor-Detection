Dr. Knighton and the staff are amazing. I brought my doggie there because she was ill. They gave her the best care and at such affordable rates. My doggie is doing fine and has been back to get up to date in her vaccines. \n\nHighly recommend them because I feel they truly care about the health and well being of the pets they treat. They treated my senior dog with care and gentleness.
