This location is preferred over the Verona location as the tap list is more diverse and bigger.\n\nBeing a chain, the food was relatively the same as the other locations I've been to.\n\nAs for the staff, they are much more pleasant and well trained than their Verona counterpart. Polite and attentive, their knowledge on their beers is much better. Oh and they take coupons without stink-eyeing you or asserting that you are some kind of criminal.
