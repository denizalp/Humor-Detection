I love this buffet. Today is Friday. This place is crazy busy. The line was building by 2:00 pm. No discounts for players club card holders, only Monday through Thursday I believe. Anyway, they have a large variety of meal selections. I believe that this might be one of the best buffet in the Las Vegas Valley! I don't think they provide wi-fi even though they are located inside the M Hotel and Casino. I highly recommend this buffet.
