I recently moved to the area and was looking for a new hair stylist. I read lots of wonderful reviews on here and decided to give it a go! Juli was fantastic, super friendly and easy to talk to. My highlights haven't looked this good in a long time. I can't wait to go back and see her, I would recommend this place to anyone.
