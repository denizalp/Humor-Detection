Bought a Highlander Limited from Toyota of Surprise.  I did try to haggle since I found the exact same vehicle in Sierra Vista for $1500 less (not the color I wanted, and delivery would take five weeks as the car was on order) but they really do not haggle.  I respected this and decided to pay the extra money because they had the exact color and packages I wanted in the Highlander.  Talked to Tiffany twice on the phone for less than a total of five minutes and then went in and bought the car.  Fast and easy.
