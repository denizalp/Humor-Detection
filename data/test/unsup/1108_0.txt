There's always a first time for everything!\n\nWent to a dive bar in Vegas and Stage Door was it! Came in before our crazy night out. I think it was happy hour or something cause well drinks were $1.50. WTF! Really! I know it's \"just well\" but people that I know that work at bars say they fill their \"good stuff\" with well alcohol anyways, so I ain't hatin. \n\nThe crowd is kind of rough, but don't be such a wuss!
