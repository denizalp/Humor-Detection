Who pays $4 for an above average cookie? THIS GIRL. The compost cookie was highly recommended. They warmed it up so it was soft and gooey on the inside while maintaining a crispy outer edge. \n\nOverall, it was delicious but just OK. The price made it kind of not worth it. If I was to return, I'd probably try the all time best set so you can try a bit of everything. Also, they open late so if you have any sweet tooth cravings skip the bars and check out the Milk Bar.
