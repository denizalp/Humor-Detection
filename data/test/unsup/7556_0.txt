Had reservations for 10pm for a bachelorette party, arrived and were told we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated then they sat us at two separate tables for the party.... Long story short it was very frustrating at first but management stepped up and fixed the situation. I was really happy with the service and food once everything got corrected.
