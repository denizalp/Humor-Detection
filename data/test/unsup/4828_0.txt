I'm not in trouble, I swear! Came in to get some fingerprints done for an FBI background check to teach abroad. The people here are very welcoming and professional, not to mention speedy. Since the process is digital, they printed out the FD-258 card on the spot for $20. Getting fingerprinted at B&D was easier, faster, and cheaper than figuring out how to get it done by LVPD. Thanks again, I'll be sending that postcard soon!
