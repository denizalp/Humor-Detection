Fixed some minor issues on my tile roof quickly and professionally without trying to sell me a new roof.  Great attention to detail - fixed other minor cracks on some of the tiles since they were already at the house and sent me lots of photos to pass on to my real estate agent (I had recently moved for work).\n\nThey were at my house to do the repairs less than two hours after I called - great customer service!
