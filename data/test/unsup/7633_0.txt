DON'T GO!!! This should be called Mexico Clown Circus.  Mostly in Spanish.  Smokie inside the whole time. Small scale tricks.  Children lost interest.  Too loud! Chair seating. The biggest kicker they hand out $5 free passes for kids but it cost $18 for an adult ticket-nothing saved here. I am totally being honest!  I read the reviews before going and was totally mislead!
