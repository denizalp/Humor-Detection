Definitely not worth 17 dollars for a haircut.  The fat slob of a girl, Amber,  who cut my hair, halfway through cutting it mind you, figured out that she really didn't know how to do a fade haircut.  MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME THAT BEFORE ACCEPTING THE JOB OF CUTTING MY HAIR!  Then she goes \"you look nervous, don't be nervous\" after telling me her black co-worker was going to have to fix my hair.  How about I try to cut your hair, mess up, and you don't act nervous either, deal?
