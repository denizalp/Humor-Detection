Love the donair and baklava!  I would give 5 stars but counter service is quite slow although friendly.  The last time we went we ordered a greek salad at the same time we ordered our donairs.  The salad was still being made when our donairs were ready and was not even finished by the time we were done.  \n\nWe will be back
