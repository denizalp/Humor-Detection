I like individual dinner. It comes with 1 item, cup of soup, rice or noodle,  and a egg roll. It is only $10. It is more than 1 person can eat. I share with grandma who live with us. It is cheaper and tastier than anything around here. We order take out about once a week. Good busy  day dinner item.
