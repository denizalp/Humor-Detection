The worst sales people, attitude and management of any furniture store, no wait, any STORE I've ever been into. Horrible way of speaking down to customers, nasty responses to inquiries regarding promised delivery, and the manager who was to \"problem solve\" my bad experience basically sneered at me. I wouldn't send my worst enemy here.
