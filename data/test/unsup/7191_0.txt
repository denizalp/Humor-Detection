They should be embarrassed of themselves those baos had microscopic amounts of meat on them! I ordered the duck and the belly. I would never eat there again, $30 later and I'm just as hungry leaving as I was when I arrived. The only decent thing I ate was the chicken wings, but how hard is it to mess up fried chicken wings? Save your money and go to McDonalds, you'll thank me later. . .
