My first time here! I was able to seat myself. The pho with tofu beef and spring rolls were ordered along with a cup of coffee. I wish they had vegan friendly \"cream\" for the coffee they serve because it does exist but overall decent experience. The customer service was also good here. I'm not sure if I'll be back but for a change AND if I'm in the area, I may consider.
