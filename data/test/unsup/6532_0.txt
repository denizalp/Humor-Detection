I'd love to review the food here, but we've been sitting here over an hour in a nearly empty restaurant and it still hasn't arrived. It good 20 minutes for someone to take our order and no one has been by to refill our drinks in the 45 minutes we've been waiting for our eggs. Yes, just eggs. Thanks Queen City.
