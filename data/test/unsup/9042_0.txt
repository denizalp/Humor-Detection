It's one of the closer theaters to home so it's usually where I go. The movie projection and sound is decent, but not the best in town. \n\nI've only used the concession stands once as the bag it yourself candy was a bit stale. I usually either bring my own or get something from the food court to snack on. \n\nIt'll do though. Sometimes we don't want to go across town to catch a flick.
