Disappointing! Went there because we received a menu in the mail. Everything sounded good. What caught my eye was the fact they boast \"natural and organic\". I wanted to try the healthy shakes. Went for the Energy Boost shake which states natural peanut butter. After receiving the shake I notice Skippy Peanut Butter on the counter. Not even the natural one. Walked out and threw it away.
