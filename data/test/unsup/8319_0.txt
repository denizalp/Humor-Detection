An experience, even on a quiet day like the one I visited. Have never seen so many dollar bills staples to the ceiling and walls of an establishment. You order indoors and eat out doors. A few good bottled beers in their repertoire. Looks like a good place to stop for bikers and country fans. Would like to go back and see multiple bands on it's multiple stages. Lots of rusted antiques for decor. Can things rust in the desert?
