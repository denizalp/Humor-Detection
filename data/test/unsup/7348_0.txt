Love love love this company. Communication was always prompt. I waited till the last minute to hire them because I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money on hair and makeup and I couldn't be happier with my results. My makeup and hair were both flawless. Lenny was even able to cover up a HUGE zit I woke up with that morning. Highly recommend for weddings or any fun event you want to feel beautiful for. Thank you!
