Food was pretty good , it was our first time and kailin was pretty amazing service , very energetic and friendly , attentive and always had a smile , it's because of people like her that makes customers come back again , the food quality on the other hand could be better , I had Korean BBQ at different location and was better , I won't mention names :)
