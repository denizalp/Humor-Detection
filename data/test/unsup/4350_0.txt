I really, really like this place.\n\nI was surprised when I went in -- everything is so clean and cool in here. It also has a second floor RECORD SHOP! Amazing. \n\nThey have really great baristas, a decent selection of teas in canisters (Formosa Oolong all the wayyyyy), and really comfortable chairs. I think they are at least.\n\nI appreciate the free wifi too!\n\nI'll be back!
