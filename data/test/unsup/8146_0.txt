Wow wow wow, just wow! Best sushi bowl in town, HANDS DOWN! Trust me, I am an engineer! Jesus Christ this place is good, I ordered the three protein bowl and that was enough food for a Crossfit athlete after a workout night! Their fish is just amazingly fresh! I'm glad to have this place bookmarked!!!!
