This is the first time I've noticed place.  Tiny, unassuming, boutique coffeehouse located across the street from the venue that run events in sometimes.  I love their style.  Clean. Crisp.  I ordered a latte macchiato.   A little short of perfect but still tasty.    Definitely going back more often to try some of their other products.  Service was very good.  I would recommend this place to coffee connoisseurs to try at least once. Til next time!
