Lannie is the best nail professional around. I've been to many nail salons but none are as pleasant and enjoyable as this one. She's extremely friendly and the price is great as well! Love this nail salon so much, I've been coming twice a month, every month, for the past 8 months and will continue as long as I live in Phoenix.
