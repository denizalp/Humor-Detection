Besides the random homeless lady walking in and disturbing not just me but every customer eating in there... The workers kinda just let her bother all the customers because they didn't really stop her. \n\nThis place is legit. Guess location is the problem? Figure I try other ramen spots before my go to. \n\nBeen here once. I hope to not get bother by a homeless if I eve eat here again.
