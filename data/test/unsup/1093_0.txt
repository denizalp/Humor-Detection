\"bACK ON THE sCENE, cRISPY AND cLEAN\"- DrES, BlaCK sHeeP\n\nFinally Hip Hop On The Strip wihout that god awful techno rearing its ugly face!\n\nGo here on a Wednesday Night and you will be pleased with the music.  Get there early to dance and only go to the bar once.  Don't make a night of it because the layout at LAVO sucks for a club.  \n\nIf only they could send the dj to a bigger space
