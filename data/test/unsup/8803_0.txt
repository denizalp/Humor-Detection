We have dined at North Italia for years. Love their food and service. Their is one problem ,however, they have no restroom of their own. Diners must go outside into the public area to use restrooms which are uninviting, small and often not very clean. This is a huge setback for an otherwise perfect setting for a dining experience. Kierland is notorious for providing far too little parking and basically third world restrooms.
