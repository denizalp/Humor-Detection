Tierry neglected to ask if my son had his permit, even though we spoke 3 times prior to lessons. I didn't know that they needed this before starting driving classes. He then proceeded to berate me for not being aware. You would think it would be the first thing he asked prior to scheduling. He's rude & belligerent. Stay away, there are other schools in town.
