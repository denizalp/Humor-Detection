Heard its good and came here 6-ish on a weeknight. Almost everything gone but still wanna give it a try. It's such an awful experience. I was so regret. They just made me feel like they don't care about your business. This is the WORST service I have ever had. I'll never come back again no matter how good your stuffs are. Damn it.
