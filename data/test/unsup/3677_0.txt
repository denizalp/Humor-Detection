I've been to Lot 17 twice now for animal rescue related events, what a great place! Plenty of space around the bar\/table areas to stretch out and kick back with your pals. Great beer selection, delicious food and huge TVs to watch the game on. I hope to swing by Lot 17 again in the near future! (and THANKS for supporting the animal rescue community!!)
