it's a party!....in your living room...\n\nLAVO is tiny for my expectations of a Vegas club.  Pro: you can easily scan the floor for cuties or possible one-nighters. Con: you can EASILY scan the whole dance floor.  There was an open bar for the ladies, so that includes double-fisting and an assembly line of passing drinks to the fellas.  Overall, i had fun since there was a good dj and good company.\n\nFuture reminder: i was just told the fried oreos here are the bee's knees so i shall be visiting again.
