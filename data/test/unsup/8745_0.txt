I'm very happy with this company. After being in a minor motor vehicle accident (hit from behind), Impact Auto was my chosen collision repair facility. They had my vehicle for 2 weeks and did a very nice job. My understanding is this is a pretty typical time frame for collision repair. They even detailed the outside of my car! Also, friendly customer service.
