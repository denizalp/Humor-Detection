This is an elegant restaurant, perfect for a business lunch or dinner date. The menu is a refreshing departure from the chains and standard fare in Gaston County, and the chef does an excellent job of delivering exceptional meals consistently.  I've been over a dozen times and the food and service never disappoint.
