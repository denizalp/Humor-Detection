I could just be partial because my bff is a cocktail waitress here, but I had a really rad vodka-filled time at Marquee.\n\nI especially love their outdoor area where they have the pool, cabanas etc. because being in the open air sure beats the sardine-packed stuffiness of the boombox room downstairs. \n\nI appreciate how they themed the rooms according to varying tastes in ambiance\/ music.  BTW ATB was there that night, and I was stoked!!\n\nExpensive everything, but had a beyond awesome first time.
