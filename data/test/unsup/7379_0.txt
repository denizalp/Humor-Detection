I have not eaten here.\n\nI will say that they graciously allowed a drunk Filipino woman stumble in asking to use the bathroom merely to throw up in because she had one too many cheap drinks from somewhere less classy. As I pitied the bathroom attendant for listening to the hurling, I wish she held my hair up.\n\n\nLater, I found out there was a closer bathroom at the food court we were eating at. Hey, a 5 star review is a 5 star review.
