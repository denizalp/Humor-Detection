This place is great! Liked the staff, very friendly and eager to serve. Didn't pretend or make me feel ashamed since it'd been a while since I last had some maintance done. \n\nThe art of threading relaxes me, yes it's a bit rough at times, but the pain is minimal compared to other things, say like tooth extraction! \n\nThere are a lot of other products for sale including designer bags, very pretty stuff, worth looking at. \n\nWill be back for sure!
