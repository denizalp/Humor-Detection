This little store is sort of off the grid. Next to a Peter Piper Pizza, so the parking is a bit scarce.\nThey have a great selection of name brand athletic shoes. I always head back to the clearance section, where you can find super deals. The sales people are always available if you need anything, but don't hover over me while I look around! No one works on commission, like some of the other shoe stores. It is the fastest way to go in and out for shoes, no mall!
