5 stars for customer service!\n\nCalgary burger was delicious but next time I'm asking for heavy on the sauce.\n\nFries are good but cool off fast.\n\nHaystack onion rings are ridiculous! Paper thin, crispy goodness. I inhaled those like a crispy Kreme donut!\n\nKids loved their Kid Smash burgers. \n\nPrice for our family of 6 was $53. Great addition to Deerfoot City.
