By far the best poke place in town. I highly recommend the poke crunch bowl and the Kimura ahi katsu bowl. My kids are the ahi and didn't know it was fish. That's a for me!! The owner was so friendly and gave my boys complimentary spam masubi and let me try the kamaboko which was so onolicious!! I am Definitely coming back here!!
