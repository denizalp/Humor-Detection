These guys are rad! They really come to your place and wash your windows in kilts. Two things they remind me of:\n\n- The Men in Tights song. Every time I see their truck.\n\n- A really bad joke that a Scottish person told me: \n\n\"Why are they called kilts?\" \n\n\"I don't know!\"\n\n\"Because the last person who called them skirts was KILT!\"\n\nAsk for Sheldon, he's pretty boss. Inexpensive and thorough, they do window cleaning; gutter cleaning; pressure washing; snow removal; blind cleaning and carpet cleaning. In kilts. Call them, you know you want to!\n\nJust remember: No peeking :).
