What a lovely bar!  I love all the decor and the attention to detail, beautiful floral arrangements, comfy seating, bartenders are friendly, its very inviting. \n\nWe came in on a Thursday night ready to dance but it was country night so we finished our drinks and left.  While we were there the owner, Stacy came around and introduced himself, he seemed very nice and it's obvious he cares about his bar.  \n\nWednesday's sound like the best night to come.  Great drink specials and top 40 music.  We'll be back!
