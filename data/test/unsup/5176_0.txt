I initially wanted to try this place out in LA until I discovered there was a location about half an hour from the strip! Our server, Alodia, was so amazing! Super nice, constantly checked up on us and gave us phenomenal service. Not only her though, but the host and manager were also very friendly! Cajun shrimp is bomb by the way!
