We stopped by for dinner and sort of get dropped.  Zach, the manager came by after a few minutes and immediately took our drink order as well as an appetizer on the house.  He continued to check in and made sure our server took extremely good care of us.\n\nWhat started out in the wrong direction was changed to a BIG POSITIVE by a manager that is truly watching his business.  We will come back again!!!
