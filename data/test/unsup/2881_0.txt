This is my go to place for Persian takeout.  The eggplant dip is awesome and I love their beef and chicken kubideh.  Everything is made fresh here, and its an ideal place to call in an order for a movie night at home.  Don't forget to ask for some sumac powder to add that sour salty flavor to the meat!
