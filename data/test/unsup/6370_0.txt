Horrible !!! I came here last night with a group of friends. And there was no one to greet us. I saw there were a lot of empty seats and the waitresses saw us but didn't come and sit us. They weren't even doing anything. We waited for almost 5-8 mins and we left after that. I think they think we weren't here for izakaya. Horrible..I will not return and I don't recommend this place! I hope this place shuts down! Pfftt!
