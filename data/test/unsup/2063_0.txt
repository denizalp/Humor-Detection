This is the place where you can find so many lovely dresses that you will have difficulty trying everything on. I tried on more than 10, and loved 4 of them (that is a great turnout, considering most of time you can hardly find one piece). \n\nI ended up buying 2 piece because they are simply irresistible.  \n\nOnly downside: dresses are NOT cheap (most of them around $60), but they are definitely much more classy than Forever 21. \n\nLadies working there are very helpful and friendly, offering honest opinions.
