Went in with a buddy that's been there a few times before so decided to try it out. Walked in on a Saturday @ 5:30pm maybe 10 people at the bar, not even a greeting when we walked in and sat down.  Waited 10 minutes with ZERO acknowledgement so we walked out.  Even my buddy that recommended the place felt embarrassed.
