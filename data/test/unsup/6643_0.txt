I love this restaurant and especially their wonderful to-go counter.  The hostess always greet and are very polite as well as the counter staff. On several occasions the manager working named Margaret or Marjorie (not sure but she works morning and afternoon) has been extremely rude and unfriendly. She doesn't smile or make eye contact with anyone and looks miserable. It's very sad to see someone dislike their job as much as she does and I'm sure her employees pick up on it. Hire someone friendly they are supposed to turn around bad experiences not create them.
