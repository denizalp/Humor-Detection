This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas; I usually go twice in a trip, once for brunch and once for dinner. This location is much easier to get to than Mandalay, provided you enter from the strip. \nI did brunch with my bff Saturday morning. Chris was our waitress and was AMAZING!! My friend ordered bottomless mimosas and she kept them coming!! She was super attentive and brought us dishes we might like. \nIf you like Mexican food and brunch- this place is a must!!
