Idk if it's because she's older or what but the bagging lady is rude and slow and doesn't smile. She has no personality and completely ruined my experience... \n\nShe's skinny with long blonde hair. \nShe's petite around 5'4\" but definitely older than 50. It honestly aggravated me that I had to bag my own things...\n\nIf I didn't bag my own things I'd be there for another 20 minutes... Never going to this trader joes with her there, it was seriously awful, rude, I'm lividly upset...
