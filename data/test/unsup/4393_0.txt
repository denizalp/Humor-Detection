We just moved here from Norfolk VA in June. I'm really impressed with our apartment! !!! The wood laminate is beautiful! !! I also love the way the two bedroom units are setup. They also keep the outside looking beautiful.  The office held our  apartment for a few months before we even moved. I give them 4 stars for sure! !!
