I like it here and I usually try to come over here when I need a car wash, but lately they've stopped offering me the little air freshener and moist towel to wipe down the car interior and I feel like the value is starting to slip, or the employees are getting lazy unless prompted to offer these items...?  \n\nI'm not sure which it is, but it gives me a bit of hesitation and makes me think maybe it's time to find a new car wash that always offers these things when you come?
