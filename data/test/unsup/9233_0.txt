This was an OK place to go. The restaurant was clean, atmosphere was...unremarkable. I wouldn't say my food was spectacular, but it was plenty good enough to visit again if you just have a craving for standard, basic Americanized Chinese food. My waiter seemed very bored because it was quite slow, but I received my food in timely fashion and the prices were more than fair.
