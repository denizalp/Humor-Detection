At first we were very excited to have food here because of the great reviews.  VERY DISAPPPOINTED!!!\nFood was cold, tasteless and had to wait more than 20 min.\nThere are better sit down choices, please spend ypur money $$, at a sit down place and get service with the meals!!!\nGave it two star, one star for the convenience and another star since they had a water dispenser on their counter. \nWould not recommend.
