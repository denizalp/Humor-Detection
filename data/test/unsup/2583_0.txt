I spent $1000 on Nokian tires for my vehicle expecting a place that only does tires I could expect a professional job. After picking up the vehicle I noticed the ride was something not right. Checking the tire pressures were all different psi. Tires gauged at 36 37 37 38 psi. They just put in air without checking manufacturer psi.  The manufacturer recommends 32 psi. The sticker is so obvious to see on the side door. Idiots with no regard to doing their only job correctly. I will not buy my tires from Kaltire tire again..
