Review on the Run\n\nLocal fish and chip place out in the west end.  Family run business.  Fish was nicely done.  Service was great.  For whatever reason the fries were awful.  Super soggy.  I have a feeling the precooked (blanched) them way to earlier and for too long.  At least that's my experience as a former fry guy.\n\nThe owner was friendly, but super talkative.  I was alone and he joined me for a long talk about politics. \n\nConclusion: Eat Here?  I'll give it another try.. maybe.
