I don't get this place. \n\nFirst - Chicks don't like to go to a place where girls are being hosed down with water. Why would I want to see a girl in a bikini look like she's showering without soap in front of me? I get that guys are all about this, but no... don't do that. \n\nSecond - Why the hell would an artist be painting in a night club. \n\nI just don't get you Myst!
