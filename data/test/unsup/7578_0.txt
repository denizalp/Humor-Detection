This place is seriously cute and Erin the owner is simply delightful. She makes everything pretty much from scratch gluten-free and vegetarian or vegan friendly. Everything is about $7 and includes a soup or salad.\n\nMy TOMATO MELT on RYE with avocado, havarti, and rosemary garlic mayo was absolutely superb.  I can't wait to go back and try the CHUNKY HUMMUS SANDWICH on RYE with bell peppers, green onion, cucumber, and sprouts or the GRILLED BRIE SANDWICH on OATMEAL RAISIN bread with honey baked apples. Yum!
