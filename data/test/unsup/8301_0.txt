4 stars.  One of the best theaters I have ever been to.  It wasnt too crowded, it had super comfortable seats that RECLINE, and they also show  DLP movies so they are super crisp\/sharp.  Overall a great theater!  Staff was friendly and the layout of the theater was great.  Damn near a perfect movie theater.
