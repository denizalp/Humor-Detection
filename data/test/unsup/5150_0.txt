The button on my shifter broke and my steering wheel has been making noises so we added steering wheel fluid and went to get a quote to see if anything needed to be done. They quoted us 1\/5 of the value of my car to flush and replace the steering wheel fluid and replace the shifter. We decided to go elsewhere but they still charged us $120 for a quote\/diagnostic test because it took them 30 minutes to find the problem even though we told them what was wrong. I would not recommend this place.
