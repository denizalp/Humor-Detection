Tim Hortons is a glorified Winchells Donut.\n\nI was going to leave my negative commentary at that but I must mention how odd some of their selections are....like the chocolate bar donut with sprinkled candy bar on top. Really? Like candy needs to be combined with a fucking donut. Isn't the donut enough to cure even the most aggressive sugar rush? \n\nYeah, I guess not.
