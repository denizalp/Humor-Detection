Good and entertaining show. Set and show were creepy but that all goes with Criss' persona. The seats\nwe had were on the main floor. Show is interactive as well, and he picks people from the crowd. There were alot of lights, fireworks, and live heavy metal guitarists. Criss also brought out his son at the end while we he was talking about childhood cancer. Glad I got to see this show before it ends in late Oct but I wouldnt pay the regular $90 + ticket price. See if discounted tickets are available if you're interested in this show.
