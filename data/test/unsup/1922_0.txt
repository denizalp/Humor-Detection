The worst service ever. Don't plan on returning, let alone exchanging anything here, even if it's brand new and still in the bag. \n\nI received a bag as a gift but it wasn't my style, not having the receipt I was fine if I could simply exchange it. They made some BS excuse on not being able to look up the item. IT STILL HAD THE TAGS ON!\n\nI'm probably going to go back just to yell at them and make a scene, because typing this is getting me all riled up
