Who doesn't like Cookies By George? That warm, soft, gooey, deliciousness sliding down your throat. Yes, I'm still talking about cookies you perverts!\n\nI like to mix it up so I usually go with the bite-sized cookies so I can get a few different types. It helps to bring a friend to share with so you don't feel like a total pig when you're inhaling them.
