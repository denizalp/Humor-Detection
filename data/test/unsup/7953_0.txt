With all the coffee shops in Toronto it's hard to say what's the best one. The Black Canary is definitely up there! My favourite is the nutellaccino but their other signature lattes are a must try like the stay puff. \n\nIf the coffee doesn't bring u back here or the fact that's its in a comic store, then the staff will. Luthie and her staff are awesome!
