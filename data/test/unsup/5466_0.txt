High Prices. No Service.  All the same merchandise you can get elsewhere.\n\nOh and these vegan pinko commie tree huggers don't carry hunting, shooting, archery supplies.  The outdoors goods are weak too.\n\nIf you like racquet sports and carrying a fanny pack this might be your shop - cause it ain't mine!\n\nThis is the next Borders Books.
