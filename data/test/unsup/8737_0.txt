This place is awesome, it has a very trendy and metropolitan vibe. Wine selection isn't as vast as some of the other wine bars but the atmosphere really makes up for that. They also have beer and liquor if you have people in your group who don't drink wine. I have only had the cheesecake here but it's good. The other food looks good as well.
