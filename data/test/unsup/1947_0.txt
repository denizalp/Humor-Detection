I called the day before to schedule the unclogging of my main sewer pipe.\nThey gave me an appointment for 9:30 .\nThe next morning a representative called me around 10:15 to inform me that they were so busy that they couldn't do my job that day.\nI cancelled the job and found a plumber in Tempe with great reviews on Yelp.\nI called and 3 hours later the job was done for a lower price.\nBottom line- they're too big to take care of you -
