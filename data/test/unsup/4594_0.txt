Mom and pop shop two dollar tacos down the street? Yes yes yes.\nI ordered the pork tacos and was really impressed. If I had had more change on me I would have gotten an horchata too while I was at it. I have no doubts however that it's delicious.\nI'm actually concerned that I'll just stop cooking and live off of tacos and churros now. Worse things have happened, I guess.\nVery much a hole-in-the-wall type deal and absolutely worth it.\n\nHeads up: it's cash only for the time being.
