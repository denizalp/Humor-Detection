We never had the chance to eat here because we walked in 5 waitresses at the front messing with the cash register and 1 counter her food tickets... NO ONE bothered to look up or say hello... I had to ask if we sit ourselves and got a look from the workers as if I was bothering them. We walked out and went to Black Bear Diner where we were greeted with a smile and seated immediately. This is not a very Christian way of doing business nor professional.
