This is near to the university so I expected higher prices.  Shoes, men's cowboy shirts, and great vintage jeans were among my favorite finds.  \n\nThe best thing to do is bring a few of your pieces to get a discount on the items you are going to buy.  \n\nThe shop is chucked full, crowded with merch.  The employees are very kind and want to help you find items.  This is a place I would like to go to on a monthly basis as the items change at such a rapid pace.
