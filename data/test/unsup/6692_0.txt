Such a great vintage shop! Sooo much stuff to choose from! I love that everything inside is only 10 dollars! Allow yourself at least an hour to dig through everything! If you like vintage rocker type tees, army surplus, denim jackets, flannels, and vintage leathers this is your place! \nMake sure to come check it out!!!
