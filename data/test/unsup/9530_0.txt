Great atmosphere and a cool location.  The coffee I selected wasn't my favorite, but I appreciated the knowledge and care that went into preparing it and talking about it (recognizing that tastes can vary).\n\nWould definitely recommend dropping by if, like us, you were in the neighborhood and desperate for some coffee not made by Starbucks or your random hotel lobby.
