The scene of my favorite springtime lunch activity.  What is it?  Getting a mozzarella sandwich and than heading over to Steele Indian School park and heckling the urban fisherman as they struggle in vain to bring in their catch of garbage fish.\n\nThe sandwich is magical in its simplicity.  The rest of the sandwich world should take note.
