This place is an A&W\/ Long John Silver's combo store so all your french fries taste like fish. They do have root beer on ice cold tap. Some of the items on the menu are ok, but most of time I leave disappointed. They do have a jukebox and lots of comfy boothes but its still fast food & its fish & burgers. Not the best but if your intoxicated it'll do.
