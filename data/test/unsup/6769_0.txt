Having this place right around the corner from my house is both a pro and a con. The pupusas always hit the spot without hitting my wallet too badly. I've tried pretty much all their pupusas and I am never disappointed. I love that they make it fresh once you order it, which means it does take a while but I'll accept the wait because I know the finished product will make my tummy happy. Their service is good. This place is definitely my only go to spot for pupusas!
