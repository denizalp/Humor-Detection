Price with discount is a great savings if you're on a budget or in a large group. Selections are soup and salad, seafood, Asian, Mexican, Italian\/Pizza, BBQ\/Country, and deserts. Sodas are included in the price but alcohol is separate. I found the food very salty, undercooked, and not very tasty overall. I would say if you need a quick convenient bite this will fit your needs. If you are looking for a tasty and quality buffet, this may not be the place. As for service, our waitress was very friendly and attentive.
