Got the original crepe cake (because they were out of matcha and chocolate). Glad I did though since it was my first time trying it. It had an interesting texture so I'm not sure I would order it again but the flavour was good. I also ordered a large mango roobios iced tea. YUM loved it but then again I am a fan of sweet mango juice.\n\nMy sister got the chicken katsu plate and liked it too. Would consider going back and trying some of their savoury options.
