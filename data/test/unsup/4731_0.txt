Fantastic lunch spot! The plate portions are huge and the salad (included) is fresh. The salad is made with real greens and it's loaded with large pieces of cucumber, tomato and bell pepper. The humus and baba ganoush are delicious as well. Try the kifta, you won't be disappointed. If you're lucky, they might drop off a free slice of the baklava for dessert.\n\nI have taken both white collar and blue collar associates here and everyone loves it.\n\nTry it!
