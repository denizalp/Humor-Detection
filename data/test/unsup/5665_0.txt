Wow. What a nice little find. Bought a living social for this place and tried it out. Based on the location I was not expecting much but what a nice surprise. Food was very good and service was excellent. Small but interesting location in a courtyard. Heat lamps so we are outside and listened to live Jazz. Will definitely go back.
