You're a bar in Mesa..... and you charge a cover to see a shitty dj who just curated some Spotify playlist. Plus tell people before they buy several drinks for there friends that you don't serve real liquor instead serve some water down crap that taste like ass. If you happen to live in the butthole of the valley that is mesa this a ok bar to go to but don't come here from anywhere else in the valley it's waste of time and money.
