Not a very good McD's.  Fountain sodas are flat. Wait times at the drive-thru are ridiculous. Don't bother going inside, it's not any better service. Speak of which, how bout reiterating my order so I don't end up paying for someone else's food.  Disaster avoided! My rating was almost a -2 stars....\n\nRe: drive-thru\nUtterly ridiculous. 2 entrances for 1 order terminal\/speaker box (right of way madness). Not to mention the horseshoe turn where it's near likely you'll hit some idiot passing through the drive-thru to get inside the McD's...not worth a visit.
