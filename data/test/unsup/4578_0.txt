Super good food, don't let the fact it's from a gas station scare you. The biggest downfalls are the hours, they close early and there's usually only one guy working so it may take awhile to get waited on and get your food. But its worth the wait. Hubby usually gets the California Burrito. I have had the Carne Asada Nachos and Chicken Chimichanga... Everything is delicious, great prices, huge portions. \nWish they were open on Sundays!\nI'd go more often if they had later hours!
