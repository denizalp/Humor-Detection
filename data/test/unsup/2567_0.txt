My family and I were headed to the movie theater in the same shopping center as this joint, so we decided to give it a try for dinner before hand. The service is pretty good. Their chicken is great. You can tell it is fresh and made from scratch. They have many sauce options for wings and the fingers. It was a neat experience and the next time we catch a movie nearby we will stop in again.
