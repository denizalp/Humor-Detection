I highly recommend you watch the three movies this show includes. It's the most emotionally and visually beautiful show I have ever seen in my life. The lighting, live band and music direction add to these already heart wrenching stories of star crossed lovers. Don't just bring a box of tissues,\nBring a bag and get ready to be emotional. I'd see it a million times.
