Staying at Candlewood Suites and ordered deliver from here tonight\n\nGot a cheese pizza was good, cooked well medium thickness crust, bland but good sauce and enough cheese.\n\nGot mild wings (had the kids). Wings are not the greatest, bland flavor and not crispy enough.\n\nGot a steak and cheese sub.  This sandwich was about the best I have had.  Great bread and tons of steak.  A+
