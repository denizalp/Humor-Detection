Super fast and easy overpriced pizza! It's tasty and the way pizza should be. The allergen free options are unrivaled and supreme, really delightful for someone that has to avoid things like wheat or dairy. The online order system is very simple and so far very much on time. The standards like pepperoni pizza are run of the meal, id recommend exploring some of their more niche choices for toppings and sauces. They're really good!
