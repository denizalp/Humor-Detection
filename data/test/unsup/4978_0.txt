Found this place by accident, but wow what a find.  It look like a touristy, cheasy, mexican restaurant in Old Montreal, and it is.  However, the food is really good, the service was amazing, and the drinks were awesome.  Even the Mariachi singers were ridiculously good.  I usually pay those guys to stay away, but these guys were so good we had them play 4 songs.  Really fun  place.  Our two young girls loved it as well.  Enjoy.
