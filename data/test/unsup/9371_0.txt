Went through the drive-thru for a dose of Egg McMuffins and not only was the line (technically, TWO lines since there are two ordering boards) not moving much at all, but it was super slow. We pulled up at 10:15 and were immediately blocked in by cars behind us. At 10:32 when we finally got to the ordering board, we were pleased to find that they were still serving breakfast.\n\nSeriously, it took us 25 minutes to get Egg McMuffins. We'd have left, but we were stuck!\n\nBooo!
