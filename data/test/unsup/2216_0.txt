The food was good and this is nice place for a simple lunch.  It's location at city center provides for a more quiet sit down place.  They also split the salad for us which was a nice gesture.  Both pizzas were very tasty, we had the Mushroom and the spicy pepperoni.  However the spicy was not spicy at all.  I would have provided 4 stars but our food took forever.  I think it was a kitchen screw up but the hostess should have noticed and provided a simple apology.
