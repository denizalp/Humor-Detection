Terrible, honestly disgusting, had to send the cold food back twice. Got excited when it started steaming but was disappointed by the salty gingery chili chicken. The dry as hell and not garicly but soy filled garlic chicken. I can get food 4 times as good for 1\/4 the price. The atmosphere is comparable to the bathroom in Saw and the wait staff is about as nice as a bullet to the forehead.
