Farmers Boys never does me wrong.  Came to Vegas with the family and stoped here for a quick bite.  Have been to their Ca locations before.  Always loved it and loved this just as much.  Awesome burgers...clean orderly atmosphere. Friendly service.   Did I say awesome burgers.   Yummmmm crispy fries and onion rings too!!
