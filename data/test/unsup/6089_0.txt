This was one of my favorite meals in a while. \n\nWe started by getting a couple drinks. The bartenders need more room back there.... BUT were awesome and friendly. \n\nThe server was great he was attentive but not annoying. \n\nWe started with the Italian Salad, amazing\nBread and oil and balsamic, was good\nThe braised beef gnocchi was fantastic!\n\nThe wife loved her wine and her after dinner coffee.
