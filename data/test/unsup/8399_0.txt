This was a hang out of mine in the 70's. My girlfriend and her husband are in town.  I told them Minder Binders is open again after 10 years of being closed.  We walked thru the doors and we were time warped back to the 70's.  Had a beer and sat down in the patio which a long time ago would have been the dirt parking lot. I will go back to have their hamburger.  Hopefully, it will take me back to the same taste!
