This is a hookah bar for hookah tourists. That is perfect for me! It has a chill, club type vibe with decor straight out of an import store. It is located in the heart of coventry. Sure, sure, the guys there are apt to be a bit too young for me, but I can flirt, can't I? \n\nThey let me act the fool and dance on the table and couch until 3 am one night. Ain't nothin wrong with that.
