Nasty, and they constantly screw up order!!  I called to order they could not understand me due to a language barrier. I've been there two times and both times left my stomach feeling unstable. My experience wasn't pleasing, never again will I go here for food plenty of Thai restaurants that's better. Try la Thai great food there.
