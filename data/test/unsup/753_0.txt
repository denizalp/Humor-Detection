I go to the Tavern Company 3 or 4 times per month.  For a while I lived around the corder and I walked there every couple of days for a beer or two.  \n\nTo me, and to many who walk into the TavCo, it is THE place to go on Lee Road when you want a drink with friendly faces and a really nice, reasonably priced meal.  \n\nGreat beer, wonderful staff, wonderful service, outdoor seating and NO attitude.\n\nGo - it's a wonderful, locally owned and operated place.
