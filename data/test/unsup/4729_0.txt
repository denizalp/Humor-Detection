I had never heard of this place until I ran across it here on Yelp and all the reviews were positive. B.K.'s review really had me ready to go.\n\nWell it was everything promised. Terrific melt in your mouth catfish, crispy and mosit hush puppies and did I mention it was CHEAP!! $5 for 2 fish & fries.\n\nNext time I will have to order alot more it was so good I had to share.\n\nThe place was comfortable and relaxed with smiling faces, plus great food I can't wait to go back
