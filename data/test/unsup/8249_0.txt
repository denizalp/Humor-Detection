Typical bar food.  Typical mid-western beer selection.  Everybody is fake-baked like its a frigging competition or something.  Not Irish at all in my opinion.  Same cheeseballs that ya might find at the Barley House downtown except the ones here drive pickups and listen to Kenny Chesney.  Only reason its getting 3 stars is that it used to be Cleveland's PM strip club and if you close your eyes real tight you can still smell the stripper lotion and hear \"Crazy Bitch\" by Buckcherry playin..
