For a busy restaurant, we were able to get in minutes after signing on the wait list. Cashier estimated 10 minutes so that was great. Menus have no photos but description says all. Food was amazing. Country fried steak was juicy unlike many dried up ones that I've tried. I understand with this amount of business a lot of tables would be ideal, but it feels a bit crowded. Nonetheless, great breakfast joint. One of the best in South West Vegas.
