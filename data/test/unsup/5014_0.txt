My favorite sushi, sashimi, chirashi, rolls, and everything place! I once got really sick after eating sushi boat at a different Japanese restaurant in Henderson...so I decided not to eat anymore sushi in Nevada at all...UNTIL I ate at Tokyo Boys :-). Their ingredients are super fresh and I never get sick after eating here. I get different things...sushi assortment, chirashi bowl, salmon bowl, rolls, and other things. Everything is fresh and delicious. Customer service is good as well. They are very welcoming and nice.
