The service, along with the food, has been very inconsistent.  We have been to this restaurant a few times, and will most likely return, but our visits are never without issues.  Either with the food or with the service, they seem to take turns.  Had to send duck back to the kitchen 3 times once due to improper cooking.  My suggestion, don't order the duck : ).  However, given its convenient location (for us) and for the most part, satisfactory food, we will return.  A+ for the shrimp on a stone!
