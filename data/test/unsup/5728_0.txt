What's not to love about this location?!?  As the previous reviews have stated they have great instructors, spa like facilities, variety of classes and times and price that makes it seem too good to be true!  Martin, Tony, and Liz are awesome instructors!   They were some of my favorites when they taught kettlebell, barefoot boot camp and pilates at Vegas Hot.
