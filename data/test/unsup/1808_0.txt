This store has a huge selection of vitamins and supplements. There are many brands to choose from. I like the selection of ready to eat foods in the freezer case. There are plenty of vegan and paleo choices. There is a modest selection of organic grass fed meat. This place is similar to Trader Joe's and just as pricy. I will consider this store for specialty items or supplements that are not found at Sprouts.
