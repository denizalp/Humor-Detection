Whatever you do, don't go to Metro police station for fingerprinting! Go here instead! Because of Metro's fingerprinting mistakes, I had to redo my background check, which takes another 12 weeks to process for my counseling license. I should've went to B&D the first time to get it done right. The staff is awesome and wonderful, and I was out of their office in 10 minutes! I highly recommend their services :)
