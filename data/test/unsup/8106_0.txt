My go to place when I'm too lazy to cook. My favorite is the spinach katsu curry. I usually get it with medium spice. Sometimes when I want to sweat I'll take it to the max. Wonder if I'm burning any calories with all that sweat.\n\nFor my daughter, I usually get her a side order of katsu and rice. It under $6 so that's a cheap good dinner.\n\nI recommend calling ahead if you plan out take out.
