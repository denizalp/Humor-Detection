Worst service in the PH. We sat there for 15 min before she took our order. Only one other party of three in the whole area. The food was not that good and way overpriced for what you get. Then the last straw was when I had to refill my own glass because our waitresses just left and nobody explained where she went. Took another 20 min to get I our checks and she got pissed when we wanted it split three ways. Never again will I eat there.
