Good food - had the deluxe burrito - I would consider it somewhat of a hybrid between authentic Mexican and modernized Mexican food. Either way, it was good.\n\nGreat service - very friendly and attentive.\n\nGood atmosphere - nice indoor seating with Mexican decor. I opted for the large outdoor patio, which was very nice.
