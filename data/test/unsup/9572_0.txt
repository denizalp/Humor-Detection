We came on a Thursday to be apart of their Trivia, but it finished. We got there around 8. Winners of the trivia gave us their pitcher of beer! Wonderful hospitality. Sad that we were the only ones there when the trivia was over. Bartender didn't approach us? We looked like we had \"a meeting\" haha. Anyway, it looks pretty cool inside. On the table, there is a tap where you just slide a card to get some beer. greattt!
