Called this company to order a cab and they confirmed it would arrive at 1:45pm. At 2pm we canceled and drove our friends to the airport on our own. \n\nFirst I waited about 15 minutes while trying to schedule the cab. When I called at 1:55pm to ask about eta... They hung up on me. I called back and canceled. This is exactly why I prefer to use Uber. Can companies can't complain that they are losing business to other ride share type companies if they can't keep up with the competition.
