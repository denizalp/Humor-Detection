Super yummy cupcakes. I love that they come in mini form so you can try multiple flavours and each one is a big super tasty bite. I also love that the different flavours each have such unique colouring\/look that it's easy to tell them apart. \n\nMy favourite flavours are caramel, mint chocolate and vanilla bean. \n\nThe store front also sells little cutesy knick knack type stuff with a cupcake, baking, sweets theme.
