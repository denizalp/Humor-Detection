This Jack in the Box is in a good location, bathrooms were clean and food was pretty good. However, we were the only people in the building and drive thru was slow but it took a bit longer than expected to get our food out and every single table in the restaurant was dirty. They may have been understaffed but it was super slow and I feel a clean restaurant is a necessity.
