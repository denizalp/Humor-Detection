We come to Vegas a lot and tried most of the dining options in the D gates and this is the best food I ate by far!  Also I had a real martini made be a bar lady so if you are looking a good drink this is a nice surprise!\n\nThis is why I gave a 5 star. It would be better if it was a comfortable restaurant but until then! \n\nThe only suggestion is that the sandwich we ordered was supposed to be a grilled sandwich and it was not! Just make sure when ordering!
