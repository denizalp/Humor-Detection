First proper cocktail lounge Lorain County has to offer.  SOTDC has me mesmerized.  Maybe it's because I've matured a bit but lounges & bars like this are more appealing to me.  The tones are dark with a touch of dim lighting.  Not a bad seat in the place.  I loved the crowd everyone was happy.  Job well done behind the bar.  \n \nIntimate hideaway for those enthusiasts seeking inventive & sociable drinking
