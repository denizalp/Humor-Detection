We come to this location all the time. We always have great service and great food! The service is fast and friendly. The restaurant is clean and so are the restrooms. If you don't make reservations try the bar area, if you can find a seat the service is awesome and you can order from the menu. We have had just about everything on the menu and they never disappoint. It's a must try!!
