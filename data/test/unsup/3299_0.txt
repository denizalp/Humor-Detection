Wow this place has honestly ruined my experience forever with Tim Hortens! \n\n1. Line was almost out the door very slow \n\n2. Strawberry cream cheese bagel freezing cold!\n\n3. Looked at my bagel to see a HUGE MUTANT \"Timmy's\" FLY\n\n4. While driving almost threw up in shock ! \n\n5. Still drank the coffee! Theirs something wrong with me.\n\n6. This experience was like a bad break up. I had to drink the coffee one last time .
