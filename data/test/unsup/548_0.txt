This is the most cozy yummy Asian fusion restaurant in Ahwatukee!! The food is made fresh to order and the staff is amazing and well versed on the menu. They offer gluten free dishes which makes it an option for those with food allergies and\/or sensitivities. The spicy wonton soup is this best appetizer on the menu (I think). Definitely worth a try!!
