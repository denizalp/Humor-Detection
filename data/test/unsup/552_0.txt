The decor here is very \"white\" and somewhat sterile feeling, but otherwise lush as is most of Mandalay Bay. The menu was delicious. I had the surf and turf, and it was creatively made and presented. Highly recommended. Very good wine list as well, but unfortunately it was substantially overpriced.
