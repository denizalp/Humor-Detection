The best thing about this place is the service! And I'm a person who totally believes service is the most important part of dining out, otherwise I'd just eat at home. Lina was my bartender and service. She was friendly, helpful, and outgoing. She seemed to love her job and take pride in being a part of SLS.\n\nThe food was fantastic. I had a soup that the noodles tasted like dumplings just like your grandma made. Everything was fresh. The soft poached egg was perfect. \n\nI'm a local so I'll definitely be back!
