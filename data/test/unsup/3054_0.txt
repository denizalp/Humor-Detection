Slow, slow, did I mention slow service?\nHave had quality issues in the past but when pointed out they do take care of it.  \n\nJust today..... so ... slow.\n\nLike only 4 cars ahead of us... ONE HOUR from pay to drive off. \n\nAbsolutely ridiculous. Lead on staff (blue shirt) barely cared or listened.  Just made excuses.\n\nStaff sat on wife's clipboard in passenger seat with papers on it. All crumpled.
