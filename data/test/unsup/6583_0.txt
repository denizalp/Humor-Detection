This dealer has BY FAR the highest prices. But if still insist in dealing with them, start emailing a salesperson, asking for good numbers, etc,  and if you decide to go to the store and try to buy a car bring somebody who understands numbers, because the folks from this dealer will trick you big time. The salespeople at one point will bring their managers to present you a deal, but the deal will always favor Honda and not you. BE AWARE!
