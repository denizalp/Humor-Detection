Got the bacon breakfast taco on a layover. Pretty odd and greasy-the tortilla was fried on the griddle, I believe. Definitely not a traditional breakfast taco, the salsa was closer to ketchup. I can't comment on the other food options, so the stars are for breakfast tacos only. The service was friendly, though.
