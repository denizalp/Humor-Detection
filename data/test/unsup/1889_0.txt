These guys clearly think they're all celebrities. I wasn't greeted by a single employee and while looking at watches four employees were more interested in playing guitar than helping me. I was really disappointed. Glad I went, but I wouldn't shop here. (Ooh, it wasn't very busy when I was there...so that's not an excuse.)
