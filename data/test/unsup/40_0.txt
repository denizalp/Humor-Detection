Yeah, it's a bit of a shitshow and it costs more than it should, but if you like beer and central European granny food, this is a pretty good way to close out the summer. Excellent German beer, gratuitous displays of German heritage, wiener dog races, and wonderfully fatty sausages, schnitzel, kraut and other delights... you really can't go wrong. And the people watching is fantastic.
