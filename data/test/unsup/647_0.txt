Awesome ice cream. Walked in, no wait and very friendly staff. The only thing better than the ice cream was the price! A small (which was 16oz!) was only about $3.50. They also had bottles of water going for only $0.25--nice to see a business not unreasonably inflating the price of a bottle of water in this heat! Will definitely be going back.
