Worst Costco I've ever been to. The lines here on a Monday at 3pm are double or triple what they are at the store on Bell road on a weekend. Super unorganized with everyone crashing their giant carts into other people trying to get a spot in line. The lines go back into the aisles, but some people curved sideway, can't tell which line is where. It's a disaster. I'd rather drive a half hour out of my way to go to arrowhead Costco to avoid this store.
