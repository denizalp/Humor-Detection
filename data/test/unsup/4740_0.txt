Personally I love LA fitness. It's a great place for me to go right after school. It gets VERY crowded between 4:30-7 as people get home from work and can barely get on any machines or benches. The place is full with meat heads who are fairly rude but I just ignore them. Overall great experience here for the last 2.5 years
