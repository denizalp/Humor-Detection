Was just here, picked up a fresh juice. It was tasty. \n\nThe cashier couldn't have been more unfriendly, totally flat and unwelcoming. \n\nI've been in the service industry for 8+ yrs even if you are having a bad day, you still have to suck it up, put a smile on your face and be nice to customers! \n\nSo juice gets five stars, service gets two stars.
