I have never loved a haircut so much till I got here. I read reviews here on Yelp and they didn't disappoint at all. I called to schedule for Kim and she is the nicest hairdresser I've had in a while. It's so hard to find a good hair salon but thank goodness for Isis. Shampoo, haircut (layers & side bangs), blow dry, straightened and styled with my thick, frizzy, long, unhealthy hair for $30? I'll be coming here from now on. Thank you Kim!
