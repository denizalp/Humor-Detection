This place is horrible. I do gel nails. I had to go through 10 colors before I found one they had. Once I had that they were running out. The UV light malfunctioned. The nail tech didn't know how to do the gel. I had nails 1\/8\" thick on some sides. It was awful. The owner redid them before I left but tried to charge me for her redoing them. Avoid this place if you can.
