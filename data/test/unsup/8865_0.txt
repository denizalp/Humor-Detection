As long as I get what I pay for,  what I want, when I want  & the way I want, I'm good, and 99% of the time they give it to me that way at this location. (I ALWAYS order soy, and when I use the next closest Starbucks, I am pretty sure that half the time, they give me regular milk and just tell me it's soy.)
