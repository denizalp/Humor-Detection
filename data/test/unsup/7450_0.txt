Divey? Sure, but not dingy or creepy, at least not at 1PM, heh! The ambiance was quite jovial with lots of natural light.\n\nYou definitely come here for the drink prices, reports of which are all true: $1.50 wells, $3 calls, $3 fireball, $2 Bloody Mary, $2 PBR with whiskey shot, $2 j√§ger, $4 patron.\n\nPretty smoky even with no one actually smoking - my eyes were burning. That's really the only problem with this place.\n\nOur bartender Cassie was great.
