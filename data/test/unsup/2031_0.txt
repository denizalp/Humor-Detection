1 star is too much for this extremely disappointing experience. Do yourself a favor and save your money. Even if everything was working it was still not worth the time and especially not worth the cost. The Marvel Experience was a Marvel Rip Off!\n\nEverything was grossly overpriced. Just glad I only wasted 40 on the ticket and not the 200 for VIP experience.
