The food was good, the vibe was also good. \n** Except there was a very unfriendly older lady taking my order. She seemed a bit annoyed and was just not pleasant nor warm.\n*** However, I will give it a second try at their Frank Lloyd Wright Location soon!!!. \nHopefully they'll be a bit more friendly there!!! I've heard wonderful things about this restaurant from co-workers, so I wouldn't want to give up just because I had a not-so delightful first impression.  :)
