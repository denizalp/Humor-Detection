Diamond in the rough.  This was definitely worth the trip off the strip.  We tried to sample as much as we could and loved everything.  The Pork Belly & Duck Baos are a must, as is the Shortrib grilled cheese.  Maybe a bit more pricey than you would think, but for one: it's Vegas, and two: it's worth it. The service was excellent; personable and freindly. I expect this place will do quite well with the quality of food and service. We'll definitely be back!
