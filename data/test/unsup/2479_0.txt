Scratch. From scratch.  Made from the basic ingredients. Not containing any prefabricated ingredients. \n\nKiller desserts, which is what I had here.  And good cappuccino.  But I wanna return for breakfast.  And lunch.  And dinner.  And dessert.  Again. But I think I may have picked up some calories from the air in this place.  Bakery air.\n\nPricey on the dessert though, but wonderfully yummy, made with care and tenderness and affection.  And sugar.
