I stopped in before work one morning about 7:45amon a week day, and I have to say the selection was disappointing. They had tons of kolaches, but I wanted donuts. I got a glazed and a sugar, they were about 90 cents a piece but small. They tasted fresh and were good but I could get the same quality in the supermarket. The guy that waited on me was pleasant but that's about all I can say about this place.\nI say skip it.
