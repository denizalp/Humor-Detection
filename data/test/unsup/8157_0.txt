I have been here twice now, and it is quickly turning into one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The menu is reasonably priced, the service is super-friendly, and the food is Delicious (with a capital D). The falafels are probably the best I've ever had, and the hummus tastes light and creamy. Plus they have a beautiful selection of baklavas to finish off your dining experience.
