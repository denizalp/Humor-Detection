There is an old line about a Fool and his Money that would suit this establishment as a name better than VTR.\n\nAs a former bar and restaurant manager and possessing over of thirty years in the service industry, my experience here was entirely mundane from product to service to atmosphere.  And at $18 for a cocktail, I need to be summarily impressed.\n\nSimply the most over hyped establishment I have ever encountered.
