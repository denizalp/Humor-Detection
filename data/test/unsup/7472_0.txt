What happened to the Duck Tongues at Kung Fu Duck?!\n\nThey are definitely not as good as before. They taste bland and boring. Where is the spices, the flavours and the aroma?!\n\nI think I made way better tasting duck tongues than those., just ask Sami E :)\n\nThe duck hearts though were good, thanks for Edwin A for his bravery. Maybe I would start making some duck hearts and at home.\n\nMaybe I can open up a Karate Duck one day selling my own tongues and what not?!
