As expected, the Marquee was very crowded and lively.  Maybe we were just expecting too much because of what we've heard about the place.  Do you know the feeling when you're expecting something super and it just doesn't happen?  Well, that was our feeling for the Marquee.  \n\nSince, it did not live up to our sky high expectations that evening....we can only give the place two stars at the most.  The layout wasn't good.  The music wasn't nice.  \n \nCan't recommend the place.....I must be getting too old for this kind of thing.  LOL
