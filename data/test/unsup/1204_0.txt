I can't give the Hall of Fame five stars because it cost so damn  much to get in.  I know they have a ton of interesting things to see, and I want to gawk at Morrison's boy scout uniform like everyone else.  But WOW, did it cost a lot to get in here.  If you're a music freak, this place is a must.  But if you're like me, a minor music \"enthusiast\" you might find a better way to spend your day and your money.  My husband liked it enough, though!
