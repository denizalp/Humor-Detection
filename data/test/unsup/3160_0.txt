May 2010 - Stopped in for lunch, ordered the quesadilla. It was served cold and soggy, almost like it was dropped in water or something. Totally disgusting. Asked for it to be returned and then ordered Beef Dip, again cold and the beef was loaded with fat chunks! By then I had given up and left only to be charged for both dishes! Will NEVER return.
