I was excited to eat here given how much I heard about it, but like a lot of hyped up places the actual food just wasn't as good.  They sounded so creative but flavor was just \"eh\".  We had the gyro's, burnt ends, shrimp and grits, and bacon jam.  However, the staff was amazing and friendly, and the beer we tried was great.  Good atmosphere for happy hour, but for dinner the flavor was just not there for me.
