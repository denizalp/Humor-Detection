LOVE THIS LOCATION!! I don't check in often, because I'm so focused on getting here, but I go at least four times per week. It's always pretty empty, but the smoothies are amazing and taste a lot better than Jamba juice. I love the half off Wednesdays and anything pineapple is great. Sign up for the rewards and you get free smoothies by email. I definitely recommend.
