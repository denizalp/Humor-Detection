A pricer place to eat but it is totally worth it! Food is made fresh and it is very good. I recommend the chicken parmesan meal with one of their ever changing soup options. They also do an excellent job of updating their menu with seasonal options. This place is usually packed no matter what time of day I go, so be prepared to fight for a seat!
