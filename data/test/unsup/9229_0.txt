This Coffee Bean is located in the Miracle Mile (Planet Hollywood). The location is a little difficult to find if you enter from the Casino part, but if you come in off the strip by Sephora it is pretty easy.\n\nThe staff is super friendly and they did a great job at making my drinks, they were consistent on every visit and fast. I recommend getting the Black Forest, it is a great blend of chocolate, coffee beans and cherries, be sure to ask for whipped cream!!!
