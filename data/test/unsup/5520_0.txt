It's currently 7:18 am and I have been waiting in line to make an order for a good 10 minutes now.  Not too sure why they would only staff one person on the shift at an airport location...don't come here if you are limited in time to board your flight!\n\nOkay: It's now 7:35 am and I was just told at the cash that they do not have matcha.  I was then forced to order something else.  Honestly, an airport location should have all ingredients on hand -- I am extremely disappointed.
