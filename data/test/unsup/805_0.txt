Great fast food sauce...hence SAUCE. The sauce is absolutely fantastic, most especially for a fast food joint. The chicken was bland, but perfectly cooked. The fries were absolutely atrocious. The bread was okay. The sweet tea tastes more like syrup rather than the classic smooth sweet tea that I remember from Alabama.\n\nThe sauce was so good I couldn't stop eating...I was originally going to save it for later :(...as soon as my sauce ran out I threw the rest away, because the fries were just that bad.
