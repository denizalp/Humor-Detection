A friend told me about this place. From now on I'm buying my bread here. They have my favorite bread for only a buck a loaf. Yes! You can get Dave's Killer Bread for only a dollar. They also have their signature Alpine Valley bread on sale for a dollar as well. Killer bread at a killer deal, it's almost criminal. I'll be a committed customer for life.
