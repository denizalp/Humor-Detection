Very nice hotel that is very close to the Cleveland Clinic. Not much close by but they had bar and restaurant in site as well as room service. A bit pricey but the food was good. \nDecent sized lobby and reception area. No store but the front desk had sodas and some snacks. Also a fitness center. \nThe rooms were really nice. Large with a seperate bedroom. Large refrigerator with glassware which is a nice touch. \nLiving room had a couch and seat with a TV and dresser. Along with a desk.
