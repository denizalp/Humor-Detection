I came with my gf and had a wonderful time.Staff was pleasant and friendly and was very professional.The owner was very nice & friendly also.\n I wasn't use to having a \"dry\" pedicure where there wasn't a foot bath but instead we got a exfoliation and a wet warm towel....which I pleasantly enjoyed a lot with the soothing massage.\nGreat for an express manicure & pedicure Kiosk experience.
