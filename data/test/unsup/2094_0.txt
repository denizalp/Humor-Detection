Good old Loop...\n\nI live a block away and come in a few times a week. A medium coffee is $2. Baristas are friendly. They've been playing a lot of Beatles lately. Before that, it was Tame Impala. Sometimes they'll leave a record on accidentally and you'll end up hearing Frank Ocean's \"Sweet Life\" nine times. But maybe that's why it's called The Loop.
