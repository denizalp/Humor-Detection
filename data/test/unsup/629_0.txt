Service is poor even on a slow day. Waitresses are friendly but not attentive at any time. Only 2 couples in the place but it took over 15 mins for our drinks which came after our food. We ordered 2 pnds of wings which I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Quick fry and just swimming in sauce. Gross even for pub-food.\n\nBut the student\/sports bar appeal is there. I could see myself agreeing to come here to watch a game over beer again. Drinks only though, food is not recommended.
