The manager here was very unfriendly and needs a refresher on AZ law. He wouldn't let my out-of-state friends in with me because they had vertical IDs, even though they were still valid and acceptable forms of ID. This law was changed back in April and when I showed him the updated identification requirements from the AZ liquor board on my phone, he scoffed at me and still wouldn't let them in. Stacy, please educate your employees on the new ID laws and make sure visitors from out-of-state aren't treated like this in the future.
