For a German (Bier) beer place you can only imagine my surprise that the house lager is...wait for it... Coors.  No, Coors is not a lager and I even question that it's beer.  \n\nThe inside looked fun and hip, but service was poor and slow.  I'm kind of holding a grudge over the whole Coors thing...
