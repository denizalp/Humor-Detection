Very classy ambience. They have a huge wine collection. You can tell by looking at the wine shelf. The staffs here are friendly. Even the on-training waiter looks very professional. \nEverything under oyster bar section in the menu is a must try. Chilean sea bass is quite unique. I also had 2 lobster tails, and they are huge. They're a bit pricey tho ($88), and the second piece wasn't hot anymore after I finished the first one (I eat faster than most people). But they are delicious, 5 stars.
