Dope looking restaurant, but unfortunately the 90 sanitation grade is not.  The lunch menu consists of salads and sandwiches, the waitress was nice and made a few recommendations but disappeared after she delivered the food.  The food came out pretty fast and my chicken sandwich was huge and looked great.  The chicken breast was very thick and chewy, they should probably use a thinner chicken breast.  The fries were pretty good, so just ok for me.
