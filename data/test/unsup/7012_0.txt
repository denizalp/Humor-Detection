Food over priced,  didn't taste bad. I am allergic to cilantro and i told them when i ordered. However they kept forgetting that.  Served chips and salsa, with cilantro. I ask for anything else, even tapat√≠o,  but got nothing. Then came my pozole, also with small bits of cilantro and was tiny bowl not worth the price. Finished my meal and my drink I ordered with the meal never came.  My $7 bowl of pozole left me hungry, going around the corner for pizza.
