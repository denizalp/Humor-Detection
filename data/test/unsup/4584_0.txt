Worst massage ever!!!! It wasn't relaxing at all. My therapist did not listen to my needs; she pretty much did her own thing.  The therapist talked a lot during massage; I'm not here to listen to your bull shits!!!! She was a sales person not a therapist!!! She was trying to tell me that I need massage every week for my back pain and I have a scoliosis!!!!!!!!!! Are you a doctor?!!?!?!?! Who are you to diagnose me with scoliosis!!!!! $20 Foot Massages are much better than this place or at least that person!!!!!!! Stay away from this place!!!!!!!!!!!!
