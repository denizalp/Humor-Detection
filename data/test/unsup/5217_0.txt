I came in to claim the free lunch combo promotional deal. There was a line outside with about a 20 minute wait. The advertised cut off time was 1pm. It was 11:45 and the deal was stopped. They said they were only making 140 pizzas so it was first come, first serve. Needless to say there were a lot of upset people.
