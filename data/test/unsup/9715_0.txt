Okay guys. Really love your place.  Love the food. But who is in charge. Monday the 11th of December walked in and walked right out. Immediately the very very strong smell of bleach was wofting. So strong immediately my eyes stung. I have asthma. It also set off an attack. Who had any brains to do that while you are open.
