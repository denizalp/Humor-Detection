Save your time!\n\nThere are about 3.000-5.000 people visiting this place every day! We went early in the morning and didn't have to wait in line. The place is much smaller than it looks on TV - and half the store is a gift shop with show memorabilia (bobble heads, t-shirts, coins, ...). The TV cast is predictably nowhere to be found. And from the stuff on display there was not a single item that I wanted. If i had waited in line for a while to get in I would have been annoyed.
