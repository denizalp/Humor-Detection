Excalibur Hotel is a giant, cheap motel. I have never stayed in any hotel \/ motel without a coffee maker! What kinda cheap spit is that?! The place wasn't exactly filthy, but it also didn't feel or smell clean. The temperature of the room was either really hot or really cold. The thermostat didn't do an actual, comfortable temperature. The bathrooms are also only okay.  Oh, yeah, no free wi-fi, even though it is the year 2014.  \n\n This place is cheap. That is the best thing about it. I would not likely come here again.
