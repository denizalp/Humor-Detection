Finally an authentic Vietnamese place that doesn't cost a second mortgage to eat at! Seems like the run of the kill joints overcharge cause they can then on top of that skimp you on the portions. Not VNB this place gives you your money's worth 100%. Waiters are attentive, restrooms clean and kitchen is always looking organized! I recommend it for yourself, your loved ones, friends family bring everyone!!! You won't be disappointed.
