According to legend:\n\nOnce a thriving Austrian restaurant, Hafbrauhaus was forcefully annexed by German Chefs, much to the delight of it's ultra-nationalist wait-staff. \n\nWehrmacht bussboys agressively marched into Hofbrauhaus to enforce the will of the new German management.\n\nIt's rumored that plans are in the works to expand into the Polish restaurant next door.
