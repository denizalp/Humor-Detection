All circle K's are not equal. Some are brand new sparkly testaments to convenience. This location isn't the cleanest I've ever visited for sure but also not the dirtiest. However this is a VERY old location that needs updating of oh EVERYTHING. I've been in there when they've run out of cups too many times to count, change, electricity goes out when it rains, ceiling leaks, bees all summer at the front door etc. Basically this location needs some TLC like yesterday.
