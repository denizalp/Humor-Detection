Went here for dinner and wanted sushi, but noooo way! Way overpriced compared to their lunch menu. Ended up ordering Chinese food instead. It was pretty good and cheap. My only complaint was that they gave the smallest scoop of rice. Couldn't they tell I was half Asian? I need a scoop of rice with every bite I take! LOL! Definitely go during lunch for the sushi bento deals.
