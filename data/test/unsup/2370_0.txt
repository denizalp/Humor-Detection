This will be quick since there's not too much to add over my fellow Yelpers - just some quick tips:\n\n1) Bring cash - their register is from the stone age and debit\/credit card machines were no where in sight. The prices are flat rate though - $20 for a large 2 topping.\n\n2) Do a walk by. Seriously if you're not in the area don't bother. They're notoriously bad with the phones apparently\n\n3) Be prepared to wait an hour for your pizza. They only have one stove.\n\n4) GET THE BACON. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GET THE BACON!!!
