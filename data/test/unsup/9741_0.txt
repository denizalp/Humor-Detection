I'm giving this place five stars, Solely based on my 7 year old daughter's liking.  After we did a round of mini golf and laser tag, just her and I.  We get done... I'm pooped from running around and her beating me at all games! We walk back to the car and she says in a loss of breathe voice, \" mom I really had the best time there!!!\" \n \n\nShe loved it, I kinda did too. But, it looked like all the kids there loved it. So being that the kids love it. Why not!
