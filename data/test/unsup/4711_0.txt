This Nobu was a huge disappointment compared to the Malibu and Newport location.\n\nI ordered 9 pieces of sushi for about $125:\n\nScallop (2\/5) - not fresh.\n\nUnagi (3\/5) - fresh, but cold and not grilled.\n\nAma Ebi (3\/5) - fresh.\n\nAma Ebi fried head (2\/5) - soggy.\n\nFoie Gras (1\/5) - it was cold and hard. So disappointing.\n\nWill not be back.
