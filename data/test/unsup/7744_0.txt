I've been several times and all have been an enjoyable experience.  The highlights for me are the Veal Meatloaf, the Gyro Tacos, Beet Salad and Bison Sliders.  Tried the Bacon Jam, but was not a fan.  The Strawberry Salad seemed a bit flavorless.  The service has always been great.  I've only been at lunch and I always go early.  The place is small, but seems to work fine.  Sorry I've missed Simon's other restaurants in town.
