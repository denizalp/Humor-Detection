Drive thru customer service was easy and efficient.\n\nOn a thanksgiving night, not much to choose from in fast food. But of course McDonald's is open! For that I am appreciative.\n\nBig Mac was yuck, but I love the fries! Best fries ever!\nWhat is the meat in that Big Mac? Sure doesn't taste as I remember growing up?\n\n Drive thru girl was sweet and they were very fast. So, thank you for feeding me on Thanksgiving!
