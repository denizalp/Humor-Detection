Pink box doughnuts are not your ordinary doughnuts. If you feel like going bold and trying some different doughnuts that your not used to this is definitely the spot to go. They have maple bacon, yes I said maple bacon with real pieces of bacon on top, smores, Elvis doughnut which has peanut butter and banana. My favorite one was the powdered sugar with cool whip in the middle, not too sweet. \n\nA dozen doughnuts cost about $8.50 which isn't bad at all.
