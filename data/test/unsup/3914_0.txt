I used Queen City Petsitting several times to watch my dog and never had any problems. The sitters are very friendly and professional and went out of their way to work with my crazy schedule to get oriented to my apartment and dog. My home was always cleaner than when I left it and my dog was always happy when I got home. I would highly recommend them to any of my friends (and already have!). Stacy and the QCP crew are great.
