The food here will not disappoint but it is on the pricier side just like anything on the strip. Portions on the salad and pasta are quite small. We had the beet salad with goat cheese (so fresh!!) and the tomato ravioli pasta. Service is very good too and it's a great excuse to check out Aria. I'd come back to try more of their food next time since we were in a rush and didn't get to fully enjoy our meal.
