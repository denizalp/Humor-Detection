We went here for a friend's birthday party. The pizza was good as long as it was warm, and the happy workers there were engaging, polite, and helpful. :) The laser tag assistants were friendly and the laser tag itself was a fun workout. Even the adults enjoyed themselves. We then played mini-golf, and it was fun watching golf-balls roll through tubes and cannons and laugh at our failing scores. However, the moving golf equipment sometimes malfunctioned. Overall, a great party and a nice place to have a kids celebration.
