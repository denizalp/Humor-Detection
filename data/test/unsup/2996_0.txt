Completely disappointed with this establishment as a retail bakery.  After 5+ trips and having no baguettes sold retail, stick to wholesale then and don't tease us with loaves on display that you won't sell. Plus calling your baguettes as \"baguettes\" is an atrocity. Might as well call 'em bread sticks. If I enter the 7th street public market again, I'll add a picture.
