Mike was excellent; very helpful and friendly.  Got my wife Monica the car she needed for her rental in a quick and timely manner.  Everything about the experience was smooth quick and friendly.  I believe Mike is the Manager and he has a great personality and works with you to get the correct vehicle for your trip.  Thanks so much and we will be back if we need a rental car again!
