I have had no issues with Embrace and their services. Any time I have a question or want to follow up on a claim I call and within minutes I am connected to a representative who is both informative and helpful as well as pleasant to speak with.\nI did a ton of research when I bought my cat to ensure that I was getting the right coverage and the right insurance company and I gotta say, I'm pretty pleased with my choice.
