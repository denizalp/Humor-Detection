This is a small place, which doesn't accommodate dining in really well. I get take out from here sometimes. It's pretty good. Not as pricey as some of the competitors in the area. They get pretty busy in the evenings, so even when i call in an order and show up 15 mins later, I still have to wait when i get there - other then that, i'm a fan and also a repeat customer.
