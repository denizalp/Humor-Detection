I usually go to All you can eat sushi when I crave for sashimi... Heard of this place, not all you can eat and a bit pricey... Finally gave it try. OMG! My money is totally worth it!! Especially the $75 sashimi... the fish is so fresh and just melts in my mouth! The portion is good but I just wish I could have another plate of that!! Anyone who loves sashimi has to try this place!!! Highly recommend~
