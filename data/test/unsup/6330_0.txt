Jenny was great! I am relatively new to the area and have struggled to find the friendly, reliable, and honest \"friend of the family\" feel in a seamstress. Jenny is just that.....not to mention talented and receptive to her clients request and vision. I would recommend her to anyone....she can work with all fabrics!
