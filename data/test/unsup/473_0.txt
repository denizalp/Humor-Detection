Another perspective occurred to me during my last trip to LAS. When I landed in Las Vegas, the Airport seemed bright, shiny, and timeless, similar to what I would soon experience on the Strip. Coming home, the Airport seemed worn and tired and I walked along to the Gate. The Boulevard of Broken Dreams? It's a good thing I don't gamble.....
