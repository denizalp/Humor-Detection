Amazing happy hour totally negated by a large group of off duty employees sitting at the bar being loud and obnoxious- one actually went behind the bar and got his own drink. Female bartender eating behind the bar and on phone. Huge beer selection, but beer wasn't nearly cold enough. Appetizers were cheap and tasty. What could have been a great experience was ruined by the annoying off duty employees at the bar. If you want to do Mellow- stick with the one on Mill Ave- they are pros and the ones at this location are clueless B-leaguers!
