If you're not a local, DON'T COME HERE. Sitting next to a local and their service was way better. Their food came out faster and the servers came to them 10 or 15 more times then our table. We ordered the short ribs and they got their short ribs in two servings before ours. OMG. The locals were literally 2 feet away from our table. Food was not that great. Philadelphia roll was the best. They honored my avocado allergy.
