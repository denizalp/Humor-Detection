Best coffee in town by far! We moved from Portland, Oregon where the coffee scene is competitive. This little shop could definitely keep up! They are true coffee purists so you are not going to get the extra sugar syrupy tastes that you get at other places. This is a must see in Champaign-Urbana!\n\nBesides the taste, the staff is so friendly and welcoming and the vibe is lots of fun. They also have all of the Homer Sodas on display so kiddos love it too!
