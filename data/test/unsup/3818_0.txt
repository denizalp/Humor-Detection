We ate here at different mealtimes to see how the food was. The salad\/fruit bar was AMAZING. The pastries and BBQ was also great. The Asian counter was iffy and the food was dry. The lines get long at prime hours, so eat breakfast early or dinner early to avoid the rushes. Overall, not a bad value at ALL for the food and the variety.
