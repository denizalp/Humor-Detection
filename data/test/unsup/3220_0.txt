Easily the best ice cream I've ever had. I love their Campfire S'more Sundae, complete with homemade marshmallows, but most visits I just stick to the salted caramel. It's pretty much the perfect ice cream.\n\nEverything they make is high quality, delicious, and they always have new flavors to try. It's become my go to when I want something sweet. Why bother with something that's not worth the calories?\n\nCan't recommend them highly enough. Cute little store, great ice cream, great service. Not a single complaint to be found. Great work.
