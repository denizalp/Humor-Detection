Wouldn't eat here even if it was free!!  Went there for lunch looking to support a local business.  BBQ was not good.  Huge disappoint.  Pulled pork was very salty, sauce was bland and tasted store bought.  Our coleslaw tasted days old and was very pickled. I ended up scooping it off my pork sandwich it was so bad.  Not sure what recipe they use for it, but I have never tasted any thing this bad. I love local businesses, but here is one place I won't go back.
