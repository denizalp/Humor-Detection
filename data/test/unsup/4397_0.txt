By far some of the best food I've had in a very long time. Every ingredient was fresh and well cooked to our liking. I ordered the Seared Sea Scallops and it was so delicious. The scallops cut so nicely and when paired with the pea pur√©e and asparagus, the taste was almost euphoric. Not only the food was amazing, but the staff was as well. Scott was a very sweet waiter who patiently explained the menu to my family, offering his personal opinions on each dish. The food, the ambiance, the staff, the view-- it was all exquisite.
