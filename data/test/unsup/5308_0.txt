I really appreciate Harkins as a brand in general. I think Dan has done really well for himself over the years with his establishments. Tempe is no different. I don't think the big screen is worth it, personally, because it's in a giant theater, and by the time you're pretty far back, the relatively distance makes it seem like a normal sized screen. Or you sit too close and what's the point, right? Their normal screens are already great. Food is not half bad. Keep up the good work, guys and gals.
