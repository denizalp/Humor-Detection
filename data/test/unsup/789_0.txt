Was very disappointed in the quality of the steaks. We ordered the prime dry age ribeye and it looked (and tasted) like a $12 dollar steak from a nearby super market. I couldn't finish more than half of it. Really was beyond bad. For the same price I would strongly recommend SW Steak. This place was embarrassing. Would give it 0 stars if Yelp would let me.
