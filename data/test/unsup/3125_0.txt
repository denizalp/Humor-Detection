I am a veteran using the GI Bill. I signed up to start school. They school decides to tell me at orientation that they are not certified to take the GI Bill. That Tuesday before orientation they said every thing was fine and I was ready to go to school. They have known about this problem and never warned me. Now I have to scramble to get enrolled in a school that fits my work schedule. The people that run the VA must run this school.
