Fairly good breakfast place in the valley.  Just a warning, it is typically very busy so plan to arrive early to avoid large crowds and long waits.  They do their best to get you in though!  \n\nAll the food is excellent!  The menu is a large array of breakfast favorite, southwestern renditions, and some unique items as well.  \n\nStaff is friendly and attentive.  Would highly recommend to anyone, better than Denny's or IHOP.
