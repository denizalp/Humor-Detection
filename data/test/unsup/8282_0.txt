Wow! Is the word that comes to mind when I think of this place! Eating at Pampas was my first experience eating Brazilian food and I loved it. Our waiter Jorge, was very welcoming and informative something that was tremendously helpful during my first visit. I will definitely be back for more delicious Brazilian food!
