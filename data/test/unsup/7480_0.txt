I tried to make an appointment on a Monday morning.  I called the number listed and a very...\"I hate Monday's\" voice (Jan) told me that she couldn't talk but would call me back.   She hung up as I said my name and number to the dial tone.......Nope.  She never asked my name or number and I did not get a call back.\nI don't have the time or energy to beg for an appointment.  I won't be calling back.
