Holy Louisiana Style Hersey Squirts!!  This place gave me the flaming runs!\n\nThis location was a little messy, bits and pieces of food could be found at all the tables.  Service was fast, staff was friendly and efficient, and the food was tasty but greasy.  Super greasy!\n\nI forgot what my subordinate ordered, but it came with some chicken and he enjoyed the meal, and I ordered the popcorn shrimp.  \n\nOverall a decent location if you into the greasy kind of food and my subordinate says the chicken is the bomb!
