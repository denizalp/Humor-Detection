Bradbury's has been rocking my pour over world lately! \nMy cold brew world too. \nMy muffin world as well. \nAnd on some days, my scone world.\n\nIt's worth noting their early am hours, as I'm not sure anything on the square is open 6:30am 7 days a week. Today when I rolled up at a quarter to seven, warm cherry walnut muffins were coming out of the oven, trans\/electric music was blaring, and I felt like as the sun was rising I was in my own arty independent film until a couple came in abut twenty after seven.
