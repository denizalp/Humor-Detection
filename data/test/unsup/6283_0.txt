Hell to-the-motha-f'er yes!!!\n\nThis room made me want to sleep with Mr. Wynn on top of the tower while shooting the next wynn\/encore commercial.... just to say thank you. \n\nThe tower suites were bomb! The lobby\/special service for the tower suites were bomb! The folks there were bomb! The little bathroom amenities were bomb! (and smelled good) Robes: bomb! View: bomb!Everything there was BOMB! (enough explosions for one review)\n\nIf ya wanna be high rolla.... go there.\n\nOh, and Danny Divito was in the room next to us. Sa-weet!!!!
