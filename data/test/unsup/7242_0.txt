We had dinner.we had to wait to be seated when the restaurant only had about 5 tables. I had to ask for their hot sauce twice .they gave us two basket of chips for a party or 5 and never asked whether we wanted more .I ordered the green chili and the pork was WY overcooked , the sauce was flavorful their taco meat way way too dry and it took about  10 minutes for the server to pick up the check  the bill had tips calculated for 18 and 20 percent. I would not plan on going back
