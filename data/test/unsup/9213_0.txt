I stopped here to get a quick bite to eat.  Popeye's is consistently one of the best fast food chicken around.  It is at least one star better than KFC.\n1.  The coating is tastier, I like the spicy\n2.  The coating is crispy.   KFC original always comes out soggy.   Their extra crispy has little taste except salt\n3.  The people behind the counters seem to be more organized and speedier in delivering food to a long line of customers.
