Eh, I feel bad for ol' Dairy Queen. I'm surprised they can still compete with McDonald's, Cold Stone and Gelato joints. DQ was like the ultimate treat when I was a kid, but now I'd only go there for reminiscent moments or desperate need.\n\nBasically, the ice cream is over-priced and this particular location is a tad dumpy. I got the hot fudge sundae and all I kept thinking was...'shoot I should've gone to McDonald's they are 1\/3 the price and I get nuts!'
