The review is for a restaurant, although, frankly, I'm confused why you'd combine an Italian restaurant that serves very comfort-food dishes with a night club. It's not like you can dance to the techno as you're eating. So what do you do during the dinner portion of the dinner? Stare awkwardly at your party because you can't really talk. \n\nThe food is fine, although a bit too salty, and expensive. But the atmosphere makes the place rather unbearable.
