Guy guarantees it's the best pizza you'll have, and I can't say I'm quite on board with that claim but it is pretty darn good and I'll be making many repeat visits.\nQuite pricy -- but this is to be expected for a small independent pizza chain.\nStaff is very talkative and remembers you. They have good intentions but it can be overwhelming while you're waiting.. at least for an introvert like me ;)\nWings are pretty good too, but I prefer St. Louis. Better wings than most pizza places though.
