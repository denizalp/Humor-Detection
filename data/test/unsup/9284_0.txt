Not gonna lie, this place is pretty awesome.  I'm sure there may be something on the menu that doesn't meet the 5-star criteria, but personally, I had a braised short rib and avocado cheese crisp with a couple of grey hounds, and that was delicious!  The chips are a step above MANY and MOST other restaurants and the salsa and guacamole is simply superb.\n\nIf you are disappointed, you are either a snob, or you got bad service.  Our waiter was great, and had plenty of patience for how annoying we probably seemed. ;)
