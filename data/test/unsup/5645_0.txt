If you need a shirt pressed no problem,  but if you actually need something cleaned go elsewhere. I took an expensive, only worn once, bridesmaid dress here to be dry cleaned. Obviously the dress had stains on it from the wedding food and drinks. When I picked up the dress and got it home there was a note on it that said \"Ran it twice, couldn't fix the stains\". What!? So they charged me $$ for not doing their job? Took the dress elsewhere with no problem, and no more stains.....
