This gem of a restaurant has become our go-to place for dining out in the southside. We just had a family party there last night, and as usual the food was just superb. Great intimate setting... owner\/chef is very accommodating to individual tastes, serving both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Hint: Don't pass up on the beans and greens!! Service is awesome too. You won't leave hungry here! Highly recommended.
