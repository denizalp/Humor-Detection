BabyStacks! Get some pancakes, upgrade if you order something else! \n\nThere is a huge selection of pretty unique pancakes and flavors. I got the macadamia nut & white chocolate, it was okay but the banana cream pie looked so good :O\n\nAdobo Fried Rice was a generous portion and done well. First time here and I'm a fan, will come back to try some more food.
