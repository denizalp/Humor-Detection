In my research of escape rooms I have enjoyed this place the most consistently. I have done all but one of their rooms and have enjoyed each one, Mapuche the most. I'm not a fan of their walkie talkie's but I can over look that part because the rest of the experience is so well thought out. I have brought friends coming in from out of town and they e enjoyed this place as well.
