I have been receiving water at home by Sparkletts Water for over a year now. Their service is always professional and I am in love with it. The water they provide me with is always water that's cool refreshing and good. Their is no after taste and they also have other drinks they bring from time to time like tea, and crystal light. The water cooler is fun to use because you can use hot or cold water and also its easy to keep clean.
