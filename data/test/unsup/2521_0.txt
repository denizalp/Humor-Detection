Visiting Toronto from the states, found this place on Yelp due to the great reviews.   They weren't wrong!!!   Staff got us in at the last second for dinner, friendly, welcoming.   The atmosphere was a mix of exotic sexy warm sophisticated.   The food was incredible!!!   We ordered several things to try, they were all fantastic but what I will crave most when I think back to this trip was the dumplings and the cauliflower.   Drinks and desserts were excellent, nothing bad to say, everything was amazing!
