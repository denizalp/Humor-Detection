What I want to know is WHERE IN THE HELL are the old owners??? This USED to be the best Pho in Vegas, but since the new owners came in sometime ago, they lost that title. Service wasn't attentive, but not terrible. The texture of the chicken in my pho ga was similar to jerky. i am still on the quest to find where the old owners of Da Lat went. I think it was somewhere on the east side. If anybody knows, PLEASE contact me! I need the quality of old school Da Lat.
