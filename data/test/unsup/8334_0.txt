Ok, here's a hint to the pharmacy staff:  if you've got a guy sneezing and coughing holding every cold remedy known to mankind, for the love of all that is holy ... stop what you are doing and attend to the register. Five people all moving like lightning filling prescriptions for customers that won't show up for hours (because there was only three of us waiting in front of the register) and nobody wants to keep the spread of influenza to a minimum?
