Dignity Moving was such a pleasure to work with- they are efficient and so friendly! They packed up our furniture nicely and delivered it in a timely manner. These guys never stopped working the whole time they were moving our furniture. I definitely recommend working with them. They are respectful, professional, and nice!  Their prices are affordable, and their service is great!
