Al & B's is located in the old location of Sirus Pizza.Dont expect to find all kinds of neat d√©cor because this is a HOOD BBQ joint but its very good.I had a rib dinner with peach cobbler and it ran me a total of 12 bucks.The food comes out hot and the meat isn't drenched in sauce.The service is good so yall go out and give Al & B's a try.
