I used Platinum Rides and they are awesome! Joey the owner helped me out when I was in a bind to get a party bus for a Cardinals Game and he got me one last minute. Even though we went over and were charged for over time, he even worked with me on that. I will use them again and I recommend using their Limo or Party Bus Services here in the Valley. Thanks Joe!
