I lived in Japan for 2 years and loved the katsu curry.  Often the problem with katsu curry in America is that the pork is tough, but that is not the case here!  The katsu curry is spot on how they make it in Japan.  Yelp led us to this restaurant as we were waiting for a flight and it was on the way to the airport.  \n\nMost of the items on the menu are katsu related.
