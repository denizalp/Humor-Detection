First off this is not traditional k BBQ.  So don't expect it to be authentic. That being said. For what it's worth is pretty darn good.   You can eat anything you want as many times as you want.   Not like some other kbbq places (cough *honeypig).  Granted the meats are not all authentic traditional Korean marinades. They are still tasty.  Especially the smoked pork belly and the #3 sliced brisket.
