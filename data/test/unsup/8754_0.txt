Yep, I'm the guy who had a pumpernickel bagel before heading to the dentist. But it was a decent bagel and re-toasted properly. The jalapeno cream cheese does have some go to it.\n\nGood coffee as well.\n\nIt's a small place but it does a decent amount of business and it's definitely inexpensive.\n\nWifi works well.
