I visited this bar buring my dbay on 7\/17. Locals were not friendly at all and the slinky looking gogo boy made a huge deal when I pulled out my camera to take a pic. Believe me, I just wanted to share with my friends the sadness of gogo boys that this bar had. My intentions were not to put up a shrine for you, you are not La Virgen de Guadalupe you are much closer to depiction from El Dia de Los Muertos.\nI will definitely not recommend this establishment to any of my friends here in SF.
