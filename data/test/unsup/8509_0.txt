4th Street is a bar which seems to be having an identity crisis. here's what it has:\n\n- upscale yuppie bar look\n- lounge-style lighting\n- pool tables\n- sit-down dinner area\n- bowling alley lanes\n\nwhile it did have an extensive drink and food menu going for it, the wait time on a Friday night (when it was BARELY packed) for our drinks was uncalled for.\n\nseriously, I could've gotten my fat ass over to the bar, poured myself a beer, finished it, and poured\/finished at least two more before our serving wench got me my second drink.\n\nperhaps it was the heat causing the malaise.
