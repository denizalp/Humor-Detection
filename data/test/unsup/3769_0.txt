I'm involved in an ALS clinical trial at The Mayo Clinic and this has become my favorite spot for a meal afterwards.  My family and I have been here at least 6 times. Good margaritas, great food, friendly and timely service and reasonable prices.  I highly recommend the Green Chili Chicken Enchiladas.  My favorite.  Oh ya, all of the tacos are yummy too.
