I went here twice while on vacation in the Phoenix area.  It's awesome that they have so many gluten-free options (I think everything on the menu is gluten-free, except a gluten-filled pizza option).  I was so excited to see a gluten-free bread basket but the bread was really disappointing.  I had to cover it in oil and butter and salt to make it taste decent.  I have had some decent gluten-free bread (like Against the Grain baguette) so I know it's possible!  \n\nThey did handle allergies very well though, and their gluten-free pizza was good!
