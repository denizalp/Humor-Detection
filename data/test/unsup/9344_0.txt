Stopped by here for my first time and ordered take out. Italian food is usually best when eaten fresh and hot, not 45 minutes after being prepared. I ordered the chicken parmigiana and I couldn't have been happier. The serving size was large and the meal was absolutely delicious even though I took it to go. The cheese was perfectly cooked on top of the chicken, and the chicken was perfectly thin and breaded to Perfection. Next time I come back, I will definitely dine in so I can enjoy their culinary experience!!
