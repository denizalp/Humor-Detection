This review is solely for this specific location. Walked in hungry for a delicious sandwich. Lady behind the counter greeted me, and then proceeded to cough all over into the open air. Seemed to be a smoker's cough cause it continued for the entire 3 minutes I was there (just long enough to realize that a capriotti's sandwich didn't sound as good as I thought).
