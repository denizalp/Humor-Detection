I walked in to your shop today fully prepared to buy a bicycle. Unfortunately you were to busy talking about how your I presume to be owner of the store... Didn't pay his taxes for the last two years. \n\nI presume because you didn't see me when I walked into your store... That you didn't see me leave either.    \n\nBad business guys.
