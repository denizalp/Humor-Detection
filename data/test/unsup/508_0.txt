This review is not based on the coffee or the food, because I haven't tried those yet, so admittedly it's pretty limited, but I had a lovely tea and enjoyed the various seating options that felt intimate and also open to schemes. The decor is totally lovely and the colours are soothing and inspiring. The location is great, right by Beaubien metro. Most importantly, the people working there have such nice smiles and are so kind the their regulars.
