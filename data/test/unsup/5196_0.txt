I'm sitting at my booth now, but I had to take a moment to say how incredible the service has been so far. \nI got a salad and forgot to say no onion, tomato or spring mix. The manager, Nathan, saw me picking it out, came over to offer to have them remake. It was my error and he was so intent on making sure we had our food and that we were happy. 10\/10 will come back. The waitress is also incredible. Best chili's experience.
