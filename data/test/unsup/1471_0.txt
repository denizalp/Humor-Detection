I'm a fan!  I love Eastern Carolina BBQ and this place nailed it. Don't come here for anything besides the BBQ (pulled pork). It's what they do best. Tender, juicy and oh so good!  Sauce is on point too. If you don't like vinegar you don't like this kind of BBQ. \n\nSome of the best BBQ in the state is King's BBQ in Kinston, NC. This place is giving them a run for their money and hands down is the best in Charlotte. Can't wait to be back.
