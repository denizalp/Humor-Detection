Gen is a great BBQ restaurant! I went there with my friends, and all of them does like Gen's food and  service, especially a waitress whose name is Kailin! She did an excellent job that was  attentive with us, and provided quality service that exceed our expectation! She just came up with an unforgettable night for us! I love Gen, and say thank you to Kailin!
