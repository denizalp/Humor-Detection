Dr Wallace and his staff are amazing! We had a very bad experience with our puppy at a previous vet and came to VCA for a second opinion. Dr. Wallace took the time to do a thorough examination and answer all questions we had. He explained the process of the tests needed and what they would tell us. Pricing is certainly within the norm and the staff make sure you fully understand each procedure (and cost) before performing it. We will certainly keep coming here!
