Came here for the pancakes but its only served on Sundays.\n\nWe ordered the inari bento, fried saimin bulgogi. \n\nThe inari is soo good. You'll just have to try that for yourself!\n\nThe fried saimin is yummy, comes with the potato salad and kimchi. A bit salty but good. \n\nIts a little pricey but it's still good.
