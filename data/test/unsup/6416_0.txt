This has got to be the BEST Lebanese restaurant in the WORLD. \nYou like Basha or Amir's? Oh my, if you are ever downtown St. Jerome, go to Arousse. A small shish taouk sandwich is $8 and a large (I MEAN LARRRGE) is $10. \n\nHubby & I LOVE IT. Definitely return worthy and most of the staff are super friendly too.
