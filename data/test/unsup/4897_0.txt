Came in early around 11 on a weekday. Was treated by Sam who was very nice, and helpful. Especially when my 9 yr old almost ordered very hot tacos. His advice was VERY much appreciated there! He was kind enough to put the spicy sauce on the side so my son could actually have fun trying it. His thoughtfulness made my son's experience here. The food was very enjoyable the location was dead though.  It could also use a cleaning. Yes, this is an indoor-outdoor location but there was truly an excess amount of dirt and grime.
