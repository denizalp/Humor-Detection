Went to this location based on the reviews it has and was not disappointed. Keep in mind because of it's popularity that there is a wait time. When I went i just waited approx. 45min. We were walked to out table with a cold water jug waiting for us. Service was excellent and welcoming. I hope that the people who give a low rating to this location get exploring diarrhea. :)\n\nI would recommend this place and happily return.
