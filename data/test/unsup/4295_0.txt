Hey Yelpers,\nThis place has a huge menu of both Thai and Chinese.  Reasonable rates, good portions and tasty food.\n\nI ususally do take out from here.  There are no other reviews, so I thought I would add something...  I haven't been here in a while, but would definately go back.\n\nI think they have good lunch specials, too.
