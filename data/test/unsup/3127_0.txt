Man, burgers are expensive these days! Big Smoke certainly gives you enough to write home about though! \n\nThe Craft Burger was loaded with mushrooms and the patty was nice and juicy (Seriously, the juice was dripping out of the burger) and the bun is nice and soft, though a bit small compared to the burger as a whole. I had onion rings on the side and it was the BIGGEST rings I've had (that's what she said). Drinks are also re-fill-able. \n\nA lot of people were ordering poutines, so I gotta give that a try next time!
