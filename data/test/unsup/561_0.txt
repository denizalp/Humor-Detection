I went online looking for affordable Halloween costume store in my area. I found Halloween express, I drive across Vegas knowing that they open at 9 am. I arrived at 945am and the place is still not opened. If your going to be open only for a few weeks out of the year. Hire employees that care about being on time to work!!! 10 minutes is ok. An hour plus is unacceptable!!!!!!!
