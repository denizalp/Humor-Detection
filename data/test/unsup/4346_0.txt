After a long few weeks looking for an apartment, I ran into the Avilla apartment homes. This setting was perfect for me. I was met by their Leasing agent Kristal Miner, she provided me with essential info for the complex, kept me posted on my application process (with no surprises) and made the experience welcoming and easy. Look her up if your interested in this complex!
