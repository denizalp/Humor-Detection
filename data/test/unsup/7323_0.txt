Phenomenal experience for the whole family! It's amazing because you're right in the midst of an urban setting but the prairie is native and the setting is stunning. My daughter loved seeing the turtles floating on logs and the rabbits hopping along the trails. We became a member on our first visit. It's a great organization to support.
