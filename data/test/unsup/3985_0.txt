I was told theres only junior stylist today when i booked an appointment. When i walked in and get a haircut nobody informed me anything and i got charged for senior stylists haircut when i leave. Pretty much a rip-off. $60 plus tax and tips, no shampoo. The haircut only took 30 mins and I wasn't satisfied because feels like I was getting ripped off. The stylist was friendly, but will not go back again.
