Wow\nWorst service ever\nWe came in and sat down and no waitress ever came by to visit us\nWhen we finally asked for a waitress she came over and asked us what do you want\n\nOur response was menus would be nice\nNo refills of  water we were just pretty much ignored the rest of the night\nWe put a credit card down to hold open a tab\nThen tried to pay cash and that confused the waitresses even further\nAs I write this review we are  still waiting for the cash and the credit card and a manager it's been 15 minutes
