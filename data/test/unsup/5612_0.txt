This is indeed one of my go to spots. The one recommendation I will give you is to call in your order. You will indeed have to wait. Most of the tables are taken by people that are waiting for their food. \n\nThe pricing is great and the food is awesome. I can say that I might have eaten everything on the menu at least once.
