The hype on the brisket sandwich is true.  It was very tasty and I loved the bun.  It does come slathered in BBQ sauce... a lot of BBQ sauce but it's still very good.  The mac n cheese side was done correctly and a very generous portion.  A can't wait for their new location to open down the road from me on rainbow and windmill.
