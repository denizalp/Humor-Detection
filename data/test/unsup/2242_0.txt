Chose this restaurant based off of the Yelp reviews and my friend's Google search. We were looking for food our first night in Toronto and this spot was close to our place. The service was amazing from the time we were greeted and seated at the bar until it was time to leave. The food was AMAZING and the price was reasonable (based on the taste and quality I would expect it to be more). I also appreciate that they served sparkling water which tasted great as well. When I'm back in Toronto I'll definitely be coming back!
