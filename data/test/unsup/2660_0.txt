OK so funny story: Went here on a date, the date dint go so well, free expression of ideas and half way through I was eating by myself, lol. I guess the server felt bad so he brought me couple glasses of plum wine on the house, exactly what I needed! So I stayed, finished both mine and her plates and had desert. The food was good, the sushi was a real nice quality for Montreal, and everything was presented really well. The pricing was fair as well, definitely recommend this place.
