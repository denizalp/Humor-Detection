My friend and I went here earlier this week and had an awful experience with the server. We asked another server for refills, she promptly brought them and sent the manager to our table. We explained what happened and we were understanding because the server was relatively new. The manager comped our entire meal. This is not what we were expecting nor wanting...we simply wanted refills. I really appreciate that the manager went above and beyond for the customer.
