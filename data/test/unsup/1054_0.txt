The Playa receives 5 stars for the ultimate, unequaled dive bar experience. The Playa is the unmatched champion of dive bars. If The Playa were a Star Wars movie it would be The Empire Strikes Back. In all seriousness, if you are looking for a bar with cheap drinks, pool tables, sometimes a DJ but always a great juke box, and no effing judgements, The Playa is where you need to be. The bartenders are awesome and the bathrooms are clean. (and in case it gets too real, there are security guards)
