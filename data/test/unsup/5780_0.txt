Excellent customer service & delicious baked goods! Jay gave us an educational tour & showed us the ropes of the bakery. Non GMO, preservative free is exactly what I was looking for & they delivered! The cinnamon rolls were mouthwatering, the 9 grain bread & French bread divine. \nWe took home some frozen spelt bread that I can't wait to try. We will be back!
