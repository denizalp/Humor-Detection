This place looks like Candyland. I'm a dungeons and dragons junky and even I think this place is tacky. \nRooms are very out-dated as of 2011 and there is security at both towers, making it difficult for men to hire consenting adults to visit them.\nThe valet is a bit of a cluster, though self-parking is often a fast alternative for a woman on a tight schedule.\n\nThere are a few decent and discrete rendezvous spots in the casino itself.
