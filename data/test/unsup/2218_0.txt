Security personnel extremely rude. The custodians, not sure if thats what they do at the airport, were stationed at one spot pretending to be cleaning tge floor, harassing passengers at 3am, extremely disrespectful, did not care about sleeping babies who were with their families sleeping on the floor. Stated they were working and wasn't their problem. Truly awful people this airport has working here.
