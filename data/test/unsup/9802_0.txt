I had a craving of bbq ribs. So my husband brought me here. The ribs were a little not too much tender. The chowmein was good. I liked the steamed veggies.  The service is good but waitresses dont smile. I like to smile to my customers. Thats why I notice that a lot in a person when Im the customer.
