This is a late review but\nNo Hanukkah items at all.\n:( \nEven pier 1 had menorahs. \nReally expensive menorahs.\nI came looking for candles.\nThey didn't even have bags of gelt. :( \n\nI looked really well and asked an employee. \nWas super bummed. \nI actually couldn't find them anywhere in Las vegas so if anyone's knows let me know hahaha\nSo easy to find in La. I got a menorah and candles at a food for less in south central.
