I wish they had a bigger dancefloor. This place is awesome but they let too many people in and it's starts to get unbearable with the amount of people. Security also won't let you stand in the only open space that is a walkway:\/ so unless you get a table of make friends that have a table be prepared to get pushed and have people spill drinks on you
