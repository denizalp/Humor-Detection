I'm not sure what all the hype is about this place. I was looking forward to a good New York style bagel after reading all the good reviews. However I was a bit disappointed by the bagel itself, it was a little doughy. I got a ham egg and cheese bagel sandwich and they kinda of skimp on the ham and eggs. Their cream cheese was good though and you can tell they make it in house. Overall it was good for the price but I probably wouldn't come back.
