It's not cool that you tempt me with slot machines the minute I arrive in Vegas AND when I leave! Horrible, but I like the way the people who built this airport think....slot machines! However, I dislike that I have to walk through the airport to get to my destination and....the hungover people who could possibly puke on me after a long night of fun before leaving Vegas...uncool. The baggage claim takes forever, so I think putting slot machines as a concept to suck people into spending their money...damn you airport!
