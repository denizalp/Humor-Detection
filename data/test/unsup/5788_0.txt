A word to the wise, get the pomegranate margaritas and get them in a pitcher! \n\nThey seriously serve up the best margaritas ever. \nI love the duck pond! When I first tried this place I was sitting outside with some friends enjoying a beautiful Arizona day noshing on the Mexican fare, when two crazy ducks came flapping by our table and rolling on the ground in a fight\/mating dance! \n\nThe food is amazing, I love enchiladas. Try the Seafood ones on Monday nights, YUM!
