Extremely overrated. There is most of the time a ridiculously long line, and the prices are more expensive than other shacks.\nThey were the first ones in this part of town which is why they are so popular, and the creative name helps, but they deliver the same product other places do, and sometimes the other places are even better.\nPlus their cream sucks.\nIf you drive past and see there is a huge ass line, keep driving down the street to horizon and green valley, and you'll find frost bite. Less crowded and in some ways even better.
