This one of the best smoke meat sandwich delis I found  in Calgary. Their sandwiches have the authentic Montreal style flavour you expect when you bite into a loaded sandwich. Just the right amount of meat &mustard on the right kind of rye bread.  \nThey have a reqular style poutine loaded with real cheese curds and a yummy gravy, also another loaded with chunks of smoke meat.\nAtmosphere is great with friendly staff. A little  bit of Montr√©al away from home.\nCheck out their menu for more great options  available.
