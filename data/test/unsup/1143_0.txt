So glad that they finally opened their new location! For months I've been enjoying the terrific huaraches, tacos, alambres, and other Distrito Federal (DF) style fare that they've been serving at their old location and this new place is more easily accessible and has better parking. And the service is just as friendly and the food just as tasty and inexpensive as in their older location. Looking forward to many, many repeat visits here. (Note: for now they accept cash only; eventually the option to pay by card will be available as well.)
