I love everything about Leroy Fox, including the fact that it's less than a mile from my house. It's a place that both my fiance and I can agree on. I like the crowd, the service is friendly, there are both healthy and not-so-healthy options, and it's a great place to bring out of town guests because it has a lot of Charlotte charm. It's a wonderful place for fried chicken, mac and cheese, or a yummy salad. Leroy Fox has my vote!
