I happen to run into  this place after an afternoon at the four seasons center for ballet. We were hungry and looking for a place to eat and it seemed great, the pies looked beautiful and we decided to give it a try. The place was kind of small but cozy. The pies tasted great but it was a bit on the pricy side ($8).
