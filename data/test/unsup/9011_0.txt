Who would've thought I could be easily amused by a bunch of wax statues.  This is a great place to check out when you need a break from the hot weather.  The museum is interactive and you are encouraged to take pictures with all of the wax statues.  A camera is a must as there are a lot of opportunities to take some hilarious pictures.  Price is a little high so be on the lookout for coupons or discounts before going.
