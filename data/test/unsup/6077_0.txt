Gym is ok. Fitness membership is a decent price and so is the MMA membership. Equipment's alright, but a lot of roids dudes overtake all the weight equipment. Yoga instructor Sandy is really good. Come here if you want to see a lot of strippers working out. I go there because the two Goodlifes in the area are filled with mould and are gross.
