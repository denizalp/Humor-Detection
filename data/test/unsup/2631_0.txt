Finally no line! Was able to pick up a post-pool afternoon coffee today as there was no line. I usually get my coffee in Tower 1 Starbucks. The Baristas were friendly and efficient and my drink was great. I pay with my phone and feel bad that at this Starbucks they have to key in the number manually. \n\nThis location is right by the food court on the main walkway from the casino to the pool (closer to the pool side).\n\nDOS 8\/29\/14 2pm
