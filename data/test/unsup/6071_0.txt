This was the first Baton Rouge that I've ever been to and I sometimes return to it.\n\nDuring a recent visit, I ordered my usual which was ribs with an all dressed baked potato. Service was relatively quick for a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant wasn't too crowded.\n\nThis Baton Rouge is located inside Complexe Desjardins but the entrance to get inside from within the mall is a bit hard to find due to some construction inside the mall so I entered from the outside on Ste-Caterine Street.\n\nDon't really have any complaints about my experience at this Baton Rouge.
