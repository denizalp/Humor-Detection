I liked this place, the lunch was good, and a nice portion size.  The decorations are cute. It's a nice crowd and friendly staff that gave us suggestions on what to visit while in town.  I had the chicken salad sandwich and salad for like $10. I wish I had saved room for the pies that sounded delicious!
