Found a drop off box located on Lake Mead behind a grocery store.  They have several drop off boxes just go to their website. It made it very convenient for me to drop off clothes.  You cant miss the lavender colored Donation Box the says,  \"Safe Nest\".\n\nSafe Nest is a 24 hour shelter for women who have suffered domestic violence often they have children with them.  I hope the clothes we dropped off are picked up in a timely fashion and provided to women and children who are in need.
