i am a 72 yr. old female who has been under the care of gastroenterologists since i was 20 yrs. old. Dr. N. Zitomer is by far the most compassionate, caring, empathetic, and understanding dr. i have seen over  many years, and i cannot praise him enough. he listens to me, he hears what i have to say, and i won't allow myself to think about who will take over my care once he retires. he is the very best of the best!
