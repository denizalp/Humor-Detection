I love, love, love this place! Not only do they carry the highest quality dog foods, they have some interesting toys, great service and wonderful staff. As a positive-reinforcement trainer, I love that they refuse to carry any punishment or aversive tools. They are one of the few stores in town committed to creating safe, dog-friendly environments for the animals they serve.
