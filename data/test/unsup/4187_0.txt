It was horrible. They ran an ad in the vets thing for buy one get one free. So we decided to try it out. It was horrible. Food was nasty service was horrible!!!!! Beer was warm all around do not stop there. I rather go to Taco Bell and I hate Taco Bell. What a horrible waste of money and two hours of waiting!!!!!
