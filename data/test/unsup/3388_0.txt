Visiting the Galleria Supermarket was a pleasant surprise.\n\nWe went in to kill some time before a movie but found a treasure trove of Korean and Japanese products.\n\nWe were even able to find a wide selection of Asian gluten free products.\n\nThe place had a very large amount of stock for a convenience store, but it was well stacked and product just cried out for us to take a look at it.\n\nThey had a good selection of fresh foods and baked goods as well as fried foods and candies.\n\nA must visit for people looking for some unique product for these areas.
