Good food but the owner threatening the chef in the middle of the dining room make this a non-returner for me.  We all heard the owner tell the chef that she would fire her if she took her cut hand to the doctor, was unacceptable, not only is this a public display of a civil rights violation and completely illegal, but it is the kind of atmosphere that turns your stomach no matter how good the crawfish dip is.\n\nShame
