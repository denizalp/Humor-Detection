I like that they sell the reeds for reed diffusers separately ($2 for a bundle of reeds)\n\nI like their new scents, (pink champagne is a nice fruity grapefruit), and I love that their lineup of scents are very citrus-family friendly and makes for great room diffusers.\n\nHowever, I've never bought anything in the store...the style of the stuff here doesn't really jive with my style and I think a lot of the furniture\/pillows here are overpriced for what you get. \n\nHowever I love the scents here and would be coming back to get candles and such.
