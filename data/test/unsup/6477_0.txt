I bought a Group on here and stopped in a week ago to finally use it before it expired.  I loved the atmosphere, it reminded me of my party days!  The sandwiches were very good and toasted, the bread was MUCH better than what you find at any of the chains.  The veggies were fresh and the meats were tasty.  I wasn't a fan of the brownies, they tasted like box mix.\n\nI'm sure I'll stop in for a sandwich again next time I'm in the mood for a fresh made sub.
