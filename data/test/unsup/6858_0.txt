The prices for breakfast is pretty inexpensive and they did a good job renovating the restaurant but that's where it ends. Food was mediocre at best. The eggs had zero taste and not a fan of hash browns even though they weren't as greasy as some other establishments. Coffee was good and the bacon was a thick and was the most flavorful on the plate. Service was standard. Nothing memorable. Again, it wasn't horrible, just mediocre and boring.
