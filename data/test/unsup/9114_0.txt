My grams surprised me for lunch today. How sweet! She chose Uno's, I think they should change their name to Ohno's. \n\nHad the chicken sandwich, bread was stale. Grams had the fish and chips and they never brought her ketchup or vinegar even though she asked 3 times.  Her friend ordered a deep dish and the bottom of the pizza was still doughy.\n\nI don't think this place will ever get it right.
