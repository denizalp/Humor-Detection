First of all, I love that it's open 24\/7!\nI was craving donuts and I went on yelp to check out the reviews. They were horrible. I was a little eh about coming in here but thankfully I didn't experience what they experienced. \n\nIt's my second time coming here now and the customer service is by far the best I've had in any donut shop. And they give out free FRESH warm donuts!!! YAY.
