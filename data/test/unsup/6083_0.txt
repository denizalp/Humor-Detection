I love Boba and this was the first place I've ever been offered basil seed.  It was amazing!  However, the flavor options are limited and menu vague (you have to ask for what you want instead of what is advertised).  Workers are overly chill (pun intended) - there are no Boba places in the northwest and there is so much potential in this area.  I hope this place researches what they can do to make Business Great.
