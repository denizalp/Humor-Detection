First time to Gen on a Friday night, party of 6. The restaurant was clean and the food delicious! Ozzie our server was super friendly and very helpful with picking out what cuts of meat to try. Our favorite was the #10 (forgot what type it was). The beef tongue was delicious as well. They split our bill easily between the 3 couples which is much appreciated. Will definitely return!
