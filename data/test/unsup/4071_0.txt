Horrible. No A1 sauce. Manager said it is too expensive to give away. A cheap knockoff is all you can get. Food was average tonight. Chopped steak and roast beef cold. Mac and cheese is not only cold but very dry. Sweet tea is good so is soft roll. I won't be back at this one until someone contacts me and says they have A1 sauce. Food is expensive at k&w. Don't mind that but they should have steak sauce like other restaurants do.
