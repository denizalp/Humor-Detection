My local burrito joint. We go quite often with the kids. Highlight is the salsas. Rojo and habanero are the best two. In my mind a good burrito needs good sauce and this sauce is damn good. I usually get the nevada burrito and the kids always get bean and cheese burritos. Tortillas seem home made but probably ordered from a local maker. Either way they are done right. Staff is friendly and the food is consistent and fast. As far as taco shops go this one is a winner. 4 stars when compared to others of its kind
