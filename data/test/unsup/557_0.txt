Cute restaurant in my old neighborhood. Staff was super friendly, easy ordering. the food was yummy, got the Chicken Curry and the Shrimp Katsu. Like I said they were both tasty, crunchy not greasy, but I felt like you get a small protein portion (3 shrimp-15$)  for the price. I was overwhelmed by rice though and was eating it for days.\nI would go back but not often, I can get a lot more food for the price elsewhere and make my own rice at home.
