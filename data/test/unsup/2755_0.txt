Had a wonder dinner here on a Tuesday night.  The hostess said there was a 20 minute wait but it actually turned out to be only 5 minutes.  Killed those 5 minutes with a Green Flash single hop pale ale.  Ordered the mole chicken enchiladas for my main which was great with a side order of the fresh roasted jalape√±os!!!  The advertised ghost chilis fresh salsa was did not include ghost chilis but I'll give them a pass as it was fairly late in the evening.  All in all, a very solid Mexican dinner...
