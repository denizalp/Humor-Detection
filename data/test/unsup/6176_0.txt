This was so disgusting. I never write reviews but after throwing out a lunch that I just spent 14 dollars on, I thought I would try to save as many people as possible from making the same mistake. I ordered the jungle lemongrass chicken box to go. The sauce was so gross and the worst part was that the chicken isn't even peices off chicken breast- I am pretty sure the chicKen was the kind that you can cook in 2 minutes from frozen- it was rubbery and nasty. Overall, really disappointing.
