This review will be quick and to the point! Lilly is a chocolatier in Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood that also serves alcoholic beverages. Do I hang out and drink in candy shops personally? Nope.  But I do buy chocolate for my wife on special occasions.\n\nGuys, if you want to look like a cheapskate go to the drugstore and buy her a Whitman's Sampler.  If you want to buy her something unique & tasty, and score yourself some thoughtful points, go to Lilly!\n\nNot kidding,  go do it!
