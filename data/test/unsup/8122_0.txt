Having been stranded here for 7+ hours due to noob weather @SFO, I'd say this is the most dangerous airport to be stuck at.  Surrounded by slot machines taunting you with bright colors and broken promises...this is where some serious damage can be done (as if you're not already a loser to the casinos).  \n\nSo what the heck did I do?\n\n- EAT\n- Slot machine\n- SLEEP\n- Slot machine\n- EAT\n- Slot machine\n- Ride the tram a dozen times and SLEEP\n- Slot machine\n- EAT\n- Stare at empty wallet with sad face\n- Slot machine\n- Laugh...cry...and laugh menacingly...and cry\n- SLEEP\n\nI'll never forget it.
