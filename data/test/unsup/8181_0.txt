My first hand experience:\n\nOrdered a banana and peanut butter sandwich with a caramel apple milkshake. I never received said order because when we went on lunch to pick it up, it took over 30 minutes.  Seriously, over 30 minutes to make a PEANUT butter sandwich? I called the store and asked for a refund due to non receipt. The guy didn't even ask why I wanted my money back and said \"reversal done\" and hung up. I was sure to inform my coworkers and will not return.
