Went to this location today for an oil change and basic maintenance. The staff is incredibly friendly, all of them! When they walk by you thy smile and acknowledge you and look genuinely happy to be working there. They were also incredibly quick, I think I was in and out of there in 30min. I will be back for a smog check and other services as needed.
