A fine bar and a fun place to hang out for a bit but it's by no means a nerd bar. There staff are clearly just a bunch of posers playing like they are needs because \"nerd\" is what's cool now. If you want a real nerd bar try the \"Mellenium Fandom\" on Hoover. However if you just want a fun gimmick bar to shoot some pool at or something. This one will do fine.
