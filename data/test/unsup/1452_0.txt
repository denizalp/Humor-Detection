I love this particular Trader Joes location..it may take you a bit to find parking but once you're in the store and all done with your shopping, you don't have to wait long before walking out with your groceries.\nI don't know what it is about Trader Joes hiring practices but they seem to have it down to a T.  It's like they found the trick to hiring the most genuine and friendliest people in the neighborhood at every location- I love their staff!
