One WORD:\n\nseedy  \n\n\/sede\/\nAdjective\n\n    Sordid and disreputable: \"his seedy affair with a soft-porn starlet\".\n    Shabby and squalid: \"a seedy apartment building\".\n\nWhew, this place is like a Nascar race meets a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert meets Midevil Times.\n\nI have to admit, it looks pretty cool from the outside, but once you get inside...it's a dive.
