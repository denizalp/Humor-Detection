Great group activity, for sure!\n\nGet creative, think deeply, Untangle clues, everything has a reason..\n\nEach room has a distinct story behind it and each clue opens up to another clue....20 some figured out clues later you are FREE!! Goal is to escape the room in under 60 min with 3 or less clues! A totally different way to team build and create team morale!
