Saketini opened not too long ago, so they're still having grand opening specials.  Get 'em while they're hot!\n\nI haven't had their food yet, but I have partaked in their fantastic drink specials.  They have $2 well drinks for happy hour.  Woo hoo! Plus they have a reverse happy hour too, which scores them another star.  Any place that offers late night drink and food specials is alright in my book.  Once I try the food, I'll be back and I'll update the review.
