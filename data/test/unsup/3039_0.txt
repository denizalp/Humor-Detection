Wow. Super good sandwich. I got the Viet Special with the jalepeno and siracha. The spiciness level was not too hot, enough to be pleasant, but I like spicy. Everything inside was very flavorful and balanced. The baguette was crispy, but not enough to cut your mouth. The side cabbage salad is a nice little add-on, assuming you like fish sauce. Price for everything is very fair. Not enormous, but a solid meal. My only regret is that I have but one stomach to fill. I can't wait to eat there again.
