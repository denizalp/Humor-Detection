Excellent buffet with great service. Super inexpensive for $18 per person!! The buffet at Excalibur opened up on dec 23, 2014 and we visited it two days later on Christmas Day. Everyone in the service team was excellent - ready to spring into action as soon as you ask for anything. The food options were amazing - freshly made crepes, pastries, freshly made omelettes, fruit, oatmeal, Latin food, desserts - you name it!! We were totally not expecting such good food. Good job, Excalibur! Hope you keep it up. :-)
