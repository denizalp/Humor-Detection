My first time here and I like it! Not a 5 star salon but Bongju Kim gave me the hair cut I wanted!   If his wife didn't wet my blouse when she washed my hair, I would have given them a 5 stars. She was nice but not too gentle when she washed my hair. I felt like my head was inside the washing machine!!
