First off the instructors are amazing! My son loves everyone he's had as they rotate depending on time and schedule. From Sacha to Scarlet etc. He want from being scared to get his hair wet to now a fish in water in the span of two months or so. Each one is playful and makes the lesson enjoyable. They know his strengths and weaknesses. Would highly recommended learning here.
