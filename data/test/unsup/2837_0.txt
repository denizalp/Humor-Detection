Food was great, service is crazy slow.  SLOWWWWWW\n\nI wouldn't complain if it was super busy. However, it really wasn't.  Our waitress was in fact very friendly, but it waas painful.  45 minutes to get our food, we ended up going to the bar to get our own drinks. this was *after waiting 20 minutes for a table and there waas many empty ones while we waited. \n\nit's just not worth it.
