A small booth in the Bally's new bazaar shopping area.\n\nThe staff was friendly and took the time to perfect the waffle.  Even offered to add extra items to make it more delicious.\n\nWaffle was quite pricey at a little under $12, but the worker filled it up with strawberries and bananas.  Way more than the picture.
