Been to this place many times, and I've never had a bad time.\n\nIt gets mad crowded sometimes, and the stairs when you enter are a bit of a hazard.\n\nBUT.\n\nThe music is great and the crowd is great.\n\nIt is a bit pricey though for the village.\n\nDrinks are almost 10 each.\n\nCover is usually around 20.\n\nBut come on, it's babylon!
