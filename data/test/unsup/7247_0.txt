We went there since it is near my new favorite deli NYBB and wont go back. Not many people in the place but it took 45 minutes for eggs and one of us got the wrong order. The female manager barely apologized and did not offer to do anything about it and since it was soooo late - they got nothing...The bagels were horrible.
