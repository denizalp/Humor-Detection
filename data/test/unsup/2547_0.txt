Well its ok to stay at. Not very clean sometimes. Restaurant is a joke and very slow. Veggies with dinner came out cold and no butter. Plan to sit and be ignored for a bit upon arrival. The beds are not very good. No bath towels one visit and thank you for the wash cloth after noticing soaking wet. Toilet wobbled bad and scared the crap pit of me no pun intended. I stop there as all the places around this area suck. Have fun.
