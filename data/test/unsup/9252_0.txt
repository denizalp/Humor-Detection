I tried this place for the first time today since I live right across from it and honestly don't think I will go back. I tried the sliders, the ribs and chicken fingers. All of them were not very good the sliders tasted old like they had been leftover from a few nights back. The ribs were not very flavorful and were really dry. The chicken fingers tasted like ones that come in TV dinners. They were really soggy. Definitely would not recommend going there.
