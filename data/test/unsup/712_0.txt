Went this past Friday and atmosphere was great. Drinks were really pricey for Chandler. We're not in Scottsdale or Vegas! Drinks were good though ( you can actually taste the alcohol and every element in the drink description is present ). We ordered 4 appetizers for 4 people and food was delicious, but was still hungry after. Granted appetizers aren't supposed to fill you up, but I was expecting more food on the plates coming out. In the end, 7 drinks and 4 appetizers later, the bill came out to $150 including tip. The struggle is real!!!
