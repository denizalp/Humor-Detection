Dammit. Thought I wrote a review for this forever ago. Maybe not so ill keep it short. \nHIP HOP ON THE STRIP!!!!!!!\nOk. I'm done. \n\nThis club is a little small for vegas standards. I went here on Halloween ( a few years ago so sorry for the delayed review) but I remember really enjoying the music and the party people. This would be included on my favorite night out should I come back again which I have plans too soon. \n\nSo yay for good music.
