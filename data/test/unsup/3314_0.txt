We will return.  Here on a Wednesday night awaiting the bull rides. Numerous beers on tap.  We walked up to the bar to get our own drinks and we went out to the seats to watch the amateur bull riders.  There were little fires throughout the area to warm you on a cool night.  You can make reservations to sit in their \"skybox\" for a $10 fee per person to watch the bull riding.  Or just sit in the stands for free.
