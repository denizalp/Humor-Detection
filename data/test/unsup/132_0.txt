So the new location is less Mall and more professional feel to it.  For this visit I was actually having them sell a piece of jewelry. The piece was actually acquired from them, so I was thrilled when they indicated the market had picked up and I'd probably make some money on the piece.\n\nFolks are very professional and also personable.  I just wish I hadn't moved way.  Great company for many aspects of jewerly acquistions.
