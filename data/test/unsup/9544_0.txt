Kickass bar, no complaints, except that we only had about an hour to spend there.\n\nWe were nuggets for beer, ended up here.  Got some white ales with orange slices, tasty and refreshing and light.  Got a taste of a friend's Leffe, tasty and thick and smooth and wonderful.  Our friends forgot to tip the bartender before we got there, and we *still* got service.  How much better can it get?\n\nThe noise level is completely manageable.\n\nAnd the answer to the most dire question of all: yes, the fire in the fireplace is real, it's just gas-burning. You're both right.
