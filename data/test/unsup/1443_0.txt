Always a great place to have breakfast & the service is excellent. The pancakes are amazing but if you're looking for something healthy they're great at that too.\n\nI have had their french toast and their pancakes and they're both top notch. Lately, I've been eating extremely healthy, so I had an egg white omelet \"made to order,\" and it was amazing.\n\nOnly bad thing about this place is that it's so good, you'll definitely have to wait for a table on the weekends, but it's worth the wait.
