Absolutely fabulous! Carly was so detailed and accommodating with the design I wanted. I got a gel manicure and I couldn't have asked for more. This is my go-to-spot now because I'm sure Carly will be able to do my nail art that I've been looking for a long time :-) \n\nWith the design I got, no embellishments, it was $45 dollars well priced. She checked in with me throughout the process of my nails, which I really appreciate. \n\nI hope she sticks around a lot longer! Hooray!
