No service. The waitress pushed the foods of last guests to my friend's legs. The foods were served on the edge of the table, she didn't even bother to put in front of the right person. Wrong order. Why do we queue for a hour anyway?\n\nAsian restaurants these days near downtown are spoiled.\n\n没有这个服务水平就不要开，何必呢
