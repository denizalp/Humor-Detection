This place is awesome! So much to do and see and eat and drink!\nPerfect for group gatherings. They had a hoolahoop contest, a limbo contest, boxing ring, ping pong, and so much more. The drink list is AWESOME, you can get a 16oz or 32oz, but I'd recommend the 16oz because you gotta try something new each time you order a new drink! I highly recommend the Raspberry Gimlet, Peach Cobbler and Hillbilly Tea. The staff is great and the atmosphere is wonderful.
