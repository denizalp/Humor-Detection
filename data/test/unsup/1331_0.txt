Having lived in Tokyo for 2 years, I tend to be picky about my sushi (#sushisnob). But this place is impressive! We collaborated with the chef in setting a price and preferences. The salmon with fruit was my favorite. Table consensus loved the steak as well as the white fish with cilantro and jalape√±o topping. Wished they severed sake in a standard small glass or masu (wooden box) but the dry sake served was so good that I didn't mind.
