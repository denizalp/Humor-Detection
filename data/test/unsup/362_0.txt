Extremely offended. I walked in to look at engagement rings and wedding bands and before the sales lady even said hello, she told me a pawn shop might have something more in my price range. Apparently, if you wear a hoodie, you don't have enough money to shop there. I wouldn't give them business or the time of day after that.
