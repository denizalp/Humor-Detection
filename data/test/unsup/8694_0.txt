My husband and I are from out of state and we wanted to have a nice quiet dinner at a locally owned restaurant. The environment was clean and comfortable and the staff is exceptionally friendly. The food was great and our waitress was very pleasant. The prices were also surprisingly reasonable. If we ever find ourselves back in Charlotte NC. again, we definitely would go back to this restaurant.
