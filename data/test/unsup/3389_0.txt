Booked it last minute for Ironman Wisconsin.  My hotel rating is simple. If is a place I will go again it's an automatic 4 stars. Clean room gets a 4 stars as I don't use anything else in the hotel. I sleep, I shower, and I use the internet. Bonus point for microwave to heat up my Chicago pizza. This place also has stove, regular size refrigerator, and dish washer.
