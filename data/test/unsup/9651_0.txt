My most favourite tattoo shop ever.  Very professional, but fun!  I enjoy going there as much to socialize as I do to get tattooed.  \n\nI have been going to Teika Hudson for about two years now and consider her my artist.  However, my mom recently got tattooed by Jess there.  I accompanied her and she was great too.  Very patient with my tattoo virgin mother who was squirmy.  I enjoy chatting with the artists that work around Teika and I'd happily have any one of the artists there work on me.  \n\nGreat shop.  Clean.  Friendly.  Excellent tattoos!
