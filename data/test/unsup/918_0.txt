My favorite Best Buy store. Associates always knowledgeable, friendly and items I am looking for in stock. The manager steps right in when there is ever a problem or question his guys can't answer. I am shopping here for years, all my computers, printers and appliances are from this store.\nI have visited other  BB stores, for get it. This one is the best.
