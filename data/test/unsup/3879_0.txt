I was craving Vietnamese food and decided to come here....this place is nice and pretty upscale.  The food is pretty good.  The bun (noodles) with catfish is to die for.  The bun with grilled meats and shrimp was pretty salty.  The eggrolls ain't all that.  The spicy chicken tossed in fish sauce, oh so yummy...may sound gross but man, this is bar food.  Yeuummm!\n\nIf you are looking for the vietnamese cafe with the dripping filter, this is the place for you.\n\nThe service was very friendly and attentive.  I will be coming back here again!\n\nHappy Eating!
