If Sapphire is the Costco of Vegas strip clubs, why isn't it less expensive?\nDoesn't matter - this place is great!\nBig = more choices \/ variety of girls!  A BIG plus!\n\nMale strippers = waste of time.  Girls look ever so much prettier in g-strings.\n\nWhy 4 stars, you ask?  Not enough pole dancing.  LOVE pole dancing!
