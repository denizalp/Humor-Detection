Really nice stadium but gets hot and humid really quick. Please either open up the roof or control the air properly. The footlong hot dog is a great deal and you can add a lot of toppings so make it your way. The beer selection is pretty good actually and the location of the stadium is perfect right down town. Easy to get to by mass transit and well maintained stadium.
