Wow. This is a super efficient store! \n\nI walked in with my package ready to go, but the guy asked several questions, had me confirm the name and address to make sure he got everything right and asked if I had any questions. \n\nI left confident that my package would be delivered to the right place on time! For that alone, it's worth the extra money...compared to USPS. \n\nIf I need to mail something again, I'd visit this location!
