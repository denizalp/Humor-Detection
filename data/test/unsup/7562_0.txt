The staff here is always super friendly and my dentist which seems to change every time I come back is thorough with her exams and game plan on what should be done to keep my teeth in its best shape. They do a great job at handling my teeth and I don't ever feel uncomfortable when they are working on my chompers. The office is very \"modern\" and kept in great care. I've also noticed this office is very involved with community drives which i love. Gives me another opportunity to give back.
