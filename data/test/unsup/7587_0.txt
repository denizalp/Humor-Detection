You know that guy you dated who is really cute and really smart, but he smells or he's bad in bed or he's got a personality quirk that you just can't accept?  That is this restaurant.\n\nI've been here twice now.  Awesome atmosphere and the food is great.  I'm being generous about the food because I only ate half of my nachos.  They were too greasy because of all the pork, but I think if I ordered it without pork or only half, they would be good.     But the service sucks. Both times, it sucked.
