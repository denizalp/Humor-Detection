We went here for our Anniversary dinner in January.  Loved it and our server was great.  For those who haven't been yet, they have it set up so that you cook your own food in a little pot on a burner in front of you.  This was fun and unique so we enjoyed it, but it's definitely not somewhere you want to go on a time crunch or anything.
