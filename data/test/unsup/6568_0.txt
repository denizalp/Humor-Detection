Cheezy movie theatre entrance. Food service quite slow. Waited more than hour for food. Plastic plates and you need to shine your silverware with the napkin. Son asked for make your own pizza but they make it. Previous establishment had real make your own pizza that the kids loved. Wife (40s) with pre teens was refused beer due to lack of ID. She should be happy! Was not a good first impression of the newly opened restaurant.
