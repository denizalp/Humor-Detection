The food is quite tasty!  As a vegetarian it's often hard to find lard free beans, but they have told me twice that theirs are.  They are quite yummy, so it's hard to believe!  We have eaten here several times and enjoyed it each time.  My husband has tried several things, including the steak burrito and shrimp tacos, all to his delight.   The salsa is really good too!\n\nWe like to support local businesses and it makes it much easier when the food is this satisfying.
