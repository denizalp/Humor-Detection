They don't actually make coats at this Coat Factory so it's false advertising.\n\nWe had to look around because she wanted something furry and fluffy that was not actually made of animals for the winter. Didn't find anything that was both cheap enough and sexy enough, so we ended up getting a coat elsewhere.\n\nIf you dig through the racks, you can find some cute clothes here at good prices. They also have some cute shoes, but then so did your grandma.
