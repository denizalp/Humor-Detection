Definitely lives up to the hype!  We visited Sprinkles three times on our recent trip to LV.  We sampled red velvet, coconut, black and white, orange, carrot cake and milk chocolate varieties with red velvet being our absolute favorite.  We took advantage of the cupcake atm and absolutely loved the concept.  We will definitely visit Sprinkles every time we're in Vegas.
