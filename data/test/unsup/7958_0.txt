I'm writing this quick review solely to get it out of my list-of-what-to-review.\n\nThe doughnuts here were:\n- Fresh!\n- Doughy!\n- Cheap!\n- Had an assortment of interesting flavors!\n\nI LOVE THIS PLACE. Better yet, it's open 24 hours! Moments like these make me seriously ponder if my clothes will fit by next season. \n\nSpecialty. Classic. Gourmet. All at comparable prices. Check it out yourself so you can see the different selections they offer.\n\nThe store front itself is very cute and attractive in my opinion. +1
