Maison Martin Margiela is one that every man should have in his collection, if he's grown that is. Not loud and good all year round I like it manly during cold months. I don't think so but Weirdly.. Jazz club could also be a Lady Boss who wears super tailored pant suits to work and does not bother drinking wine at parties but can hold her scotch and cigars! I would rather my woman wear Funfair Evening by Maison Martin Margiela as a everyday sent.
