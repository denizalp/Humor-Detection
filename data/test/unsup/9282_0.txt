We moved from California about 8 months ago and found this place for our son to go to. So far it has been great! The teachers are very caring and attentive and he is learning a lot. It's always hard to bring your kids to a new place, but the teachers here made that transition easy for him. I'd recommend Peace Garden for your childcare needs.
