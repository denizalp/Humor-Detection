Was with the homies for a homie's birthday and we heard Can Can Rooms annoying advertisement on the radio and decided to stop by to buy the birthday boy a couple lap dances.  And as soon as we walked in and met with an older female..\n\nTHERE WAS NO ONE DANCING OR ENTERTAINING.  NO DANCERS AT ALL.\n\nBusiness was definitely open because we were able to walk in.  I'll stick to Rhino where a Yelper works.
