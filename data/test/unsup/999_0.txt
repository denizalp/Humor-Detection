Austin Walkin Cane put up a mean performance tonight! Our server was super-friendly and accommodating, given today's finicky tastes. Definitely should try the jerk Seared tuna sandwich. Crabcakes, ceviche, and conch looked ultra-tempting going out to the neighboring tables. Boutique wines availed themselves, making decision-making  a treat! Kudos!
