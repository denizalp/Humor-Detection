Gullifty's closed yesterday to make room for an expanding non-profit organization...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/stories\/local\/neighborhoods-city\/gulliftys-restaurant-in-squirrel-hill-is-closing-701052\/\n\nI've been reading and hearing that Gullifty's was middle-of the pack, but the last time Kay and I went, the food and service were both sterling. I'm sad and surprised over this closure as I've been with all the others recently, but at least in this case gentrification wasn't to blame. Reading between the lines, I'm guessing the owners simply want to retire after having been in business for over 30 years.
