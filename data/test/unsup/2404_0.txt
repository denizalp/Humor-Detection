A group of us needed to find a last minute place to get breakfast and we randomly chose Butterfield's based on convenient location. We made a pretty good choice. The service was fast, efficient, friendly. The menu was extensive and well priced. One day, when I've given up on life, I plan to go back and order the oreo cookie pancakes.  They look amazing. They also look like they'll probably kill me.
