This place is amazing!\n\nMe and my wife have been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. \n\nWhile everything is great I have fallen in love with the enchiladas (especially the green sauce) and the the cheese crisp. \n\nPlease be aware there is almost always a long wait (30 minutes plus) but it is well with the wait. \n\nAlso great place to take out-of-towners.
