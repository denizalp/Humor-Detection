We were arriving in Boulder City later in the evening and were looking for a place that served salad.  The Chicken Shack had a tasty Salad with either Grilled or Fried Chicken strips.  The Service was quick and the staff were very friendly.   It was easy to find from highway 93 and the prices were very affordable.  Definitely a classic family style drive -in and restaurant.  The kids will love the squeaky chicken restroom key! :-)
