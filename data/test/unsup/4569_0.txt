waiter dropped my wallet which was ON THE TABLE. Question: how do you drop someones wallet off the table. You would literally have to pick up my wallet and drop it. \n\nThen she recklessly set it back on the table. She literally fucking puts my wallet on my plate of food with tomato sauce. My MK wallet was dipped into my plate filled with tomato sauce. What. The. Fuck. I told her what she did and just gave me a napkin from another dish that was on my table. What. The. Fuck.\nThis place deserves 0 stars if anything.
