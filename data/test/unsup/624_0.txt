Total dive diner with big, deliciously greasy portions, great service, and a good value.  Hungry Man = three eggs, six glistening bacon\/sausage, hash browns\/home fries, toast and all you can eat pancakes for $8.99.  You'll keep coming back and getting fatter until your mobility scooter won't fit.
