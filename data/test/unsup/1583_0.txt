Don't let all of these reviews fool you! They changed management a couple months ago and they are awesome! Very helpful, understanding, great maintenance staff, referral program, pools, easy access to mountains for hiking, and the best part is the price cannot be beat for the amount of square feet! I currently am in the older phase and love it, 850 sq. feet, one bedroom! I'm glad this is my current home!
