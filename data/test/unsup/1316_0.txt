Been riding Calgary Transhit (not a typo) for over 10years now and in this decade the buses have always been late when I'm early and early when I'm on time.   I've seen drunk midgets fighting, had my car stolen twice from the ctrain parking lots, seen some of the ugliest graffiti tags, drunk people falling off the train platform on to the tracks, kids stealing bikes, watched a cop car crash into the train cart I was in, and the list goes on...on a scale of 1 to 10 I would give you a ...negative 4
