John did a good job of making me feel comfortable during the massage. I also appreciate that he asked about the pressure level I prefer. The room was a comfortable temperature, well decorated, and the music was not distracting. I like the little things like giving me a bottle of water when the massage was over. I have had massages that run short, but John's service later the entire 60 minutes even though I was a little late. I would definitely recommend him to others.
