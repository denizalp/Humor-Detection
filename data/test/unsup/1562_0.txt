Was there with my wife and a friend, we were there for dinner and a some drink. We had some great fresh sashimi, sushi and their hot dish are stunning!\n\nThere are many sushi place out there but this place turns your sushi into art. It's so beautiful that makes you want to look it a longer period before tasting it. See pictures yourself!
