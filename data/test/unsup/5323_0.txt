Really disappointing experience. The barista had clearly no idea how to make a flat white. I think he misunderstood it for a latte. The coffee was extremely weak. \n\nAnother major issue are the hours. The target audience for this shop are rich housewives who have nothing else to do while their children are in school. But when I get home from work, they are already closed. \n\nThe design of the interior is nice.
