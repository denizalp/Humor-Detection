This place was great! I'm use to looking for restaurants on the strip when trying a new place, but this was a great choice. The shrimp and scallop vodka sauce pasta was delicious. Everyone in my party enjoyed their dish. I recommend Mastironi's to anyone who loves pasta and wants to stay off the strip!
