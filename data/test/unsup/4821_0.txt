People passing through YYZ are harder on Apropos than I would have expected! I love the iPad ordering of caesars, fizzy waters and weird little snacks before flights. There's tons of seating, and the staff are all smiles. \n\nIt's true, you definitely have to be tech savvy to navigate their system with ease, but if you're not, calm down. There's a very obvious Request Server button front and centre. \n\n\"Travel safe!\" -Everyone's Mom.
