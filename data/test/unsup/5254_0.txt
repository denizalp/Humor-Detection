I don't know.....  I got the New Mexico plate which consists of a chicken enchilada, chile relleno and pork tamale plate and it tastes just like Mexican food to me.  My husband got the meatloaf with green chili sauce and two eggs.  He said it was really good.  So I'm kinda torn of where I stand on the review so I'm in the middle.
