We came here one time before and love it. This time we showed up and asked that they pick recommendations for our group and the entire staff took advantage of our request and picked the most expensive items on the menu regardless of our taste. It was the most expensive experience that we've had and made it for a very disappointing experience.  Furthermore we left the table still hungry.  We won't be back.
