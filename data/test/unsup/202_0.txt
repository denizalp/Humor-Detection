My star rating is not due to the food. We had AYCE sushi and it was very good. Fish tasted fresh and there was a lot of choices. Price was reasonable. Restaurant was clean and the ambiance was enjoyable. The problem was the service was painfully slow. It took 45 mins after ordering to get our first roll. There is a 90 min time limit on AYCE. Getting our check dropped off and picked up also took WAY too long. I might come back if I have a lot of time to kill.
