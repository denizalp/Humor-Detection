I came here for my two puppies vaccine and they give you a free first check up for up to 3 different animals! The veterinarian answered all my questions clearly and they even narrate exactly what they're doing to my pets so I can stay calm. The only downside is the lobby, it's quite uncomfortable and there's just one small TV facing the front desk.
