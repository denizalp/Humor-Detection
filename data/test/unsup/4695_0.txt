Dear Baja Fresh,\n\nThank you for saving me from so many hangovers each time that I have stayed at the Excalibur Hotel in Vegas.  Your food is not so greasy that it makes me gag, but it is just greasy enough to soak up the excess alcohol from whichever club I had partied at the night before.  Thank you for making me quesadillas with extra cheese and for including guacamole in the price.  \n\nI love you,\nCourtney
