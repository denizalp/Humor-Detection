This is definitely not the place I will come every again.  Service here is horrendous.  The cashier was horrible, I decided to leave my purchase and go to the Scottsdale store.  My husband was amazed I didn't snap at her, due to her language.  I told him, he cramps my style.  I have to be in my best behavior in front of him, haha.
