Amazing. Great little spot with a fun, casual atmosphere. Also love that as long as you avoid the peak dinner hours there is very little wait for a table. Delicious Thai food. We love the pad thai bolen and the mi ga ti is also delicious. The portions are a big smaller than typical Thai fare, so be prepared to order an extra main or a few app's to share. Family friendly: Would be on okay spot for older kids but not toddlers as seating is stool seating. Tight downtown spot and carriers would be preferred to strollers.
