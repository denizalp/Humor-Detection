Fast service, inexpensive good. My favorite is spaghetti nights!  I absolutely LOVE the spaghetti. Big helpings and plenty of sides!!  The sweet tea is also to die for. You won't walk away hungry...unless you get the chili.  I got the Cincinnati and it was horrible! No flavor, I couldn't even finish it after 2 bites. The cornbread was hard as a rock (twice) and flavorless.
