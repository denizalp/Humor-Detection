Ducked in to Presto for a quick bite. I ordered the one Vegetarian item on the menu. Its a sandwich called the \"veg head\".  I asked for no cheese and had it vegan. It was good but without the cheese its a little on the light side in terms of ingredients. The bread was tasty and toasted. Overall, this sandwich joint would be better of there were more vegan options.  A vegetable soup would be nice. Overall, I guess Presto is basically good for a meaty lunch.
