I was surprised to see this place is being remodeled, nice floors and tables...more light! The food was waaaay better! New manager, she's so sweet and made sure everything was good, and the cook, Norma is awesome!  The salsas I used to hate here they we're watered down and bland,  NOW THEY ARE GOOD!!! and this is coming from one Mexican girl who loves and knows authentic Mexican food!! ;) will be back again!
