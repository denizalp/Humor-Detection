I wouldn't come back if I had a free table and bottles. Worst place I have ever been to in Vegas. The security was super power hungry and soooooo rude even after I tried to be the nicest person I could ever be and spent tons of money. Spend your money ANY WHERE else besides here. Horrible rude security. Truly not sure how they stay in business with so much competition  around
