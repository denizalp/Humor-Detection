Great tasting food. Their menu is also much better compared to most AYCE sushi places because there are more to select besides sushi. With their menu, I think they have the price to beat for AYCE sushi. \n\nThe service, however, is very very bad (hence, just 4 stars). Their female servers would just place all of your orders in all table while whispering what they are in a way that almost no one can hear and do not even bother to place them close to the person who actually ordered that particular food.
