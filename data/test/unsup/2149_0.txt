Very pleased with our experience! We brought our dog Kane in due to allergies. We had taken him to other vets in the past, but could never get his itching under control. Within 4 hours after the visit he was noticeably better. 2 days later and no itching at all! Very pleasant staff, fairly priced, and professional! Lara was great and I highly recommend!!!!
