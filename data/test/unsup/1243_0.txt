I've been to this airport a few times and it's nothing extravagant. There's not a big selection of restaurants to eat. For the most part, when you're arriving you're rushing out to get to that famous strip. When you're leaving, you're trying to remember what actually happened during nightlife or why you continued to play those slots and now you can't order nothing in the airport,  because you're broke, lol.
