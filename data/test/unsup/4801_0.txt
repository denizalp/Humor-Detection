I was a meat lover before coming to this establishment.  I can tell you that the dishes are nothing short of fantastic.  I never knew Vegan food could be this amazing.  I had the spicy noodles, pho, curry, Hawaiian Burger, carrot cake and more.  Every dish appears to be very thought out and made to taste authentic.  I would recommend!
