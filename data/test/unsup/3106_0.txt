I really like this place. I've been wanting to get my 2nd & 3rd lobe pierced but I didn't want to just go to some place in mall. I did a ton of research and found this place. Upon arriving the staff was super warm and friendly and I immediately felt very comfortable. Jay was the one who did the piercing and he did a great job, I will definitely be back in the future.
