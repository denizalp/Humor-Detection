I had the great good fortune of being waited on by Scott when buying a bike rack at Budget.  He is very knowledgable about the different racks but he also made sure that I understood the advantages\/disadvantages of different racks.  What impressed me the most was when he was helping me install the rack he made sure that I understood how this rack worked.  Scott's excellent customer service will keep me going back to Budget and recommending it to friends.
