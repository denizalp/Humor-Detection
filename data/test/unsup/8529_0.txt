You don't expect to come to the desert and find the freshest, most perfectly prepared seafood we have ever experienced!!  And I mean any where!!  The service was as incredible as the food.  From oysters, to shrimp, to Mahi Mahi, to the Barumundi..  All I can say is AWESOME.  A must stop for foodies.  The decor is of an old fish market...  Really works!!
