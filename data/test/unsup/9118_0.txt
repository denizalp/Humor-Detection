This place is do ply awesome, service is great, food selection great, a very busy place. Price is fair, they have food also for people who dont eat meat very accommodating. I found a new breakfast joint its a lil ways from me but its worth the drive....id definitely come bak. A must try, specially if ur vegan eeater. Five starzzz!!
