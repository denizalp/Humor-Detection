I love love love this place. I am a lot closer to DT's and I drive my whole family's butts all the way to flamingo to eat here. The service is quick and the food is just simply delicious. Tinolang manok is my daughters fav... Btw she is only 18 months old.. She's a picky eater but when she smells this soup... She goes crazy.. Lol beef pinakbet-inihaw na baboy- pork skewers- chicken adobo- fresh lumpia- halo halo- super super super yummy. The service is fast... Compared to the one closer to me... I'm glad this place opened up.
