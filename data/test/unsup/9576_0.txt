While visiting Lee's last night for a post dinner sweet treat, I discovered that they provide free toppings and cones! The topping options are heath bar crunch and other chocolatey treats and the waffles are waffle cone squares that provide the perfect crunch to the Jack Daniels chocolate! Meow that's what I call a sweet find!
