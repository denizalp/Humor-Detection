Came here with my wife on V-day,\nThe place was filled with people but the amazing design gave each couple there on privacy.\nTho hostess with the amazing blue eyes recommend that we sit on the sofa, we listened to her, that was the best recommendation!!!\n\nService: we had cristal as a server, I don't remember I had such a professional server in a long time. She was amazing!\n\nThe food was ok, we didn't eat anything fancy....\n\nWill be back for sure!
