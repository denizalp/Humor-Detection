This is the most popular Trader Joe's location for Hawaii visitors to buy stuff to take home.  It's in a strip mall whose parking lot isn't well lit in the evenings but there are lots of people going in and out of the store.  I expected this location to be open until 10 but closing time is 9.  Friendly and helpful staff inside, which is expected from any Trader Joe's.
