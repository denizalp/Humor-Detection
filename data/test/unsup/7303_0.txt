Fantastic find in the Phoenix area.  Was a highly rated place via Yelp and did not disappoint.  Place was packed on a Sunday afternoon.  Quite possibly the best place of fried rice I have had while living in Arizona.  The chicken had a nice coating of curry flavored seasoning which added a nice element to the dish.  Will be back very soon to try more menu items!
