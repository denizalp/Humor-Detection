Did a bait and switch on us. Told us they would give us a certain rate, that it was locked in, sent loan estimate showing the rate, then days later came back and said they did not have permission yet to give us that rate. Communication was poor and forms they asked us to complete always had incorrect information. Did not meet deadlines. I had to get another lender. They wasted 2 weeks of our escrow. Was one of the worst experiences I'd ever had with any company.
