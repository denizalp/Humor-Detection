The only barbershop I go to in Phoenix area. Been going every week for over a year and Jacob is the only barber in AZ I trust with my hair. Never led me wrong and always does a perfect job. Everyone in there is great and Yuri the owner is awesome! Definitely recommend going to Jacob but know that Yuri and the other barbers do a great job and I go to them when Jacob is out of town.
