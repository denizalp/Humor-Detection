We are always looking for another place to try Bun and found Pho Hien which opened not to long ago. Great service, friendly and helpful. Food was great and very enjoyable. We tried this place three weeks ago and have been back twice every week since. The rare slice steak Pho had a very tasteful broth. The Spring Rolls are excellent and the peanut sauce thick and tasty. The charbroiled pork with vermicelli Bun was extremely delicious and filling. We'll be back to enjoy this food.
