Had the eggs benedict and cheese grits. \n\nBoth were good, but nothing out of the ordinary... \n\nI particularly liked that they had donut holes from Dunkin Donuts along with coffee in the waiting area....\n\nWhile we didnt have to wait long, I definitely filled up on SEVERAL of the cinnamon, powdered sugar donut holes.
