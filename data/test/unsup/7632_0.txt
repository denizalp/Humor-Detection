Came into rotate tires before leaving town, was told it would be a hour and half wait due to a busy weekend. Was Advised To SCHEDULE An appointment. \n\nPerhaps having a open lift for loyal walkin customer may be worth it. \n\n I've bought multiple sets of tires through Discount and have never \"scheduled an appointment\".  \n\nIm looking at three empty bays watching these guys toss around a water bottle back and forth as I'm typing this....and it's hour and half wait! What the hell!!!!\n\nWhat you save in price, you loose in service!!!
