It was a long time since I had gone to a Dentist and I was referred here by  a friend. From the cleaning to the permanent crown everyone was great. Dr. Smith, the Assistants and the front desk Ladies were wonderful.  They made me feel at ease and comfortable. I will go back to this office from now on.
