Took the wife into Affordable Dental to have an exam. They said she'll need X amount of things done. So I said fine i'll make an appointment for next week. Next week and another dentist said...No she'll need far more work on her after they did a full check up on her. So I again said fine let's do it. On the third visit they now do an updated exam and now find even more things on top of everything else for me to spend my money on. This is a real story.
