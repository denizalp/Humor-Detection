This place was great!! As soon as you step in through the door you get indulged by all the wonderful BBQ smells and you also hear how others' in their table are cooking up their own meats and veggies!! What a great little spot it is!! I highly recommend it to all those BBQ lovers and Panda express fans!! This is much better and healthier too!! \nIt was a good full that we got after consuming all our food and not a fatty full!!
