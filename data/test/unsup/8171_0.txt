The owner of the salon called me regarding my review (apparently she went back to the appt. book and matched up my name to get my #).  She offered to redo my nails herself; I declined.  My opinion of the service I received stands, but I should say that the owner is willing to attempt make things right for unhappy customers and she assured me all instruments are sterilized properly.
