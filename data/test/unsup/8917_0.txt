Have visited the location on 35th and Tbird and always order their amazing Kung Pao Chicken. Not so amazing at the Arrowhead location. Too many green onions (I thought I got the wrong order until I found a few peanuts) and chicken was dry. Didn't finish it. Fried rice was good as was the egg roll. Crab puffs were pretty small, though. Hoping this is just an isolated situation as my workplace has moved to the arrowhead area.
