I really like this LA Fitness. Since they opened in 2014, I have been a regular at this gym. It's not a big as some of the other LA Fitnesses, but there is a nice neighborhood feel to it. It doesn't get to busy and they have a nice selection of machines. The staff has always been great. Things I like are the juice bar, the large area they have for stretching and the upper level for bicycles and tread mills. My only con is that some of these newer LA Fitnesses have smaller pools (2 to 3 lanes).
