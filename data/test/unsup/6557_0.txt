Honestly, how does this place stay in business? they do not sell plantains, which is a staple food in the islander\/Caribbean culture.  The rice & peas are bland.  The Calypso greens are too vinegary. The prices are too high & portions are small.  I will NOT return to this place & I do NOT recommend this place.
