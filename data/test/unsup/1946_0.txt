Friendly place.  Good service, good food and reasonably priced, clean restrooms.  Casual dining style nick knacks where they over decorate.\n\nHaving said that, the fish I ordered was bland.  I didn't eat it, and the chicken fried steak was a bit greasy (so my beau said).  \n  \nThe mashed potatoes were great!  \nThe portions were generous.  \nThe drinks were good too.  Plenty strong, and a good bang for your buck.  \n\nCaveat:  Lots of screaming kids, so feel free to bring yours too.
