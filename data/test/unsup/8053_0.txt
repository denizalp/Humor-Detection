Yes, the bean and cheese burrito was good.  Yes, I'm glad they don't use lard (then it's vegetarian).  It was hot and cheesy.  But, it was just beans and cheese.  Nothing fancy.  I won't rave over it.\nThe chips and salsa were OK.  I would have liked more salsa, but since you have to pay extra to get them in the first place, I didn't want to get charged more.\nThe highlight of dinner?  The horchata!  I even got a refill to go as I left.\nI will probably go back, but I won't be craving it.
