I have long heard about this artsy caf√© on the Plateau and there I go, I finally got to try it! I had a matcha latte that was quite good and my friend enjoyed her cappuccino, the place was quite unique in the sense that the interior decor is so special and each wall has different highlights elements. The iconic part is the rainbow colour blocks, just love it! Didn't get the chance to try the brunch yet but judging from the mouthwatering smell from tables around us, I need to come back and try their food!
