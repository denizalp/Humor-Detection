Love this restaurant!  Had the halibut burrito and it was just right.   Fish was light, flaky and moist; rice, beans, etc. had just the right seasoning.  Husband had shrimp tacos which are always a delight....always cooked perfectly.  \n\nRubio's is always clean and the staff all are helpful and so polite.  \nDefinitely my \"go to\" place for a delicious and quick meal.
