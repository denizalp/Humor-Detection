I've never been to an establishment that treats their customers so badly. The owner literally shooshed my one and a half year old and then told us our children are too loud. I should mention that we were the only ones in the whole restaurant. He didn't even let us tell the kids to quiet down. He was rude and his actions were ugly towards some mommies and their toddlers just wanting to eat lunch. It was hateful and we will never go back.
