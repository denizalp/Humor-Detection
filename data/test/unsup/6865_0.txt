I did have a higher review in the past for Crust, but after dining last week and asking for ranch dressing with my fried zucchini and I was given TWO tiny cups and charged .50 for each without the server advising me of this charge, I have lowered my review. Never before have I been charged for a side of dressing. That seems very sneaky
