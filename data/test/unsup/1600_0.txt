The Centurion Lounge is my only reason for going to the airport 3-4 hour early for my flight.  My daughter and I recently came here and it wasn't too crowded.  This time they had Japanese Udon noodles with Shitake mushroom. It was interesting to eat udon noodles with a fork since they don't have chopsticks but it was still good.  \n\nI'm looking forward to my next trip to Vegas.
