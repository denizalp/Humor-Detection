Wow, I was impressed. I'm a vegetarian, so of course, no beef burgers for me. But their veggie burger was impressive and \"big\". I kept the toppings simple: lettuce, tomato, onion and some guac. During my week in town, I actually visited a second time. I will definitely revisit the next time I'm in Toronto.
