Update - tried the Raspberry Peach which was refreshing but not as strong as I'd have liked in flavour, and spicy chocolate which was REALLY interesting. Your experience will be as follows: bite...savour rich chocolately flavour for 3...2..1.... SPICE POW. Not overwhelming, but a definite chili thrill. Salted caramel still the favourte.
