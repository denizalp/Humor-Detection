I've came here 3 times and it is definitely worth coming to. I ordered the Pastrami sandwhich. The portions are huge and it's also not soaked with mustard. The is definitely great. Also walking into this place I've seen nothing but welcoming energy! I'd definitely recommend this place. It's almost hidden if you haven't been here before! Wouldn't have known about this place if it wasn't for yelp!
