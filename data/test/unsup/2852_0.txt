I tried this place again and can report back that other items on the menu are better than the salad I previously ordered.  I really like the stracciatella soup (chicken broth, spinach, egg).  It's simple but filling and delicious.  It usually comes with cheese mixed into the broth, but they were able to make me some without cheese which I really appreciated.  I would definitely order that soup again, and it matches well with the simple salad for a healthy and fresh lunch.
