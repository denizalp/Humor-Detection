I'm typically not a BBQ fan but after having a sample of Honey Bear's BBQ Chicken Sandwich at a street fair I'm now a believer. \n\nThe sauce has a warm and sweet taste and the pulled Chicken looks to be all white meat and quite tasty.\n\nThe only things that suck: the buns instantaneously decompose under the liquid BBQ sauce (making it a fork dinner rather than a sandwich) ... also they don't have Coke or Pepsi (only Dr. Pepper for the cola selection).
