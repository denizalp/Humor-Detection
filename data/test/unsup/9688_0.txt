It's close to the strip and is a nice hotel. I only stayed there one night. Bastards stole few items from me. I'm almost certain it was taken out of my bag because that's where I had Them whole trip. \n\nSo I forgot a zip lock bag full of hygiene stuff. I called lost and found and was informed that it was recovered. I had a buddy of mine pick it up for me. Everything was there except my cologne & deodrant. Not cool!
