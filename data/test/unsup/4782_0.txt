Ode to Pistachios,\n\nHow I love thee\nI mix you in my oatmeal, and you give me a hug\nI place you in my yogurt and you give it texture\nI make a mixed snack with dried cranberries, pistachios, and dark chocolate cherries & cashews, and you make me giggle.\nYou Little flavorful meaty nut!\n\n\nI like buying my pistachios and cashews at Sprouts.  They have excellent prices and fast service.
