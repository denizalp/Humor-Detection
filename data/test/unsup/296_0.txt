This place has been on my go to list for years and I really couldn't care less about the \"marginal\" area or cash only policy, I just wanted to love the custard.\n\nWell no love here.  \n\nNot like I'm expecting someone to be all yippy skippy about slinging out custard, but damn, this was one rude unhappy individual.\n\nLimited selection of flavors.\n\nWe had chocolate, orange & coffee; nice consistency and texture, but all very blah in the flavor category.\n\nOverall we renamed it to OK-It Frozen Custard.
