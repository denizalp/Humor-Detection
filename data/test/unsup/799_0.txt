A wonderful place to shop for vintage clothing. Everything is reasonably priced to sell and the owner is extremely helpful in helping you find what you need. \n\nClothes are organized by decade and then by size. \n\nI saw several regular customers who shop here every week and they seemed thrilled to constantly find new selections each week. \n\nThe clothing is mostly in excellent shape. \n\nCome to buy or just to browse, the store is lots of fun.
