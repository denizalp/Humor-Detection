Here's what I had:\n\n- duck leg bun\n- lamb and yogurt\n- chicken skin, pork skin, salmon skin\n- chicken wings\n- blood sausage bun\n- crispy cod bun\n- octopus and enoki mushroom\n- corn\n- scallops \n\n\n\nThey play Naruto on the wall. This place is awesome. Only it's a bit expensive so I'll leave it at 4 stars. I really enjoyed my experience here.
