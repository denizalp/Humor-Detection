First time here,  I love Japanese food,  extremely disappointed,  server wasn't paying attention , we said no for the silverware, another server brought us my husband's food and gave us more silverware.  Regretting coming here, should've just waited at Sakana or went to Kabuki. We were just looking for other Japanese restaurants. Definitely not coming back.
