Came here once after hearing of $9 haircuts (including shampoo). Everything is done by supervised students; an instructor stops by to check every so often. Quality was fine, but my simple trim took upwards of an hour---so if time is money, that $9 is not really such a great deal.\n\nThere appear to be other cosmetic services available here, but I didn't try them. It feels weird enough being both a straight guy and the first to review a beauty institute.
