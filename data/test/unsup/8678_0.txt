I have had two really great experiences at Rehab. Kaye, the technician, is the ultimate professional, and taught me a lot about how to care for my nails, which have been through a lot. I've been dreading even showing my hands at a nail salon, but Kaye's confident advice makes me believe they'll look great again some day. And her application techniques are flawless. I've left Rehab very happy two times now...I think I may be a regular customer!
