I thought the food and service was excellent. The food came out relatively quick for how busy it was. The only constructive criticism I have is the waiting area. I felt like I was on top of the guests eating. Maybe an overhang outside or something for waiting. Also a sign saying please wait to be seated would help direction. I will definitely be back soon.
