As an American-Chinese guy, I need to say that Bento is the closest the University Area will get to authentic Chinese food.  All of the silly Americans looking for that Kung Pao or General Tso garbage will still get what they're looking for.  The chef is able to cook up various authentic dishes.  Just go to the restaurant and look at what another Chinese person is eating.  Don't worry, you won't get any dog or cat meat and you can still get your little fortune cookies.
