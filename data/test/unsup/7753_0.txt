My favorite dive bar, ever. $3 beer and hot dog deal can't be beat. If you're tired of the Disneyesque glitz and glam of pop Vegas and want to take a walk on the sketchy side, this is the place for you. Smoke, peeling linoleum tile, and tired construction workers crowding the place are what it's all about. Combination convenience\/liquor store is a classy touch, as is the bulletproof glass window for redeeming tokens. The bartender runs the place with clockwork efficiency: get in, get your beer and dog, pay, play, get out. \nKeep it real.
