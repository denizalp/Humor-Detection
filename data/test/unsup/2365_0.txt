Consistent enough across the different location. This location on King St is always busy. With no shortage of coffee joints in First Canadian place underground, this is definitely one of the best choice of coffee in the financial district. Unless you're pressed for time, then don't get in line waiting for your to go latte or americano. Definitely a strong coffee to try. The good thing is, the baristas try to give your java doses as soon as possible. Just remember to perk and open up your ears, be ready to pick up your java with the long queue.
