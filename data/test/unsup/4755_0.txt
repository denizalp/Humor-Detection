You never can go wrong with Sweet Life. I never have regrets that I stopped by for a treat.  I recommend  Bacio ( choc. and Hazelnut) , Peanut Butter Cup , and Funky Monkey ( peanut Butter and Banana) , we love so many flavors there.  Stopped by yesterday to putting the proverbial icing on the cake of my day !  Matts, LoLos and Sweet Life , it was perfect.
