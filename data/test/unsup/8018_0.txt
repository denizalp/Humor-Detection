Today I had THE BEST MOCHA IN CANADA courtesy of the White Squirrel. White Squirrel, you have literally taken my breath away! (Which by the way, literally hasn't happened in quite a while!) \n\nCoincidently, my friend literally saw the white squirrel today across the street at Trinity Bellwoods Park. SO YES PEOPLE! THE WHITE SQUIRREL DOES EXIST! :)
