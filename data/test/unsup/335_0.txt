Decent ice cream but nothing to rave about. The creme brûlée just taste burnt and there's more to the taste of creme brûlée than that. It's nowhere near the taste quality of  marble slab. The system they use to ring people through is ridiculous though. I stood there for about 10 mins, money in hand, while two cashier rang through a myriad of customers because apparently only the person who scooped the ice cream for you can ring you through.
