Normally never eat everything on my plate but I couldn't get enough of the food here! The calamari was crunchy and perfectly seasoned. The lobster was great also. We are from San Diego and have been looking for a great seafood place to eat and yes this is the spot. Jeremy was on point and made our time enjoyable and efficiently open a blue crab. Most of all very reasonably priced. Thanks for making my Sunday an enjoyable one!! See you guys soon.
