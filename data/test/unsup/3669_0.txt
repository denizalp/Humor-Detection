I love the selection at Rachel's Kitchen. From pasta and sandwiches to salads and smoothies, this place has it all-- and it's healthy! I typically opt for the Turkey and Avocado sandwich and it's always on point. Lots of meat and the avocado is always very fresh. I also love their fresh pressed apple juice... it seriously tastes like you're drinking an apple! \n\nIt does get busy on weekends around lunchtime but, in my opinion, it's worth the wait!
