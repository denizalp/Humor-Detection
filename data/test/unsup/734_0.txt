Really confused here. This place looked so unsanitary, from their unkept bathroom to their cold \"turo-turo\" food. The choices were not great, but we thought we drove all this way, maybe their food will wow us. Womp womp, worst restaurant I have been to for filipino food. My brother could cook better than this, and thats saying something! I am not sure if the food was just sitting out too long, or it was cooked in a rush matter, but it really lacked taste. We could not finish our meal. It was horrible.
