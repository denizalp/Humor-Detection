I bought my tires at the Discount Tires on Blue Diamond. Came here because I work across the street and noticed my tire going flat. I made an online appointment in the morning to take it in during my lunch break. I thought I'd have to leave it there but they fixed my flat...a screw was in my tire in less than an hour. Staff was friendly and helpful.
