I lowered my standards walking in here. So much regret. Worse than prom night. I like my beer cold. They got that right. I like my mozzarella sticks hot. I miss Blackthorne's. The poor girl writing out the menu took at least... more than two beers for me. She received a nice groping from the chef. Man, I ain't coming back.
