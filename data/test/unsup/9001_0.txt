Terrible communication from this company..:(\nI have left messages and sent emails asking about out 3-d views needed to get this project started. When we went to the showroom, they were quick to come by the house, agree on the initial plans and accept our half down payment, then totally fell off the charts as far as follow through...so far very disappointed with the service....\n\nJessica, the Manager took ownership of our issues and immediately got things back on track.  \nThank you for turning this into a good situation..
