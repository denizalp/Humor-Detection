We had two wonderful dinners at this very fine restaurant. Exceptional food and outstanding friendly service. Every dish was beautifully prepared, the wine recommendations were perfect and the dessert Madeleines were just right with our coffee. We were thrilled to have the same waitress both nights! Genevieve (Gen B.D) helped with our choices and allowed me to practice my rusty French. It was just lovely and we will return!
