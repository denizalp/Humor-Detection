Tried to eat here at 11am this morning....not able to. Waited 1 hour and 15 minutes and only got served our drinks. Told it would be yet another 10 or more minutes before we would be served. Manager offered to pick up the check if we stayed, but we we on our way somewhere else and couldn't wait any longer. Too bad food going past us looked like it was good. Might try going back at an earlier time. Until then, and until service improves, I can't give a great score.
