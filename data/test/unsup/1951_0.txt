I went there to get my eyebrows waxed and had a horrible experience. The lady took ALL of my skin off and now it's extremely painful. Not only did she not know what she was doing with waxing, she used completely unsafe waxing practices by using the same stick and double dipping every single time she put it in the wax. The wax is completely contaminated!!
