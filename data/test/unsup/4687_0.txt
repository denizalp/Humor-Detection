I have to say, it feels really odd to be reviewing a steak place when I don't eat steak.  We had a work dinner here and I split several side dishes with another non-steak-eating co-worker.  We had the mashed potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts.  Everything was delicious and we saved room for dessert too - a banana bread pudding of some kind.  That was fantastic.  Overall great experience, for a non-steak eater!
