Worst place I've ever ate!!! Bathroom dirty debit machine didn't work! Didn't tell us before we ordered and then wanted us to leave credit card info with them!! Had to leave and go get cash to pay the bill and it was my husbands bday. Only pic this place cause it had almost stars so we drove from Glendale to check it out. Huge mistake. Who ever put almost five stars is crazy!!!
