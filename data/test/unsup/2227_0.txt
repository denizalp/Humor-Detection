Took some Adult beginner ballet classes here and it was great!  I was worried about my klutziness and having a teacher that promoted anorexia, but there was no such thing here.  The classes are about 1h 10 mins and are a great way to clear your head.  The pace is also nice.  The facilities are also beautiful - beautiful airy spaces, hardwood floors, giant glass windows.  And also a treat is having a live pianist playing during your class.  Adds so much to the experience!
