I first heard of Drones Plus from a Drone Racing Event that was held in Downtown Las Vegas. \n\nThey have a really nice store in the middle of the city. Drones plus has Drones for all price ranges and skill level.  The staff was friendly and helpful with our questions.  They were able to make recommendations from personal experience in order to allow us to make the best buying decision for us.  They were even willing to do a test flight of one we were interested in starting out with which sealed the deal.
