I want here for breakfast the other day with some friends. O, my! I just found my favorite breakfast place in town.  Everything is make in real butter and the Benedict was out of this world. I'm thinking about it has I'm writing this.  It is a new restaurant at Central and Camelback. \n\nLet's just say if you really love breakfast you should go here first before you try any other place out.  It is easy to find and parking is not bad either. \n\nSee you next time Elly's.
