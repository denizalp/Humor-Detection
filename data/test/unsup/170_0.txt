Wow, just so pleasantly surprised!  Doesn't look like much from the outside, but whenyou walk in you can immediately see how beautiful and old it is! The interior pond, the glass, the flamenco dancer and guitarist. Simply lovely. Service was perfect and they were busy. I just loved the Chicken Mole.
