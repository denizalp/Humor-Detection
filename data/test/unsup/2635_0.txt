Just stay away. Dont go. The only thing people are screaming for is their money back. \n\nThis place has GREAT detail, but is so cheesy and hoaky, it makes morning radio look like it should have an emmy. Even the actors knew it was bad! \n\nBloody Mary couldnt get the crowd any bit excited for a mediocre attraction. \n\nThe \"elevator\" employee put his head down in shame. \n\n$35 to go through, not even work $5.
