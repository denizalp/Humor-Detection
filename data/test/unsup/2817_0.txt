I had a really good experience here, room was cheap and clean, that's all I could ask for and the service was really good and over the phone with the reservation was perfect for me. In the casino, the drinks are really watered down, so you might as well ask for a glass of water. I was not expecting to win any money here. I came here because my neighbors recommended it and I could park my car outside my room and keep an eye on it.\nReally good stay and I stayed for a few nights.
