Me and couple of gals from work went to try this location. Ordered the broccoli cheddar soup with steak and arugula sandwich.  The soup and the sandwich tasted pretty good as well as the service but is really bugged me how the place was dirty and no attention was given to clean up after some customers and it was just a mess. We couldn't find a clean table to sit so we had to clean our own table . Did not enjoy eating in dirt like that
