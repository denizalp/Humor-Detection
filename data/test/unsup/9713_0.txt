I've been coming here consistently for a year since discovering them on yelp! Can't beat the price and they are great at what they do. $14 for both eyebrow and lip threading. I've had different threaders but they are all good. I've never had a bad experience or had the skin of my eyebrows cut up like some places I've been to. They have you sit up and thread sitting up sometimes to make sure it's even. I haven't tried other services besides threading but would be willing to try.
