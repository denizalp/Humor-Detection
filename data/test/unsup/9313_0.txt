Why is there a man that works inside the women's dressing room???  My 16 year old daughter is in here trying on bathing suits and this is super awkward. I actually saw him walk in on someone dressing. There are no locks on the doors and he just opened it right up. He said \"0h that's where I was keeping clothes to put away, I wasn't trying anything weird\". You've GOT to be kidding me. Why is he in here?
