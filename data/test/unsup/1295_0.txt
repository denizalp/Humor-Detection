I would give no star for this place! My cousin took my car out just to come here. He only been here for a few times but  the car got stole! We asked to talk to the manager but they only asked for the information and they said the manager will be in on Monday and we have to call to complain! So we have to wait!? My car just got stole and you want us to wait!? \n Smh and I would sue this place for no responsibility and safety!
