Cool little dessert shop that uses waffles in the shape of a fish to hold ice-cream.  I like how there are already made menu choices as well as make your own menu of different cones and ice-cream flavors.  And your desired 2 toppings to go with your ice-cream.  I had the custom made mango flavored ice-cream and it was yummy.\nOn top of that, they have a drink menu as well.  \nWhat's fun is their flower wall where you can pose for photos with your taiyaki ice-cream and or drink.
