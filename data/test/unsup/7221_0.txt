The facial was pretty good, but made me break out terribly afterwards. Used it as a groupon deal and got a cream and $100 gift certificate. I saw someone else here complained about the lady almost giving a sales pitch about the membership, I definitely felt pressured and ended up not doing it. It has a nice atmosphere though and relaxing other than that.\n\nThis says 2018, but this review was supposed to be for years ago and it never posted. Lol.
