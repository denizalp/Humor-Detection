Terrible. Came in for a walk in, waited over an hour. Agreed front desk is not professional and does not provide quality customer service. When I finally went to ask about the wait time, that receptionist never came back to answer. Asked the second girl, she finally says she doesn't know. Theres only one doctor in and she has to see ALL these patients. Wow, really? Why didn't you just say that in the beginning. I left.
