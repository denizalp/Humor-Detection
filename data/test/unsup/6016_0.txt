I will continue to buy cars from Acura of Peoria. Not because of the sales staff. But because of the service department. From the second you arrive. You are welcomed with a smile and a high level of respect. The basically roll out a red carpet for you. Thank you Ryan V! You always go above and beyond than what is needed. The only reason we drive further to a different acura location is because of his outstanding cutover service and extensive knowledge of acura vehicles. So if you ever need service, ask for Ryan V.
