I mainly go here to play basketball. Whenever I phone ahead and ask if the basketball courts are open, the front desk claims it's \"open\". However, after starting to play within less than an hour, the court is closed down due to specials events not posted on the calendar schedule. This has occurred to me multiple times throughout the years. Infuriating to say the least, especially since this is the nearest ymca and in-door basketball court facility to me.
