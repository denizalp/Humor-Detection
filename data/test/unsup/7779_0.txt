Amongst other reviews by Yelp-ers, indeed Yoshi is a hidden gem in Brampton. Portion sizes are huge, especially there Sashimi and Sushi. I've eaten at quite a lot of Japanese restaurants and I must say, this is in the top 3. \n\nFood is very authentic, even the ice cream is imported from Japan. It is definitely worth every penny! Be sure to try their Toshi Specials, they are to die for. Especially the lightly flame seared salmon sushi! Exquisite!
