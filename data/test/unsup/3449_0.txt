5 stars for the hair cut.  The guys that have cut my hair have always done a nice job.\n\n0 stars for the inappropriate conversation and lack of hygiene.  The counters don't look like they are cleaned and sneezing into your hands and not washing before continuing isn't cool.  Not a place for children as the conversations are x-rated and loud.
