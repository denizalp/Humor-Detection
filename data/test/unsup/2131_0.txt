Worst f'ing furniture store on the planet.  Waited 3 hours for them to get it right. Then by the time they did, our almost $5,000 order was to be delivered in 6 days. Then 7 days.  Then 9 days.  We finally were confirmed for a 9-day delivery.  Here we were waiting patiently for our delivery. Had to call them, only to confirm they are two plus weeks more before they will or can deliver it.  UNACCEPTABLE.  WHAT A BUNCH OF IDIOTS.  DON'T BELIEVE THEM, THEY LIE.  THEY SUCK.  THEY ABSOLUTELY SUCK.\nC. MCMAHON, LAS VEGAS
