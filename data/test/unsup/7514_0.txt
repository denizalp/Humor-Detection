Went with a party of around 40 for a class trip from UNLV. For having so many people come in so quickly, the staff remained attentive and put together. The prices for AYCE for both lunch and dinner are AMAZING. \n\nVenue is very spacious and modern. Tamara was our server and worked her butt off! Overall had a great experience, will definitely bring my family and friends here.
