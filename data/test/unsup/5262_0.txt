Like others, came here out of curiosity.  But I'm not really a pawn shop type of chick.  Though I did see a pretty amazing 5 carat cushion cut diamond in the front case!  They have an amazing Chumley t-shirt selection in the back LOL.\n\nFunny thing about this street, there are wedding chapels, pawn shops, and strip joints all next to each other.  In El Hub's words, you could pretty much buy a ring at a pawn shop, propose to your lady, celebrate your bachelor party at the strip joint, AND THEN get hitched all in one car ride!
