DO NOT SEND YOUR KIDS TO THIS DAYCARE.... not at all they withheld information from me until the very day that my son was to start class there and it caused me to almost looseeverything because i had no where for him to go. They told me i could get part time care then said no you cant but you cam at our other locations, then turned around and told me it would be 400 dollars a month ...IM UNEMPLOYED this place is a freaking joke they need to be under new management
