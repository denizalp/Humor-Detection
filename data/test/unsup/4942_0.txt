Came in for drinks with a dreamy little hunk of man meat and had a nice time.  Had a great lemon blueberry drink and a glass of prosecco.  It was pretty quiet at the bar, so service could afford to be friendly and attentive.\nThe bathroom attendant freaked me out; she wasn't there when I walked in, but then she would magically appear when I came out of the stall.  Is she materializing in through the walls?  Hiding in a stall?  Weird.\nReally a gorgeous location.
