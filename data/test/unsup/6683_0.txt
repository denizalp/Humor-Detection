The best ever sushi ayce in the world :\") costumer sever great. \n\nWhether because of perceived healthfulness, its clean flavor, or just owing to greater availability, raw fish has stayed hot. And Long Island has benefitted from the rush of new restaurants that specialize in it. Sushi may not be as omnipresent as pizza and pasta, but the communities without a place to sample the uncooked taste of the ocean...\n\n\nI love this place foreal
