Took my family from Ohio here and we had a great experience!  Our server was great and so was the food.  My steak wasn't cooked correctly the first time so when they brought out a new one they brought a while new meal, not just the steak.  My husband and dad shared the \"cowboy stuff \" and the slung of food was amazing! Great views and free cotton candy for dessert.  Sit near the indoor slide if you want to wear the kids out.  Check out Horney the bull out front.
