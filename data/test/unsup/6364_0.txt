I bought a Groupon and am so glad I did. The studio is small which is nice because it was an intimate experience. Everyone was welcoming and friendly. I loved that the environment, instructor and students were NOT pretentious or judgmental. I felt peace and acceptance which is what yoga is all about! Overall I felt this is a great neighborhood studio that we are lucky to have!
