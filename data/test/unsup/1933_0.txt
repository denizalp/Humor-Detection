FANCY DOUGHNUTS! \n\nThere used to be a pink box inside town square behind my work & I literally used to get a couple doughnuts EVERYDAY!! Came to this location right before my doctors appointment & it seemed a little different. \n\nThe doughnuts didn't seem as tasty as they used to be... & they also didn't have my FAVORITE key lime pie!! =\\ \n\nNUTTY PIG $1.95 - this doughnut is freaken interestingly addictive w\/ dates, bleu cheese crumbles,  filled w\/ cream inside.
