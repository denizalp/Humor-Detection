We were here for 3 hours: not by choice, but because it took our server that long to take our orders, deliver our drinks, bring our food, hand us our check, and take our money. \n\nIn that time, I got to eat dried out chicken and luke warm french fries and drink a flat soda. Not only that, but we had no silverware, so I had to personally get up and retrieve forks, straws, and napkins for us to all use. \n\nI didn't know I had a second career in waitressing. It sucks.
