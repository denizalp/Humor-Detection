I came here for Thanksgiving dinner and man was it busy.  They were able to accommodate our group for a last minute attendance to make it 7.  Off the bat it was great service.  Considering how busy they were that evening I was impressed.  I opted out of the traditional turkey dinner and ordered the pork tenderloin.  Probably the best decision of my day.  It was cooked to perfection!  Thank you Seasons 52 for hosting a perfect Thanksgiving dinner.
