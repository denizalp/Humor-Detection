Always Busy, the best suitable word for this location of PF Changs. \nMe and my wife have been many times here now and we love the Firecracker Shrimps with Veggie Dumplings pan fried which is just slurpy n mouth watering..\nService is great. Would love to say that ask for Gordon and I bet you will be delighted by his services. He is a very professional and one of the best servers I have ever interacted with in food industry.\n\nWe r coming every time here. You guys are awesome.
