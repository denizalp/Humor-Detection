After reading the many great reviews, I had high hopes for this place.  It was clean, but lacked any atmosphere.  Tom yam soup was tasty but terriaki salmon was flavorless.  Unlike the great photos posted by others, the food presentation was uninspiring. Service was poor, with side dishes arriving 10-15 minutes after entrees.
