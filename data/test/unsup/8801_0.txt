We compared a couple of companies and felt we were getting a better deal overall from AZ. Solar Solutions.   They worked tirelessly to install our system and when a problem arose, they were here to fix it quickly.\n\nWe have been producing nearly 100% of our energy since April when we became fully operational.   Even on the few cloudy days we have in Arizona, we're generating energy.   So happy to have final made the decision to 'go green'.
