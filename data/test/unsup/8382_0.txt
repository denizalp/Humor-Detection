I have been a loyal customer to this store for nearly 3 years now. I can always find what I'm looking for without needing to store hop, and the staff are friendly and helpful anytime you ask a question. \n\nI am happy with the products I purchase from here. The store does not allow you to make certain returns, however I have ALWAYS had it made right with store credit or exchanges within reason. \n\nI appreciate the management and staff. Thanks :)
