this is the first time i've ever been to a strip club with no real complaints. Im thoroughly impressed at the customer service from the limo driver, bouncer, door man, waitress and large range of non pushy girls. the drinks are expensive around $14\/$18 dollars but the atmosphere is great.  whereever your hotel is, ask for Blaine to pick you up. Call him 702-343-2828, he'll take care of you ;) He reminded me of Sal from Breaking Bad lol. 4 stars because drinks are expensive
