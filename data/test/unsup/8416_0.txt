Very disappointed. i made my appt. A day before, with the stylist jonathan he didnt even show up! Its very unprofessional. I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt since there are so many negative comments on here about him. Yep they are all correct, i seriously dont know how he is still employed. Anyways, luckily there was someone there to take over i ended up getting a Brazilian blowout which is not even what i wanted i originally wanted a keratin treatment. Oh well, i just wont be returning.
