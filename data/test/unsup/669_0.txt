Really hate all these wannabe Hawaiian places who  say aloha as you enter there place of business, but in Hawaii you never ever hear them say that....\n secondly when you order hot saimin with spam.  ..thus place don't cut da spam in slices....cause we think people like it one whole piece....and by day way the picture just right of the register SHOWS IT SLICED????? What up with that?????\nfood was okey...but not to filling.\n\nAlohaaaaaa and better luck next time.
