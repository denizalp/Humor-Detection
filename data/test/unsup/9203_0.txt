The only thing Irish about Fitzgerald's is their name and the fact that they serve Guinness.  Other than that, you can expect average food, average drink prices and mediocre service.  They have lots of TVs if you are there to watch a game.  The two times I've been here, there has been no waiting to get in.  Gee, wonder why?  Charlotte has too many options to settle for a \"meh\" experience.
