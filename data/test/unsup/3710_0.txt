We had taken the hubby's car to Manny's and had to come here for the rental car through the other person's insurance.  The driver that picked me up was friendly, but the other employees were just kinda there.  The process took forever, they weren't very organized, didn't know what was going on, didn't have their reservations right, couldn't get my card to run because of all this, and didn't have any choices.  I would never rent from Hertz unless I absolutely have to again.
