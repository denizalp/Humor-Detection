Came here because a car that was just bought 5 days ago had an extreme gasoline smell. We were told to bring the car back Monday despite a fuel leak. An employee named Austin told us to come back, when I said it wasn't safe, he became extremely rude and told us \"well then fine I don't know what you want me to do\".. When the owner of the car asked for proof that it was safe to drive his response was \"well she told me it wasn't okay so??\"\n\nUnbelievably rude service. Unbelievable unbelievable unbelievable.
