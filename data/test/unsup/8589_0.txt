My favorite salon!\nI found KCS through yelp a couple years ago and have been seeing Colie for my hair therapy :)\nNow that I'm back in LA... I'll drive from LA back to Vegas just to get my hair done by Colie. yup.\nYou are paying for high quality products and service... so be prepared for that financially. \nVery trendy, friendly salon. Love the wash room and head\/neck massage. \nParking is never a problem which is something I enjoy about Las Vegas compared to LA.\nCall ahead of time to book an appointment.
