Horrible place. Ive gotten my car detailed there before and they just did a shotty job. Just went to go through the autowash for a quick wash. I pulled up expecting one of the 10 people there to present themselves and collect payment but no. Had to leave car out in middle of lot, go inside and ask how i do this. They didnt speak english very well and dont communicate at all. It was very frustrating. I got through car wash and then they didnt dry it. Wouldn't recommend getting my dog washed here.
