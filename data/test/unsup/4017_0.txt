I love this place. I love that they have an insane locals discount on my one day off per week. It is so clean, and you can use the facilities all day if you get a treatment (like all casino spas). The service is impeccable (Four Seasons comparable). I got the best massage of my life here and I wish I could remember the therapist's name. \n\nJust got done w hot stone massage. So relaxing! Wish I had time to stay and enjoy the pool. Til next time!
