Wonderful lounge at the Las Vegas airport!\n\nStaff is very professional and courteous. The space is plush and modern, arranged so there are ample cozy spots so you don't feel you're among many other people. All seats seemed to have at least four plugs so iPhones, iPads, laptops, etc... can be charged simultaneously. There is an open bar and buffet, conference room, showers, long tables, cushy chairs, built-in seats, etc... You can't hear the general airport announcements so it's very peaceful, but there are screens with flight info that can be seen from most seating areas.
