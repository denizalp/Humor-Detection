Not bad. I got the kaarage don which was solid and filling, but they went a bit heavy on the mayo topping. As it's a donburi place I feel they could offer more classic Japanese options such as sliced beef on rice or the chicken and liquid egg on rice but I understand the need to cater to a rushing lunch hour crowd. Otherwise I'd be tempted to visit an izakaya instead for more variety
