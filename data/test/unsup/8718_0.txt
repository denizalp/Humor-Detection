Baggage claim doesn't take a long time. Lines for check in and security are efficient for the most part - unless you opt out of the naked x-ray machine. Then you will wait 20 majillion years for a female assist.\n\nIt also looks like you walked inside of a disco ball full of slot machines and shitty A.C.\n\nPlanes come and go, generally on time. So it's alright by me.
