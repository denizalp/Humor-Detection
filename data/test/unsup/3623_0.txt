Pros: lots of sweet hot gulab jamun, tender meats, great crispy naan made fresh on request for no extra charge, lovely mango ice cream, only $10 for the lunch buffet\n\nCons: barely any flavour. I'm surprised the owners don't notice this, considering that they eat the same food for lunch.\n\nWouldn't bother going back. Indian Cuisine at Yonge\/Hilda is way better for a couple dollars more.
