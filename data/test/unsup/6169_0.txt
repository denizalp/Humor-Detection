I had the BLT and a side Caesar salad. The bacon was crispy, the veggies fresh and the bread was toasted perfectly.\n\nI love the decor at all the locations and the people are always nice enough and helpful. Everything was clean, neat and smelled good.\n\nIt's a Corp kind of restaurant as you know, but it's certainly  one of the nicest!
