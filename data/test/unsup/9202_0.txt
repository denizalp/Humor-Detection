What can i say? Its a hair cut joint. The hair dresser i got was good, and I am happy wih the result, the only thing i found is that the hair dresser didnt talk to me all that much.... although they never really do any way (must be me). Other than that, the service is relatively kind and quick, will be back in the near future. Also, be sure to get the app so you can get in by reserving in advance. Quite useful!!
