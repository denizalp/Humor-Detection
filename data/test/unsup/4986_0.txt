Went to one in Tucson and had a horrible experience, but was willing to give this one a try. no smiles from the staff, the prices are over market value. Sure are proud of their mediocre food. \n\nMaybe I'm still tainted from my experience in Tucson, but I will never darken this establishment's doorway again. FTP\n\nThe only good thing to get there is to get out!
