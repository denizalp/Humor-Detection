I have only twice seen the elusive white squirrels of Trinity Bellwoods, but I have many times indulged in a flat white from White Squirrel Coffee. I'm a fan of this teensy coffee shop. Their coffee is good, they've got Greg's Ice Cream in the summer and they take debit. When you're looking for a pick me up on West Queen West, look for the squirrel sign. They've got you.
