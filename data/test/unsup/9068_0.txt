Cute lil French cafe! I love their pastries and coffee! My bf and I went here a couple times so far and there was never a let down. They have a variety of different types of flavored coffee. We enjoyed their hazelnut praline.Their menu is quite unique compared to other French cafes in town. Great spot for breakfast and brunch! Oh and don't forget to try their chocolate croissant so good!
