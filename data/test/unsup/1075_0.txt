I was completely blown away by the customer service and knowledge of the ladies here at Rose Tuxedo.  I absolutely H-A-T-E clothes shopping.  I'm 6'4\" and long... nothing ever fits, and I always have to try on item after item.  However after a few quick measurements, everything I was given to try on was a perfect fit.\n\nIn and out in under 30 minutes, tuxedo pants and 2 LS button-down shirts for $70.  My kind of shopping!  Cheers, ladies!!  -The voice of the Midwest  :D
