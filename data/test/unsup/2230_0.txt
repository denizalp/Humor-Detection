The Wynn and Encore are two of the nicest hotels\/resorts in Las Vegas.  The Wynn Ferrari dealer is amazing, I bought my 2010 Ferrari California off the showroom and they treat you like family, Rich and Tony are beyond amazing!  The negative is the high prices for drinks and food at the bars\/restaurants, I guess you do get what you pay for!
