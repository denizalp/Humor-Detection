This was my first time at Docktails with my family for my moms birthday. The food was delicious but the service was HORRIBLE. The waiter even forgot when my brother ordered dessert for my moms birthday so we cancelled....after we had waited 20 minutes. It was not even busy...on a Monday! I can't even imagine on the weekends...very disappointing!!!
