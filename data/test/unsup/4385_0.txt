This is a fantastic spot!  Definitely get the Katsu Donburi with egg and everything on it. \n\nThe owner is really nice and makes sure everyone has a good experience.  I can ask a lot of questions about things only I care about and he was super ready to indulge me. \n\nI hope they open more locations nearer the strip.
