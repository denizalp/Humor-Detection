Liza was everything I could have hoped for. She was kind, funny, did a great job on both my teenagers' hair and has very reasonable prices. \nI just moved here and had to turn to yelp and trust the reviews to guide me to a place where my kids would be taken care of. I am so glad I found Style 5.\nIf you're new here and uncertain I don't think you'll be disappointed with Liza.\nThanks :)
