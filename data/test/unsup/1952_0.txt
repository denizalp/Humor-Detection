Nice hotel in decent location however it had more of a family atmosphere and the rooms were not that nice for being a 4 star hotel. Rooms seemed a bit old and outdated. If you are looking for a fun nightlife experience I would recommend Planet Hollywood down the strip. Its in an ideal location for walking and they have a TON of restaurants and shops in the attached Miracle Mile Mall.
