I stopped here to try something different. The staff was friendly. \n\nThe food is based off of British pubs and their fried food. \n\nThey had an interesting selection. I chose the Thai chicken tacos which I  loved. Then I tried the chocolate chip and toffee ice cream sandwich which I liked. They have great prices on good food!\n\nThere was other British inspired food I want to try, would like to go back and do a taste test!
