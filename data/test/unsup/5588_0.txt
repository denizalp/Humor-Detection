Pei Wei helped to prevent me from making a total ass of myself last night after a day of drinking off and on since noon. We found ourselves at SideBar and I was mixing drinks. Not the smartest thing to do after taking it light for eating lunch. But, I'm prone to making bad decisions so rarely surprise myself. \n\nI ordered the crab-stuffed wontons and edimame, took that back upstairs and both helped take the edge out of my hunger pangs. Enough to have another cocktail!
