The gelato is very good, but expensive.  They have lots of flavors and also have sorbet as well.  They have various cup sizes as well as cones.  A regular size cup will run you over $7.  They have a coffee and tea drinks too.  It's great for a treat every so often.  I will definitely continue to frequent the place, as long as I'm in Las Vegas.
