-No Credit Cards accepted!\n\n-Prices were cheaper than WalMart ONLY by a few cents (not worth waiting in line for a small savings!)\n\n-WalMart will match WinCo's ad.\n\n-Parking was ok, busy on a Friday afternoon.\n\n-No available shopping carts.\n\n-Lines were so long, as if this was the ONLY grocery store in the entire Valley! (check out my photos)\n\n-Bulk food area.\n\n-Too busy for my liking
