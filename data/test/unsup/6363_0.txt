The service is probably the redeeming quality of this place. They are very welcoming and make you feel at home. It's dingy and kind of dirty but that's just like every other diner. It does take awhile to make your food, but they have amazing egg whites. Visit if you're nearby, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back again.
