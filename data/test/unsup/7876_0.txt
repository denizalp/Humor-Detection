Sprinkles is a perfect place for The Linq, I almost always make a stop here whan I am playing tourist at The Linq because their treats are fairly priced and it always hits the spot. \n\nI always get ice cream here. Hahaha. GET THE RED VELVET WAFFLE CONE! Not just a gimmick, it actually is sweet and tasty! \n\nI am always happy with their coffee almond fudge ice cream, so if you're a coffee fan, this will do the trick for ya.
