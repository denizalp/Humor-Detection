Dr.Trisha has been treating for more than 6 months and I am so happy to say she has saved me a lot of pain and definitely relieved all my aches from working on my feet all day long.\n\nThe staff is beyond friendly they make me feel at home coming in to any health care office you want to feel warmly welcome and that is exactly what I feel. If you are aching or in pain I would definitely recommend chiropractic care as a normal part of your everyday care think of it as a tune up for yourself .
