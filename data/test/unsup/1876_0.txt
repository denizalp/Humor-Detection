Most gorgeous terasse in Montreal in my humble opinion \nThe decor and lightening reminds me of an outdoor Californian wedding \nI went in the winter and summer and it was both charming. \nI had the oysters, tuna tartar, filet mignon, octopus, parpadelle. \nEverything was really good. The first time the filet mignon was amazing but the second time wasn't as good. I can't put my finger on why, perhaps it was overcooked.\nThe wine list is very good. \nThe service is really attentive. \nThis place is perfect for a romantic date or a night out with friends.
