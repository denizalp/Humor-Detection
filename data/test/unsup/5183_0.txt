Unreal how bad their service is. They never show up between their \"estimated arrival time\", the sunscreens I ordered from them were not what I received (wrong color and material) and the best part was, they didn't order enough screens for my home. Now I have two missing in the front of my home and it looks ridiculous. I was never given a reason why or told when the job would be completed. I've called several times with no reply. Its been over 2 weeks. If you're looking to get work done by these guys, don't.
