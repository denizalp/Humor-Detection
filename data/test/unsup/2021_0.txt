I'm normally a fan of the service and stuff, but was appalled tonight. Took forever to get service (places equally as busy never took that long) and I was clearly blown off. I travel a long distance to come here as I live in north Phoenix and to received the lack of service I did was uncalled for. I'd get fired for 1\/10 of that!
