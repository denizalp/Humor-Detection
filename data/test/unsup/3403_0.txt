Had dinner there last night with a group of people. Our food was excellent as was the service. Alan, our waiter, was very attentive and was very helpful when we had questions about the menu. One member of our party had never dined at Romano's before, and she enjoyed it very much. I had the Pasta Milano and it was excellent as always!
