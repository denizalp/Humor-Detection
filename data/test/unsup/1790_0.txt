Circle K continues to offer a nice refueling experience.\n\nWe come here towards the end of each month, when our fueling discount from nearby Fry's are about to expire.  The gas is somewhat more expensive than nearby Tatum Boulevard in Phoenix.  But they seem competitive to neighboring Shell SuperPumper on the corner. Yesterday I paid $3.559, after getting ten cents off for regular unleaded. Not bad.\n\nLike most Circle Ks, they do a very nice job of keeping things clean and spiffy. We have used the conveniences store only a few times, but it too looks well stocked and clean.
