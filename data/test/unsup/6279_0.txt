Service woes continue at Guru. The sushi is very good, which keeps us coming back -- but we nonetheless are continually disappointed. Tonight one of our entrees was mistakenly delivered to the wrong table. It took more than 30 minutes (one of us having food sitting in front of us, the other waiting) and still no progress on the missing entree (15 pieces of sashimi). When we mentioned to the waitress, she explained with barely an apology, \"When we make a mistake the kitchen puts the order to the back of the line.\" Really???
