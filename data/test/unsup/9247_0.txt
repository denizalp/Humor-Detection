You cant go wrong with Al's! If you want just a normal not fancy neighborhood bar serving you GOOD bar food, this is your place. Pricing is very fair too. And good service. All the waitresses know what they're doing and you will be taken care of! Plenty of seating, a big bar, there's some outside seating too. And good entertainment from a DJ or band from time to time. Come stop by Al's when you have a chance. You wont be disappointed.
