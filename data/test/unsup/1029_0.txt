This place is not worth going to. I definitely recommend the other locations. From waitstaff to the food. The pupusas were big but if you can't eat them what's the point. They were not cooked and they had no flavor. It was my first time ordering Salvadore√±o horchata and I didn't like it so I asked to just exchange it for a soda; the waitress was so rude about it and took about 2 minutes to get. Mind you the restaurant had 3 people in it. Overall, worst location I've been to
