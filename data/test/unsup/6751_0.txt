My motto in life, according to Abraham Lincoln is: \"Life's a party, rock your body.\"\n\nParty city fits the bill in that regard, with thousands of party needs to choose from: party plates, decors, balloons, favors, napkins, costumes, you name it. I am disappointed that they did not have the Bjork swan costume (for a friend), but otherwise, I was very happy.\n\nParty on yelpers!
