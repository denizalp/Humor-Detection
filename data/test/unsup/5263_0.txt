I work for a company that manage Independent Senior Living Homes.  There was a big bed bug infestation at one of the homes.  Pro Chem and their crew did a wonderful job in getting rid of everything.  Its been a couple of months since they've completed the heat treatment and our clients in the home are loving that fact that the bed bugs are all GONE!!!  We have tried many other ways to get rid of them and it didn't work.  All I got to say is -  THANKS PRO CHEM!!!
