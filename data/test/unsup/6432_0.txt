A different kind of museum, with lots of exhibits.\nThere is Chinese, European, Rome, Middle Eastern, Egyptian.\nThere is one floor dedicated to animals, mostly mammals.\nOne small section for Dinosaurs. I like the fact that this museum share the detail from finding out, transferring to lab & put the bones together.\nOne floor dedicated to gems, rocks, meteorites, and mineral.\nFor the first time I saw meteorites.\nAlso learned the raw form of copper, gold, silver, cool!!
