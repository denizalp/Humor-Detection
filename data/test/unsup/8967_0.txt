Hell YEA! Finally Yelp for Cananda!! \n\nThis is one of the mall we've been to after driving 9 hours from Columbus, Ohio. It's located next to the Pacific Mall. There's a lot of parking spaces. The outside of this mall looks like a block of old-fashioned row houses. However, the interior is similar to typical western style mall. It's clean, but a little dim. \n\nOnce inside, you'll see 99% Chinese shopping around. Yes, most of them speak Cantonese because they're mostly from Canton or Hong Kong. So... screw you all Mandarin speaking people =P
