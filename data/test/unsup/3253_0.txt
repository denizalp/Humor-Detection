9 times out of 10 the receptionists are arrogant towards clients. But the main chiropractor shows a complete lack of respect towards his staff, including massage therapists and receptionists, so their arrogance is somewhat understandable. And not surprisingly, they go through new staff every few months. After witnessing such disrespect, I don't want this guy working on me whatsoever, nor do I want to support such a negative business. I'd absolutely recommend taking your needs elsewhere in the neighborhood.
