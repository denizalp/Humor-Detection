This was a great car buying experience.   Corinna was new to the car sales business, but she had an awesome attitude.  She was 100% focused on my wife and I.  We sampled several vehicles and she made sure we had all of our questions asked.   She even drove across town to get the exact vehicle I wanted from another dealer.  Any questions she did not have the answer to, she immediately found the answer for us.  \nI would highly recommend this dealership and Corinna for anyone looking for a Subaru or a Mazda
