I have been to this location plenty of times and I always receive great customer service.  The staff is always super friendly and have a great attitude.  I usually get an Iced Americano 97 times out of 100, but occasionally I'll ask for a Cocomo Undertow or an Iced Annihilator the Tigers Blood Blue Rebel is my other go. Friendly Fast and Freakin Good.
