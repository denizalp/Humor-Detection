The good: quicker than you'd think.  The line may stretch out into the casino, but you'll likely have your drink in 10 min or less.\n\nThe bad: not Starbucks items in the pastry case, so if you were looking for that lemon bread or salted caramel square, you're out of luck, buddy.\n\nThe ugly: nothing, it was quite nice.  They don't take Starbucks cards for payment, though, that might get ugly.
