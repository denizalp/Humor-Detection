why is there only one review of the Cleveland Browns Stadium?\nam I missing something?\n\nThis was my 2nd and now annual trip to see the Bengals\/Browns.  1-1.\n\nI always enjoy visiting Cleveland, because its not Detroit.\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oZzgAjjuqZM&feature=related\n\nThere is a dog pound and people bark alot.\nThey have regular hot dogs and also jumbo hot dogs.\nThere is a big windmill right next to the stadium that I believe powers the scoreboard.\nThere is a number you can text if you get heckled by browns fans. I almost used it.\nIt feels miniature and like the other review, very generic.\nat least it wasnt snowing.
