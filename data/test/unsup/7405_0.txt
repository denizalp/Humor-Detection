Awesome lunch buffet! Highly recommend this place. Isn't easy to see from the road, but definitely worth the effort to drive into the shopping center. Service was excellent our server was very attentive and courteous. Buffet price $9.95 pp and has many choices. It has become one of my favorite lunch hangouts.
