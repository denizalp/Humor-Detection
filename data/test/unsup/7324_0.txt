The PRM is one of my favorite places to go stroll and kill some time. Its free, and close to the 101 on Scottsdale Road. Its also always immaculate, too. Its a small museum, but there are dozens of cars to look at, ranging from Indy to exotics, as well as some engines on display as well. Last time I was there they had a Maserati MC12 and a Lambo Reventon on display! Nice little touches like that keep me coming back. A great place for any car enthusiast!
