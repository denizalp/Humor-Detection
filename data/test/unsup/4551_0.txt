Delicious Mexican Food. Those are the three words to describe it. I have eaten almost everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed.\n\nIt's authentic. I really love the red tamales, the tacos and the pollo fundidos. Pile a bunch guacamole on there and it's food heaven. :)\n\nI really like their chips too. Order a bag one time and snacked on it with guacamole and salsa for a few days.
