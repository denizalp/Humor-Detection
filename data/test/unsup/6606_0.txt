Perfect experience. When you're having a destination wedding things become very stressful and complicated, but everything was easy and seamless with Vinh. He researched our venue, floor plan, spoke with our planners and communicated amazingly well with us. He recommended a lighting package and ordered custom glow sticks for our wedding. He isn't your run of mill DJ. Everything was custom and made our dream wedding perfect!
