GARBAGE.\nReally that's all I have to say.\nIf you're trying to find a healthier option at this terminal... Either try and hit up California Pizza Kitchen and get a salad or... Just go hungry. \nBaja Fresh is DISGUSTING.\nThis meal I got (a salad with chicken, pico and guac) cost me $22 and I threw 1\/2 of it out. \nBlah!
