Nice H&M shop and I am very particular about them. For instance I hate the layout of the one at Monroeville Mall but absolutely love the one on South Side and this one. I guess it's been about a decade since H&M came to our area and so glad to have them.\nThis location ranks with South Side for me. It's convenient and they carry a lot more than some of their other shops.
