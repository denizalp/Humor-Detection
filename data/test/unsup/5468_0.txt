Cinnabon in Vegas is like Bigfoot. \nEveryone talks about it. But no one sees it! \n\nOther than Cinnabon at the airport or far away (in Henderson), Cinnabon isn't available to those in the south or southwest. TIL NOW! \n\nNow available at the South Outlet AND on the best wing of the mall. Next to Nike and Cole Haan :) \n\nThey, also, have a new menu item \"Center of the Bun\" which is all the soft oooey gooey center of the Cinnabon!
