Amazing!  I called and scheduled an appointment for an estimate to design our backyard.  The guy called at 10 minutes to the appointment time and rescheduled for an hour later...no big deal it happens.   When he showed up he had a piece a paper and pen and no tape measure!  How in the world is he going to give us an estimate without measurements!  What a Fail!
