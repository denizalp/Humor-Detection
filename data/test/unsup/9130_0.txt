Finally gave this a try. Food was ok but for the price, I can't complain. Waiting can be a while during lunch time so arrive early. I came in 5 minutes before noon and have been done eating before the fifth person in the line behind me got their food. Maybe a fluke? I was there for a good 20 minutes.\n\nBottom line, I think this is for students on a budget or those who needs ample amount of calories per dollar-spent to go through the day and taste is secondary.
