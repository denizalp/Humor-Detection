Always loved this place but then they got a new manager or owner -- the area around the sushi bar turns us off of eating now. Messy bussing stations on both sides, open trash bins, boxes, lots of containers. \n\nSushi is ok but they no longer have new rolls on the board anymore so the menu has been the same for a long time.\n\nJust not a positive expereince any more -- folks who work there are very friendly though.\n\nBummer...
