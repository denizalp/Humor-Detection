I discovered this place after realizing my hair was growing out unevenly for whatever reason. I called immediately and was offered a same day appointment with Misty which I happily took. Misty was amazing and did exactly what I needed without taking off too much hair. She was so nice and easy to talk to... And then gave my hair the best blowout ever! I absolutely love her. I don't get my hair cut too often but I will definitely be coming back to Misty!
