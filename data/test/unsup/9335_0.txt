Impressive New Location! !! !!!  Perry's has moved across the street from the Mall to the big \"GOLD\" (Dixon, Hughes, Goodman) Building at 6525 Morrison Blvd. and what a Fantastic move!  This new location is so Gorgeous, as a friend said \" Totally Gorgeous\"! !!  Everything looks great, everything is displayed very beautifully with tall all glass cases for the silver and handsome jewelry displays organized by type of gem and precious metals!   Great Service too!
