This is my first ever Drive-In movie experience and I had a lot of fun! \n\nTuesday double header for $8 is a steal if you do want to watch 2 movies back to back. For long weekender, they are showing Triple headers, that would certainly be a long night. \n\nI prefer staying inside the car since even after I sprayed myself with mosquito repellent, I still got a bite or 2. \n\nAnd the best, you can bring your dogs with you and enjoy the experience together!
