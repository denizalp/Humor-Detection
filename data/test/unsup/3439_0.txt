A OK\nMaybe I expected more? Maybe because the cronut fad is over? I don't know. I was excited to try a cronut, I know, it's like sooooooo 2014. Anyway, I got the.......cronut, and it was good. But I don't get the hype. I wouldn't rush back here to try it or anything. Prices were good and the selection was decent. I guess, I'm still a dunkin donuts girl at heart (hate me all you want)
