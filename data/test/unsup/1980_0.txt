Initially I visit the other location on flamingo.\nThis one was  okay.\nAs you walk in you can tell this is a newer location.\nSince I had already visited another location the other location and had a positive experience I really thought it would be the same. Sadly it was not.\nThe service was really slow and even the food was not the same quality.\nFor being a chain restaurant you would think at least their food would've the same.
