Service was OK ... food was meh ... price was OMG! This place won't last long.  Started by ordering a Smithwicks (on all the menus) oh sorry we don't have that anymore. Good I really didn't want to pay $6 for a beer.  Had the honey mustard wings to start they where just so so the blue chesse dressing was nice and chunky that was a plus.  My hangover burger was nothing special I've had better burgers at Denny's.  Over all it was just a disappointment I don't think it will get a second chance.
