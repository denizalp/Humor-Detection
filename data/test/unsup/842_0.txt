BBQ & Soul food. \n\nKind of a scary location but if you want real southern bbq & smoked meaty ribs this is the place.\n\nThe owners are really friendly people and take great pride in their love of bbq & soul food and it really shows in their food.\n\nBest ribs at the 1st annual Charity BBQ  Battle. I really liked her potato salad too.
