I hire these guys to redo stucco and they screw it up, i have to file a claim with nv contractor board to get them to fix it, they want to charge me $50 to come out to look at their screw up, i pay them $50 to come out, after they came out they say the roof was old and leak, i told them it wasnt leaking before, they refuse to fix it, so i file a claim with nv board to force them out to fix their mess. Dont hire them.
