Oysters have worms (yes, plural) in them. The waiter will avidly defend his worms and claim it's a great and wondrous thing to have worms in their food.  On top of that, they will have no problem DEMANDING you pay for said worms, up to and including threats of calling the police.  Needless to say, it was an empty threat and answers the question as to why they never seem to have a full house.
