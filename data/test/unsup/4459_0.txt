I have only gone for breakfast, so can only comment on that.  Sometimes there is a bit a wait for a table, but that is normally a good sign, right?  The food sometimes take a little while to arrive as well, but it is worth waiting for - I love their french toast and their biscuit combo is great too.  The servers are friendly.  It is not all old folk at breakfast time - if you do not mind a little wait, you will enjoy the food.
