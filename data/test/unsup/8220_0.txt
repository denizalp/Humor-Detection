This place has got to be the cleanest Vietnamese restaurant, hands down! The staff are always so welcoming. I usually get pho with lean meat and extra bean sprouts and they give more than expected. I can't say I love the broth but the cleanliness, customer service, and thai tea compensate for it. Definitely a place to cure a hangover or a cold. =)
