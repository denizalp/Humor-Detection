It is a real fun place for kids in the summer and rather affordable too.  They are running a deal with no membership sign up fees, so savings is $49.  The monthly is about $14\/month for one kid with unlimited visits. Otherwise with no membership it costs about $17 for one visit.  Easy calculation, plus free cancellation with no penalties. It gets busy on certain days when an entire group arrives otherwise it's pretty mellow.
