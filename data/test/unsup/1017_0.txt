I would love to give 5 stars bui just cant,,\"it's a sub shop\" but by far my favorite,,I have eaten at many Sub Station 2 this one I really liked and it was the cheapest combo I have ever gotten at Sun Station 2 I had a #1 $5.90 i usually pay close to 8 at others,,  anyway really good place to eat staff was great.
