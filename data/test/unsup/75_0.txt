My wife and I were saddened when we found out that Jacques closed.  We always thought it was a gem of the restaurants in the area serving gourmet food at less than gourmet prices.  Having patronized the same shopping center for 15 years and seeing restaurants come and go, this closing hurts the most.  We can only hope that chef Jacque will give it another go.
