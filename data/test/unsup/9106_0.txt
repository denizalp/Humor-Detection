Avoid at all costs for brunch. Understaffed, bad service, limited menu. This is the kind of place where they will have five tables waiting to be cleared and 15 people milling around waiting to be seated. These people wait for another 30 minutes before they seated. \n\nWe ordered drinks (specifically, cans of beer), and it took for a good 20 minutes to bring them.\n\nTheir espresso drinks are so bitter, they make crazy mocha's seem sweet.\n\nIf they got their proverbial sh*t together it might be worth spending your money there.
