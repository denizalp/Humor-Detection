This is my favorite local spot to invite out of towners.  I never go wrong when bringing tourists to this place.  Any seafood lover will be very impressed with the choices and the freshness of all the seafood served. You can't go wrong with this place! Please yourself to a bucket of crabs, mussels, or whatever!
