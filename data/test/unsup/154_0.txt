We have heard the name of this restaurent for couple months and finally we decided to be our Valentine dinner. At our arived, we didn't feel welcome from the waiter. They dropped manus and left. The restaurant didn't busy but we have to ask him to fill our empty glass. The foods were of salty. Nigiri were huge but not fresh; not sweet and not smooth. Uni was bitter. We paid about 80 dollars but I feel like I was eating at AYCE place, compare to the fish.
