This place is good for a quick scoff and run. The food is pretty decent (the Chicken Tikka Masala has never let me down here) although their onion Bhajis need some work and the service is usually prompt and efficient. Don't come for atmosphere though, talk about over lit! It's like eating under the spotlights of an evening sports event.
