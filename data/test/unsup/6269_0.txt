Oh Spago, you were a shining light of good food and service in Las Vegas!  Turkey Club sandwich rates a Very Good! Side salad deliciousness. Asian Chicken Salad was superior!  Wait staff (James) was professional, attentive, engaging and fun!  A breath of fresh air in a town full of jaded employees (who wouldn't be?). Enjoy Spago! A lovely treat!
