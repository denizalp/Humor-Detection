5-stars for cool ambiance, 3-stars for undercooked chicken wings. We had a work dinner at Culinary Dropout which included a myriad of shared dishes and cocktails. I had my heart set on chicken wings which were unfortunately not cooked correctly. Kitchen mishaps happen, but of all the chicken joints in the world... why did it have to happen to mine? Other than the chicken wings dinner overall was a pleasant experience with the pretzel bites and cheese being my favorite dish! Will give it another try on my next visit to Phoenix!
