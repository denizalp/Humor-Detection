Went there Friday night with my husband, the place was mostly empty. Our server was rude and very fast to get our order. Our drinks came out 15 minutes after we ordered them, and they were simple jack and coke and draft beer. Burgers were cold. took 30 minutes, get it together. I have no idea how you are surviving
