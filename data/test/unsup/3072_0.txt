Julia helped me switch my out of state policy to Nevada State Farm. She made everything on my end very simple and easy to understand. I received a fair rate and ways of how I could lower it due to the specifics of my driving situation. My policy was fine tuned to me, definitely didn't feel like just another number. Julia was also knowledgeable on the local DMV and it's policies which was helpful. Surprisingly quick to get all my issues resolved and out the door. Great job!
