I'm a regular. Obsessed. As if the ridiculously amazing yogurt flavors are not enough (Red Velvet Cake, Oatmeal Cookie Dough, Cookies n Cream, Cupcake Batter.....), the choices of toppings are unmatched! Fresh fruit, nuts and granola are all there, but there's also every candy bar and cereal you could possibly want. Maybe I'm still on a high from last night's \"creation\" but I'm in love.
