Overstuffed place.  Is this a grocery store?  Or a drug store?\n\nWeird shelving coming at you from all angles, not cohesive in terms of display in my opinion.  Appears to be a lot of product, but its the same old same old usual stuff.\n\nStore is clean.  Cashier was polite - pleasant interaction.\n\nIt is like they have crammed everything including the kitchen sink into this location.  They have a post office in there as well.
