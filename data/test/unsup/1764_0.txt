All the negative reviews sound like whiny girls. \n\nIt's a barber shop with men so expect appropriate conversation, the salon with ladies is always an alternative. \n\nIf you don't like your cut say something they will fix it. \n\nIf you can't wait 20 min make appointment\n\nIf you don't like Jews or Russians don't go. Stop whining \n\nLegit spot
