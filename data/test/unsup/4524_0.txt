Pretty good restaurant but dances with the fine line of being over priced. We started out with the mango jalape√±o margarita... A taste you need to acquire... Then tried the wild berry margarita and loved it. We then got the pork nachos... Very little meat and lots of chips... If there was more meat the dish would be great. We then split the fajitas (we got all three sources of protein) and this meal made the trip completely worth it! I want to try the enchiladas next (they looked fantastic)! Thanks!
