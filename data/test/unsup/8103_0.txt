I've been a President status here for years. The Red Rock staff is what rubs me the wrong way every time. Red Rock Management needs to step up with diversity classes. I've been miss treated by the senior staff there for years. I may have a shaved head (by choice) however it doesn't mean I'm a gangster\/trouble maker. \n\nIf your old and at the steps of death you'll be treated like a king or queen. All us youngsters seem to be shit out of luck.
