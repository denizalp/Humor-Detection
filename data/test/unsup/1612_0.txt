Have you ever had a real taco? I don't mean the overloaded, $5 a pop, cheese-and-guac covered fish crap they serve at Playa Cabana and the like, but just some simple chorizo or al pastor with a couple pieces of diced onion and a slice of pineapple on a small tortilla for a couple bucks. Have you ever had that?\n\nNo? Then come here.
