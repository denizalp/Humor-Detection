I appreciate Saddlecreek Coffee's response to my previous review. Thought I give them another try. Ordered an Americano and a pumpkin bread Togo. The coffee was decent and the pumpkin bread was tasty; however, it was really greasy. Notice the greased soaked white bag in my photo. Definitely not healthy slice of pastry. I'd love to try their crepes next time though. They seem to have a wide selection.
