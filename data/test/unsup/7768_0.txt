I have had nothing but good experiences here. It's great for the price. Maintenance comes quickly. The office staff is always pleasant. And has gone out of their way to accommodate us. My apartment is very nice with a huge tub and a washer\/dryer. My neighbors are friendly and have offered \nhelp when needed. It does appear to have seen better days, but then so have I.
