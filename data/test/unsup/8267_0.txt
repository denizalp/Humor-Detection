The reason why I am giving this place high stars is that they have Stevia sweetened yogurt, and it is a different special flavor every week.  It's really delicious, unlike the Splenda yogurt, which honestly tastes like ass (and the reason why I'm marking this down a star). \n\nI would never touch the other yogurt here, but for those of us who go sugar-free, this is monumentally wonderful in a town that has tons of yogurt joints who are barely even able to serve \"no sugar added.\"
