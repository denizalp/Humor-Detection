Avoid going here. The customer service if horrible and the quality of their work is extremely poor. If they were the last cleaners in Charlotte I would drive out of town to find another place to go before I went to them again!\n\nThe woman who owns the place has a really NASTY attitude. Rude and nasty... oh and expensive. That's how I would sum it up!
