2.8\n\nThere is no way I can call this place a \"fine Thai dining restaurant\", sorry. \n\nDecoration is globally OK, but placing here and there some terracota elephant statues does not turn a restaurant into a \"fine\" place! Food has to be much better, refined and tastier than what I had; and tableware should be more elaborated. Service was OK, but not more than that.\n\ngood thing is that it is not too pricey.
