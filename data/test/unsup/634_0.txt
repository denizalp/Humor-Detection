I have known this place for many years but never been eaten there. I met some friends in the area and decided to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised! The sitting was comfortable, not over crowded like other Chinese restaurants. The food were big portions, great taste and cheap! We ordered chilli chicken, egg fried rice, Hakka noodles, Manchurian eggplant, everything tasted great. The chilli chicken is probably the best I have ever had. Will definitely go back!
