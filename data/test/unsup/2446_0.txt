This would have been a perfectly mediocre chain Italian restaurant meal, if it hadn't been for the 36 hours of food poisoning I suffered through following my meal there. \n\nIt made the day long business  meeting I had after my meal there all the more interesting...having to sit by the door so I could quickly run to the bathroom to throw up. \n\nThanks so much!
