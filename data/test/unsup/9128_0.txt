I have been here several times over the years and they do an okay clean for the basic $7.99 price. If you are looking for a clean exterior this fits my budget. I am happy with their service and it's consistent and good for the money. I think they must have improved from previous years. My car looked better after and that is all I wanted. The staff tries to be fast and efficient.
