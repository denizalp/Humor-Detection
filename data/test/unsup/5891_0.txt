This little sister of a Statue of Liberty is made out of EFIS: the same styrofoam-fiberglass stuff they use to make storefronts at your favorite shopping mall.  This one doesn't seem as stern as the copper original in New York Harbor but it does appear to be pouting.  What's the deal?  Can't get a date?\n\nYou're not missing much inside, Little Liberty.  It's not like New York at all:  cigarette smoke wafts through the air; there's no Zabar's or Prada; you can't get a knish, a margarita pie, or a black & white cookie; and, parking is way too easy.
