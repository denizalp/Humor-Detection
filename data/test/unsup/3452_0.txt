Oh trader joes how I wish you were closer to me. I used to live on this part of town until i moved to mountains edge and I miss doing all my shopping at tj's. \n\nWhen I got I get the chicken breast treats for my dog, just dehydrated chicken breast, nothing else! Some \"just mango\", coffee and spices. \nI miss you, can you please move to mountains edge?
