I recommend asking \"is this a phallic item?\" while ordering here since a number of things come rolled up - including an ambiguous \"pork\" item which is more like a hot dog wrapped in lettuce wearing an edible condom (patent pending). \n\nBut don't let that dissuade you! \nTheir soups are great; their egg noodles confusing to eat but delicious. \nIn general the menu's a happy marriage of eternal life stews and cardiac arrest platters. \n\nForever turtle.
