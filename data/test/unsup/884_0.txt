Vegas baby!! So many food choices, LAVO is great for groups who want to stuff their faces with amazing Italian food, unfortunately you cant go partying after since you are so full!\n\nWe ordered the pizzas, and I had the kobe beef spaghetti and meatballs. so tasty, almost as good as Raos. For dessert you must try the fried Oreo cookies, which is their signature dish.\n\nAlso eating at the restaurant offers you admission to the club upstairs, if you can move after how much you eat :-)
