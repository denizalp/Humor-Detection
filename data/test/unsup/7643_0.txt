Closest thing to a typical grocery store in Kensington. Not too big but they'll have most things you'd need. They never really have sales, but the prices aren't TOO bad. Obviously you'll want to get your produce somewhere else in the market. Open until 7pm.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: ZIMMER down!\n\nMenu Readability: Oh, so not applicable.\n\nNeed to mention: Minimum order of $10 to use your CC or debit.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I moved to a part of town with absolutely no grocery stores.
