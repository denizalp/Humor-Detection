This was my first time time coming to an urgent care for my sons sports physical since my insurance canceled & I was more than pleased with my experience. The front desk girl names Aurora (Dont know if I spelled it right) did a great job and was super friendly. The girl in the back wendy was such a helpful person. Will come back soon!
