The conditions at this shelter are deplorable.  They have way to many dogs in pens and everything is dirty.  The employees are constantly trolling Facebook stepping up to take in any dog that they think they can quickly adopt out.  That may sound like a good deed, but unfortunately they clearly do not have the space, time or resources to care for these animals properly.  Sadly, I think their main goal is to turn a profit on adoption fees.
