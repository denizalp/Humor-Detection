One star for the dog. \n\nShe told me they accepted US currency(cash only).. she treated the US currency as Canadian dollars so I was charged about 25% more than I should've been.\n\nVery unfriendly service with an unpleasant attitude. We felt as though we were a bother.\n\nCheck out Darling down the street! Great service and wonderful atmosphere.
