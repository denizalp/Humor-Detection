People! Are you guys nuts for not giving Uber five stars?? This is the most amazing service I've ever seen in my whole life. You can be anywhere anytime and call for any car and get picked up within minutes. Other than Amazon, I cannot think of any online application that has made my life so easy. If you have a problem with the driver with a low rating, you can easily cancel before your ride even picks you up.
