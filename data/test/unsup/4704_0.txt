Sen Sushi is located where Sushi Song used to be. The interior is exactly the same -- painted brick interior with awnings and fake doors that makes it look like you're sitting in an outdoor bistro. And I swear that the food is exactly the same. This is my go-to spot for nearby, inexpensive AYCE sushi ($18\/person for dinner). The maki rolls, sashimi, and tempura taste fresh. The fried scallops are decent. The deep fried squid balls not so much.
