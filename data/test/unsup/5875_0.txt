Anyone who can post up on the same block as Rap's, hold their own and earn my Jerk Chicken loyalty is legit. The seasoning on the chicken is a little less in your face than their more famous neighbors, but I think the gravy here is tastier, better rice and peas, and count on a more generous portion. Either way, you can't go wrong, but Hot Pot is definitely a sleeper in the Jerk world.
