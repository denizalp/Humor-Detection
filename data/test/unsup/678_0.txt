My smog check couldn't have been easier.   This guy really is extra friendly.  Took care of me just like he said he would, as I was his first customer of the day!   Cozy little front with bowls of candy by the plastic lawn chairs.  I was in and out, absolutely painless!  I also got a free run through the shell car wash. Win win!!  Left him a tip as well =)
