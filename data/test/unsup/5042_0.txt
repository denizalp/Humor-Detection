Stayed here for the weekend . Yes there is a resort fee but all the hotel on or near the strip have them now . Great location across the street from Bailey hotel and right off the strip with in min.3 min. Walking .The rooms where clean . The beds so comfortable . They also have a great breakfast buffet which was worth the money. Only thing I did not like is the pool closed early at like 8pm . Otherwise I would come back .
