I have been there twice since new ownership and the food is definitely not what it used to be, and most certainly not worth the price.   The new owner is lacking in customer service by far.  Both times I have been there I have witnessed her being rude with other customers.   She will not honor gift certificates purchased under the previous owner.  As a result,  I was told to contact the previous owner to see if he could rectify the problem.  I would recommend wild sage restaurant as an alternative in the area.  Great service, food, drinks, and atmosphere.
