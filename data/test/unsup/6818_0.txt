Okay Five Guys....You've won me over since the last time I partook in some meatygoodness that is a five guys burger.  \n\nOur food wasnt as Gr---easeeeeeeeeeeyyyyy (In my best Paulie Shore voice) as it was last time.  Our canjun fries were nice and crispy.  \n\nWell, at least the food didnt seem as greasy.  Though my lack of a gallbladder would have said differently about 30 minutes later.  Thank goodness Target and Burlington had clean bathrooms!  O_o  EEK!  :P
