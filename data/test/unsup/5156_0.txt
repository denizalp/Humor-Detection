There needs to be a minus button!  This review will get edited with more details!  We had an appointment!  Ya'll, don't bother to set an appointment, I wouldn't even go to this shady place!  Just to give you a quick idea, Pep Boys quoted us $1300.00  Said the rotors were bad!  Hubby took the car to Mr. Breaks and only the rear break pads needed to be replaced!  The price........$250.00!  Pep Boys you should be ashamed of yourself!  I thought you were a company that could be trusted!\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE UNLESS YOUR JUST GETTING A OIL CHANGE!
