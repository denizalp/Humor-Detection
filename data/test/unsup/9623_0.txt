Nice pie!  Got the sausage and pepperoni pizza (all are thin and crispy) and it was very nice. Although it wasn't spicy it had enough flavor to carry the day. Was served about 10 minutes after placing the order. Coupled with a glass of wine, all in all it was a nice lunch at the airport.  Cost around $18 but was a nice sit down lunch to kill some time between flights. I would recommend to a friend.
