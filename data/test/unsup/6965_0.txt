This seems to be a pretty decent LA Fitness.\n\nMembers (well at least during the time I went) were respectful and reracked the weights. You can't say the same of most LAF.\n\nPlace seemed clean too and the staff seemed friendly, except for the musclehead working the juicebar who was texting the entire time.
