Update after multiple visits.\n\nThe check in number card system is confusing because they don't really use it and you just kind of stand there until noticed.  They run out of stuff quick and the pricing is high and seems solely based on thca%. I bought a bottle bong one visit and left empty handed on another occasion. \n\nI just couldn't justify spending so much $60 + tax for an 1\/8th is crazy. It comes out to $74 out the door. Also why are there so many taxi's bringing people here?
