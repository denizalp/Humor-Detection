TL;DR: Great food and service. Awesome ambiance, and very sanitary. It's on par with Teharu, but much closer to me!\n\nI've been to the restaurant twice. On the first time, I just had the safer rolls that I'm used to, but on the second time I tried a few new things. Everything was well prepared and delicious. The price was worth it, and about what I expected. The conveyor belt makes the experience much more fun. Traditional lanterns and artwork make the experience feel more holistic. This will definitely be my new go-to sushi place.
