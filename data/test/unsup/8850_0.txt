As many of the other Yelpers have summarized, this is a great community library in the Ahwatukee area. The place has great upkeep and everything feels new and clean. It is a cove of books and more than a dozen computers. There are plenty tables go study and lots of outlets. The noise is minimal but there is no quiet room for those who need to study in complete silence. The staff is super friendly but there are also self automated check outs for those who like to do things themselves.
