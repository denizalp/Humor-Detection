We came here for breakfast on a Friday at 11am. They have a 24 limited breakfast menu. \n\nWe started with mimosas which came back fast and were good.\n\nHusband ordered the Benedict which he liked. I ordered the ham and cheese omelette which was perfect and came with toast and hash browns, all great.\n\nThe service was fast and pleasant. I'd definitely come back. It's a fast sit cafe kinda place, nothing too fancy but everything was good and hot. \n\nI recommend it if you aren't looking for fast food or a huge buffet.
