if i could give it 0 starts I would... $35 cover to get in.. Ok whatever.. music was horrible.. dont know how girls can try and dance to house music.. the girls were not very friendly mostly standing by the bar instead of coming up and offering lap dances.... Oh and drinks are overpriced.. No I won't be going back.  I had a better time at Palomino!!
