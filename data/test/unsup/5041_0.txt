Id give this place 4 stars for atmosphere and probably 2 stars for the food if im being honest. For a place called Crust you would think they would have bomb pizza. They do not. \n\nIronically the entire group agreed the one thing off was THE CRUST. Tasted like bicuit dough or something. Also comes out shaped like a Penis at happy hour, which is a little weird.
