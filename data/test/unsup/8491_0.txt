Nice variety of pastries and the coffee is served hot in a nice mug. The dining area is beautiful and very clean. They also serve bubble tea and some rice and noodle dishes. So if you are with friends that are split between having a bite or a dessert, that's the place.\n\nThis can be an extra for some: They have a TV on asian channel. I kind of like to see the news from elsewhere in a different dialect and try to figure out what is happening. :3
