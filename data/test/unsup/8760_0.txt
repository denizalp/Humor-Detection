Yes, their gelato is on the pricier side, but I'm still a fan of the flowering treats here. The flavors are fantastic. I usually stick to mango and strawberry, but sometimes I'll get chocolate or lemon. They also have gelato macarons which look cute on top of the gelato rose cones and are tasty to boot. This location doesn't have much seating inside so be prepared to take your orders to go, but there are seats and tables right outside.
