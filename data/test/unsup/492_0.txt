After my hip replacement i was admitted to this facility. I was very impressed. The nurses and staff all very helpful, friendly and loving. Margarita from housekeeping such an exceptional asset to this hospital with cleanliness and care always smiling. The food was delicious, my stay was comfortable especially knowing i was surrounded by great care. Thank you all from medical records Annabell to all the staff in housekeeping, to my physical therapist and all the great loving nurses from every shift.
