Good tasting food in a really beautiful location.  So why the 3 stars?  Well, the price is just out-ray-geous (something like $350 for 4 people for brunch).  And while I probably would have sucked up the price as part of the woooo Vegas experience, the fact that the brunch is a buffet really makes it unjustifiable.  Fine, it's 3.5 stars but as Yelp doesn't have half stars I'm rounding down because of the price.
