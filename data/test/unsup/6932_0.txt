Service is excellent! They have a points system too so if you buy a certain amount of coffees you get one free. (Love rewards) The food is delicious and the pastries are so good. Banana Carmel cakes is out of this world and so is the carrot apple cakedefinitely recommend the lattes too! Great French cafe
