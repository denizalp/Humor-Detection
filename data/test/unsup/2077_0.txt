I've seen more Yankee games here than at Yankee Stadium!\nBut lets go straight to it, this is a great ballpark. I've seen 3 games here and the atmosphere is great, especially at night where you can see the CN Tower! I've had fun times here, but it would have been more enjoyable if the Yankees won those games ;P
