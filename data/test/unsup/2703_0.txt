The white pizza was very good.  Enjoyed the thicker bread like soft crust that is crisp on the bottom and edges.  The topping of mozzarella, ricotta, red pepper flakes, lemon zest and garlic oil was evident but wish it had just a tad more garlic. You get a pie that is about 8 by 10 inches and cooked in a metal pan to make the crust crunchy.  Will definitely return some time and try another style.
