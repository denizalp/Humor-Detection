We went there for dinner and we got the antipasto misto appetizers and the Classico pizza. Appetizers was a sample of charcuterie, cheese, and olives with home made bread made from pizza dough. It was delicious! \nThe pizza was amazingly good too. Home made caramelized onions, tomatoes, and dough. Great pizza! Good service and nice place. Great experience for an Italian dinner!
