Where to begin... \n\n-bathroom, small as a hallway closet, the toilet was something outta Alcatraz prison.\n\n-room, smaller than a hallway closet.\n\n-AC, middle of Las Vegas summer 110 out side, non working. (The average temp in room was 92 degrees, my parents had to leave a day early due to unbearable room conditions.\n\n-Staff, unsympathetic to both my parents and their friends issues with the AC units in the room. \n\nIn a nutshell spend the extra bucks on a renovated hotel on Fremont street, avoid this hotel at all cost.
