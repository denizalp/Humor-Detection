Horrible!!!!  We went as a large group,  men and women. The hassle and hustle begins at the door and does not stop till you leave. The place was nearly empty,  but they hasseled us over tables and crazy minimums till we just threw in the towel and left. We had hotter chicks in our group anyway. We'll neeeeever return. 2 thumbs down  for this spot.
