Room was nice, what we expected. We did an overnight staycation (we are locals) to get away from our new puppy & kids. All I kept thinking about was how excited I was to sleep in! Check out is 11:00. At 8:22 housekeeping begins banging on the door wanting to clean the room. Woke me out of a deep sleep & I was not happy! Of course I couldn't fall back to sleep. Then at 10:00 they started in again! Check out is 11:00! Leave the room alone until then! Frustrating.
