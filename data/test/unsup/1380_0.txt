Went with our 17 month old son recently and had a blast. We went after church on Sunday morning and had the place pretty much to ourselves. Thought 15 bucks total for all three of us to go in for two hours was reasonable. Even as a little guy he loved all of it and could do most of it with our help. Clean, spacious and the food was good too. Only thing I wish they had was high chairs or booster seats. A little tough to eat and contain the younger ones. We highly recommend though.
