Came for a quick last minute brunch. Coffee and other drinks were pretty good. Breakfast sandwiches, toasts, bagels, etc were all delicious. I would definitely recommend getting something freshly made rather than the stuff in their case.\n\nOnly criticism is that the staff want very attentive and our food took an hour to come out. So, while the product is good, don't expect great and speedy service.
