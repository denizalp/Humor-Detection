What a wonderful place to hang-out after work! We ordered pork wings, beer, Pita chips and Margharita flat bread amongst other things. My friend ordered a shrimp and she was really happy with how it was prepared. \n\nI am a vegetarian so I stuck to Pita Chips, they were deep friend but soggy :( Our server was a beautiful girl with a lot of patience and courtesy.
