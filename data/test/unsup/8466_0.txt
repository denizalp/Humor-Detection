Best Buy Mobile Experience - Today I used Best Buy to upgrade my iPhone.  I will say that the level of service that I received was way better than that of what I normally get directly from Verizon.  The staff was a pleasure to work with.  The young man that helped me was super friendly and answered my questions.  Would highly recommend them over the corporate Verizon Store.  Did I mention I didn't have to wait for someone to help me.
