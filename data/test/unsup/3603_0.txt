The doctor took too long to authorize my prescription with the pharmacy. I called the office, spoke to employees, left messages multiple times but it took over 2 weeks to get things straightened out. My body suffered due to missed doses.\n\nThen I was given a new prescription. Ok... EXCEPT that it is 6 TIMES more expensive than the brand I had before, which I had no problem with. Prescribed me a more expensive medicine FOR NO REASON.  I was not told the price up front and instead was surprised at the pharmacy. \n\n\nTime to find a new doctor.
