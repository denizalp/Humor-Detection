How on earth are folks so excited about these bagels? It's nice that they use Boar's Head meats, but the bagels are completely lacking in texture. My bagel flattened out like it was made of air. Where's the chew? No thanks.\n\nI really wish this were just some accident and that I had a bad batch, but I doubt it. I'm baffled by the folks who compare these bagels to ones in the Northeast.
