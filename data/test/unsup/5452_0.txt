...paid $50 for an appraisal in January...have YET to receive the appraisal, a refund or a response to ANY of my emails...I believe this company utilizes paypal as a payment method because paypal doesn't 'guarantee this type of transaction\/service' and therefore won't proceed  with a complaint.  $50 is not going to keep me from eating but my experience with this company owned by Jesse Amoroso has been one of deceit, extreme incompetence, unprofessionalism and rudeness. Be careful....PS, they don't deserve even 1 star....
