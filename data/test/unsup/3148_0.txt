went on a friday night... it was EMPTY wtf.... the band playing was too loud, and the lead singer must have thougt hes Bon Jovi in the 80s.. or Axel dunno.\n\nAnyways, there were neither any guys, nor aifroce guys there. If anyone knows where to hang with airforce guys, PLEASE let me know.\n\nOur shots were way too expensive.... just saying. The other prices where ok for beer and tequilla mixers.
