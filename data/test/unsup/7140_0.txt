my parents and I decided to eat early lunch here. This used to be Fortune Restaurant located opposite International Market on Decatur.\n\nThey serves dimsum. The owner said it was the first day of opening and we are the 2nd customers. They only have few items of dimsum ready. The owner said it was their first day so taking a while. \n\nthe dim sum was ok. All of the dimsum are $2.88 each which is pretty inexpensive. We had chicken feet, pepper stuff shrimp , pork ribs and shumai.
