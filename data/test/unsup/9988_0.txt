I've tried this place 4 times to give it the benefit of the doubt. and lee is better than the 3 other people I had. He actually takes his time and makes sure you like it before moving on. But other than that the others want your money. I keep going back because so close to home and decent price. I only recommend lee tho. Also I wouldn't get your eyebrows waxed or try their fake eyelashes extensions... you get what you paid for and the both ladies that do that are extremely rude.
