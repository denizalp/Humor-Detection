We weren't disappointed in Olives, just not overly excited.  Service was fine.  Not bad not amazing.  Food, was the same.  I had the pesto gnocchi and my husband had the lobster risotta or something like that.  I wouldn't eat here again, but it wasn't horrible.  We have had much better food and service.
