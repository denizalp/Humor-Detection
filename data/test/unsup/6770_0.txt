I'll get the bad stuff out of the way: this place smells. Let me make that clear, I am not using smells at a metaphor, the place smells old and moldy. It's a pity because in a picture the inside wouldn't be bad. The food is ok but it came on ginormous plates and it seemed they were really keen on adding cheese on everything.
