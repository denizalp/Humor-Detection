I ordered the chicken noodle soup that was priced $10 dollars thinking that it'd be anywhere near satisfying for its price. Turns out it's approximately 8 ounces of bland 1 piece small chicken pieced soup. I hate writing bad reviews for businesses but this is a prime example of a strip establishment overpricing its customers just because they could. I'm a Vegas local and it's disappointing as fck
