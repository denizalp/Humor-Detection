As a young adult, this was not the place to be in late july. Had a youth Basketball tournament going on which swamped the place. Little kids everywhere anyway. \n\nThe GOOD was that tables were $5 and I saved $100 on my car insurance. \n\nI was also on the 17th floor, at the end of the hallway. And I get hit on by alot of prostitutes this trip for some reason. who knows.
