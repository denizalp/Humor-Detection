We eat out and order drivers regularly. We've tried every delivery restaurant in Penn Hills and  these folks are the best. Food tastes great, is prepared as ordered and delivered quickly. We won't order delivery pizza\/Italian from anywhere else!! Hats off to you for being the best! Love the stuffed shells!! Extensive menu items. They've got something for everyone.
