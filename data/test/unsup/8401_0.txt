What a wonderful business and customer service. Van is the best; an owner whose quality of work matches her affability. Even though I live in South Gilbert, I'll make the trek to Chandler just for Van's. I will keep coming her for tailoring services because her prices are fair and her commitment to the customer is unrivaled!
