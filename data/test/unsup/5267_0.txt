Great food! I love the BLT sandwich with crispy bacon adding avacado! My husband likes the roast beef sandwich adding creamy horseradish and a side of au jus.  The turkey and Italian sub are fantastic. Service is very friendly and welcoming! Unfortunately they close for the summer! Would like  to know when they open up again.
