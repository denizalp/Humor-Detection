Delicious! I've been here a couple of times now and their baked good are too die for (calories don't count when the treats taste this good), and the latte is also delish and beautifully presented with a leaf design in the middle. Love it and so will you! Please note that they do not accept credit cards. Cash only. It's hipster, it's cool, it's trendy.
