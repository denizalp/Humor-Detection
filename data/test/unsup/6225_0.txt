Cute cafe in the Strip District of P-burgh. Every surface in there emits the aroma of well-made coffee. I opted for a Clover-pressed brew and was not disappointed. My partner-in-coffee got a beautifully filagreed latte. If I didn't live 300 miles away, I would return sooner.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Unpunnable, sorry.\n\nMenu Readability: I think I just walked in and said \"coffee.\" (It was early.)\n\nNeed to mention: Intelligentsia coffee available here. Also, this place ain't cheap.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: If forced to, I would WALK three-hundred miles for a decent cup of joe.
