They just opened their new studio which is beautiful!  My girls and I have been to several birthday parties at AZDA and they are sooo much fun, very well organized and the kids always have a great time.  We have also been to see the Nutcracker for 3 years in a row, they put on great shows, they are professional, the costumes\/brackgrounds are beautiful and the dancers are amazing.  Its so great to see such a family oriented place that supports our local youth in this community.
