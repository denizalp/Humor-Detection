Ozzy was our server last week, and he was phenomenal! Very patient and suggests as well. He came to our table already prepared with our usual initial wants. His section got full quickly, but he still checked on us often. Always has a smile on his face :) Thank you for your service, Ozzy! Hope to have you as my server again next time!
