Looking for a new favorite breakfast\/lunch place? Well this is it!!! I never go anywhere else....I have been coming here for awhile and have never had a bad experience! My food is always served fresh and amazing. Your never going to get a bad meal when you come to Griddlecakes. My mom loves there eggs Benedict she actually craves it! The Hollandaise sauce is never tart and always amazing and we just can't stop coming here!!!!
