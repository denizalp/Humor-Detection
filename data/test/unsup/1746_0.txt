Do yourselves a favor and skip this place! I can't believe how bad the customer service is. The selection is poor and if you ask about anything they don't have, you will hear 50 reasons why that brand or product has problems and you should buy something they have instead. I had a bunch of problems with some reloaded ammo they sold me from Nevada Cartrige company also. I wish I could give zero stars.
