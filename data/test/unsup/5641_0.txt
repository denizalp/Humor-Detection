I had Rush and his team re-polycoat my walk deck patio. They were professional, candid, and forthcoming from the first phone call. It was clear they had experience with walk decks, which is a specialty trade. Not all roofers have this expertise. My #1 concern was would they do the job right and with the quality to last over time. After looking at the finished project, I'm convinced Rush and team are the folks to go for this type of work.
