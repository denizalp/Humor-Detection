Finally we have a captain boil in Mississauga too. \nIt's a very big and open restaurant. When we came it was empty. \nThe server told us to choose where we want to sit. After we waited for the waitress ones she came we \nordered shrimp and a king crab leg, fried rice and corn and a shrimp bucket. \nThe food came very fast cause.\nIt was nice as always.
