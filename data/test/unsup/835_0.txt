Went for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the service and food. If you order extra meat, it's definitely worth the money. Get a lot more meat than you would expect.\nI would certainly be going back to this place again. \nI ordered the pork with cheese katsu which comes with unlimited salad, miso soup and rice refills.
