Good food, busy restaurant, not quiet. \n\nServers are always attentive and knowledgable. The menu has a huge selection. Almost too huge! Food is always great. Portions are big and I usually have leftovers for the next day's lunch.\n\nSometimes it can be quite noisy and tough to have a conversation. There are so many tables next to each other that noise can really travel.\n\nThis is one of my wife's favorite places and I always get in trouble if I go without her.
