When a customer is asked their name and they respond deliberately by stating, 'they will write it' CLEARLY they do NOT want it spoken out-loud. When the clerk DOES read the written name out-loud, it can be assumed they did it deliberately--violating the customers attempt at privacy from the public.\n\nTWO stars for lack of concern over customer' privacy\/security.
