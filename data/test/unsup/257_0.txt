When I come to vapiano...im always pleased. Im not a big pasta fan but its something about the way Robert cooks my pasta that keeps me coming back for more. His cooking skills are great and his humor is the cherry in top. Vapiano has a great ambiance and me and my friends love to visit for drinks and music. I can definitely say as long as I can get Roberts great pastas, ill most definitely return for more than just drinks and music and bring more of my friends to experience the greatness.
