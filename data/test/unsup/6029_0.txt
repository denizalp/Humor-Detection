Don't go there!!!!\n\nTerrible service, food less than OK, and......they charge you a CNF (extra tax) fee on your bill. We ask for clarification, they told us Paris charges them a fee to be part of the hotel and so we have to pay an extra tax to them. Went to the Paris management, they didn't know this was happening at the restaurant.  \n\nWe received THE WORST SERVICE OF OUR LIVES!!!!
