Rolled in on a Friday night, not wanting anything to do with having to make dinner or wash dishes.  The parking lot sucks as there is a lot happening in this corner of the parking lot.  Lot's of bodies were ahead of me, but the PE staff keep the line moving and seemed unaffected by the human waves crashing down on their Orange Chicken.  Was in and out quicker than I expected and upon ingesting my Panda found the quality to that of any other Panda.  A solid option when you don't want to do anything other than eat.
