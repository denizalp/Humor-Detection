Being from LA I was shocked that you couldnt buy liquor anywhere else. Also the prices of alcohol was insane. I love my hard liquors and was not able to get the brand of choice. It was double maybe triple the price I would pay back in LA so I figured it wasnt worth it. I showed my CA ID but it seemed like they didnt really want to check my ID. They just told me the price and that was it. I found out about Sortilege through my friend and I have been craving that ever since.
