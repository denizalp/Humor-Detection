Amazing. Definitely try the kale salad. A new way of Italian including our  newer foods (and healthier) like quinoa (in dessert, amazing!), kale and the sort. Wasn't in love with the homemade wine, but it was acceptable, and at least you have options!  A refreshed look at these healthy foods and Italian food. Again, AMAZING!
