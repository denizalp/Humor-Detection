Everything is so close together (equipment) and the STAFF IS THE WORST part to this location. Rude, careless attitudes, and horrible listening skills but thats how their fearless leader leads. If it wasn't down the street I'd pay for another gym - like most in Vegas... Customer Service ranks below under performing. \n\nThe facility is overall simple to navigate with everything being so close to one another. Male lockers are not the cleanest, ; don't walk barefooted!  Group X classes are like many and so far I've encountered positive instructors! Take it for what it's worth.
