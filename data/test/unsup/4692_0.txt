I decided to get some front layers so that they look like bangs (if that makes sense) and since I live around the area I decided to check this place out. I like that the place is clean and looks a bit upscale. I told Caesar what I wanted. I am really happy with how the look came out!! If you explain things right then your look will come out how you wanted. Caesar was very friendly and talkative as well. Definitely recommend this place
