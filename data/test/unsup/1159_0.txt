Went there with a coupon for buy 1 get 1 free buffet for $19.99 with 3 other people.  Got the bill and it was $110.00.  Found out that the 2 for 1 meant that they cut the price from $44.90 to $19.99 meaning 2 meals for the price of 1.  Poorly worded and misleading coupon.  Service was decent, coupon made me feel otherwise.  Especially after our waiter told us the bill would only be a little more than $44 with the coupon.
