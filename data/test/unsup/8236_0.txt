The burgers here are usually very good.  The only issue is sometimes the toppings are just thrown on top of the burger which makes it very difficult to eat without making a huge mess and falling apart.  My favorite burger is the original smashburge - it has their signature sauce, lettuce, onion, tomatoes, ketchup & mustard.  \n\nThe location is great and their fries are usually really good as well!
