I usually come here for their HOT GRASS JELLY with Qball (flavoured mochi - comes in Green Tea, Taro and Sweet Potato flavours) and tapioca. \n\nI'd like it if they made the grass jelly a bit hotter so that it would be more similar to the ones in Taiwan. Otherwise, it's pretty good.\n\nService is great. For the times that I've visited here, the place isn't packed so it's usually spacious.
