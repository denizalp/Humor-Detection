Not a very good store in my opinion.  The prices are about 15% higher than other stores nearby.  It's fairly clean and service is what you expect from a Walgreens.... Crappy.\n\nI can't stand the check out system of these places and others like them (CVS).  Just horrible.\n\nAnd the check out process is WAY too long.\n\nAvoid!!!
