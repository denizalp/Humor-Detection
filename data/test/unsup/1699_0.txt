If I could create a storyboard for one of the MasterCard Priceless commercials it would go something like this:\n\n   - Car service to STRØM Spa: $30\n   - Bathing suit since you forgot yours: $80\n   - Outdoor Thermal Experience in negative 12 degrees Celsius weather: $38 and very cold!\n   - 60-minute Signature STRØM Massage: $94\n   - Herbal Chai Tea to warm you up: $3\n   - Best almond cake which made the entire experience worth it: $5 (in our eyes $250)\n\nYou and one of your best friends having an unforgettable and well deserved time in Montreal: PRICELESS!
