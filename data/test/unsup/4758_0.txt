Hanging with the boys\n\nMy husband and I and a bunch of other boys partied here after Tao,  Sapphire shuttle came and picked us up.   We were already so tipsy and the girls came and made it more fun.  \n\nMy husband enjoyed two of the three dances and the one he didn't care for was the one I picked for him...( the Asian one) lol.  \n\nenough said....
