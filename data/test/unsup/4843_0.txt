Checked out the comedy night last Thursday here. Decent bar with an unusual two room setup. One side is just totally bar and the other side has a stage for whatever. They had $4 captain and Coke on Thursday, but the comedy was the same pathetic amateurs telling fart jokes. Can't expect much for free. Patio was nice outside - too bad patio's can't have a non-smoking section. College bar.
