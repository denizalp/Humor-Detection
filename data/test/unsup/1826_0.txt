Pros:  Great food, large food and beer menu and great layout with three floors. Friendly staff.   \n\nCons:  poor execution and preparation . When we came, thy ran out of several entrees as well as basic items like chips (French fries) and most appetizers.  \n\nI have been to the other Pasty locations in Tempe and Scottsdale and they are great.  This location needs work.
