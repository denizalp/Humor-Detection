Oh how I love this little sweet shop, they have chocolate, they have cookies, they have gelato, they have cupcakes, they have all my favorites and oh yeah coffee too.  My absolute fav are the cookies, which are baked in house and vary daily and yes they are addictive.  The gelato sometimes seem to have freezer burn so I usually don't order that.  Occasionally I get a cupcake but pass me the white chocolate macadamia cookies because they are amazing and my fav and usually available on Fridays.
