This store carries a good selection of dresses at a great price. Some of the dresses might have small imperfections, but for the price point is completely worth it. Keep in mind that some other dresses are in perfect condition, they are just the leftovers from previous seasons. \n\nThe service is also great, the associate is friendly and tries to make you feel comfortable with your decision. I did not feel rushed to make a purchase as she understood this was an important decision. Overall, this is a great location to come and see when buying your wedding gown.
