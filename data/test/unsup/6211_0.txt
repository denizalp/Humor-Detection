Just finished eating here by myself--prob not optimum to eat AYCE kbbq alone bec you just can't try that much variety.  I got and ate 90% of my food (bec it's bad to waste food): steak, marinated steak, Bulgogi, rice cake, kfc, tofu soup.  Everything I had was fantastic (except for rice cake--didn't care for those).  The service here is awesome--they change the grill without me asking.  My server is named Kailin--super friendly and helpful--made my dining experience wonderful.
