While they did not have the very specific item I wanted in stock, the gent who was managing the counter was very apologetic and very helpful. They've only just started carrying this particular line and they don't have all of the different varieties yet.\n\nOther than that, the shop is very tidy, nicely stocked and has what looks like a great selection of nutrition and vitamin supplements. Prices looked great.
