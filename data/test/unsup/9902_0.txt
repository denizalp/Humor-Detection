I'm always satisfied when I come here. Didn't get to see my usual Ivy. None the less,  I'm still happy. I didn't settle with my usual style. Decided on the coffin look today. Thought I try something different. It's pretty but I think when I go back for my fill in, I'll go back to my original style. I have to say though the color I chose is banging!! I'm just a glitter freak! Just a little advice... make an appointment. This place tends to get busy.
