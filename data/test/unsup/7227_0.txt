Do you like \"Mexican\" food? Do you LOVE cheese? La Pinata is for you then!\n\nI was surprised at the inauthenticity of the place given its location but cannot complain about the actual food. I had the Pollo Azteca and it was very tasty. The chicken was well seasoned and cooked and absolutely smothered in cheese. The portions are a perfect size: eat half at the restaurant and take half home for lunch tomorrow. Please do not attempt to eat it all in one sitting, Phoenix does not need any more morbidly obese people. Seriously, we have too many already.
