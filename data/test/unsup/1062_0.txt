I've been coming to the birthday suit  for a little over a year now and I absolutely love it. The staff is always professional and friendly. I always get great result and I cannot wait for their new location to open in summerlin! Plus they are very well priced, I've paid double for a BZ at other places where the results weren't as great and the staff was not the best.
