BEST dental office ever! Super friendly staff (Michelle, Suzanne, Courtney) and Dr Bhatt of course!!! Modern dental chairs with massage, TV, headphones, all make the experience incredible!  I've been going there for about 3-4 years, and have NEVER had to wait more than a couple minutes to be call back to a room. Couldn't say enough about this office.
