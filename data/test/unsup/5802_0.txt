That main building was quite a sight to see and they allowed us to go up to the top and peer out the windows.\n\nOn the top level, there are a few showcases with art and designs that I thought were very nice but, I'm no artist. I can only appreciate things as I see them. The students seem very artsy fartsy and they had good things to show in the hallways.\n\nThe world needs art. It makes our living space so much more liveable. Art and design is even in the very can of cola that I'm drinking right now.
