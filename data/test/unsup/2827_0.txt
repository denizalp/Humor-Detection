This is more of a tip than a review.\nIf you want them to stop calling you, tell them your income is less than $25,000.\nThat being said, they'll tell you unfortunately you don't qualify for their services\/timeshares, ETC.\nI make way more than that but when they called me and wouldn't stop harrassing me and then asked me about my income, that's when I told them \"it was around $25,000\". They said \"Oh, unfortunately, we have minimum income requirements\" and wouldn't be able to offer me that \"Free\" vacation.
