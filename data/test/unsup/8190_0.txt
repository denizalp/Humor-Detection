Went here for dinner last night. Sat at the bar and got a avion margarita that was on special, tasted really good after a long day in the sun! Ordered off the 3 combo selection section, food was so good I took the leftovers home. Finished off the night with a chocolate tequila shot for desert, WOW! So smooth and refreshing. Would recommend this place to anyone that wants a quick bite and a good margarita!
