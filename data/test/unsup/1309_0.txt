Looks much fancier on the inside than the outside. However be sure to dress-up, casual doesn't really cut it here. \n\nService was slooooow - food was alright, but nothing too exciting. \n\nBest Tip about this place: If you're under the age of 40 you'll be treated like you're 15 and your mom just dropped you off at the mall.
