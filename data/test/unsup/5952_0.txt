What can I say about Tim that hasn't already been said? Although I didn't end up getting my car serviced at Walter's Automotive, Tim gave me a lot of helpful advice and was very personable. You can tell he genuinely cares about his customers and their concerns.\n\nI'll definitely be going to him if there's anything that I need to get fixed in the near future.
