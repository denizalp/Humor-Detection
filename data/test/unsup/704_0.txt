Not in class, library, or gym? Then I'm probably here.\n\nI do really like how our Student Union is very up-to-date as it's fairly new compared to some other school. It's 5 stories of fast food, Ballrooms\/Meeting Rooms, computer lab, gaming rooms, nap rooms, Sorce room (craft room), and just a place for students to hang out!\n\nThey continue to add new things each year, which is awesome. The only downside is that it does get super crowded throughout the day, so it mightve helped if the space was bigger, at least for the first floor.
