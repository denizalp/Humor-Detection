I took my car to get an estimate after it was rear ended. Joel met me outside and looked it over.  With the damage and bent frame the scope of work was too much for their shop.  He recommended a place to take my car and even taped up my entire trunk area as it was raining hard that day and he didn't want me to have water damage also.\n\nI will definitely be back if I ever have any other issues with my vehicles.  Top notch place!
