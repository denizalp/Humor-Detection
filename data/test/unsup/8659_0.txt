My new go to farm to table restaurant!  Ingredients were fresh. Everything was superb from their handcrafted cocktail libations to their appetizers and entrees.  I am still giving them 5 stars even if I was not that impressed with the black sesame crepe dessert (this was supposed to be one of their signature desserts).  It didn't have flavor and the crepe was very dense.
