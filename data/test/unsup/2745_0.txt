What tastes good on a 115 degree day?  Gelato of course!!  Came across Amorino Gelato while wifey was shopping at the Las Vegas North Premium Outlet.\n\nSampled a few flavors before deciding.  Chose 3 flavors.  Mango sorbet, Banana sorbet, and Hazelnut gelato.  All were good, but nothing amazing.  \n\nPrices were a bit on the high side, but not overly expensive.  Be prepared to eat your gelato out in the heat cause there is hardly any seating available inside.  Better eat fast lest your gelato melt.\n\nCan see myself frequenting them again especially if the temperature is hot again.
