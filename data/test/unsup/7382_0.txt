Really impressed on my first visit.  \nGreat venue. Perfect energy. \nGreat looking menu.  \nGreat looking plates.   \nGreat tasting food.  Wish I could eat more or come more often and try everything! \n\nGreat service.  Perfect.   Glass of water delivered at the end of your meal - bonus marks, classy touch.  Never had to ask or look around for our server.  Coffee perfectly replenished exactly as needed. \n\nGreat value.  It isn't cheap but it's really really fair value.  \n\nAnd the kids loved it too.   \n\nJust a great experience all around.  I wish there were more of them.
