Good , authentic mexican.\n\nHad the 3 carne-asada street style tacos plate with rice and beans. Very generous portions and could not even finish my food. Meat was tender and hot off the grill. Added guac, pico, lettuce and lemon squeezed over the whole thing, simple delicious. They beans and Spanish rice are some of the best I've had anywhere, ever. They also have negro modelo on tap. Overall very solid and would eat here again, good service, nice non-tourist trap atmosphere.
