I visit this business for the first time. \nToo many signs of  don't do's.  Ordered fry bread stuff with beans and ground beef, the menu price $6.79, at check out I was charged $8.31. I ask the cashier how did you get to $8.31, she responded \"I have to pay taxes, you can't buy and not pay taxes.\"\nI should of walked away, but didn't.\nTo the lady cashier, you not only over charged me, the stuff fry bread needs more stuffing, taste like I had fry bread with no stuffing.
