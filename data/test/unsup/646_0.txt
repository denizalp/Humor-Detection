Absolutely amazing. Staff was incredibly helpful and sincere. Dr. Huang was awesome, very honest and to the point. His patients wellbeing is definitely his top priority. I had all 4 wisdom teeth removed and it was actually shocking how quick everything went. From the consultation to the surgery to the post-op; everything was quick, easy, and to the point. Would definitely recommend Dr. Huang to anyone needing oral surgery. I'm actually sad I have no need to go back regularly as I absolutely hate going to the dentist.
