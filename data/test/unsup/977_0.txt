This was our first morning in Phoenix and we tried here for breakfast. We didn't wait very long on a Saturday morning and our waitress and server were very friendly and attentive. THE best breakfast we've had during travels in a long time. Everything was super fresh and in huge portions! Williams definitely want to come back to try some other stuff!
