2.5 stars... \n\nGreat shows come through here, the building is cool to look at in a retro way and the seating is roomy, as mentioned in previous reviews. \n\nBut... \n\nThe parking lot SUCKS: if at ALL possible, find a parking space you can back into (if not possible, figure out a way to back into the space anyway); there is such thing as a \"bad\" seat here and the acoustics are good for music but not voices.
