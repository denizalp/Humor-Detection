Dear Justin, spare me. Can you not make a comment if you work for the place? Can you not comment after a whole year? You need to get a life  buddy!!! People who are looking to go there want to know what it's like, hence yelp. I am from Michigan, and was visiting the Phoenix area. I have been all over the United States, so I can guarantee you I can \"be pleased\". This place is a nightmare period. Not for an adult who isn't filled with silicone or covered in nasty cologne and hair gel.
