I took a yoga for runners class here, and while the physical studio was nice, clean and pleasant, the staff was slightly on the pretentious side. Unfortunately, the class quality didn't make up for that. The instructor was awkward, slightly introverted and unhelpful in breaking down positions for beginners in the back who were very obviously struggling. \n\nThe studio is still well equipped with showers, props for yoga and plenty of parking was available. I might try a different class next time.
