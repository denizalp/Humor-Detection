I've had worse and had much better. Quiet midweek - Local hangout , friendly enough folks and staff. Tried it for quick  burger \/ sandwich couple of times & the last time will be my last. Served what looked like a burger; but  the play-do ones my nephews make kind of look like burgers too . Think I'd rather had  the play-do one.  What I got was good for shoe repair or hockey maybe - not so much for eating.
