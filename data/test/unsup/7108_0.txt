Been working on filling up my frequent customer card at Acacia Cafe, still in love with the little place. Turns out Sunday's are special because they've got a few extra menu items for their Sunday Brunch, including an awesome Fruit & Nut Waffle, with cranberries, raisins and walnuts baked right in. Yum. Other Sunday specials include Eggs Benedict and Eggs Albuquerque. If you've never been to Acacia on a Sunday, check it out.
