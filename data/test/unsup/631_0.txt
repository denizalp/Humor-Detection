In A Nutshell:\n\n-Fry's Marketplace is the Lord of Supermarkets!\n-It's super HUGE, extremely clean, organized & they have a freakin' beer & wine bar!\n-While you are enjoying your Sauvignon Blanc or ice cold draft IPA, you can ask the meat department to cook up that raw chicken or beef you plan to eat later.\n-That's the epitome of a full-service grocery store.\n\nOverall, since it's Arizona, they have a giant covered parking lot so you can spend hours inside & then come out to a bearable car.
