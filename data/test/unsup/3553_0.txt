The Gibson Library is a small one, but the service is big. The library staff are always patient to help you and very polite. I absolutely love the fact that they have a drive thru window. Who would've expected a library to have one! If you tell them you're a regular drive-thru patron, they will put your requests right at the window and lessen your wait. Talk about convenience!! It's perfect for those super hot days when I don't want to get out of the car or when I have my little buddy with me!
