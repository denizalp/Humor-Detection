This place is awful! The menu is has a strange combination of foods, the service is terrible, the food is terrible. It's an old restaurant in a lovely historic building but the inside seems dirty. The silverware was dirty and he whole time I was sitting there eating I was a little creeped out by the cleanliness. I have been there once and will never go back. Gross
