I was not impressed with anything. I waited inline to check in for over 30 minutes. When I took the car out and was on my way to Yuma i realized all to late there was no windshield washer fluid in the car. Lets  just say smeared bird poop and a hot windy desert drive with no way to wash it off does not mix.
