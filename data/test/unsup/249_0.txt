Dr. Holly has been great. Started out seeing her to have wax removed from my ears. Followed up with a hearing test and decided to move forward with hearing aids. She has gone above and beyond to help. Spent the time to go over options and contact my insurance company several time. If you are looking for someone that actually cares about her patients look no further.
