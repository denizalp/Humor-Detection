I wish my husband would look at me like he looks at doughnuts from Glory Hole  they have an amazing selection that doesn't disappoint.  They're fresh, taste great and it's ok to get more than 1 and not feel guilty! We definitely recommend them and will keep going back. Remember to go early because they sell out quick and make each batch fresh every day.
