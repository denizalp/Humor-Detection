After reading the Yelp reviews, I had to try this place.  I ordered the tri tip plate with macaroni and cheese, and coleslaw.  I really enjoyed my meal.  The tri tip was tender and tasty and my two sides were really yummy.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  I had to give Big B's Texas BBQ 4 stars because I wished they had more than just one BBQ sauce.  I like my BBQ sauce spicy and sweet.  I will be back!
