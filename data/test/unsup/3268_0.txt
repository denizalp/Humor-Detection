This place hit the spot!!! Very rare that I find a seafood place that is true to its name. The lobster bisque was amazing. We had the garlic sampler which fed 3 of us (could feed 4). The frozen banana shake (alcoholic) was phenomenal. No need for me to have dessert. However, the fam had the waffle sundae skillet. Shout out to our waitress, Sarah, she  and the other staff took great care of us!!!!
