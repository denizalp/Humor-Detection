We came here in a group of 4 on a Saturday night around 7:30. Place wasn't pack and a group of servers were just talking to each other ignoring us. One was on her cell phone and the rest I assumed just gossiping. Dont get me wrong, beer is really cheap here. $12 for a pitcher. Thats the only good thing about it.
