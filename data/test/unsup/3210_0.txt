Great brand, great store... It's clean, their employees are trained very well in customer service, returns are seamless, they have great quality for most things.  Their produce section is not to be desired and their fancy packaging fools you into thinking everything they have on their shelves is healthy, which is very untrue.  I recommend buying your toiletries here which is an underrated aspect of shopping at trader Joes, or TJ's better know to the soccer moms and milfs that shop here which is another added bonus.  Good suburban, little past their prime talent.
