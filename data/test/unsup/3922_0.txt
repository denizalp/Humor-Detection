I've never had much luck with this location.  Slow.  Frequently wrong order. At times downright rude, or at least clueless when dealing with customers.\n\nI was overjoyed to see a sign out indicating they had new ownership, so I gave it another try.\n\nPizza by the slice should be warmer than room temperature. Maybe it's the location that's cursed?
