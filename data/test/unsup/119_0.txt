Had SUCH high hopes for eating here.. Sad to say, probably won't be coming back. If I'm going to spend 12.00 for crab dip, I want a bowl of it, not some placed on a baguette. My friend and I spent 60.00 for the two of us. Service was less than spectacular. 6.00 for a shock top? I can buy a 6-pack for 8, where's the value in that? Disappointed overall.
