I've heard a lot of good things about Gen so when my friends and I decided to try it out we were not disappointed at all. Every time we've been there Ozzy was our server and he is by far the best server I've ever had. Very personable and tentative he will make sure you have a wonderful experience while eating there! Thank you, Ozzy!
