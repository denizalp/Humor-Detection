Love Honey Bear BBQ! A buddy had them cater a party for him and I nearly passed out from eating to much. The pulled pork, chicken, or beef are all great and they don't skimp on the sauce which is what it's all about. It's all about the sauce! The peach cobbler is good too. I go there every chance I can not to mention I can reminisce about the old days as a kid eating in the retro-blue IHOP building.
