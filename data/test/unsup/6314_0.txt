My cat gets to live thanks to this pet insurance company.  I took out insurance on Fiona less than two months before she was diagnosed with lymphoma, and I expected trouble getting reimbursed.  But Embrace has stepped up and done exactly what it said it would do.  I could not afford to treat Fiona if I didn't have this insurance.  They've already paid over $1,000.
