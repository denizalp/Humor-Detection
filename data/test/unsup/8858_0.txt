I freakin LOVE this place! I am not a huge smoker but I love the references... I almost died laughing at the ice cube reference... I am corny. I know.\n\nThe sandwich was good, I also got a brownie. I'm not a sandwich person so I couldn't go into detail about it but I do know it was good. My BF introduced me to this place because he used to eat here when he was at ASU. \n\nGreat place!
