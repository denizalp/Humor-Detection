ok have eaten at el polo loco for at least 30 years. Prior to eating at this new scottsdale store i ate at the one on Bell and 7th street. that had been several years ago because i got food poisoning from there. so after throwing up bad chicken you tend not to want to eat there again. so fast forward several years. new one built in Scottsdale. So i thought why not... greasy and old chicken, i couldent believe it ... new store and greasy and old.  Well im done.... very disappointed.
