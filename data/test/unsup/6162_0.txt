Went in to get a lease. \n\nNo one really seemed to know what was going on and they did not even know the current lease specials from Honda. I had to inform them what they were! WTF!?\n\nI was told I would be called the next day with the final details of the lease. Hmmmm, 3 days later no call or anything.\n\nI think I shall not even bother with these fools and go somewhere else.\n\nLosers.
