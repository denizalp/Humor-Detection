I walked out of this restaurant yesterday. As I walked in to grab a late breakfast, the hostess \/ cashier and waitress were haggling over who would take care of me. No greeting from either of them just this back and forth between them about who was going to take care of me so I decided to make the decision for them and leave.. your food is not that good so you should thank anyone that walks through your doors
