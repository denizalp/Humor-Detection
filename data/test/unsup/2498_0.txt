Banh Mi & Ti is a great place to grab lunch with friends in Lawrenceville. Be warned that it can get crowded sometimes, especially if you want to grab a patio seat when the weather's nice.\n\nThe food is fresh and delicious-- I get the classy chick bowl, which comes with chicken, jasmine rice, pickled carrots, scallions, and tomato and cucumber slices. It's big enough that you can definitely save some for a snack or small meal later on.\n\nTheir bubble tea is also awesome. Overall, a great spot!
