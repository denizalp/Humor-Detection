While im waiting for my shaved ice, let me write this review. It's been an hour that i stepped into the restaurant, been sitting at this table and just observing the work flow. There is only one waitress doing all the serving, taking orders, cleaning of tables while one is at the cash. My friends are almost done with their food and still just a glass of water in front of me. I understand they look really busy but i think they really need more staffs. Good luck sugar marmalade, i'm not coming again!
