I heard of the legendary service from Hiland's on Youtube. I decided to pop in and get some snow flake tobacco. I was a little lost when I first came in. Soon after I met Scott the legend is true such happy and helpful staff can't be found anywhere else. I will be coming back here for all of my needs. There is nothing better in AZ.
