I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and it was amazing!! They are soo friendly and helpful! The food was beyond great. They do offer a lot of meats but try the lamb! The food wasn't dry and was cooked perfectly. Our waitress was very sweet and fast. \nThank you for making our dinner party great!!
