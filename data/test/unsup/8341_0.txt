I don't love food festivals typically but the Las Vegas Greek Festival is one of the better organized events around town. \n\nPrices were high which is typical but the food was good, there was plenty of seating, lines moved quickly, entertainment was fun and they had booze. What's not to like.\n\nI have had a good time on the few occasions I have been over the years. I would choose this festival over any other in town, for what it's worth.
