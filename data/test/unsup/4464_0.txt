Imagine taking a stack of sliced salami, maybe 15 slices thick and taking a nice bite out of it. That is the equivalent of eating a burger from this Kmart brand nostalgia restaurant. The fake old-timey roadhouse decor is a reflection of the fake food: looks nice on the outside, but tastes like rubber. Their burgers are too salty, like compacted hockey pucks -they taste more like a slice of bologna, than supple, crispy seared beef.
