The best chiropractor and acupuncturist! Dr. Lam has such a calm energy and is so knowledgeable in his field. He has helped me through shoulder & back problems with his Chiropractic care. \n\nHe never \"promised\" acupuncture would \"heal\" my cysts on my ovaries (I had tried everything else with no success) BUT it worked! I was pain free after two sessions and thrilled b\/c those cysts hurt so much for almost one year. \n\nI continue to see Dr. Lam and will always sing his praises!!!
