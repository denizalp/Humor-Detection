Great food and atmosphere if you're looking for something fancy for date night dinner after visiting the mall. Food here is not too heavily priced and the portion sizes are good. The menu offers a bunch of different options including steaks, hand-heads, vegetarian, and gluten free.\n\nWe ordered the peppercorn steak and a double-stacked turkey sandwich. The steak was tender and juicy while the peppercorn brandy sauce was to die for! On the other hand, the turkey sandwich also tasted great and was too filling for me.
