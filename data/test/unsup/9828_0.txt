At Mr. Zagros, you get to have your cake and eat it too. \n\nNot often do you eat at a place where every bite is delicious and the portion sizes are too big to finish. \n\nWhile I highly recommend the chicken shawarma wrap or plate, I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It's a family owned place and is my go-to for chicken shawarma in Richmond Hill.
