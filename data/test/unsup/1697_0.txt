This place is amazing!!!! Just a relaxing vibe. Have some great food and unwind on play ping pong or cornhole. \n\nOrdered the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy with a biscuit. It was delicious!!!!Best Mashed Potatoes and gravy ever!!!! Don't tell my wife I said that. Chicken was too die for so juicy and crunchy!!!
