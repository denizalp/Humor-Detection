Be careful when you go here, they charged me twice, once on my debit card then on my credit card after saying the transaction didn't go through. I tried to get them to reverse the charge after a couple of days when the transactions showed up on my bank statement,  I even showed them the cancellation receipt, however they refused and said they wouldn't do anything. \n\nEnded up paying $150 for $40 of mediocre sushi. Not worth going to at all. Don't waste your time or money.
