Bobby Flay grills a hella good steak! This is my 2nd Bobby Flay restaurant (first one was at Bobby Flay Steak in Atlantic City), and I loved it as much as the first. Just like the steak at Bobby Flay Steak in AC, the steak here at Mesa Grill was perfectly charred on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. Delicious. Best steak ever. I don't even like steak. I heard Bobby Flay was a jerk in real life, but I just can't help loving his food. It's so good!! *puppy eyes
