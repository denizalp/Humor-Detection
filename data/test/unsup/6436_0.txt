There's a lot of good one can say about this place, but there will never be words to describe just how incredible the lemonade is. \n\nHuman language will never do it justice. It's more of an idea- a movement of energy and passion and explosions and joy and bewilderment...\n\nIve had an ongoing quest for dukedom at this establishment and while I'll be unsuccessful in my quest, I know that no matter what I'm still the real winner here, having had so much lemonade.
