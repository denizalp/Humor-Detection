This is the best meal we've had in Madison so far. We ordered Arepas, Empanadas, a Cubano Sandwich and started off with Tostones (crispy fried plantain patties). The Arepas and Empanadas were ordered as part of the lunch special that came with soup (or salad). We tried both of the soups of the day and those were great too.
