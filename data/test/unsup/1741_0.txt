Everything was nice until I was leaving and went to the toilet.\nI picked this restaurant because of the views on Yelp. we asked the hostess that we would like to sit next window and she said that this seat is better than other side. So we sat at that table,the lady who worked as hostess she said other side u can't see anything just desert!\nBut it wasn't! It was super view, much much much better than my side of view.\nI wanna see her boss's face! Boss need to teach the hostess  how to talk to customer.\nBetter for future.
