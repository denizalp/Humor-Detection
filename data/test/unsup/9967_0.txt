Went on a Wednesday night for trivia night and I was impressed.  Busy, but not crazy.  Lots of wait staff, everyone very friendly and helpful.  Ordered a cheese small pizza with 1\/2 pint of cider and a side Caesar salad.  Yummy!  Walked out of there for less than $20, which, for a single person, isn't bad.  If I'd had more to drink the tab would have been a lot higher, and believe me, I was tempted.  Lots of wonderful sounding craft beers and Sangria by the pitcher.  Heaven!  Will be back soon!
