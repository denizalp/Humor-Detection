Organic, skilled groomers and friendly service!  It doesn't get any better than the quality of service provided at Muttley.  We take our dogs and our foster dogs to Annie and her team and they always do a great job.  \n\nEntrust them with your Poodle, Doodle or Terrier and you're sure to walk out with a good looking pooch...not a platypus w a shaved tail :)
