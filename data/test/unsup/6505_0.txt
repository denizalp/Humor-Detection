This review is for the Food Truck that visits the Biltmore area on Tuesdays. Will be happy when they finally open their store front there. The hot dog is a great butcher dog made locally, natural casing beef and pork dog. The dog is cooked to order, wrapped in Naan. I got the chipotle cream cheese and green chilis on mine. Overall very nice dog.
