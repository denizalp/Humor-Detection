Continue to visit Brass Tapp ever since it opened in my neighborhood and there has been no improvement in the service whatsoever. We continue to sit in the restaurant and watch the servers struggle to get to their tables. If you're there for 2 hours, you'll get at most 4 visits from the server and maybe 3 drinks. They can't seem to figure out proper staffing. Case in point, they do not employ bus boys there to clean up tables that remain dirty for 45+ minutes. Waste of time and money.
