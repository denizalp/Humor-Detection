Enjoyed a pleasant dinner with family here during a business trip to Vegas.  Inside a casino off the strip, so it's a little more laid back and prices seemed more reasonable.  Wouldn't know though since we splurged and order a ton of dishes off a $360 comp.  Us 4 adults, 2 toddlers, enjoyed a humongous meal of some delicious appetizers, steak kebabs, sushi, warm sake, brewskies, and more.  \n\nDined like royalty.  Good food, good company, good times.\n\nThanks Shizen!  Enjoyed it
