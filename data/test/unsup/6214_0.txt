I think it's completely rude that they forced us to take our food Togo, even though we ordered 40 min before closing time. I understand that they close at 10 pm, and as someone who works in a restaurant I understand that after a long shift you want to go home. However, I feel like this is completely unacceptable. I will never dine here again. And their curry is mediocre at best. GO TO TONKATSU KYOSHI INSTEAD. SO MUCH BETTER.
