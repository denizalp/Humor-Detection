The vastness of route 51 seems never ending when all you want is a beer! You've been stuck in traffic for the last hour and all you see is gas stations and a Donino's pizza. In comes Bobby's!\n\nFor a $2 16oz draft Yeungling, you fulfilled my needs! The bartender was SUPER friendly and you could tell that she definetely knew everyone's name there. One downfall, smokings allowed. But a $2 Yuengling can make you forgive a lot...and perhaps forget a lot too;)
