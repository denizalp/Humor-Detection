Best veggie burgers ever!  I swear they must put crack in those things -- I'm a total addict!  I'll go back a couple times a week for more...and I'm not a vegetarian!  They're pricey though but totally worth taking out a second mortgage for.  Their produce is decently priced.  Slightly cheaper than Giant Eagle but not West Side Market pricing either.  It's a clean market and very welcoming with a good selection.
