My friend and I stayed in Vegas last weekend and ate here. The waiter was great, the food was great.  We ordered the filet mignon, mashed potatoes and a vege...everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Our waiter was so polite and attentive.  The room was large and even with a lot of people talking and eating wasn't too noisy so we could hear ourselves chat.  Very nice restaurant you won't be disappointed.
