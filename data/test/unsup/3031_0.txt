Holy cow. I thought service that bad didn't exist in Chandler anymore. We sat down and no one even stopped by to take our drink order. After 10 minutes we got up and left. They weren't even busy, maybe 10 tables at the most. I made eye contact with our waitress 3 different times and she still never came by. As a Hispanic I have never felt more uncomfortable at a restaurant in my 26 years of living here in Chandler. Never again.
