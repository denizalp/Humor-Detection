Might be one of my new favorite breweries. The service on a laid-back NFL Sunday was quite pleasant. A couple of the taps were out and that is always disappointing but the flavorful variety of beers did not disappoint us in the least. There are a lot of choices here in Phoenix, but this one hit the spot. We tried every beer on the menu between our group of 6 and there was something for everyone. No food on the menu here, but you can bring in your own. Good popcorn!
