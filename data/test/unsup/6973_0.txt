Stopped in here on a whim and was more than pleasantly surprised. First off the staff is incredible!  They have tasting tables to try their many products (none of which I didn't like), gelato, coffees, and teas. I highly recommend the cranberry honey iced tea. It was so refreshing on a warm day. Also, do yourself a favor and get the gelato on the brioche bun.  It's the BEST ice cream sandwich you'll ever have!!
