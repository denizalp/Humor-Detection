We received 2 meals with vouchers from listening to a time share presentation, so we got a plate of food instead of the usual table side meat service. The hot and cold salad bar was really good. The selection was fantastic and I loved the beets and the goat cheese. My steak however was tough and so gristly I had to spit out most of it. Mashed potatoes and gravy were the best! Service was slow.
