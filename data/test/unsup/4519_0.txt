This place rocks.  It's infinitely better than Gordon Ramsay's and DEFINITELY better than the Homestead in Caesars - that place is way overrated.\n\nAndiamo's did not disappoint in the least.  I love it.  If you like Caesars Salad then order it here - they do it old style and make it at your table.  The steaks are fantastic and the lobster risotto is melt in your mouth oh-so-good. \n\nGoing back to Vegas this week and I already have 3 days set aside for this place.  Booya.
