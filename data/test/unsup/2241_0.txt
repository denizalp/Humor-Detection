Always such a great treat! I wish there was more around the valley because it's so refreshing in this Arizona heat. I love all the different options of shaved ice they have and that they have speciality flavors during holidays\/seasons. \n\nI love the gelati which is shaved ice with custard on bottom and top. The mixture of the creamy custard and the shaved sweet ice is amazing! My two favorite combinations is cherry ice with vanilla custard and root beer ice with vanilla custard. \n\nHighly recommend. Great place for families! Must get the Gelati (:
