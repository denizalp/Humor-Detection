I enjoyed this place. It's decent Sushi in AZ and it even appears to be owned and staffed by... wait for it... ACTUAL JAPANESE people. As opposed to 95% of sushi places owned\/run by Koreans who memorized \"Hello', \"Thanks\", and \"Cheers' in Japanese and attempt to trick their customers by pretending to be Japanese.\n\nToo bad this place is so far south it's practically Casa Grande adjacent.
