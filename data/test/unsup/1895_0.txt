Oh Butterfield's how glad I am to have found you after my tried and true breakfast joint just packed and left me. \n\nThe service is amazing, the food is super yummy and breakfast has never tasted better.  With so many choices and tons of space, there is never a long wait and the food is always high quality and top notch.  I'm pretty sure I'm in love.
