One of the best run courses in the state, hands down. Great food deals, great prices... great atmosphere. this course had it all for me. management  couldent be more friendly and helpful. Decent holes!!! well done. RJ, and David,  the managers, are a hoot to deal with. there is nothing they would not give to make sure your experience is top notch. they even have an atm so i can bet with my buddies. well done....
