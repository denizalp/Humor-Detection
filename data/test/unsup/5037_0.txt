The only thing that this place sells are truffles, and they tasted extremely bitter and nothing like what the specified flavors suggested. Wouldn't recommend at all! Each truffle is priced at $2.00 a piece, I'd recommend going to Walmart and getting truffles instead, being that they actually taste good.
