Sorry Port of Sub but , I ain't eating here anymore. I work in the offices behind it and I've watched them chinch the heck outta peoples sandwich's.  The ladies are nice that's not the issue for me. When you slice a dang piece of cheese so thin that it breaks and then put that on someone's sandwich like it's a full slice REALLY? And the meat too, I wanna ask them,Yo can you slice me a regular slice of meat and cheese wow let me get my moneys worth.
