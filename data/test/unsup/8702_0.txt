So, they have a website that says they do to go patters and that you can customize them.  Apparently that is not true. You can just order from a list of 3 sushi platters and that is all.  I wanted to order the big platter and add a bunch of extra separate rolls but apparently that is not possible. The reason is they don't have prices for rolls to go.  Yet they sell these rolls in their restaurant.  Bizarre.  They don't want people to order more food and spend more money.
