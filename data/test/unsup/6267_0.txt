What a scam!!! Don't Waste your time. Even, there is no free gift. They promised us two free flights, and $100 visa prepaid card. BUT to get them, we have to pay $150 as a deposit, $150  (two $75 as agency imposed fees), PLUS TAX. However, we are limited in the date, the day of week, and lots of other restrictions. All in all, you pay $150 deposit, and because of lots of restrictions you are not able to get the free flights. Even if you get it, it is much more expensive than cheapo-air or orbits.
