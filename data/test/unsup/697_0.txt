Went on a Saturday to check this place out.  WAY crowded, smelly (like rotten diapers), and the set up makes it very hard to have physical access to your kid at all times (kids can climb into tight spaces in which a adult could not), kind of claustrophobic.  Not enough seating.  Too much junk (i.e. high chairs, toys, etc.) blocking the store front and shoved into other corners of the very small space.  Overall, the place seem dirty.  Not good.
