The food is simply terrible!\nOvercooked pasta, undercooked enriched flour pizza crust and tasteless sauces caused for embarrassment when i went there with an Italian friend  who was visiting!...\nAnd the fact that my previous bad review was taken down due to \"complaints from the community\" lowers my opinion even lower than any possible low rating!
