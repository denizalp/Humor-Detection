I have nothing bad to say about Nova's Bakery. This location is fairly small but there coffee and pastries are very good. It can get busy on weekend mornings. The server we had today was very friendly and enjoyed speaking with her. \n\nIt was the perfect place when craving a brownie this afternoon! Easy to get in and out of.
