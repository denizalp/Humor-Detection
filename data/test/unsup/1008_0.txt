Still remember my first time passing Jesus guy. I was young, probably 13-14, walking to the Eaton's center. Dude was just chilling, holding some pamphlets. Walked past him and \"BELIEVEEEEE IN THE LORD!\". Skin jumped right out of my goddamn body. What an exhilarating experience. I see him often and every time am brought back to that moment. I walk past now, tensed up, knowing that the shock may come. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesnt. Sometimes... \"BELIEVE!!!!!!\".
