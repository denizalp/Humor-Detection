I've been going here for years. The service definitely went down hill. Went for new glasses last week and had girl helping me telling me \"black frames don't look good on you.\" Well thats really one of the only colors I buy and I like them, rude! Then I find a pair I like in brown and she says \"Nope, too big for your face.\" Alright give me my prescription and I'll go somewhere else. My God. Way too much going on in the office, screaming clients, workers rolling their eyes, drama.
