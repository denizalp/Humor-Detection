I pulled off I-57 on my way back to Chicagoland after finding this place on my handy iPhone app.  \n\nThe Red Curry chicken was very good, served piping hot. The veggie rolls were fresh tasting and better with some hot sauce along side the peanut dipping sauce. \n\nThe service was friendly and worth it was worth the stop.
