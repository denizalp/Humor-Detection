This place just oozes coolness. I've only been a handful of times, and not on the weekend, but got great service. It's super hard to find, all I can tell you is there's a smaller bank facing Camelback with an ATM on the side. It's the next business alongside the ATM, just South of the bank. It's DARK inside, which is great!\n\nI feel like sitting here, I should be making an arms deal or selling a few thousand pills of ecstasy. But you'll probably be alright just hanging out with friends. If you're poor, this probably isn't your ticket.
