This is a great place to stay when you want to visit Las Vegas with your family. This resort is clean, big and not too far or too close from the strip.. Minutes away from the strip, it's a perfect place to enjoy with your family. \n\nThis is our first choice when picking a place in Las Vegas. And the points we use is really good. I will highly recommend this place.
