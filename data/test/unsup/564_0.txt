As 3 native New Mexicans we are very conscious of the true flavors of northern New Mexico cuisine and we must say that our high expectations were more than met here at La Ristra. Our server Aaron was friendly helpful and effecient. His recommendation of margaritas and the calabacitas were right on point. I can honestly say we WILL be back!  Nirvana for the New Mexican food addict!
