It was supposed to be \"Rock N' Roll\" Thursday and got free cover for being a hotel guest. \n\nIt was dead. Absolutely 100% dead. \n\nThey were playing \"Mr. Brightside\" which is a.) Not rock and roll and b.) Not dancing music except for the few drunk girls lurching around the dance floor. \n\nAnd then I left. The End.
