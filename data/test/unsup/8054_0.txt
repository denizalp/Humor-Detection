I went for dinner with family on Xmas Eve since most buffets were ridiculously long lines and pricy. Love the compliment popcorn. Juicy burger with crispy onion rings and refreshing cocktail. My dinner was complete. Overall, great food and friendly staff. Nice and cozy atmosphere. Definitely check it out when you are in Vegas.
