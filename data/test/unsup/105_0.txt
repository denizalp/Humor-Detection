Snubbed at the door today. Wife and I stood there waiting to be seated. Waitress walked right by us and didn't make eye contact and never said a word. We gave the place several more minutes then walked out. Nope. Too many other restaurants to chose from right there at Trinity. Walked over to East Side Mario's. Greeted immediately and sat soon after. Sorry no food review for Fionn's.
