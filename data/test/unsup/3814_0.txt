The customer service was the worst.  We went to them for help to set up a new salt water tank.  They sold us too many fish to start with and did not provide us good information.  The fish died.  They said it was not because of what they sold us.  Then we went to a different place Fins and Friends and they helped us get the tank set up and all is great with our new fish.
