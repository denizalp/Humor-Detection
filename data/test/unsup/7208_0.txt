Have been here multiple times, each time hoping for it to be a little better. But this is the last time I will be here. Not only were my boyfriends wings undercooked,  but our server was rushing us the whole time and making smart remarks \/ even told us we were her last table and trying to get out. SWERVE BYE FELICIA
