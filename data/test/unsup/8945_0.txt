A wonderful gem in the middle of town only begins to describe Local 25. Yes all the other reviews are right, the food here is outstanding. I would describe the food we had as comfort food--the kind of meal that becomes a new memory because of how the food was prepared. The gunnies stew and chicken pot pie were delicious, both had  complex flavors and were some of the best I've had.    When in the area we will return.
