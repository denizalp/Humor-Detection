Only a week since this place opened. The restaurant is decorated tastefully and is spotless. Located in a strip center -  self parking was a breeze to locate.\n\nIt was lunch and I went with the pork Tonkatsu. The entree came with miso soup, salad and steam rice. The portion was generous and my friendly waitress crushed sesame seeds and mixed it with a sauce which was yummy for the pork Tonkatsu. The Tonkatsu was crispy on the outside and moist and hot inside. \n\nI'm so looking forward to returning and trying their curry.
