Jen is awesome! She explains what brushes you need and where on the painting you use them BEFORE you even start painting. She also calls the brushes by what they are, rather than numbers, which eliminates confusion. I have been 6 times and planning on many more! I have heard from friends about other paining venues and I'll stick to Design and Dine. The Henderson location is the best! It seems bigger and not so crowded. Plus there are a lot of hair dryers! Do it! You will keep coming back for more, like me!
