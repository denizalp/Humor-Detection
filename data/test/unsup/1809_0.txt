Pi Co is my favourite place for margherita pizzas near downtown. It's fast, fresh, and great value. You can customize your toppings and also make the crust gluten free. \n\nThe crust is cooked to perfection - great charred flavours. They could put a bit more mozzarella, but in all, great taste and great price. \n\nPerfect spot for a quick lunch or snack.
