It's pricey. After that all is awesome!!! Shared the prime rib, twice baked potato, Mac-n-cheese and salad with the bread.  The two of us could not finish it! The prime rib is HUGE and very good.  Had the leftovers for lunch the next day. Everything wonderful. Been there 3 times in last 6 years and the place has not failed us. I'd go back for the bread! Great servers and very clean and elegant table service.  Nice quiet place.
