What happened to this place? The employees are still really nice but the prices have doubled. 7.25 for a dirty chai?? Even local boutique coffee shops don't charge this and for the quality that comes at Dutch Bros' out of the plastic jug chai and just above average coffee- this makes no sense.\n\nThey're fast, which seems to be the only factor involved in having to go here. If you have time, you might as well explore your options in the other places around the area and get a really good cup of expensive coffee elsewhere.
