Was craving a taste of home yesterday and based on yelp reviews decided to try TKRE for lunch. The Dahi Puri was forgetful at best - flavorless and bland. My chicken tikka kathi roll was underwhelming. Chicken was dry, under-seasoned, and was not cooked in a tandoor (who are you trying to fool here?)! The parantha itself was very thick and undercooked.
