I had Bianca do my hair and makeup for my wedding in Vegas last week.\nBooking things online makes me nervous, especially as I was travelling from Australia and had no local knowledge.\nWell I was extremely happy ! \nThey were really professional, and did a fantastic job.\nWould not hesitate again to use them.\nWell done guys, and thanks ! :)
