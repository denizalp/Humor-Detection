Seriously, where did all these 5 stars came from? Owner's friend? Family? They ate for free?\n\nWhen I saw the menu it looked familiar. They have another store call Sushi 21 or something... This is when I had the \"oh crap\" moment..\n\nDidn't have good memory from Sushi 21 and Sushi Cruise is the same. Fish on the nigiri is like frozen, defros,  frozen and defrost again. Soft, soggy fishes....  Hot food is like frozen, defrost and reheat.... I think that's pretty much sums up the food quality.
