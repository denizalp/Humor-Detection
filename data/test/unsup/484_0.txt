This place was amazing. Loved the atmosphere here and the service was fantastic. I ordered the Fungai burger and it was cooked to perfection. Melted in my mouth perfection. I didn't order a booze shake because I was too full after the burger.  The sweet potato fries and the onion rings were also delicious. Highly recommend and compared to food prices at every other place on the strip, the prices were reasonable.
