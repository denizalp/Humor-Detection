Once finding a stylist I like, I find I get a consistently decent haircut for the price. The place is clean, and the girls are friendly. I have gotten the occasional not amazing haircuts, but fortunately I have weeded out the bad stylists and my hair grows super fast. \n\nHonestly, though, for a few dollars more you can go to a good salon where you can make an appointment.
