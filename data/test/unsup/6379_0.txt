I like the venue!!! guy\/girl ratio was pretty good too since they had special promo for girls to get in free with drink tickets!  They do lack the shaded areas... you have to squeeze into the bar area in the back if you want to get some shade, but hey just put extra sunblock on and enjoy the sun!\n\nI like the $35 drink cups that fill about 4 drinks.  Refill is $25~ :D
