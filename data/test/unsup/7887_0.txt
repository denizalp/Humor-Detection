Cold crisp draft beer!!!! There were 2 Bartenders working that were very friendly and polite... One recommended a Chicken sandwich with Cranberries that was awesome, steak sandwich was ok but not recommended by the staff...\n\nThe bar was very laid back inside people kept to themselves more of a real locals hangout.\n\nClean bathroom with plenty of soap and paper towels :) \nFor a bar that allows smoking it didn't smell like a astray inside great ventilation... The meals were under $10.00 very inexpensive & the beer was cheap in cost also..
