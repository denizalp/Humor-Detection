I wouldn't recommend Pino's for weekday lunches.  The pizza is ok, but for some reason this place has not updated technology enough to accept credit\/debit cards, which I think is unacceptable.  At night and on weekends, however, both the pizza and the service get better.  It's definitely worth trying.
