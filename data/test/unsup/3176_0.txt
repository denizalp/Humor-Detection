I haven't came here in a while but I ordered a coconut shaved ice and I asked if they could put a little more condensed milk and they said 25 cents... Really? Your going to charge me 25 cents for a teaspoon more of condensed milk when you can buy a jar of it for less than $3? Better yet I seriously maybe got half a teaspoon of condensed milk in my snow ice which really pisses me off. Never coming back. What a bunch of cheapskates.
