This was our first time, but it was better than any other Korean BBQ we've visited. Ozzy was our server and he is fantastic. He was so friendly, upbeat, positive and always attentive. We tried all of the steaks and shrimp and a really good pork steak. I am not too into pork, but it was delicious so it also exceeded my expectations. We will be back! Thanks for making our third Anniversary dinner a success!
