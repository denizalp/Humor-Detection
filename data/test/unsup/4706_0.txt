Waited 15 minutes just to leave. Myself and others kept piling in while those who already dined were paying before us. Customer service? Non existent. When people enter any restaurant they should be greeted and seated in a timely manner rather than have those who've already ate cut lines. My business was happily taken elsewhere. Perhaps a hostess\/ host position should be posted.
