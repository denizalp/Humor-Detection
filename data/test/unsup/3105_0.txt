This place deserves some credit. At first I thought the price was a little high but the mountain of food made up for it. Great crispy fries and the steak burger wasn't half bad, it actually tasted like steak. Didn't get a chance to try the sweets but my sons hotdog was great as we're my wife chili cheese fries. The cherry on top for me was having Code red as a selection in the fountain drinks. Freddy's = The best fast food I've ever had.
