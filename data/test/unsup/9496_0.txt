The food was delicious! We went there for New Year's Eve, and despite being booked, the owner personally was able to accommodate us for a delicious dinner. Caitlin had the fried calamari and side salad which were both delicious and I had the pho with banh bao. The pho was 3.9\/5 and the banh bao was so good!  The atmosphere of this place is also very cool and modern - great place for a date night!
