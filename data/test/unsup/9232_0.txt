Dear Lost Leaf,\n\nI love you.\nI know this might seem sudden to you. I'll admit that I did fall hard and fast, but please don't fault me for that. I can't help that I think you're amazing.\n\nMarry me? Put me out of my misery. Stop making me stalk you so much. Yes, I enjoy seeing you so often, but I want to call you mine. It would be spectacular; I promise.\n\nAlways yours,\nYour Lost Lover
