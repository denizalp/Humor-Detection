I'm a pretty big fan. There are still a couple issues to work out but they're not anything I really care about so... yeah. \n\nBasically, I love the design or the architecture or both. Not sure which is which. But it's rad. \n\nIf Sens' bathroom makes me feel a little amorous, I've probably touched myself in a Hanny's bathroom. Probably. Beautiful. \n\nTodd and Jason are great bartenders. \n\nI like the martini concept they have going. $5 for vodka. Yes, please.
