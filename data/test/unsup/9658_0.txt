This place is really horrible. Salty dishes and very little food for the money. Goat is grissley and very little meat. I have gotten better naan at Safeway. The naan is dowy thick under cooked. I eat in a lot of Indian restaurant all over the country and this one is off my list. You want good Indian food try Delhi palace in Tempe and compare fir your self. This is it once fir me here.
