Dude. Seriously. Good eats. I like fast cars, fast women, and fast service. Honey Bears is just that. Err, i mean.. Whatev. The ever-so-popular BBQ Pork Sandwich was the juiciest its ever been today. Add the seasoned fries and wash'er down with the RC Cola with crushed ice. I say \"Damn, son.\" Ima fixin' ta look at dem ribs ya'll talkin' 'bouts.  I turned southern all of a sudden.
