Came here with some friends for lunch. So delicious. The chicken salad was phenomenal, and the croissant was fresh. The brownie was also BOMB! My friends loved their meals. The decor is so cute- totally the kind of place you can cuddle up with a book and a coffee and treat for a few hours- and not as loud as Starbucks. Staff was so sweet and attentive. Can't wait to come back!
