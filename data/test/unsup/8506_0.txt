Horrible experience. We drove 20 miles to look at a car that was advertised on the Internet. When we got there, they could not find it. After making us wait in the office for 15 minutes, they told us that they had sold it at auction two weeks earlier. Seriously - they couldn't update their website for two weeks? I will not do business with Earnhardt dealerships ever again.
