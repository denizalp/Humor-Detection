We have been at this location 3 times in the past month and can't rate it high enough. Very cordial and friendly staff, excellent sandwiches. Totally unfair to compare this to Capriotti's, Subway, Firehouse, or Port-a-Sub. This is the gourmet of subs, in my book. The ingredients are freshly sliced in front of you, the tastiest bread, and flavor abounds. Sure it's a bit more expensive than the other places, but the care, flavor and service are all there and worth it.
