Ahh good ol' Steamie Weenie! This place is fantastic! Located right off GVR parkway and the 215 it's in an easy to get to, nice location. \n\nA family run restaurant that serves high quality food at a decent price, you can't go wrong! Me being from Tucson was excited to see they have a dog on the menu call \"The Tucson\" basically their take on an Sonoran dog. (Grilled dog, wrapped in bacon, pinto beans, mayo, mustard, jalape√±o salsa, pico and cheese) \n\nSo good! If you're in the area, definitely give this place a try!
