Horrible service upon arrival. 6 open tables and we were told it would be a 30 min wait because the hostesses said they didn't want to overwhelm their servers.  The three hostesses then went on to tell us the restaurant was so very busy and we didn't understand,  even though we were staring at a restaurant with several empty tables.  The hostesses were rude and condescending.  One hostess then went on to say our patronage as year round Arizonans didn't matter. No thank you Outback, we'll never visit again. Oh and we easily spend over $1,000 every year.
