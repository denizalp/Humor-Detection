This is a neighborhood dive bar in Mesa [so set your expectations accordingly] with good food and good prices. However, they do have the BESTchicken wings I have had!  I get them grilled which adds another element to the wing... and a flavor you can't find at most places.  The wait staff is always friendly too!
