This is a beautiful addition to the Wynn, which we love.  The decor is very elegant - and very red.  Love the giant red chandeliers.  Spacious walkways, really nice bars, and of course, shops!  Short walk to the Wynn.  Love that I can play here and my points work for both Wynn and Encore.\n\nHaven't stayed here yet, but I'm sure we will one day.
