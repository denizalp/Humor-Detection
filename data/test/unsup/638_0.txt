The store is dirty and ugly, their stock is faded, and the staff ranges from tired to outright surly... but Astro is one of the biggest mail-order comic shops in the world, and that's where they shine. They can bring in almost any comic and get you a hefty discount. Moreover, they are supportive to new titles and independent books. What more can you ask for?
