Sure do love some Honey Bears!  Cheap tasty eats for us carnivores.  Luckily for me, this location is 5 minutes from my work making it one of my favorite lunch break spots.  I would give it an extra star if it had the cool ambience of the Van Buren location but alas, it feels like a 1980's fast food joint.
