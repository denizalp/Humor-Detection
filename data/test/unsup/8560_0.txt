Crowded but well stocked and organized on Christmas Eve. I was surprised not to see long queues in front of the registers but it seemed like they actually had enough registers open for the level of customers shopping today.\n\nThe shelves looked properly stocked though the clothing sections needed a good amount of tidying. Produce was clean.
