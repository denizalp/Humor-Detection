This place is horrible! My group of 9 people came here the other day and it was like eating out of a salt shaker. We cut our meal short because it was so bad.  It says a lot when you leave an AYCE spot early with room in your stomach. I went to get a lot of rice to cancel out the saltiness of the meat but even the rice had too much salt.
