Ooooookay.  Here is the deal about buca.  I do enjoy the food but I am very outraged by the prices.  The waiter here has a crush on bradford and I'm straight but brad is a sexy guy.  \n\nSoe we got a couple of beers and an app and three meals for over a hundred clams after tax and tip.  So 1 star is deducted.  \n\nIf you go there get the chicken saltimbocca.  Sheer delight!
