#SHOXS #YELPTO\n\nProbably the grungiest eatery in this area, and the cheapest. There's a decent selection of cocktails and beers. And decent bar fare. Oh, and don't let the outside fool you - it's actually pretty spacious. \n\nThe guy had 5 beers and a shot of tequila. I had a margarita. Can't even remember how it was because this was one of the worst dates I've been on. And I paid for all of it.\n\nI'd like to go back and experience the place sometime.
