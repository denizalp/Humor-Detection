Black Bear Diner is SOOOOOO good. If you like BIG portions for a good price this is the place. The breakfast is off the chart! I always order The Grizz....Pancakes are amazing, made with like a sweet cream or something. The club sandwich is delicious also. You CANNOT go wrong by eating here. The servers are also very nice. You can tell there are some regular patrons and there is a friendly family atmosphere. I'm sure kids will love all the little teddy bears decorating the place inside. Seems like hundreds lol! Great food, great place
