I LOVE Dr. Trisha! She is soo caring and knowledgeable, she takes her time to explain what she can and is doing. \nOn my first visit Dr Trisha adjusted my lower back and my pain disappeared by the next day! I've been dealing with lower back pain for years!! \nDr. Trisha... you have magic hands!!\nLove Schleusner Chiropractic... A one stop health and wellness center!!
