Trailer park ($6.25): premium Vienna Beef frankfurter with house-made beer cheese, creamy slaw, fried Spam, watermelon bbq sauce and crunchy fried onions. My dog had a crunchy snap and was pretty good. \n\nThe owner was super nice and cool.\n\n3.5 stars!!\n\nThe Steamie Winnie is kinda yummuylicious!!
