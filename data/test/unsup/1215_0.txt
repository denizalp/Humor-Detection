I get that the coffee here is supposed to be very good and it's pour over, and if you are a coffee purist this is probably the best place for you. \n\nIf, however, you dare to sully your coffee with artificial sweeteners prepare to be schooled on your uninformed palette. \n\nIt's unfortunate because there aren't many options for coffee shops in the strip - places where you can sit and drink your coffee - and this one is practically tyrannical in their serving and preparation of the most basic elixir of life.
