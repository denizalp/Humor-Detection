It's an airport in the city of sin. Obligatory slot machines within along with typical food offerings. Starbucks, Quiznos, a Wolfgang puck to go offers some nice options.\n\nIf you're not flying south west, you have to ride their tram to\/from baggage claim & gates. If you're not first class or precheck allow yourself 90 minutes to get through bag check and security during peak flight times out (6-7am and 9-11pm)
