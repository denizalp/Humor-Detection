There are a lot of combinations of topping and flavors you can come up with. The assortment we had was pleasant and satisfying on these super hot days, however, it didn't stand out from the many other shaved ice spots. There are 3 different portion sizes you  can pick from and they also have milkshake shaved ice in which you can blend  with any syrup or toppings of your liking. The decor was simple and the pricing was average. Service was interesting, but wasn't exemplary.
