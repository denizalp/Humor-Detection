Service was awful. Food was ok but for the price... You can definitely find better. Warning!!! Do not let the server suggest what to order... He will pick the most expensive dishes on the menu and will fail to tell you how much it is.. They should definitely warn you that your dinner for two will cost u nearly $1000.00!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! THESE PEOPLE ARE STRAIGHT UP CROOKS!!!!
