Have had brunch here twice now. Started with the avocado toast, then the baked eggs. Amazing food. My only complaint is the coffee. You can't have a straight up from the pot coffee, you have to have an americano, which unfortunately comes piss warm, then close to cold once you add the cream. A 2nd cup is a whole other order. Kind of a pain in the ass. Just brew a pot. But my husband and I both loved the food, decor and the service.
