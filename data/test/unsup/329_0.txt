Small ramen bar WAY off the strip, it was about a $20 taxi ride from our hotel\n\nThey have some bar seating and some tables but if you're coming with a large group id advise coming at an off lunch hour \n---agedashi tofu: not bad\n---kimchi: nice side dish\n---tonkatsu ramen made spicy and with thick noodles: you can choose your noodles, good spice to the broth and yummy pork belly \n\nNOTE: $5 minimum credit charges
