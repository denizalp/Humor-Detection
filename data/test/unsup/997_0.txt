I'm fresh of a night of costumed fun at their annual #screamwhistle event, and I think it's high time I show Steam Whistle some Yelpy love! \n\nThe roundhouse venue is a stunner, and their tours and event programming are both worth checking out. It's a perfect place to grab a drink before a game or doing something touristy with friends from out of town, or hell, friends from in town. \n\nToronto is awesome, and sometimes we Torontonians steer clear of areas like this, but we really shouldn't. Vintage trains, beers, aquariums. Good things are happening here.
