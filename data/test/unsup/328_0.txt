Maybe it's just me and I like almost every brunch place. Eggspectation has met my expectation. Not overly great, but a decent brunch place. \n\nA huge selection of eggs (really?) menu. What to eat here? Typical brunch place - sausages, eggs, fruits etc. I can't have enough bacons. \n\nMy complaint is the waiting time if you're a group of three or more. Come here on a Saturday at 11am.... you'll be seated at 1130. Location is great at the heart of downtown Toronto. Eat before you shop at the Eaton Centre.
