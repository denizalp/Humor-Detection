I absolutely love this place!\n\nThe atmosphere is welcoming, laid back, and still very attentive. If you want some great food and for a reasonable price, come here. It's not what you expect when you think \"bar food.\" Jake, one of the bartenders, especially goes above and beyond for customers. \n\nBeen coming here for awhile on a regular basis, won't stop. Always something new happening here( great live music, food specials). This place gives me a lot of what I like. Thanks 7777.
