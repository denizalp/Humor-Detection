This is a rather unique facility housed adjoining Hough's.  It is one of a small number of breweries for which patrons can rent time to brew their own recipes or to brew suggested recipes. This involves some lessons in the beer brewing process and ingredients and bottling.  The output of the process is taken home to enjoy.  Quite an interesting concept.  The facility is beautiful with large windows for viewing from the bar and others for viewing from Greenfield Avenue.
