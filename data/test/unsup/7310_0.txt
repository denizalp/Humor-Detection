Hot stone massage when you purchase a pedicure service! There are a lot of extras for the low priced pedicures. We decided to try this salon because we lived around the corner. For under $25, your pedicure includes the massage chair, foot spa soak, hot towels, hot stone massage and of course, your nails painted. They also have a drying area for your feet. Most places just have that drying service for nails. Because they found out I was a teacher, they gave me a coupon if I paid for my next trip with cash. Serendipity!
