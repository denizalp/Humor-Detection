This and the Wynn are my husbands favorite hotels.\nThey are simply gorgeous in design, immaculate in service, decor, even the air smells expensive.\nYou will find minimal riff raff here, but isn't that part of the Vegas charm?\nNo, well then stay here for a luxurious pampering, great shopping, fine dining.\nIf not, leave your 100 oz plastic cup outside and have a glimpse of what you could be doing instead of puking margarita slushies in the bushes out front.
