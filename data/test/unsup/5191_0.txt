Love the history museum at the top and the interactive tour of how the incline operates. It was great to see that they had a POW memorial in addition to the famous Mt. Washington statues. Provides a beautiful view of the city, especially at night time. There's about 4 fancy restaurants at the top but other than that, not much else to do touristy-wise. Side note- there's no bathrooms anywhere near so make sure to keep that in mind. Definitely recommend for any first time visitors!
