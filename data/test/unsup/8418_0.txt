We went to get a bowl of bun bo hue on our weekend in Vegas. On Saturday, they posted a sign saying that they ran out of food. On Sunday, after a 30 minute wait, we were seated only to find that they didn't have the bun bo hue available. The venue lacked air condition and we had a fly that pestered our table. Our server dropped off the food and then never made it back to our table... I normally don't leave reviews but this experience warranted a review.
