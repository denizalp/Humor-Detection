Bigger store then I thought with endless selections from hats, t shirts, sweaters, flags, skates, children t shirts and more. But today I came for Chance ($50) they had them behind the counter, long line but it moved fast. I'll definitely be back for some shirts, they have a better selection then the armory at T Mobile (my opinion)
