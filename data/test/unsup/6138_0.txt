when you're in vegas for ces and you run into a lot of your colleagues, one of the first questions people ask is \"where are you staying\"? it's sorta like asking people where you went to college in your early twenties. \n\nwithout fail, everyone giggled or asked, no really, where are you staying. that reaction pretty much sums up my experience at the excalibur. \n\none good thing about the older hotels is that you can open the windows in some of the rooms. fresh air in a hotel is as rare as a snowman in vegas.
