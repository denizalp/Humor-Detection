Honesty, this is probably one of the best, if not the best fish and chips place in Mississauga. I would recommend getting their special haddock and chips. \n\nAnd if you want something lighter, try the grilled salmon with wild rice. Absolutely divine! \n\nOverall, it's a must try if you like fish. Bon Appetit!
