I think this is one of the best quality sushi around Vegas without paying STRIP prices. Happened to come on a night they served Big Eye Tuna sashimi and it was melt in your mouth GOOD.\n\nThe roppongo roll is always a favorite of mine but I try to stick to the nigiri and sashimi since the quality of the fish is so good.\n\nCome early since the place is small and becomes packed easily.
