My office is close, so I stop in about once a month. The number 1 item bringing me in is the macaroons. Heavenly macaroons. I've traveled all over NYC, and still haven't found ones that compare to Essence Bakery's version- so fresh, light, and melt-in-the-mouth delicious. \n\nFlavors are seasonal, and a variety are available daily: Pumpkin, Salted caramel, blood orange, mango, pistachio, etc.\n\nFor lunch- I typically order whatever is on special, and have always had a wonderful lunch. I order out, but sometimes I eat in. \n\nBring some macaroons back for your co-workers- they will thank you\/and love  you!
