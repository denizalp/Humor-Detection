Pros :\n\nLarge portion of combined gyro beef and chicken \nNice tasting rice \nWhite sauce is tasty\n\nCons:\n\n$17\nExtra for hummus\nExtra for falafel\nThe beef had a weird smoky aftertaste\nThe staff might be under instructions to sell up \n( I thought I said chicken gyro sandwich and got the combo platter)\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nNot the best shwarma in Toronto or even in this section of the city. Try Mzaar just up Yonge or Paramount at a comparable price point.
