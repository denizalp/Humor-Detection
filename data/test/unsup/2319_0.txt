I usually don't like Filipino food unless it's breakfast and this place hits the spot with their TapSiLog. That's marinated beef, fried rice (even better when it's garlic fried rice!) and egg.\n\nI also like that their \"boba\" isn't really boba but more of it's Filipino counterpart: sago. \n\nI'd definitely be back if I'm ever in the area :)
