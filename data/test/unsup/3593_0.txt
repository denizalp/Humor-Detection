This is an excellent salon who will guarantee that you leave with fabulous hair that you love. Gary did a phenomenal job with my balayage. You can show him a picture of what you like and he will match it very well. Sometimes I don't know the right words to use when describing my preferred hair color but Gary can figure it out by asking the right questions. The entire service from start to finish is very thorough and they don't squeeze in other appointments during your visit. I highly recommended Gary at Salon Tru!
