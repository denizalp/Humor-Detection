This was a great place!  The staff couldn't have been nicer!  They gave us a nice table, kind of out of the way, but with a view of all the festivities in the Piazza San Marco.  We only had happy hour drinks and appetizers, but  they were wonderful and very affordable, especially compared with the restaurant just across from them!  We will be back and I highly recommend it to anyone!
