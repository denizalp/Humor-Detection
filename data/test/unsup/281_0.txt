Returned for second try about a week ago.  Food was much improved   We prdered pho, Fried rice, veggie burgers and something else which I can't remember.  It was all very good we got a huge piece of cake for dessert and split it between two of us.  I will go back if I'm in the area.  I don't know if the menu is the same but for some reason the food was better maybe it was a different cook?
