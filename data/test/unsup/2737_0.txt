The Tempe Marketplace Harkins is one of my favorites to see a movie because they always have a large selection of films to choose from with lots of times available. Soda and concessions are also varied and who can't resist movie theater popcorn? Service has always been great here. The only slight negative is that it can be hard to find parking close to the theater when it's busy but overall it's a great spot to watch current movies.
