Solid, simple food done right.  Perfect for a quick snack if you're on the Strip snaking your way through the casinos.\n\nThey also offer menus for the choice or chance diner (vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, allergic to shellfish). Very cool especially considering poker players today.\n\nStarters are the best bet.  The crispy cauliflower  with its creamy roasted garlic and smoked paprika aioli and the smoked wahoo fish dip and lavosh crackers are outstanding.\n\nPrices are typical of a Vegas resort.\n\nNote:  The hours of operation are short.  This is strictly a lunch place (breakfast if you're a poker player).
