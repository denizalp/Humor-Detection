Decided to try this location since it was remodeled from a Savon to a Smith's.  The store is really large and very clean.  I was very unimpressed with the staff.  On the floor i asked for help locating an item and that seemed to bother the guy stocking.  The two people working in the meat section were deep in a conversation with each other ignoring customers and the two cashiers seemed more interested in flirting with the cute guy that stopped in to say hi, than customers.  I will try another time but for now 2 stars it is.
