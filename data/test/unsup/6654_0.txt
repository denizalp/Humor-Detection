I just love Rose Theatre Brampton!\n\n- Complimentary Underground Parking on Show Nights - Ton of parking spaces!\n\n- Complimentary Coat Check\n\n- Never a line to use the washroom facilities\n\n-Small and Intimate seating means you never too far away from the stage (I did have a good view of all the actions...)\n\n- Classy but casual as there is no dress code\n\n- Professional but friendly staff\n\n- Great Location for commuting as it is just off the Highway and right across from the bus terminal!\n\nAnd of course the show: Full Monty is great! Thanks Yelp GTA for the complimentary tickets!
