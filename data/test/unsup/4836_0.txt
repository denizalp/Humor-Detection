02.06.10\n\n5 stars with 104 reviews?  I had to try this.\n\nThink Naia + Bi-Rite, and you get Sweet Republic.  Gelato, sorbet, and ice cream!\n\nI was a bit disappointed in the rest of the flavors, but the blood orange mimosa [http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/7mGZrCzGGjS95SdRtEaGcQ?select=brB0R88F2xsLZZ646u4AEA] was pretty refreshing.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't have such high expectations going in.
