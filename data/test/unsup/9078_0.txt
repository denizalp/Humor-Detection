AVOID. \n\nWent there on a Livingsocial coupon and won't be going back. The food was far below average. The service was ok, but by no means great. The waitress seemed new and not very used to the job. The place was virtually empty (3 tables total) and she seemed overwhelmed. The menu is definitely uninspiring. If you have a diner, you should at least be able to be somewhat original with the food choices. \n\nDefinitely never again.
