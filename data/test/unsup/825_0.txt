Holy nautical theme!  \nI've always been afraid of this place 1. because it's on west sixth and 2. because I hate nautical anything.\nSurprisingly I really enjoyed the nautical theme.  Gave it a different kind of atmosphere than the traditional downtown bar.  I also thought the atmosphere was very laid back and chill.  \nHaven't tried the food yet, but if you want to meet up with some friends in the downtown area and don't feel the need to dress like trash, then try it out.
