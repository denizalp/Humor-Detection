Keep it simple and you'll be impressed. Go with the Classics or the Kobe with potato chips and beer and the sweet potato fries. Unless you're trying to impress someone. Then ask for lots of napkins.\n\nMy burger was cooked perfectly and the beer was fresh and cold. Can't ask for more.\n\nService, well, I guess it depends on the mood of your server. I visited this place when I was attending a conference in June this year.
