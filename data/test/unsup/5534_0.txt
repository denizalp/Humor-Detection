Not a bad hotel. The first hotel I ever stayed at in Vegas being legal. It's pretty cool that this hotel is walking distance to other hotels like luxor, MGM and mandalay bay. It's near the M&M, Coca Cola stores and Arcade. Fun stuff for the kids.\nThe buffet at this hotel is average. I love how they have little fast food and chinese togo restaurants upstairs. I love the spicy mc chicken sandwich at McDonalds. Too bad they don't have those here in San Jose.\n\nThey have an arcade on their Lower level.
