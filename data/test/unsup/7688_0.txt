Breezy is awesome! She did my hair for almost a year. She's very sweet and reasonable in her pricing. She did a fabulous job with my extensions, cut and color. Also, she is extremely fair in what she charges for the Great Lengths extensions. Most of the high end casino salons charge double for the same service. I recommend her to anyone that needs a kind, honest and talented hair stylist.
