It's a new poke place in front of Hard Rock Cafe next to Checkers. I had the poke bowl and it was really different from other poke craze happening in town. They have ingredients like mango, tangerine orange, asparagus. Strangely these ingredients works really well together.  \nThey also have fish grill, I didn't order this time but for sure I will try it next time I come, it's good for people who can eat raw fish.\nThe hand crafted ice tea was really cool, they give you the mason jar to take home.
