Been coming here for a while. It's okay depending on whom serves you. If you get the waitress that served us forget about it. I am not one to give bad reviews but this was horrible. This waitress literally lied and avoided us because of her mistakes. Drives me crazy when people act like this in a service business. Anyway I would not recommend anyone here if you get this waitress. I'm not going back ever in the chance I end up with her.
