I had the opportunity to make a 2nd trip to Jade Grille for lunch.  Once again I ordered off of the Chinese menu and both of the dishes we got were excellent.  So I think the first time I visited I must have just ordered items that were perhaps too unfamiliar.  I'm loving the new \"real\" Chinese restaurants that are opening in Pittsburgh.  Its a great change of pace from Americanized Chinese.
