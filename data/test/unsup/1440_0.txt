I forgot to mention that China Max was giving out free samples during our Ross Park Mall ordeal, and in sampling their food, I found that they make a sesame chicken that is as tender and sweet as a grandmother's hug. We didn't want to fill up too much since we were waiting 2.5 hours for a seat at Cheesecake Factory and opted for a snack at  the sub-par Oh Oh Burrito instead to tide us over.\n\nThus ends this Public Service Announcement. Hating on Ross Park Mall will resume.
