Rhonda is amazing! she was extremely helpful and personal through and through. I rented a breast pump from this location until I received one from wic. she really worked with me in regards to my rental period. \n\nI'm not sure who helped me when I went to return it but she could definitely take a page from Rhonda's book on how to talk to people - especially a new sleep deprived mom! nonetheless Rhonda's customer service gives his facility 5 stars all the way!!!
