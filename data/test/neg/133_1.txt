Just had a second meal here.. .maybe the best Huevos Rancheros I've ever had. Wow, were they terrific! My second time to have Sonya as a server, she is excellent. I was glad to see it was packed this morning. Very nice ambience as well. This will be a staple when I am in Vegas, I look forward to trying more!
