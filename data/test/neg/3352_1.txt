I enjoyed dinner here earlier this week and was blown away!  When we walked in we were greeted with a smile. The decor and ambiance were spectacular!  \nFor our meal we shared a variety of items including the mac n cheese, onion straws and the 16 ounce NY Strip...So delicious!!  Great service, all of our needs were anticipated. I cannot wait to go back!
