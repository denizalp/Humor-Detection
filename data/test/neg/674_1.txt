Our waitress was pretty awesome. We went on Monday to watch football and eat wings. Pretty empty which is good but the tv kept cutting off and on. So missed a lot of the game.  This location has improved a lot. I stop going to this location because of bad service. Very bad service. I would give this location another try just because it seems like it has improved a lot.
