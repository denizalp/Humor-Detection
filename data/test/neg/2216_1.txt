I rent cars a lot from sky harbor. I like Alamo. They don't debit more than the rental charge from my credit card. The cars are nice. The lines are usually long but I see that often everywhere. The automatic self serve kiosk is pretty slick. It took me about 3 minutes to process my rental. I wish other companies had that. When I dropped it off I was handed my receipt and went to the airport. Can't get any easier than that
