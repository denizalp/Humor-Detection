We stopped by on a Sunday evening for dinner. The ambience is nice. They have some very comfortable booths. The service we experienced was average. It was good, but not exceptional.\n\nWe ordered the steak sandwich and the lobster roll. Both were very delicious, but you definitely pay for that deliciousness.\n\nIf you decide to give Blind Pig a try you probably won't regret it.
