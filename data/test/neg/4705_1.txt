LOVE this place! Been going here for years! Highly recommend! Nancy, Susan & Kenny all do a great job. Everything is new now and really feels like a spa. Place is clean, quiet and the waterwall is a nice feature. All the techs I've had are very polite and courteous. Love the orange slices in the pedi water! I've never had a bad experience here and I'm here about every 6 weeks for the last 6 years. I would highly recommend this place! You won't be disappointed!
