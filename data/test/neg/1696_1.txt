The first time Junior cut my hair he listened to what I wanted and when he was done it was perfect. Even better than I expected. When I called the old shop he was at and was told he was no longer there I might have panic'd a little. Well only for a minute, I checked the trusty interwebs and found him at his new shop. He is always professional and polite, there is no pretentious vibe here, just good old fashioned barber shop. Check it out, I did and am a customer for life.
