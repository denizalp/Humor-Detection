I know the family, they're cool as ice! They're very welcoming, great food, always leave satisfied, very clean, and reasonably priced! Great for a party of 2, or 22, they accommodate always and never have an attitude problem with a request. Every waiter helps out if your water is empty, its filled promptly, as well as other drinks.
