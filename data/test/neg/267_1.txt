After reading some of these reviews I was really hesitant to see this show. Good thing my boyfriend got the last word and I didn't miss out on this amazing upbeat and funny show! I don't know if they are the real jabbawockeez but they are talented and I would totally recommend this show to anyone to enjoys music, dancing, and laughing!
