Great place!  All four of us went and everyone loved their burgers.  Three of us had the McNalrly burger which reminds you of the old Bobs Big Boy but much better. Thank goodness I got the small size but it was interesting to watch my brother in law eat the full double burger.   One had the chilli burger which was great as well.  The fries are great as well as the sweet potatoe tots. I'm didn't care for the onion rings but everyone else did.  We came from Glendale and will most definitely be back!
