My friend is vegetarian so I've been here a few times. I'm not crazy about their regular menu such as the burger, the falafel, the pita and whatever. But I came in to eat again with that same friend and they had...yes! ratatouille! And i LOVE ratatouille. I decided to order it and it was really delicious. Service is in general ok. Food is just ok. Hit or miss sometimes. If I find out they are making ratatouille again, I will definitely stop by and eat it.
