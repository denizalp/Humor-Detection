We ate dinner at Bink's Midtown last night and had the pleasure of utilizing the services of Go Green Valet.  They were fast and efficient as well as friendly and professional.  While I don't remember the name of the gentleman who parked the car for us, Zac picked it up as we were ready to leave, and he was absolutely outstanding.  I am always happy to use Go Green!
