Im disgusted by the reviews here and now I see why . I'm not even a resident here and I see exactly the problem. I went into the office for leasing info and waited over half an hour to hear the girls in the back gossip about their personal lives . There was two other people waiting that haven't been helped yet either ! I can't believe I even wanted to see this place . I got up and left because never have a seen a property be so disrespectful.
