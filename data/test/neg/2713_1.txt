The music and the outfits were the most memorable part of the show for me.  I am glad I got to experience it and though it was clever the way they used the calendar months in the show, but don't think we will be doing an encore anytime soon.  \n\nSome parts were really dragged out but was also glad to see a male performer in the mix.  The ladies are beautiful and the main singer and band are amazing.  I really dig this type of art but just wish it was more memorable.
