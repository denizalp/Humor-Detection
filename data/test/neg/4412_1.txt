This place deserves 3 stars.  The food was fantastic.  I highly recommend the blackened miso cod, beef tataki, and the bento green tea dessert.  However for an upscale restaurant, the service was very unsatisfiying and snobby.  Our waiter was very rude to begin with when we were ordering our dinner.  He did not take the time to explain the dishes we asked about.  Not only that he forgot our sashimi dinner, so we ended up waiting at our table an extra 20 minutes for that to arrive.
