The rice was dry, the chips were cold, the tacos and cheese enchilada were sub-par.  My son and I went there last night and both of us got food poisoning.  He ordered the beef tacos with rice and beans and I got the beef taco with cheese enchilada & rice and beans.  This morning it started - the elimination process of FOOD POISONING.  Went on recommendations even though a few said they got food poisoning - never again.,
