Have been using A Secret Garden for at least the last 15 years.  The flowers and designs are simply amazing...beautiful...unique...and very affordable.  I had to write this review after receiving an enormous sunflower bouquet yesterday from my husband for our anniversary.  Sunflowers are my favorite and this huge bouquet has 12 of them with beautiful greenery, eucalyptus and green branches all in a simple glass vase.  I cannot stress enough how pleased we have always been with the arrangements from A Secret Garden!
