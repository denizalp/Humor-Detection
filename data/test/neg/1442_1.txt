Super bad. I ordered a pita salad and the lettuce that he put into the salad was clearly wilted and going bad. It was pretty much bright orange in color. The chicken was completely uncooked and rubbery, I had to stop eating to avoid getting sick. Also I was the only customer so I'm thinking the employee didn't really know how to cook.. at all. Wish I could get my money back.
