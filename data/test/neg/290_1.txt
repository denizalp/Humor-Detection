Great place!  Everything we had was delicious, very good classic & creative Italian dishes & unique appetizers. Meal finishes off with a complimentary lemoncello!  It is a little pricey, but worth every penny. Can't wait to go back. Keep your eyes open though, it is a little difficult to find from the main road.
