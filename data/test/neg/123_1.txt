The food here is amazing. I recommend that you share your food with whom you are having dinner with so everyone can sample all of their great food! Their tako (octopus) taco's are good, and I usually don't like seafood. You will want to eat it quickly though while it is still hot or it gets chewy if you let it cool off too much.
