This is, by far, my favorite place in Toronto for lunch\/brunch. I've never had a bad experience and the staff is incredibly nice. The locally sourced food always tastes fresh and makes me want to order a second round. You must get the herbed poached eggs! The atmosphere is funky, warm, and inviting. Be warned though for weekend brunch it can be a bit of a wait but it is soooo worth it!
