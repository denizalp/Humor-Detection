I was in here the other day and got the Philly cheese steak which was really good, but it took FOREVER to get the sandwich. We only had one couple in front of us who ordered 2 sandwiches and it took almost 20 minutes for us to get our sandwiches in our hands. Pretty disappointing to say the least. I am normally a big fan of Subway and can handle waiting a bit for a sandwich but that was just ridicules. The sandwich was good so 3 stars.
