Went for lunch on our last day on Charlotte. The parking lot was jam packed, but we were able to find street packing near by. We were surprised that the restaurant was empty, so I guess everyone was going to the place next door. Service was prompt and the waitress was friendly. We had some soft pretzels, a pulled pork sandwich and a beef brisket. Everything was good, but nothing out of this world. For lunch it was nice, but nothing special.
