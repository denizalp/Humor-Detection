I brought my Rottweiler to get his shots UTD about a month ago. Standard vet meeting but the reason for my 5 stars is because this vet is a genuine animal lover and gave me some advice on dealing with my aggressive alpha male not neutered dog. But the biggest reason for the 5 stars is the price. Reasonable and like 50% difference from others places I've gone to.
