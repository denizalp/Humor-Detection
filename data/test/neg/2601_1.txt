Love love love this place. They make fresh croissants & quiche. Made to order sandwiches. I started with a chocolate croissant. It was so delicious.  I had the pesto eggplant sandwich. It was perfectly cooked, all the ingredients and spices  were blended to perfection and the best ever. My husband had the prosciutto sandwich and was very impressed. Try the Americano coffee. Will definitely return. Olivier was very welcoming.
