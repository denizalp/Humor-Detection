It was my first time visiting this place and I gotta say I was quite impressed. The quality of the food is great and the latte was A+. I ate a chipotle chicken grilled sandwich which came with a small side salad. I ordered a caramel latte with coconut milk as I cannot consume dairy. It was so smooth and rich in flavor but not heavy on the stomach. The staff is very attentive and have a great attitude which makes the environment even more welcoming. I will definitely be back !
