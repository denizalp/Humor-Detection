We are officially regulars:) moved into the area bout 3 months ago and kinda shopped around for our neighborhood bar. Brads place is definitely our favorite. The bartenders are all fantastic, food is super good which most of the time is cooked by the owner himself so you know he's gonna actually care about what he's putting on your plate! Brad the owner is also very friendly and makes you feel super welcome, like an old friend. It's not the fanciest place but I wouldn't really call it a dive just chill and a great place to unwind.
