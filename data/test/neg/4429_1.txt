This place has a great atmosphere and food with exceptional service!! The manager Scott was friendly and welcoming, but our waitress Lexi was what truly made the experience stand out! She went out of her way to serve us even when we were no in her section, making us want to move to her area. It was a decision we did not regret! She was exceptionally attentive and hustled every second. By far the best waitress I have ever had.
