Finally under an hr for my oil change and tire rotation with an appointment! Much better then the usual 2 hr plus wait. Problem is I have to come here for my warranty, so happy they got it done at normal timely manner and on a Monday! \nMuch better than usual maybe they are getting the service department together, fingers crossed
