I was having major hardware issues with my iPhone 6 Plus just shortly after my manufacturers warranty had run out and Lexi from the Genius Bar and the manager Amy I spoke with were able to help me out and get me a new replacement phone after having had a rough start to a Monday morning. It's customer service like that, that will keep me as a loyal Apple customer for life. Thank you Lexi and Amy for getting me out of a bind and putting the customer first.
