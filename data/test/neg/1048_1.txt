Also, called \"Ed's Shoe Repair\" on Charleston, East of Rainbow on the corner of Antelope, in a small strip mall.. this hidden gem \"Ed's Shoe Repair\" is the best shoe repair since Cactus' original owner Matt sold his business. Ed is a very nice guy and he does excellent work! We are very happy finding this new business :)
