I like this location as there is access from the subway directly.  \n\nThis locations is a hit or miss.  I make a stop when I make a visit to the gym.  They do have unique items.  The home section and footwear section are smaller than most locations.   Go to HOMESENSE instead.  \n\nThe lines always move quickly and I love the shelves with different fun things to buy.  It always get me.
