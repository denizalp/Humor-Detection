The only bad thing about this place is that I can't afford to go every single day! EVERYTHING on their menu is soooooo good!  Was so good we went back 2 nights in a row. I tried my first fried pickles here and must say at first I was kind of like I don't know about this but as soon as I tried one I was like, best idea ever to order this item.
