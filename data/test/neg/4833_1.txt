This review is for the MLIFE department. I just called and spoke with your representative Angela, who was very rude and had a smirk attitude. She was reluctant to give me her name and refused to give out her last name; quote \"Well I'm the only Angela here\". I will be writing a negative review on yelp and only suggest you talk to your employees about having great customer service- not sub-par or mediocre. I am very disappointed and dissatisfied with mlife. I will not be giving out recommendations for your company.
