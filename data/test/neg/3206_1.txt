Loved our meal here! We started with the mussels and the famed brie pesto fries, and we probably could have just kept going on those and been so happy. They were delicious! For dinner we had a mushroom spinach crepe, the burger, a salad with shrimp and the sausage baguette pizza. All were fantastic and our table was filled with comments like \"Next time I am getting that!\" and \"I can't stop eating these fries!\". Our waitress was great and prices were fair. We would definitely recommend and return.
