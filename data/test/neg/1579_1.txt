Came here while visiting Las Vegas for a fill and polish change.  Got the pink chrome nail polish.   Loved the super friendly staff.  They take appointments and walk ins.  We were able to be seen right away even though it was a Friday.   My daughter asked for an ombre chrome design and they were more than happy to come together and figure out exactly what she wanted.
