I stayed here for 5 nights for a work conference. I really like that this hotel has many options for food and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The only thing I hated was all the smoke in the lobby area\/casino. It's not very touristy, most of the people that come to the casino are locals so it's not too crazy which is good! The group rate we received was very great and I def would recommend this hotel.
