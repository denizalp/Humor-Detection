I have been going to Kenna for years.  She has done color and haircuts for me.  Lauren has styled my hair before for a formal event.  Both owners are amazing hairstylists.  The salon is so cute and comfortable and the stylists are so friendly and professional! You couldn't ask for a better experience!
