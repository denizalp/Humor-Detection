Marcos at O'Reilly auto parts was so amazing and helps me get a new bulb for the car right as they were closing and totally took all the time to install it and it wouldn't even let me tip him. I usually use AutoZone but this is going to be my new favorite auto parts store unless I'm having a 24 hour emergency and I'm not case I have to go to a 24 hour AutoZone. And in that case it would be the one on Decatur for sure.
