I love the crafting supplies at Michaels. Is it just me or when you go down the aisles, isn't it almost impossible to not want to just grab a little of EVERYTHING to make all sorts of little crafty projects!?! I love this place. As such a wonderful added bonus, Michaels always has coupons online. So while I was waiting in line, I went online on my phone and pulled up the coupon. The cashier scanned the barcode on my phone and instantly, 50% off 1 full priced item. I saved $12.50 yaaaay.
