3.5 stars We ordered 9 courses and enjoyed them all. The shortrib was amazing as was the souffl√©. Best polenta we ever tasted. The rest were good but not perfection. We thought the atmosphere was lacking for the price. Also the website said jacket suggested and there were people in shorts at 9:00pm on a Saturday night.
