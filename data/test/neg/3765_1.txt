Had my wife grab some coils for my tank; completely gouged her on the price and shorted one in the box. I called and expressed my concern and the employee couldn't care less. I've avoided this place in the past because of lack of newer gear and limited juice variety, because this seals the deal. There are plenty of other reputable vape shops in the area, so avoid this place unless you are desperate.
