Some of the best Mexican food and drinks I've had in Charlotte thus far. Their tacos are amazing and full of flavor. I had their beer battered tofu tacos. They were absolutely amazing! I'm currently salivating just thinking of them. The side of black beans and rice were delicious! \n\nDrinks were fantastic: strong but sweet. Service was great, and atmosphere was fun and casual. I can't wait to go back over and over and over!
