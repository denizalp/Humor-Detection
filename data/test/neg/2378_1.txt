Once is enough for me.  Crappy tacos, beans were awful.. Scottsdale wont put up with this kind of service and food.  Portions are very small, prices are high and the food is barely edible. Matgaritas are so so.  I asked for Don Julio, I ddnt get it I say the bartender pour something else.  Thats really bad.  CALL IN GORDON RAMSEY OR ROBERY IRVINE maybe they can help, maybe not.  This place will be gone by Dec 31.
