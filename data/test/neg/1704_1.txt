Took my boyfriend here for an anniversary dinner and had a great experience. We ordered the Nashville fried chicken, corn bread, steak, and scotch egg. We shared everything and were very full - definitely didn't need the corn bread. The Nashville fried chicken wasn't as hot as we thought it would be, but it was still very tasty. Ordered the steak medium rare and it was really good. Enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks. We'll be back.
