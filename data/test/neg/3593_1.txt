I stayed here for two nights during labor day weekend. The King room was roomy, comfortable and clean. Breakfast was good, for a free hotel breakfast: eggs, sausage, biscuits n gravy, pancake maker, fruit, cereal, etc. Parking was convenient, and they have free wifi.  Great value for the price.\n\nThe only negative was the loud a\/c unit. It was noticeable,  but not a huge disturbance.
