This place is right up my alley,  from the atmosphere,  the fresh ingredients that are in every dish, to the selection of adult beverages.  \n\nThe pork belly bites are fantastic and the kimchi is perhaps the best I've had.\n If you have a chance to hit this joint, don't pass up the opportunity. Even if it's just for a glass of merlot, the setting is quite tranquil.
