Song Chareunsap the owner\/technician came out quickly, looked at my washing machine that wasnt draining. Pulled out a needle stuck in the drain pump. Put it back together all in less than a half hour.  Price was very reasonable.  Anyone else would have made me buy a new pump. Great job! So glad to have found this service on YELP.  Keeping this card on my refrigerator!  Located on NW side of town.
