Pleasant spot. Slightly above average brunch but a good atmosphere. The service was very slow. It took about 15 minutes to get our coffees which were cold and the food about 40 minutes. We came at 1:00 PM on a Saturday so busy... but not too bustling. \n\nI don't think I will come back. There are definitely more interesting and good service brunch spots that Toronto has to offer.
