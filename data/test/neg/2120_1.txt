Fabulous service!!!  Even though they were short staffed on a busy Saturday, they were amazing. My little one was very nervous to get her ears pierced and Ashley was so sweet and put her at ease. Thank you so so much!!!  Everything is very sanitary and prices were great. We will be back to buy lots and lots of new earrings next month! \nThank you Ashley!!
