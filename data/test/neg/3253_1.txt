Ok...update time... \n\nThe pho here has gone noticeably downhill (so have the noodles) my last several visits. My previous review stuck up for them, but I can't do it anymore. The broth has gone from a nice authentic flavor to a watered down mess. Even their signature fat fresh noodles are not as silky smooth as they once were. \n\nThe Gerrard location has a much better, more consistent output for pho. Luckily, the other menu items, like the banh cuon, are still a-ok.
