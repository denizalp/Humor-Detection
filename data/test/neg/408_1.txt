First time in a \"liquid or fresh planet\" facility. They gave us time patiently to figure out what we wanted off the menu. I got the Neptune salad and a Men's Only smoothie and Balsamic Basil vinigrette, everything was very tasty. They have a points program, spend so much and get $5 off. The wife and daughter got wraps, wife got the Clevelander and daughter got a chicken wrap. Both wife and daughter also got the chicken paprikash , could've used some healthy seasonings. Over all a very good healthy alternative to eating out.
