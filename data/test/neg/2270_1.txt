I can't say enough good things about this place! Excellant food and service. I went in with major dietary restrictions (no dairy, gluten, legumes, sugar,or grains) and they were able to give me an incredibly delicious and flavorful meal.  I frequently travel to Verona for business and this is my new go to place. You must go!
