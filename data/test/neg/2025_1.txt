When in Charlotte for work, a few colleagues and I decided to continue our nights of dinner sushi at Baku.  I am so glad that we did! \n\nWe ordered a bunch of sushi, apps\/tapas and one of the dinners and just shared everything.  Absolutely everything was awesome and that includes the service as well. \n\nEverything about our experience here was phenomenal - if I'm ever in Charlotte again , I will indeed be back.
