Stopped for lunch on our way to visit the Clark County Museum and the Hoover Dam.  Read the reviews and decided to try it out.  I had wanted the Dos Fish Taco, but they were out and recommend substituting shrimp.  My husband had the shrimp burrito. Both meals were outstanding and seasoned perfectly. I loved the salsa bar, especially the creamy avocado. Everything was very fresh.  The grilled onions and peppers in my tacos were slightly blackened and added some perfect smoky flavor.   So glad we found this great little place.
