I was afraid this place would be a fad, but I was so wrong. This place by far exceeded my expectations and the food was phenomenal. The micheladas were huge and the prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you get. Not just quantity, but quality as well. \n\nThis is a new  favorite for my Vegas visits going forward. Place is small, but the staff is very efficient and pleasant so you're just sitting around waiting for someone's attention.\n\nThis place rocked.
