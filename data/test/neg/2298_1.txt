Pleasantly surprised after reading the bad reviews. Arrived at 7AM were seated and served coffee by 7:05 AM. Wait staff was polite and attentive. We did not order right away and did not feel pressured to do so. Once ordered, the food arrived shortly there after and was decent. The price was a little more that I expected.\nMy friend had biscuits and gravy, I had two eggs with diced potatoes and pancakes.\nOverall, the food was good and the service friendly and prompt. \n\nI would go back.
