This is a great addition to the neighborhood. Choolaah offers a wide variety of quick, Indian options at an affordable price in a fun environment. The tikka masala was great with the available sauces and the chicken was very juicy. The naan was also great with some crisp garlic on it. Choolaah also offers many vegetarian options. To top it off, the owners were interested and engaged with customers to make sure it was a good fit.
