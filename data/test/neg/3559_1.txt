Sun devil auto has always been great, but today was very disappointing. Being that I don't have a second car and work weekdays, it's not the easiest for me to find time for regular car maintenance. They have been very good about working me in in the past, but that was not the case today. They were less then willing to help out and just sent me elsewhere. The only reason they are getting 3 stars in because of past service.
