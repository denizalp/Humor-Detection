Love this place and always hit it up when I am in LV.  I actually leave room in my suitcase for the finds.  UNDFTD fitteds always make me smile and they always have some kix to take home.  The people who work here are great and will BS about old kicks, music, etc.  Dudes hooked me up with free tickets to Tony Hawk's Bday party a few years ago.
