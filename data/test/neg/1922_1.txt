The food quality here is three stars and I would give the staff three to three-and-a-half stars. What brings this down to two stars are the prices. The price you pay for the quality and portion size are not equal. The quality is slightly aboves omething like a Jack Astors but you're going to pay $5-10 more for a smaller portion.\n\nI just wasn't impressed. Maybe I need a second visit seeing all of the four star reviews.
