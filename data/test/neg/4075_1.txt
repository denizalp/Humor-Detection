Wow!! my boyfriend booked a suite for just the two of us! and boy it was soooo divine! from check in, to walking to the elevators, to up the elevators, to the beautiful hallways, and to OUR ROOm!!! The decor is amazing! King size bed! never wanted to leave bed. sofa and a whole diff room. (look online if you want to see how it looks) but it will not diasspoint you! Bathroom is crazy!! you even get your own bath scale!\n\nIt was the best hotel we stayed in thus far! 2nd would be venetian!
