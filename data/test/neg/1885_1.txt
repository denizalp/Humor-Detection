Came here for a yelp event several months ago and now I am going here for work dinners as well :).   Love the food!  It's delicious .  A little pricey but items you can't leave without are shrimp and grits and the best pecan pie I have ever had hands down.  Don't forget the biscuits and honey.  Boom!
