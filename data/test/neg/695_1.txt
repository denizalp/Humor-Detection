I usually go to the Vig on 16th st, so I decided I would try this location.  First off I got here around 5PM on a Friday night so needless to say it was VERY busy!  \nWe just decided to hang out on the back patio and have a few drinks, even the back patio was PACKED!  Great priced wine and delicious food!
