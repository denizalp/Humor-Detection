I'm a new patient with Dr. Seema Sood.  As her business card says, Green Valley Primary Care is a place \"Where You Feel At Home\".  The waiting room is a very home-like and peaceful place.  Dr. Sood's staff made me feel well taken-care-of.  Dr. Sood is personable, careful, and thorough. I called the office a few times with extra requests that were handled efficiently and pleasantly. I'm glad I chose Dr. Sood as my primary care physician.
