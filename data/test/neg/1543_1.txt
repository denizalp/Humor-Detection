It's like 'Cheers' for pets ! We frequent weekly and the staff is friendly and efficient ! One of our favorite severs moved away but they're are so many others ! Food is great .. Although they don't participate in football packages we love it there .. Sorry if no football in Sunday's then we go somewhere else .. They said they don't wavy to be another sports bar. Too bad .. Doggies like football too you know !! It's okay we will pick another day to go ! Love it there ...
