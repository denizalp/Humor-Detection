This place is amazing, small plates of great food to share. A really fun atmosphere and great food. The staff is incredible, the food comes to the table as it is ready, they do a great job of keeping everything straight. They keep the table clear of empty plate and make sure your drinks are always full. All of this at a very reasonable price!! For dessert the chocolate tres leches cake was fantastic.
