For a buffet - 4 stars. Prices have gone up in the last year. It's now $40\/pp. Still good for a buffet. My main focus was the macaroni and cheese bar--so good. Didn't really pick anything that I didn't like, but there's way too much food to try one of everything.\n\nEnjoyed the desserts--mini macarons and gelato bar. But again, more dessert than you could ever want.
