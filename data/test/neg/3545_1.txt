My neighbor wanted to come here for dinner.  I had not been in a long while. We both had the ribs and I must admit, they were very good.  Tender and they fell off the bone. Fries were good.  Our server talked us into the banana cream pie, so we split.  After tasting it, I should have ordered my own.  Oh well.
