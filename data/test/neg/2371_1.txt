OVERPRICED GARBAGE. See Photos on Google reviews. $80.00 RIP OFF!!! Pizza was paper thin with cheese and sauce little else. Chicken parm was burnt and dried out, chicken wings were dry and overcooked and smelled bad, caesar salad was romaine and a few crumbles of croutons. DON'T GET SCREWED BY THESE RIP OFF ARTISTS.
