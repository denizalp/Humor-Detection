What a wonderful little gem I've found! Prices are reasonable and they are so thorough. I had a mani + pedi with paraffin. They take their time even though it was super busy. I had concerns about my nail polish keep chipping as soon as I leave other salons and they made sure to wait between coats to let the polish harden before applying another coat. They never made you feel like you are being picky. Highly recommended.
