This is the best gym ever! The staff is wonderful. I started going here with my 8 year old son because he wanted to learn how to box. Julian is great with my son and makes him excited to return after each visit. I have never felt like I should not be there or do not belong. It's a judgement free environment with people of all shapes and sizes. I would recommend this gym to anyone.
