Wonderful experience on a Friday nite with friends. Special Halibut wrapped in Prosciutto was suburb. Pancetta popcorn app was delight. $75 bottle of amazing Chateauneuf Du Pape, incredible. Fantastic guilded age decor in one of the oldest bank building in Cleveland. Special highlight was 14 y\/o pianist playing Kawai grand full size. Kid is high functioning autistic and amazingly gifted. His wonderful family sits close by to help communicate with him. Truly touching and great experience. Well done!
