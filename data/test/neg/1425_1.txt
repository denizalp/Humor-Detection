The food is absolutely overpriced and the service is awful. I frequent Downtown Summerlin almost daily and not only was my order completely inaccurate, I ended up paying over $30 for a kids meal and a turkey melt. In addition, my daughter came on a separate occasion and ordered 3 of the same exact smoothie and they managed to mess that up. We're done!
