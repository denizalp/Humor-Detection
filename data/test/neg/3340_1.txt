We went back for a second visit and it was just as good as the first.  This no frills place was packed due to the upcoming UofA\/ASU game.  The chicken shawarma plate is quite delish!  I love the lemony tabouleh, creamy hummus and garlic mayo that comes with the dish.  Had tons of leftovers for the next day meal.  Yum.  They use lots of garlic which we both loved and it didn't matter if we kissed later!
