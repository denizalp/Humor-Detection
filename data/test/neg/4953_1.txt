Previously I rated this resort 5-stars.  As an update:  I again rate this Encore 5 stars !!!   \n\nFor whatever reason, this place has it figured out.  They know how to take care of their guests and give them individual attention, which is somewhat surprising considering what a large number of guests they have.   As I have previously stated, I have stayed at all the 4 and 5 star resorts on the Las Vegas strip and Encore beats them all!  \n\nI challenge anyone on yelp to find a better hotel resort in Las Vegas!
