Worst pool service company with poor customer service.  Technician left cover off of heater with wires exposed.  When I called the supervisor he told me that it wasn't an issue and just to lean the cover against it.  I explained I has a 13 month old along with 2 other kids and felt it was a safety issue.  He said he would call back but never did.
