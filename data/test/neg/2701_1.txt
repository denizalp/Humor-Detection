Nice theater! Went during the mid-afternoon on a Sunday to a Cine-Capri showing, which I guess means a bigger screen and fancier curtains, though I don't know if it's worth the difference in price. If I hadn't had a movie pass I probably would've just seen a regular showing. But everything looked clean, the staff was friendly, and the theater's in a nicer area. No complaints.
