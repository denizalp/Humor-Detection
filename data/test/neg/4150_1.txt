OMG! You must try this adorable bar! They serve food (small plates), desserts and most importantly drinks. I looked everywhere for a place for French 75, Jorge was the first one to make it for me on this trip( champagne, gin, lemon juice and sugar).  Very chill place. I also ordered the cronuts with cream and chocolate, the hubby ordered the sliders and I ordered hot chocolate and chocolate covered strawberry to take up to the room. I highly recommend this awesome place!!! We loved Jorge and the ambience of this place.
