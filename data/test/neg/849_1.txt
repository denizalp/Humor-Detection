We just finished supper here and are SO glad we decided to come here! I'm celiac and they have 2 options for gluten free pasta which was a nice surprise. We were both very happy with our choices and cleaned the plate completely lol! We also both had huge bowls of pasta and a bottle of wine and the bill was under $80, very reasonable price for such amazing pasta. Great service and a lovely environment, super neat vibe to it. Highly recommend!!
