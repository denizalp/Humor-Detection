I am new to Arizona and was unsure what company to call when I had an insect problem that I had never encountered outside of this area. I am very happy and satisfied that I choose Invader Pest Management. Bobby was professional, friendly and very knowledgable. He not only took care of the insects I called about but took care of a couple of other unwanted guests along with providing me with helpful information.
