(Warden\/ Steeles) walking in here last week, I realized they slightly changed the layout of this location.  Somewhat close to home, this location is always busy but always efficient in terms of service. \nTheir staff are extremely friendly and always asking how your day was, even if you're not a regular.  I got my usual BLonde RED EYE ;) to keep my day rolling-on!\nThe only nuisance I can see about this location is the parking availability since it shares a plaza along with stores, banks ad grocery store.
