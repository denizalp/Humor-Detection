A bit more pricier than some theaters but probably worth the money. Clean place with a clean and safe mall.  Nice seating. Don't really see the big attraction with the cine capri theater vs the other ones but if bigger screens are for you than knock yourself out.  Save some money and buy tickets at costco.
