The food was mediocre at best. It was not worth the money we paid for it. My husband had the meatloaf and parmesan mashed potatoes and said it was similar to cafeteria food...Hometown Buffet. I ordered a ribeye cooked medium and a loaded baked potato and it was cooked medium\/well (closer to well done). It was tough, overcooked and a poor quality meat for a steakhouse.  I could have gone to Carraba's and got a much better steak.
