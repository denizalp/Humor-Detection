I'm a fan! I wish there is a Meet Fresh in Atlanta. We got the wintermelon tea with taro balls, herbal jelly no. 6 (cold), and almond pudding shaved ice. Everything was refreshing and perfectly sweetened. All the taro balls, tapiocas were all soft and chewy. It was perfection. The almond pudding was so good. \nEnvironment was bright, clean, and modern with a touch of tradition. Mostly small tables with only a few big tables. \nTaiwanese shaved ice is better that Korean shaved ice in my opinion, come try for yourself!
