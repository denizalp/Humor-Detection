Out visit was great. So Yon was a great server and was very attentive. I got the filet med rare which was cooked perfectly. My husbad got the rib eye which was well done. He asked for it to be med rare. The manager came and switched his steak out right away. The crab stuffed mushroom were amazing. Overally this experience was better than I expected.
