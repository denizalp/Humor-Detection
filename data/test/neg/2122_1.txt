The sushi melted in my mouth! The sauces are made from scratch & these were the best lettuce wraps I've ever had anywhere. Alessandra was so sweet, informative & helped me pick out winners in my book. She is someone who truly cares and wants you to enjoy your experience. I'll be back next trip to Vegas
