I am not sure what the food is like but the hostess was rude and condescending.  We showed up at 5:10 on a Monday evening.  We were treated to a lecture about not having reservations; not once but two times by the same person.  If you can seat someone then do so graciously, I am not there to be lectured that I did not have reservations.  We did not stay, and we will not return.  The menu looks interesting but I guess you need reservations.
