Maybe I'm a pizza snob. Maybe I caught them on a bad night.  But, I will not be giving them another shot.  My pizza was burned and they lost my order so it took 15 minutes and 3 people to run a credit card.  \n\nTrue pizza lovers, there is a good chance you will be disappointed, especially if you're use to quality pizza outside of Pittsburgh.
