This is a regular stop for our family. Best rice and beans in town! It's not a fancy restaurant, it's a small taco shop, which we like. The prices are low and the food is plentiful. The folks that work here are pleasant and helpful. Our favorites are the carne asada nachos and chicken burrito. They have delicious horchata too.
