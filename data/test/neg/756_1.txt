I have been going to the Pain Center of Arizona for over 10 years. Dr. Turley does my injections when needed, in my lower back. Dr. Turley is awesome! He knows exactly what he's doing to give me relief. He listens to his patients, and has great compassion. For my office visits, I see Richard Smiehorowski. Richard, is also an awesome guy! He is very knowledgeable, and listens to his patients. Richard is very compassionate, and really cares about his patients. Between Dr. Turley and Richard, they keep me functioning. Thanks to these two gentlemen, I can enjoy life!
