I am here on a business trip and so glad this place opened. It's brand new, clean, and the food was really good. I had the crab stuffed snapper and as a west coast girl thoroughly enjoyed it. I am here for 3 nights and glad it don't have to drive out to find anything else in the area. The bartenders pour generously and that will win my vote any day!
