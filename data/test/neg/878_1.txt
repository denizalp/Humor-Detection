If you want to have parathas potato\/radish\/daal filled fried bread, or Kulchas, this is the place you want to go, if you want to have Saag with maki ki roti and Lassi, just like a village in punjab this is the place. The service is nice lots of vegetarian indian dishes and lots of sweets but the best thing is the parathas, especially on a sunday morning, have it for brunch... no lunch required....
