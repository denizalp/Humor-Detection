Great REAL bagels. Not quite at the New York level but pretty close. Service was fantastic. Good coffee too.  We went back three days after our first visit and the woman taking our order remembered our order from our first visit. \nPlace is quirky too with a decor featuring dozens of license plates - from many different states and countries. \nMy only ding is the heavy cream cheese on the bagels - if you don't like your bagels smothered, you should ask them to go light on the cream cheese.
