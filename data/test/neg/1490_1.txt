I've tried The Herb Box in Old Town Scottsdale for dinner with a friend, but had not been to this location so my fiancé and I decided to come here for a late brunch\/lunch after our wedding dance lessons nearby. My fiancé had the chilaquiles and I got the sweet potato avocado bowl with blackened shrimp. Both dishes were delicious. We loved the live music on the weekend and the patio out front. It's located near a few other new restaurants and is just down the street from The Yard so lots of options.
