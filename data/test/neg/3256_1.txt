Got Delta's number through Home Depot in Flagstaff to prepare a gas connection for an appliance installation.  On the appointment day, no one showed up or called during the 4 hour window.  After numerous attempts to reach customer service, someone finally returned a call to us to say they would not be coming until 4 days later.  We were able to find a local reliable plumber who came in a day and charged us 1\/4 of the quote by Delta.  We'll stick with the local plumber at CopperState Plumbing in Flagstaff in the future.
