Great place for a quick lunch downtown! Great food, reasonable prices and good service. I had the Pad Thai which was amazing and have heard multiple people rave about the Tom Yum soup. (Too spicy for me, I'm a huge baby!)\n\nWe've also ordered delivery to our office through Uber Eats when we were unable to venture out.\n\nGreat place all around!
