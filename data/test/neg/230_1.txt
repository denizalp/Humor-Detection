Very disappointed in Park management on 7\/11\/2014. Waited in a few lines for almost an hour and a half while they run empty cars. Management closes park on a beautiful evening at 10 o'clock with hundreds of people still in Park. Kids were getting their face painted at 9:45 in the evening with excitement. There was absolutely no rain on this day. Most of the food locations was poorly staffed. Laser show was entertaining.
