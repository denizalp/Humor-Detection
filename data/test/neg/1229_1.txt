I ordered macaroons for an event at the last minute! (2 days prior) The owner was a dream to work with. The price was very reasonable and he worked around my crazy schedule to get them picked up. He even text me to keep me updated when I couldn't take phone calls. I ordered 50 macaroons for a tea party for some teenagers and they loved them!
