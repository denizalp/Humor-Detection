Very poor quality food. The only bright side of this dinner was the pleasant waitress.  Our pizza was mushy and undercooked. I ordered the chicken toscano and it tasted like straight up balsamic vinegar and the risotto was pretty bad. I couldn't eat it. The description was nothing like the actual entree.  But the staff is really nice.
