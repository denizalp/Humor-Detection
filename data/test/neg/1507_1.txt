I started going to The Works when I lived in Ottawa, where the chain got its start. It's quirky, fun, and the old fashioned, roughneck-like atmosphere is fun! They play classic rock in the background, serve drinks in measuring cups, and have incredible burgers! Although some of my friends say their burger quality has diminished over the years, I still think they're amazing. They get their burgers to be so good because they get their own ground beef and make their patties from scratch.\n\nDefinitely go here for a fun experience, a delicious burger, and a great time!
