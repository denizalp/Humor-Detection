Came here for my birthday and being a big fan of southeast Asian food, I was a bit disappointed.\n\nAs an introduction to Indonesian\/Malay food, this place would be great but for those familiar with the flavors of this cuisine, it lacked the customary punch of flavours. No particular dish really stood out.
