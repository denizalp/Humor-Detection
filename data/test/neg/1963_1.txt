Just bought our third piece from Nick - two very unusual doors with so much character and now a one of a kind, zinc topped table that is a show stopper.  Nick never disappoints - he does an amazing job with every piece he works on and everything ends up looking so unique and cool that nothing seems to hang around his store for long. If you see it and like it - better buy it quick because you will never see anything else like it!
