I have been here MANY times, but today the tofu bao was so tough I had to throw out both of mine plus the one I was going to give to someone else... it was like trying to chew a chewing gum wrapper! I don't what the deal was, but it was entirely inedible. I honestly think I was served old \/ stale tofu.  Too bad bc this was a regular spot for me.
