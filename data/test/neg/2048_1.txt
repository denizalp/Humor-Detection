I can't say enough good things about the guys at The Velo. Their knowledge, passion and generosity is unparalleled. They have helped me through my journey to Ironman and have become friends along the way. The Velo is a place to buy and service your bike...and a great place for community and coffee. Thank you for all you do (Jake, Zach, Jason, Justin....and the entire team).
