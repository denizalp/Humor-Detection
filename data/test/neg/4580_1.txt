I was so excited I had the chance to explore just even the tiniest part of the Tremont area in Cleveland. \n\nLilly's was by far the best side trip from my drive home from MSU! \n\nThey have an open kitchen, so we can watch them create those oh-so-yummy pieces of chocolate!!\n\nThe employees and the owners were awesome with letting me snap photos of them doing their thing!! \n\nAnd oh Wow! The chocolates were to die for and so cute! The pairings from the craft beers to the wines w the chocolates, just genious!
