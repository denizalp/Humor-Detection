First off, I'm glad to see an independent restaurant in Avon Lake booming, which they do! Salad Kraze is packed all week at lunch time! The Autumn Crunch is my favorite and my daughter loves the wraps and smoothies. Scott the owner does trivia questions with prizes and the setting is family friendly.
