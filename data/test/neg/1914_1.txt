I ordered for delivery. Blazing fast. I was told about 45 minutes and they were at my door in 20. The food was good. Nothing special, like any other Chinese take Out place. I find it very hard to review these types of take-out places as I feel they all cook from the same ingrediÃ«nten list. Anyways, if you are looking for descent quick Chinese take out with a bubbly delivery guy, this is the place to be :)
