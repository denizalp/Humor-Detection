I don't know how much Style Furnish N Style has but just maybe not my Style?\n\nSaleperson though friendly enough but I just don't like people following me everywhere and telling me every single piece can be custom made to whatever material I like. I think I would need to like something first?\n\nThe display is flea market like but without the pricing to match. A note to management, more selections doesn't mean better.\n\nNo Photographs signs are everywhere. Maybe they don't want to see how messy and crowded this place is?
