LoLos was highly recommended by my coworkers so I decided to take a date there. It was ok, nothing special. I'd say the hype was overblown, to be honest. I mean, the palce is exactly what it says -- chicken and waffles. I can heat up some Tyson chicken strips, toast 4 Strawberry Eggos and save myself the gas. The sweet tea was good (served in a mason jar if I recall correctly), but I can't give the place more than 3 stars since chicken and waffles seems hardly innovative.
