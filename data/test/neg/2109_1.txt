Ordered a pizza for delivery at 715 tonight. Spoke to a girl to confirm my order and then called back for the total. I called back an hour later at 820 and then the same girl says: \"please confirm your adress\"...so i do. She then then says: \"What did you order again? Yes. We're making it now (clearly lying)\"\nTerrible terrible place.
