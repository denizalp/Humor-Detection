I've been going to Simia for years and I cannot express how great she really is. She's always kind, very good listener, and she is very inuitive. She always has the answer to the question before you even ask. Her reiki session are very, very powerful. I've gone on a retreat she held in Shasta, CA and it was amazing. I would highly recommend her to anyone I meet.
