Stuart Townsley did such a great job with our family portraits.  He took amazing candid shots (which is quite an accomplishment considering I usually detest all photos of myself). He also managed to get fantastic shots of our two crazy boys who won't sit still for 2 seconds.   The shoot itself was quick (very important with kids around) and he was friendly and professional.  Additionally, he has no problem giving tips on what to wear\/not to wear if you are interested:)  We are so happy with the results!
