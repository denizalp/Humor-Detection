No stars really, for this place. Mold, MOLD ON MY BREAD!!!! What the heck!?!? Please make sure to check your food before eating it. Didn't realize my chicken sandwich had mold until i bit into it and turned it upside down and noticed mold on the bottom slice of the bread. Called and spoke to the manager, took my food back and got my money back, but I will NEVER eat here again. I hope they are more careful with checking their food before passing it to the customer.
