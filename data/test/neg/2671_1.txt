I'm not a fan of Chipotle's food, but I will say it's a quick and simple lunch when you're in a hurry.  We stopped in today to grab a fast hire during a busy lunch rush.  Even if the line is out the door you'll only wait about 5 minutes at the most!  I personally like the carnitas quesadilla...you can't go wrong
