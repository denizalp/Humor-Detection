The location is easily accessible off of I-90 or I-480 and is located in an up and coming area, so lock your doors. The food is very good, and the service, while a little clumsy, is attentive and pleasant.\n\nGet the guacamole. It is perfect. The prices are a little high imho, but if you're looking for a bargain, go to Burger King, they're right on W 117.
