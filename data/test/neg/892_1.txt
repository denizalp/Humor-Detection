Booked a room here for a very reasonable price with a $25 dollar credit for food. The hotel had mainly \"the stay for a business trip\" vibe. Nice, clean, smoke-free environment. The only negative was that my room was all the way at the end of the hall and i think housekeeping forgot to arrive to our room to clean up during the day. Other than that i would def return to this hotel. It was a great off the strip place to stay, yet close enough to everything.
