Good experience at this place- will be going again. A bit pricey for the portion size but quality is good.  I think time is still needed for this business to settle into a smooth operation so that all parts of the assembly line run a bit more hand in hand but the offering is good.  So please just take the time to get the basics right- treat your customers right, maintain your quality, keep clean. I really hope to keep eating here!
