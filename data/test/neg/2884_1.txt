In my opinion, if you are a specialty taco spot and don't offer Home mad tortillas, you aren't a real taco spot! This place has homemade tortillas and the best steak tacos I've ever had! I had 1 steak taco and 1 shrimp taco and I devoured them both! The flavors of each taco are soooo different yet sooo delicious. If you come to the Noda area, be sure to stop here and grab a taco or three!
