I order catering from Chachi's Market Mall regularly and these guys are great to work with. They are always on time, easy to communicate, polite, helpful and, most importantly, their sandwiches and salads are always extremely fresh. They are also very accommodating - we are unable to pick up the order so they deliver to our office. I always try to give them bigger orders just to support their business. I can't comment on other locations but I work with 5-6 different caterers on a regular basis and we never had any issues with Chachi's Market Mall team.
