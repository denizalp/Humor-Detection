I have brought my vehicles here for over 3 years now and I can say that Tom is excellent, fair and knowledgable but more importantly he is honest.  That is the bet trait he has and he enjoys what he does. Imports only for the most part but it never hurts to call and ask. You will not be sorry- trust me! He is good people!! :)
