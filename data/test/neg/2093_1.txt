My 100 year old mom and I stopped here for breakfast. In her words, great food, nice and courteous people, clean restrooms.  She gave it an A. I thought it was great place. Sort of a hippie atmosphere. Relaxed, great food, friendly servers.  Good place to eat, read, work on your computer, hang out. Great atmosphere, music, couch, really interesting signs on the walls. Looks like it appeals to a wide range of people.  Might up there again just to eat. \n\nPaul and lila
