NEW GREAT FIND!!! This place is a blast! Clean, modern and the wine + food is fantastic! Thank you Yelp for helping me discover this gem! Very close to the AJ's in DC Ranch area. All the wine is smooth and delicious, not too acidic. The bruschetta is out of this world too (my friend's husband is a chef and he gave two thumbs up)! Everyone who works there seems to be very happy and loving their job, A+ to the servers! Thank you Decantur for a lovely time, we WILL be back :)
