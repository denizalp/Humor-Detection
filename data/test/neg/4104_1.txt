I don't care if you are a franchisee, if the website that is your presence and source of marketing on the web, as well as being the site through which I found you (http:\/\/www.panerabread.com\/) says that you have wireless internet access, you had damn well better have some wireless internet access!\n\nI did not even stay to try the food (which I am sure is approximately the same as other Panera Bread Cos. around town), so cannot comment on that.
