Solid choice for a mid-week night out when you don't want to drive too far from home.\nService was good-ish.  Of course, this is based on my one experience with one waiter who was a bit pushy (odd) and seemed put-off when I didn't like the wine he recommended (which was the most expensive on the by the glass list)\nFood was reasonably priced.\nChoices felt somewhat limited, but this can be a good thing.  Play to your strengths\nI would return, but would not be my first choice
