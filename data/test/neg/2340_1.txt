Yummy Pho is a solid neighbourhood Vietnamese restaurant that specializes in pho and vermicelli (dry pho in bowl), appetizers and beverages.  Though the menu is limited, it cooks every thing well, especially the vermicelli IMHO (hence, the name yummy pho).  \n\nThe restaurant is a little hard to find, in a strip mall.
