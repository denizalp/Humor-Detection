We had an excellent experience at Lake Norman Medical Center when our daughter was born. The Labor\/Delivery and Mother\/Baby unit was outstanding (Stork Landing). I could not have asked for better care and service.  The nurses were kind, prompt, and encouraging. The housekeeping and food service employees were all polite and friendly. Highly recommended if you are looking for a hospital for Labor and Delivery!!!
