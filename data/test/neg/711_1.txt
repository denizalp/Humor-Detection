I got here and had a little trouble finding a spot to park but it was OK. When I got inside the security guard was nice and gave great directions where to go. My 3 ur old got her finger wrapped around the cord of the blinds and the staff here has been so nice and kind and vwry helpful. I couldn't be happier. I would bring my child here again. Very clean and staff nice and straight to the point.
