The brisket at Rock Store is delicious! I do wish they had it sliced, but what do I care it still tastes fantastic. This is a new tradition on the way home from the beach...stopping at Rock Store to stuff ourselves silly one last time before vacation ends =)\n\nTheir sandwich combos are $6.50 (I believe) and you will be stuffed! Last time I got the brisket sammy and potato salad .  \n\nWish I lived closer so I could make this a regular stop!
