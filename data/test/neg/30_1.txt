We ordered a large take out order on a early Sunday afternoon. I didn't expect them to be busy, but I was amazed how fast they had 8 dinners ready for us. The food was ready and waiting all boxed up for us. The people were super nice. And best of all, the food was really good. Everyone raved about it. \n\nWe will definitely be back.
