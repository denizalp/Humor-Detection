This is a wonderful hotel. It's location to downtown is perfect. Very clean and well kept. The staff was friendly and very helpful. It's near the major bus routes to get to the strip. If you are looking to stay near Fremont street this is a no brainer. Great place, great price and perfect location. We will be back. Thanks for a great experience!
