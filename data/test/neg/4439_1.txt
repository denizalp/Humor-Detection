Glass Habitats is awesome.  They are so friendly and always ready to help.  They order anything that you want for your fish.  The owner even comes to my house and cleans my fish tank.  \n\nI was looking for a shark for my kid and he was able to order it.  If you want some exotic fish give this place a try.
