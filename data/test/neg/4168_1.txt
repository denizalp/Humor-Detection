Going into Dr Radcliffe's office today for the first time was a treat. Very comfortable, inviting office with professional front and back office peeps. I've always feared the dentist until today. Dr R. was informative and friendly, Gina, the hygienist was gentle and extremely efficient. 6 months from now when I return, there will be no fear.  So happy I have a new dentist. He's fantastic.
