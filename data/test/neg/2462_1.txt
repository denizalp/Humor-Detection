OMG....you must experience this place when you visit Vegas.  We didn't eat...but had a few drinks at the bar....and it was worth it.  You must wear a hosptial gown and the waitresses are \"nurses\".  We enjoyed watching other \"patients\" get spanked for not finishing their food.  Our bartender,. Stephanie, was awesome!   Great place to stop in for a drink and laughs.
