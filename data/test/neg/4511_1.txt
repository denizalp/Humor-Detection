The problem I have is not with the food but, with the customer service at this location. Every time we stop by the employees are very rude and act like they don't want to be bothered. On one occasion the lady working the drive thru never said a word to us then has the nerve to say \"I'm waiting on you.\" A hello or an may I take your order would be great!
