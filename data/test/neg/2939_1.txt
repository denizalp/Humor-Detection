I searched on Yelp for multiple companies to re-wire and install multiple ceiling fans in my new house. I am pleased I chose this company. There were some miscommunication on the pricing but the customer service of Carlos remedied all issues. In addition to the service, the actual work done by Carlos and Cody were spot on with my requests and I they provided great suggestions on upgrades, choice of color of ceiling fan accessories in conjunction with room color, and possible down the road updates. I am extremely satisfied and appreciative of contacting this team.
