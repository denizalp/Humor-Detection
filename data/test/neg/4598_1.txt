It was my first time there and holy cow, it was amazing. Portions are perfect. I left there feeling great, I wasn't feeling full or bloated nor hungry still. I got the bang bang chicken. I highly recommend. Seasoning was perfect. It taste so good! They also have kids portions available. Will be going there more often.
