So I have given this place plenty of time to settle in and get their shizz together before updating my review, but it still STILL is the worst Tim Hortons I know of. Today I said three times Earl Grey tea and she still went and made me a green tea. Oh, and they let someone totally and visibly cut the line and they said nothing and served him first while the rest of us waited and waited. Seriously step up your game!!!
