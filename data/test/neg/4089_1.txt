My favorite place downtown! I love bringing people who haven't been here so that I can show them all of the unique touches this restaurant has! I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here. Good for big parties, great people watching too! Simple menu and reasonably priced! This place could be packed and you will still receive great service!
