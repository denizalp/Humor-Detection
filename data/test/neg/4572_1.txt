Stopped in for just a drink & appetizer at the small bar.  Two open seats were open and we sat right down on a Friday night.  \n\nI had a lemon drink (forget the name) but the bartender put a lighter to the lemon.  Really enjoyed this cocktail!\n\nWe just tried the bruschetta with asparagus and prosciutto- outstanding!  \n\nNice little spot to stop- in past visits the cheese charcuterie is amazing as well as great salads.
