CInemark is my favorite theater in the area. It's never crowded in the theater or the parking lot, it's generally clean as far as theaters go, and there is theater style seating for every screen. DInner options nearby aren't great (mostly fast-food options), but it is possible to get a good meal nearby.\n\nPet peeves: The bathrooms are not conveniently located once you pass the ticket taker. The concessions stands are glacially slow. No where to sit down in the hallways (past the ticket taker).
