We are from California so of course my Grandchildren want McDonalds for breakfast.  Went to the drive thru and the service was horrible.  The cashier at the window did not say one word or crack a smile.  The second window clerk just passed our bags and our order was wrong.  The food was good but we were missing condiments!! No more drive thru for us!!!
