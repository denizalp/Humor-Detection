Got my order quick but was so dissapointed with what I payed for. \nThe pizzas had allot of sauce but no cheese and I ordered a sausage jalapeño pizza. It literally had like 5 pieces of sausage and 4 of jalapeño. After that I ordered Buffalo wings and received BBQ wings and the pizzas were cut so big I couldn't even share. So I had to cut them myself.
