The service was excellent, friendly, and attentive. Too bad the pizza was tasteless. The crust is nice and light, made of unbleached white flour. They offer Daiya (vegan) cheese, which is why we went as a family - to accommodate the vegans in the group. Unfortunately, they don't offer a whole wheat or whole grain crust to align with its healthy options.. \n\nThe toppings are meager. A smattering here and there does NOT justify the high price. Sorry, Mellow Mushroom. Nice try, but I won't be back.
