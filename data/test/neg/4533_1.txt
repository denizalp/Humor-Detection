I love Press! My parents live right down the street and are regulars, and I love to walk down when I'm in town. The coffee and iced tea are splendid and the environment is perfect for working on the computer or reading -- plenty of small tables and a nice patio. I've had the breakfast burrito and avocado toast, and enjoyed both.
