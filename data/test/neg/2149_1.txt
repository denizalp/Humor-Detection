Not sure why this place only has three stars, all my visits there have been great. This is definitely an overlooked spot in Market Square. I've had the chicken tacos which were delicious. The portions are huge and great to take home for leftovers. Also, make sure to order the trio; it gives you all the chips you can eat with salsa, guacamole, and queso for $10; not too shabby. The ambience is good. Once when I was there a mariachi band played, quite a treat.
