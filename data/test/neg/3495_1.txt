Came in with my dad during one sweltering August night, lured in by the cute 50's ambience and by the nostalgia of going to the Sugar Bowl as a kid.  The people who worked there were simply rude, barely acknowledging our presence.  When we ordered I saw that he scooped out of a container that said Dreyer's. If a sundae could be bland, this was. I know a lot of places used mass-produced ice cream, but I would go to Sweet Republic in a heartbeat over this place.
