The place is nice. Nice first time date environment. The staff were cool, alert, responsive, and knowledgeable about their menu. The Roasted chicken was great, good flavors. We also enjoyed the grilled pork chop , which by the way it was excellent! Crispy outside and moist inside. The bad thing was the sides were like garnishes instead of sides. Very few potatoes with the chicken and the pork chop had asparagus pieces. There are several options on the menu, pick one, I'm sure you will enjoy something too! Go Get  SOME!
