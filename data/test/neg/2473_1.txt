Nice little bobs shop by my place.  The kids dig the nutella crepes but I find them a little soggy.  Still, freshly made crepes are hard to find off strip.\n\nThe 2 for 1 milk teas is why I visit.  Nicely sized for thirst quenching, not enough to be calorie overload.  \n\nGreat little snack shop in a relatively quiet shopping center.
