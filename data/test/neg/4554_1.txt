Service and food were great; rarely had an empty glass. The atmosphere is perfect for an after work hangout, or a date night. Plenty of TVs in the bar area for watching hockey. \n\nOnly con was that the bathroom was down a flight a stairs in the .. basement? But otherwise it was a great experience.
