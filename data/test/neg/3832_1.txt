Maybe it was cause I was hungover, but didn't see what was so special here.  Sure the red velvet pancakes are good, but not great.  Plus, we had to wait 1 hour just to get in on a Sunday morning.  The adobo fried rice was served in a gigantic portion but was medicore at best. Not the kind of place I look for when I want a good brunch.
