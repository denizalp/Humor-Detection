On a Saturday, as a family we had lunch at Sticky Fingers.  There were 4 adults and 2 children and one teen.  The service was superior.  The Beer was the coldest we had ever had.  The food was delicious.  We had a variety of selections from the menu and everyone was pleased.\n\nWe would highly recommend this restaurant and we would definitely return.
