Wow - not sure where these good reviews came from. I guess if you like greasy cheese covered in greasy cheese, then this is your place! We're regulars at three amigos which has great food, but I was looking for some good chile rellenos.  This is definitely the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to.  From walking into the overwhelming smell of cleaning products, to bland salsa, and greasy everything - along with terrible service, we certainly wouldn't recommend this place.
