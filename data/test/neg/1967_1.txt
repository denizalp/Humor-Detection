I came here for lunch during weekdays with 2 friends right at noon.  Due to peak time, the services is a bit slow, but still within the hour. \n\nMy friend order wraps and burger, and I order Steak and mushroom pot pie, it's pretty good and I like it a lot.  The atmosphere is really nice & relax, and feels like a classic pub.\n\nWill definitely come back again!!!
