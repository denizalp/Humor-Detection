Great food!  Even my hubby, the carnivore, thought the Heirloom pizza was amazing.  He went for the Goodfellas and it was a great alternative.  We ended up splitting our bounty.  Truly one pizza is enough for two people.  However, we chose to save the leftovers for after the game.  The beer selection was awesome.  We didn't even bother with the cocktail menu.  The severs are friendly but if give yourself extra time for the kitchen and bartender to keep up.  However, it's totally worth the wait when you have time.
