i went to this sorry excuse of a restaurant on wednesday october 18th 2017 and got food poisoning the next day I threw up so hard i popped blood vessels in my eye i would not wish this on my worst enemy. DO NOT EAT HERE just pay the extra and go somewhere else. The rice looked dark and not fresh... and the food had a weird smell to it {FOOD POISON ALERT}
