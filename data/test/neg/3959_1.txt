Prompt and precise.  Was able to have an appointment within 24 hours.  Deirdre walked me through the process of completing the formation of my at home business and future services that I may need.  They are able to work outside the cookie cutter mold for small businesses and provide needed services on a case by case biases.  Deirdre promises a 24 hour turnaround time for IRS documents and delivered 100%.  Would recommend them to other small business starting out.
