Homemade pasta is AMAZING. I came with my family - the gnocchi was like the fluffiest most delicious ever, the ravioli was amazing, the sea bass was PERFECTLY cooked, the homemade linguine in the puttanesca was awesome and the 2 appetizers we had (the grilled romaine and the meatballs) were AWESOMEEE \nDefinitely recommend\nAlthough it comes at a bit of a price
