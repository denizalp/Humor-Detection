Cricket infested, unsafe proerty(break in), bad parking and thin walls. Dirty workout area and uncaring management staff. Management ripped me off after I was looking to transfer apartments to get away from crickets Manager did walk through and said everything was good, no charges and even left me a voice mail about how much money I was getting back but when I decided to move instead they came up with a bill over $1000 dollars. Stay away
