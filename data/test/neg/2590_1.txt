We were seated quickly though this might be because of the time of day.  Had the Aranchini Margaritas which were delicious. Followed with the tag Bolognese, coming from an Italian family am usually not impressed with pasta in restaurants, but this was good, .the pasta was al dente, and the sauce flavorful without being overwhelming. I had a cocktail they call La Dolce Vita, a touch on the sweet side but thoroughly enjoyable. The service was quick and very attentive without being annoying or obtrusive
