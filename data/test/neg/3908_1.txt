Went here yesterday for our burger fix, my fiance got the blue cheese burger and I got the southwest and its soooo good. The southwest burger was very spicy but it had great flavor instead of just burning your mouth. We also got the garlic fries and theyre always my fianc√©s favorite. Also always get the lemonade just do it.
