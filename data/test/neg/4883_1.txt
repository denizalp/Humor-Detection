We stopped in because we had family in town and were looking for a good place to get the kids a treat! This place was great. They had just opened for the day. The young man working was very nice and helpful with the kids. He offered them games to play and was more than accommodating! The ice cream was flavorful and I wanted seconds! The boys ordered strawberry shakes and they smelled just as good as they tasted, amazing! Definitely worth the trip!
