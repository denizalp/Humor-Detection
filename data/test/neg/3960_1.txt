Great place for kids to have a great time running off some energy and parents are welcome to join the fun, or relax on a couch and watch their children have a blast. Staff is very friendly and super helpful. Kids are in a safe air conditioned environment with their parents. They also serve food and drinks as well as let you in with your own drinks. Also it is very inexpensive.!!
