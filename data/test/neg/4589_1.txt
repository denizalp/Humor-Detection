The food is very good. The price is right. The wait is dreadful. Seriously, 1 hour for the first entrée?!?  Really? 3 minutes for next entrée, then 20 minutes more for the third and fourth entrees for our group of four.   Unbelievable. One of our party knew folks working there, or we would have left.  Just too slow.  Oh, and they ran out of the dumpling appetizers. And we found that out 40 minutes into our wait.
