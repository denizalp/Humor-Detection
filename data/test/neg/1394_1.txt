This is very much a no frills place but they serve excellent beer and the prices aren't too shabby either.  Expect to pay around $5.50 for a pint and the quality is very high for what you get.  I tried the raspberry beer and I have to say it is one of the better ones that I've tasted here in Montreal.  There isn't much foodwise but the nachos everyone shared were pretty good.
