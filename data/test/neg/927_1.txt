Came here for first time!  Definitely worth the trip.  The quality of the product is very high.  Portions were very generous.  The uni hand roll is really amazing one of the best I've had in Toronto.\n\nThe price was very affordable compared to the higher end sushi places in Toronto. I would say half the price  and the food is better than most higher end sushi restaurant in Toronto.\n\nIf you're looking for tasty casual sushi fix definitely give this a try. If
