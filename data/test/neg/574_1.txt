A very affordable place to make photocopies but still produces excellent quality work. I found this place through Yelp. It was my first time there, and I unintentionally arrived during closing time. However, it was really nice of the owner to still assist in making photocopies quickly. It took me an hour to reach this place, but I wouldn't mind coming here again! B&W photocopying costs $0.04 each. They don't accept credit cards, so bring cash!
