The best breakfast place in Vegas!   We were there four mornings this last trip to Vegas.  Great portions.  Steak and eggs like it should be.  The chicken fried steak is to die for.  The pancakes, the best!   Good portions.  Nice people there. The owner remembered us from last year.  That was nice.  No smoking establishment!!  Yay for us non-smokers!   This is the place to go for a good non-buffet breakfast.  We will be back!
