Bagels are pretty good here! I have been spoiled with Montreal bagels (like Fairmont and St Viateur) but these have been some of the best I have had in Toronto. We have tried the Montreal style bagels (does not remind me of actual Montreal bagels), everything bagels (we liked it), corn, and spinach and onion. Got 6 bagels for $4.
