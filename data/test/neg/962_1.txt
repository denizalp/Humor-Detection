Love this place! We visited on a Sunday around 5pm so the line wasn't too long. It's one of the best bakeries I've ever seen. I love the antiques and quirky things I find. \n\nVariety of desserts and yummy cafe (sandwiches and salads) bites! Great workplace, getaway, hang-out, creative space, girls meet-up, book club gathering, intimate date, and the list goes on! \n\nWe tried a little bit of everything for our dessert and will be back to relax.
