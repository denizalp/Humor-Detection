When this was the Brunswick zone it was 100 times better. Just bowled there for my sons birthday and service is absolutely pathetic we push buttons for service for food no one showed up my daughter went to the counter to get someone to serve us no one came it is absolutely horrible. If this place is going to stay in business management better change or get a grip on the Employees.
