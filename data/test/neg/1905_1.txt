The turkey delight is great! Prices are affordable and I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast or a snack. The staff was awesome and so friendly (I'm not a morning person and I went for breakfast so I really needed that kind of service to get my day going). It is pretty cramped and the food\/beverage ordering is a little more complicated than necessary, but not so bad that it would keep me from going again. I will be back next time I'm in town!
