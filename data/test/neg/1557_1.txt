Disappointed in the lack of customer service and phone etiquette the pharmacy has. When handling inquiries I recommend you have patience and choose your words before talking with your customers or prescribers. I understand you have a high volume of people to take care of but one prescription\/person isn't more important than the other. By refusing to take the information over the phone or provide me the information that is needed. Discussed this with Terry who was assisting my staff. Some additional training is needed.
