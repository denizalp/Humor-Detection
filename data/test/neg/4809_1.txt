This place is a must-try if you are out in uptown Charlotte. \nIt's right near the baseball and football stadiums, which make it a great place to grab a bite on game day as well!\nThere food is AMAZING! The chef here is totally on point!\nIf you go, you HAVE to try the boxties...they are like change-your-life good! The scotch egg is another ridiculously good appetizer!\nI was impressed by literally everything here, from the food, to the service, to the amazing atmosphere\/decor.\nI will be back again...and again, and again!
