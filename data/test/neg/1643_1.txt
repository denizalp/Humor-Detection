This is the place to go to get your fix of Detroit favorites. Coneys, Faygo, Vernors, and Better Made. The food is awesome and authentic to the Detroit style. The staff is awesome. If tou are missing your fix of coneys or never had one before, this is the place to go. I would give this a full 5 stars if they also served served Sanders Hot Fudge sundaes  it would also help if they were open later...could really take advantage of the late night college crowd down the road.
