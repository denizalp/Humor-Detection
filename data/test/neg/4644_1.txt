Dark cozy spot with a great menu and nice selection of cocktails, wines and beer.  Food was solid , with  our group ordering a nice selection of small plates, including scallops, and beef skewers, served with a tasty selection of salsas.   Our server seated us immediately, walked us thru the menu and then disappeared .  Subsequent service was slow, with orders arriving at different times and one not at all.\n\nGood if you have time and are in the neighborhood.
