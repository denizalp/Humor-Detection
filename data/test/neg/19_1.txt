I have no idea why people gave this place bad comments.  The food is fresh.  The service is the best.  The place is called moon valley cafe.  Not a Mexican food establishment.   It's always busy and they do a great job.  I'm just realizing people just like to complain.  Now my amazing service professional Stephanie was and always be my favorite.   Her smile brighten my day\n  Great way to start my day off.   I love this place.  And if you don't please stay away.  There's enough negative people out there in the world.
