Apparently a Gastonia\/Belmont staple (according to my husband), we almost always make a stop here when in town! Fast Japanese food. Who would have thought that could be good? But it is! The menu is pretty big and we usually go with the simple shrimp\/chicken combo. It comes with rice but you can make it low carb and just have double veggies instead. It also has sushi, bento boxes, teppanyaki noodles, and more! We love you, Sake Express! Come to TX, please!
