After hanging out in Vegas for a week and seeing Lobsicle advertisements all over, I decided to give this place a try. I got the fish and chips to play it safe and it was decent. You don't get that many pieces of lobster for the price but the basket was full of fries which was nice. For having special seasonings for their food offerings, I was a little surprised that their tartar sauce was in generic packets. Probably won't be back, but the food was decent so I have no real complaints about that.
