Tasty and reliable Korean cuisine. One of the better places in Toronto. I've come here several times. \n\nThe portions for most dishes are large and meant to share.\n\nRelaxed and casual atmosphere. They hold karaoke nights, too! \n\nThe waitstaff are friendly and attentive. \n\nThe washrooms are clean and well kept.
