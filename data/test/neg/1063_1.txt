Nice French speaking counter people.   Great coffee.  Free wireless.\nAll nestled into a nice art gallery with plenty of seating.\n\nTheir specialty here is crepe's with various fillings, but I opted for their coffee, and some of their specialty candy from their counter.\n\nNice place.  They could speed up the service just a bit.
