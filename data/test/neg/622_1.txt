I have used One Guard for our home, and a couple of rentals homes that we own. They have always been quick and prompt with any repair requests that have been needed. When we have had problems with air conditioning, they were fast to respond and repair. I have heard about other companies making clients wait so long to get the job done, even up to a month! It's so easy to use their online system if you need to put in a claim, or just have any other questions or concerns. I refer them to all my buyers'!
