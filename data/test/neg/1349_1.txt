Solid!!\n\nThis is a pretty no frills place that isn't very fancy and for the most part could be a Denny's with Sushi but the Sushi is top notch. \n\nReally reasonable as well. Especially for happy hour.\n\nThings I loved: vegas rolls, spicy tuna, unagi, stuffed mushrooms\n\nThing I probably wouldn't get again: gyoza, tootsie roll\n\n\nI think I've found my new favorite happy hour sushi place
