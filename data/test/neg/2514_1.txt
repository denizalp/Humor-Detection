We were visiting Montreal for a week and tried this last night. Great place for drinks and food.  There were a lot of people..very busy so we were excited to try. Their whiskey list is impressive.  My bf tried a whiskey tasting and I ordered red rum as a cocktail. For dinner I ordered georgie's catch and my bf got the vegetation masher curry with shrimp. Both were delicious and dessert was raspberry trifle. \n\nhighly recommend any one to try ...even if just drinks
