My review is a bit old and from the summer. Hands down this was the best casino buffet I ever had. So much food and my friends and I stayed there for three hours eating and drinking and our server didnt seem to mind at all. Really... I have no complaints between all the food and unlimited mimosa where do I have room to complain?\n\nThe waiter was so patient with us.  We drank and got tipsy and stayed at the buffet until it was time to eat again.  Really just can't complain.
