Great place!  Met the owner when we walked in the door. Discussed beer and food for a sec with great recs. Great hoppy IPAs. The tacos are creative with an eggplant as the shell. The lamb is a perfect pair with all the flavors. The fried deviled eggs take a classic and make it more sinful. Fish and chips are the perfect batter to fish ratio for an airy bite of pub flavor. Worth the stop and a short walk across the street from the gambling halls on Fremont. Take the time to try it.
