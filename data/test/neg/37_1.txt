I love America's Carne Asada, it has been rated the best in the valley several times and I can see why. My co-workers and I eat there at least once a week. Spring for the XL burrito extra spicy! Like others have said parking can be a bit of a pain during lunch but it isn't horrible, you can park on the street. $12 for a XL burrito and tamarindo drink is a little expensive compared to your chain fast food joint but this food is WAY better! So worth it!
