This place does not disappoint and was the best clubs I've ever been to. We were in town for my best friend's bachelor party and our host Brian Pheiffer hooked us up huge with the best pool side table in the entire club (even on short notice) for David Guetta. \n\nI definitely recommend reaching out to Brian Pheiffer who was our host all weekend and his company is Surreal in Las Vegas. \n\nHis number is: (773) 459-8133
