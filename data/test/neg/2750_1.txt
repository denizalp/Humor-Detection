Just had the best dinner! Everything was flavorful, the meat was tender, the sauce was abundant. We tried a little bit of everything; lamb chops, chicken tikka, chicken tandori, butter chicken(OMG), I can't even remember the rest. The Naan was delicious and all the sauce to dip my Naan into was beyond amazing. I will definitely come back on my next trip.
