Went back to try and iced mocha once again. I figured the initial visit could have just been an off day. Plus I really wish a decent coffee shop was around that wasn't chain-besides Verrado which is a tad out of the way. Anyway my iced mocha was ok. Nothing good. Starbucks and Dutch Bros are way better. I really don't see how this place is in business, other than perhaps their restaurant and wine part makes the business. I wouldn't recommend or go back unless new management came along.
