We had so much fun! \n\nGreat spot with some awesome beer selection and plenty of space to hang out with friends. \n\nThe outdoor patio areas has long tables perfect for a large group or communal dining. It is surrounded my ping pong tables and several beach volleyball courts (which you can reserve for use in pick up games). \n\nWe had char grilled wings, which were a little too charred for my taste but I think that one is on me. \n\nPlanning on going back this Thursday for trivia night!
