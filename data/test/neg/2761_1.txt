I'm super happy with my experience with uBreakiFix.\n\nI contacted them the night before I had the repair done and not only did they have the part on hand they matched the price I got from one of their competitors (over $20 less) without question.\n\nWhen I got to the store they were very friendly, didn't try to upcharge me and had my phone repaired in 90 minutes.\n\nNext time one of my electronics breaks I know where I'll take it.
