If you're considering eating at this McDonald's, plant some wheat and attend a livestock auction, you'll have you're burger sooner. Joking aside, this is the slowest and least organized restaurant I've been to. No matter if you order at the counter or drive through, your food will take considerably more time than seems reasonable. Staff express high levels of stress and worry during interactions. Obviously some serious work needs to be done to have this restaurant at acceptable service levels. \n\nPlease have patience when attending this restaurant. \n\nZERO STAR
