We bring out goldendoodle, Fitzgerald, to daycare everyday and he loves it!  He is ready and waiting by the door to go everyday.  My favorite part is that I get to watch him play via the video feed on my iPhone.  He is happy and excited to go and he is equally happy and tired when I pick him up. Thanks for taking such great care of our fur baby.
