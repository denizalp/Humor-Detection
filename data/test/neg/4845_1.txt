First timer. I've heard of the famous Bread Bowl and decided to take a wack at it. I visited what it felt like peak hour at 4pm. \n\nOrdered a Broccoli Cheddar Bread Bowl and although the soup was delicious, the bread was hard and did not taste fresh. I finished the soup inside and went on with my day. \n\nI also noticed that cleaning is not on their top priority. I saw other customers waiting for a certain table or booth to be cleaned off from the previous customer.
