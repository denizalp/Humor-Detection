EXCEPTIONALLY RUDE AND RUSHED.  CHRISTY IS THE MANAGER.   \n\nCONFRONTATIONAL- threatening and did not stand behind what I was told.   Basically called me a liar.  Would not reach out to the employee who just the day before told me one shirt change would be ok.  Christ Kept \" putting in her last rude comments and then threatened not to allow us to stay for our session if we said anything\".   \n\nI asked to have another photographer and she told me \" she ran things here not me\"\n\nI HAD BEEN COMING HERE FOR YEARS.  I WILL NEVER RETURN.
