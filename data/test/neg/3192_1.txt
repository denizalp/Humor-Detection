I love coming to this b-dubs!!  \nHas cold beer and yummy wraps. Honey bbq is my favorite flavor. The wait staff is pretty nice. Don't like going to much during lunch to sit at the bar anymore tho, the waitress is super nice and very slow!! I think we waited about 10 minutes to get our check one day.. But other then that service is usually pretty good
