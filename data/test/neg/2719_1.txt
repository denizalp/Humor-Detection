This place sucked.  Went last weekend.  Paid $10 cover.  The music was sub-par.  Hardly any hip-hop\/r&b and when they did play it, they would cut in the crappiest music with it.  The club is far smaller than the website leads you to believe.  All the music was sped up faster than the tempo that they play on the radio.  Must be a west coast thing.  Guess I'm too east coast for the west coast.  We stayed about an hour and left.  Not worth the makeup and outifit.
