Gorgeous spacious room but overshadowed by:\n1. No in room coffee maker. You don't want to know how much I paid for room service coffee. \n2.  Have to pay for internet access, per device!\n3.  Poorly designed air\/ventilation system recirculates stale air only in the living area, the bedroom doesn't even get recirculated (let alone fresh). I spent all night rebreathing CO2.
