I contacted Gabriel based off of previous Yelp reviews that I've seen. Eventhough he couldn't resolve my issue there was no disappointment on my because he tried everything he could as my keys were stuck inside my Range Rover. He even got me in contact with someone that might be able to resolve my issue. He didn't care about losing the job. He cared about taking care of the customer which should always be a priority.
