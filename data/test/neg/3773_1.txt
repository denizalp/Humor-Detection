the people here we so nice. And the AC kept the room cold enough to hang meat.  But....\n\nthe cleaning lady needs to wear a hairnet.  The first night there was a long black hair on the tub.  It wasn't in a spot that forced me to deal with it, so I left it.  When I came back that night, the hair was gone, however it multiplied and turned into a hair hanging from the lampshade near the bed, and one one the sink.  \n\nDespite that, I would still stay here.   Everyone was so kind.
