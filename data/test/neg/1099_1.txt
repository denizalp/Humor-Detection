Unfortunately did not get inside the main museum as it was booked the night I came. However, I did get to see Brilliant, the evening experience the museum puts on across the street, which was incredible. Cutting edge projectors make the old signs come to life while serenading you with the sights and sounds of yesteryear. Neon and signage are ordinarily not my thing, but this is a must see.
