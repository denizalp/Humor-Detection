Our waitress Cindy was one of the slowest I have ever seen. Restaurant was dead maybe 4 tables and she only had 3 of them. This was the first time here in Vegas and it will be the last time if there service is this crappy. \nBeware if you have a lot of time on your hands. \nI would hate to see it if they were busy.
