This was soooo good! Get the Churro French Toast, it was absolutely delicious! We sat in the outside area near casino and the smoke didn't bother me at all. It was the morning, on a Tuesday, but I'm usually sensitive to the smoky smell in casinos and I didn't smell any while eating. Great service and really good food!!
