We went to brunch here and did not find it exceptional. It has all the basics of any other buffet. The pictures are deceiving because almost all the stuff I really wanted are only for the dinner option. As far as the quality of the food, I'm giving it 3 out of 5 because about half of the food had that bland *buffet* taste and the rest was restaurant quality food. For the price of $42, I was expecting most of it to be higher quality. The desserts were really good and had a big selection though!
