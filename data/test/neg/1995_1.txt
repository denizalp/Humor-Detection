When we got to the location it didn't appear to be the newest or most eye catching. But we arrived for our flight time, watched the instructional video, then took flight with Josh as the instructor. It was so much fun!!! A one of a  kind experience for my wife and I. Had a blast!! Definitely try try this one while you're in Vegas!!
