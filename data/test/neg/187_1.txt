Reasonably priced with large portions, especially for the sashimi.\n\nWe had the adedashi tofu, a few rolls and sashimi, all which was very tasty and well done.  The only thing that wasn't excellent was the chicken karage, which was a little too breaded tasting heavily fried.  \n\nOverall a good experience.  Make reservations tho, since it is a small restaurant.
