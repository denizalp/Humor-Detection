I went to this place for lunch today with my friend. She had been there before. Everything sounded great to me but I ended up ordering the turkey spinach artichoke sandwich and Chipotle chicken salad. Both are amazing!! The pesto and melted cheese made the sandwich nice and creamy. The dressing for the salad was served on the side which I like. My meal also came with a bonus chocolate dipped strawberry. I would have given 4 stars if my strawberry was larger than a nickel. Haha
