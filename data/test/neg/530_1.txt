They are the best. Was able to book an appointment right away. They came to my house. Went over my medical conditions and got the iv in with no problem. \n\nI enjoyed getting to know their staff. They were professional, kind, patient and really fun! I'm looking forward to many more treatments. \n\nWhether you need iv hydration for personal reasons or for medical conditions like mine, I highly recommend if you need iv hydration at home. They are priced right and super convenient to have it done in the comfort of your home.
