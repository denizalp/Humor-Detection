Good food, great drinks.\n\nTacos are always fresh and the ingredients are awesome.  I enjoy coming here.  Atmosphere is on the louder side but it's nothing annoying.  I love the drinks here, strong!  Brooke (AKA Cobra) is an amazing bartender.  She can make anything for you.  Overall, one of the best spot in NoDa.
