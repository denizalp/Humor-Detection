The lunch specials are great. For under $12 with tax u get a few options on lunch menu\nplus a spring roll, soup AND sofa pop! \nOnly prob I have is with their pho, they totally skimp on the meat. I ordered the \"special\" which typically comes with all the \"meats\". I may have gotten couple slices of beef, 2 sprigs of tripe, a half slice of tendon and half, yes half a measly little beef ball!\n\nOther than them skimping out on the meats in their pho, the many other dishes I've tried there are tasty and decent portioned.
