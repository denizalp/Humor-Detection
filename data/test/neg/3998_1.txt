Our go-to date night restaurant, delicious every time. We usually split the gorgonzola slaw (yum) and a pizza. The Quattro pizza is outstanding if you're a cheese lover. Great atmosphere, great location. Hope to come here many more times- we are even thinking about having our wedding rehearsal dinner here!
