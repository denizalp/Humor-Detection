This is easily the best gelato place I've been to. They have some great flavors like toasted marshmallow which taste like a marshmallow straight from the camp fire. Also cookie butter and Guinness like the beer and Irish Cream. They taste just like the real thing. It's the most creamy gelato I've had. They let you try any flavor you like. They also have shakes that you can create. Place is always busy and sometimes there is a line but well worth the wait.
