Where to begin....the constant flooding, the fire alarms, or the continued degradation of a \"luxury\" apartment. Listen, if this place was half the price I still wouldn't live here. \n\nThe fitness center has been closed since it flooded in January and the garage door has been broken more often than not over the last year. The parking lot was a joke this past winter and the overall cleanliness of the building is just not what you would expect.
