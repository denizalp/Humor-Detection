AMAZING FLORIST!   They did our wedding about a year ago and the arrangements were GORGEOUS and the prices were great!  Then today I ordered a birthday bouquet for my little sister online (because I moved to California a few months ago) and it was delivered 20 MINUTES LATER!  I was so surprised!  What a great company.  Incredibly pleased. :)
