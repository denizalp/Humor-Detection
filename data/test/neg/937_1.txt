I went to see Mark for an issue with a tight and cramping calf. It was so bad that I couldn't run and I kept waking up with excruciating pain. He quickly diagnosed the problem as stemming from my hip-which really surprised me. I had therapy on my hip and leg and the issue cleared up within a week. They saw me right away unlike other places where you have to wait forever to get an appointment. I've since gone back for a shoulder issue and Mark fixed that too. I highly recommend Mark and Landmark Physical Therapy.
