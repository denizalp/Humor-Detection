I had a really great experience at this salon. The receptionist was so sweet, and got me in for a last minute blow dry right after I walked in.\n\nAlan was my stylist and he did a wonderful job on my blow dry. He was very nice and professional. I have fine, frizzy hair, and he did such a beautiful and thorough job blowing it out. I also appreciated the fact he was so fast. \n\nI would definitely recommend Alan to anyone who needs a great style while they're on vacation!
