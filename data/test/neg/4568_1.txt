I got an order to go. 60 dollars worth. Although, it does say that fried foods could take up to 45 minutes, it took an hour and it wasn't exactly busy until I had already been there for 30 minutes. Could be better. Staff was nice but there seems to be only one cook for the entire place. It's a little old inside and could probably use renovation but since I won't be back, I won't even know.
