One of those great little task-specific indie stores, as unlike Joann's as you can get.  Large selection of fabric and buttons you don't find anywhere else, and well-organized service -- you stand in line to have your fabric measured and your buttons counted and then a cashier takes your money.  Found some terrific buttons for ten cents each button-diving in the loose button bin, and my niece found some wonderful rayon fabric at a quarter what she pays for it at home.  A pleasant experience all around.
