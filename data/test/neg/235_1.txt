I'm not big on Mexican food, but when I want a good lunch I go to Fiesta Jalapenos. You can always rely on them for good, filling food. I personally really like the lunch #7 & 17. They're fast, filling, and tasty! Plus $6.99 for a lunch, you really can't go wrong. \n\nPlus I'm a huge fan of the cheesy decor they have going on, it puts me in the festive mood :)
