As soon as I walked in I was welcomed by an extra friendly cashier. If it wasn't for him I would have gave this place 1 star. It's small, packed, loud, with no outlets to plug in. On the bright side, the WiFi was working. I ordered a black dark roast coffee because there was a TV screen that kept advertising it as \"Rich flavor\" but it tasted more diluted than the usual Timmy's.
