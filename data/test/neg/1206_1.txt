3 stars because it's just OK, but hopefully they'll improve. They should get rid of the TVs, or at least only use them when there's a game on. No one wants to watch a 24-hour news channel during a Saturday lunch.\n\nI asked for my burger medium-rare and it was well done, but it tasted fine aside from that. I'm excited to hear that they have Mancini's bread, so I'll be back sometime to try one of their sandwiches.
