This is a great family owned restaurant and they provide very personal service.  They recognize their returning customers and you leave with a full belly.  Their food is homemade, authentic and they have excellent deli options.  I've had the reuben and the matzo ball soup.  My bff is Jewish and nobody can top her matzo ball soup...but this place gives her a run for her money...but please don't tell her that. :)
