Stayed on the 3rd floor during our honeymoon. The service was all around exquisite, very detail oriented and catered to our every need. Concierge took care of everything from reservations to helping is locate lost luggage and bringing it to us at the airport. The included breakfast is the best hotel breakfast I've ever had and the entire restaurant\/bar is lovely. 10\/10
