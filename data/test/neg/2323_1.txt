Questionable layout. Not obvious distinction between takeout and eatin. Lots of old plaques on walls very outdated (2001), saying best cheap eats. My gf and I paid over$30 for 2 bfast bagels and coffee and oj. Not all staff are friendly. My gf asked for restroom directions. The cashier grimaced and acted like it was the most ridiculous request in world. I get more personality from the TSA at sky harbor. Tables are dirty.Ill avoid this place.
