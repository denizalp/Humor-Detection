Probably one of the better buffets in vegas. I like the fact that they make made-to-order lattes and cappucinos...ask them to add baileys for a lil' kick! \nI love their desserts! But then again, I'm a sweets person, so I might be a lil' biased! There creme brulee is so good and you must try their ice cream. \nI've been there for their seafood buffet before and I like the fact that it was fresh and the waiters were so helpful in bringing us wet-naps and stuff.
