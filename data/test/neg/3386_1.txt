We had the best spa day yesterday!  We bought the couples retreat and had such a lovely experience.  Larissa and Rachel were our therapists and they were amazing!!  They were so kind and professional, but more importantly they give fantastic body scrubs and massages.  Larissa literally fixed my back which has been aching for quite some tine.  This is a wonderful escape for both men and woman.  We will certainly be back!
