Love this place. Broth is made in house and is legit. If you're sick, come get some of this goodness to help you get better. If you come to this location in China Town get ready for a wait time. This place is popular for a reason, and this particular location is small. Their Henderson location **check to see if they're done with their renovations** is a little bigger, but I've still had to wait there as well. \nIf you understand that wait times = good food then enjoy this ramen house. I know I do!
