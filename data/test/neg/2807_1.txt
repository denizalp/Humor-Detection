I saw a lot of good reviews and thought I checked it out.  I was quite disappointed.   The crab legs were small and soggy.  I thought there'd be more food selections.  The serving areas were dirty and didn't see anyone cleaning them.  With that high of a price, I thought there would be more seafood selections; good thing we had coupons for buy 1 get 1 off...still not worth the 1\/2 price.  The brunch Buffet at the Wynn was better for cheaper.
