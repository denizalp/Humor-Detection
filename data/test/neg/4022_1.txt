This place is a great find! The food was really good and tasted great! The service was excellent very attentive service. I would highly recommend this place for breakfast. I had a skillet with sausage eggs and potatoes and also the biscuits and gravy. Flavor was excellent. The place is small so there may be a little bit of a wait but it's worth it.
