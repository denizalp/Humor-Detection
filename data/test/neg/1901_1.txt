The was my first time coming here. The place did not disappoint. The hot and juicy sauce that they use is very tasty. If you're a first timer my advise is to wear a t shirt unless you don't care if you ruin a shirt. It can get messy since plates aren't given. \nI would take half a star off if I could because the shrimp was over cooked but other than that it was great. Will definitely be back.
