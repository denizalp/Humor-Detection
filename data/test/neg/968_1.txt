The breakfast here is great. Nice size portions, maybe a little too much food for me, but my husband loves it. We have gone here on several occasions with three young children. They always accomodate our large parties very quickly. Good children's menu. The place is nice, but not so nice that you feel like your kids can't make some noise. Love the french toast. Waitstaff is pleasant. Only complaint is that the tables are a bit close together, you feel a little like you are sitting on top of people. But, we have always gone during breakfast rush.
