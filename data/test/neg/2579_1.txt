I went to one of Brianna's makeup classes and she is amazing!! She was able to hold a class with multiple girls but also help you customize in areas that would fit you the best. She was super helpful in explaining why some things worked and others didn't. I learned so much from her in the class and I couldn't wait to host another and learn more! I highly recommend hosting a makeup class with Brianna!! I promise that you are your girl friends will have a great night walk away looking fabulous!! :)
