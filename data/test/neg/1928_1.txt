My iced coffee was good. The boy helping me couldn't tell me if the donuts contained milk of eggs. One of the employees was sitting down and talking to someone else the other kid that helped me when i left got on his phone. All awhile literally there were puddles of coffee on the floor throughout the store. I've never seen this before.  They weren't even concerned about cleaning it up.
