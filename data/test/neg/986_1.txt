I have been at dicks around 5 times and it never disappoints. I shared the blueberry pancakes and the carne adovado with gf the first time and it was so good that we couldn't get ourselves to order anything else there  yet. Friends have tried diner there and professed equally good reviews.  And the service is top notch
