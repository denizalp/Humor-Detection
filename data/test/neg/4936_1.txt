not great, but not terrible. sandwichs are great but wasn't a huge fan of the pizza. honestly with such a verity i could have just ordered the wrong one. also the wait time for food is a bit too long considering how empty the place was. willing to give them another try but as of now the best thing about this place is the staff. they were amazing!
