Pretty decent sushi. Fish was definitely fresh! However the rolls didn't stay together very well. So they all fell apart. One thing I didn't like they don't have sashimi on their menu. They have about two options that are essentially a sashimi dish but I don't want to pay $14-18 and get 8 of the same fish. I want variety. Restraint had a decent amount of people in there but they all ordered boxes instead of sushi....
