Best Sushi restaurant in Vegas! I'm Japanese and I'm picky Sushi girl. \nBefore my civil wedding, I ate dinner with husband friend couple :) We are from LA and not super familiar around in Vegas, but our choice was correct!!!! Everyone was friendly, and menu is all good ;) I super recommend and I want to go again!!!!
