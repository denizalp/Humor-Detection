As soon as you walk in you get hit with a citrus smell, so refreshing! I had the Watermelon Basil Lemonade, which was amazing! If you do not like the drink they offer to adjust it or even remake it.\n\nI had been driving by here for weeks until\nI finally made the stop to try this place, I was definitely not disappointed. \n\nTheir mason jars are so cute & you get a .50 cent discount when you bring it in with you.
