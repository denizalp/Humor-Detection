Granted that it's still relatively one of the newer clubs, I understand the long lines. However, out of all clubs they definitely pack it way more than the maximum occupancy level. There is no room to dance or breathe - it's horrible! It's a nice venue that has a hip hop room but like everyone said it is WAY TOO packed to actually enjoy your time.
