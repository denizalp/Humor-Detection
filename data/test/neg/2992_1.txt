Why is this place so busy? The  server was far too busy to provide good service even if she wanted to. Burgers were okay. Halibut was over fried with a heavy batter and a lot of grease. Yukon Gold fires (oh that sounds special) were just warm and I suspect had been sitting around for a while before being plated. Not a cheap place either.\nSummertime and the backyard BBQ has been a much better experience in the past. We will consider returning then.
