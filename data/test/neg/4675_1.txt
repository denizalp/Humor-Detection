Shakes with alcohol? pumpkin spice and crown maple?! YES, PLEASE!! Came here for a shake and stayed for a burger and fries.  All were yum-mazng!!  The billionaire burger was cray cray, but delish.  My sunrise burger was on-point....and sweet potato fries and natural cut fries were good too.\n\nThat lobster mac and cheese though....along with the alcoholic desserts are what's going to bring me back!!
