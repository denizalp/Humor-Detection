This sandwich shop is very unique. The menu is a bit different from traditional shops. I had a Ruben and it was a lot different from a traditional Ruben. It was nice and crisp, lightly buttered, sauerkraut wasn't overpowering of the other flavors and was tender yet crisp, the corned beef was very tender and palatable. The staff was extremely friendly and I even had a conversation about sandwiches with one of the cooks. Atmosphere is very pleasant and inviting. I plan to return many times and explore a few of the other interesting items on the menu.
