Pizza and pasta were both very good. \nUnlike a lot of places we did not have to wait. Pizza goes right in the oven and comes right out. \nMeatballs were firm and yet not hard. Very tasty. \nChicago style pizza was very good. Has pepperoni and meatballs and was heavy (as it should be!). \nEggplant parmigiana was good but not excellent. \nPepperoni pinwheel was very good.
