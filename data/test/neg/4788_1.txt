If you are thinking about trying iLoveKickboxing then stop thinking and do it already!  Prior to signing up for a trial I never participated in a group fitness program ever.  Now I don't know what I would do without it.  iLoveKickboxing pushes me harder and gives me a 100% better workout than I would do on my own. Also on top of the work out it is a whole community of supporters and you leave feeling great every time you go and can't wait to go back.
