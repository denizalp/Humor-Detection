Tried this restaurant based on the recommendations on Yelp. It was OK. Was expecting better. I think they charge higher prices than they should for what they offer. Probably because they are in Gilbert and know people will pay those prices. \n\nTheir food is good enough I would eat it again, just nothing out of the ordinary and portions are too small for what they charge.
