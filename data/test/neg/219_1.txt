Below was my previous review couple years ago but since then soyo has gone downhill in a big way - food now tastes half-done\/overdone lacking any attractive characteristics.  It often tastes old\/dry\/rubbery or overly mushy and not very clean (think spoiled cooking oil flavor). Service is rude and perfunctory at best. It's sad to see a good restaurant deteriorating this way. \n\n\nGreat korean food, unique contemporary menu at a very reasonable price!  They have this great beer - Morimoto soba - a must try if you like dry but fruity beer.
