We've been dining here for years and Talavera still grows on me. Love the view, and it's nice to dine in the company of people who still understand concepts like decorum and dressing for dinner.\n\nI've never seen anyone here make fun of other diners, bring a bunch of loud children, drink to excess, look a mess and pretend it's everybody else's problem, or call negative attention to themselves in any way.\n\nTalavera is a slightly different experience for me every time. It's very special.
