This place is always awesome. This experience was not a good one. Our waitress Sam was either very busy or forgettable.\n\nWe asked for napkins, silverware and another beer. Before our food was delivered. We received our food, ate it and she never came back to check on us. She came at the end and said anything else I can help you with. She forgot about our napkins and beer.\n\nThen 10 minutes go by and still hasn't brought me back my credit card. I had to ask the manager. I received it in a short period of time.
