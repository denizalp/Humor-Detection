Nothing special, nothing bad--just a decent little taqueria.  I tried a chicken taco and a taco al pastor (spicy pork), and the chicken taco stood out as particularly flavorful.  Nothing was greasy at 10:30 AM when I stopped for \"breakfast\"; they were just frying the chips at that hour.  Prices are definitely low--I got out for less than $4 including a tall glass of horchata.
