First time playing here while I was visiting family from LA.  Course was in nice condition and weather was also good too. Layout has a scenic view but the undulations are killer. Greens were punched in April, so note to self to come after they cured because it was like putting on cauliflower. Not much of a clubhouse to hang out after our round, but at least the breakfast sandwich was good enough for on the go.
