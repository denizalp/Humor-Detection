1.) Food is DELICIOUS and extremely well priced. We usually eat very fine dining, and I was shocked at the prices of the food here for how delightful it was. \n2.) Bartenders and servers are GREAT! You can either come here for just drinks, snacks, or full blown dinner and they are extremely helpful.\n3.) LOCATION is incredible. Beautiful rooftop restaurant with outside patio, floor to ceiling windows, great lighting.\n\nAll around fantastic restaurant! Favorite so far in Charlotte
