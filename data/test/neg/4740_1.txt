Frequent customer here especially on Monday's for military discount. Always a great selection and decent turnover of merchandise. Clean open well displayed store. Friendly staff. Great finds to be found just waiting here. Where else can you buy $50-60 jeans for $5.96 that's before discount. Decent furniture and vintage records as well. Worth the trip better than the Goodwill across the street !
