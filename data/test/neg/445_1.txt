I was craving Hawaiian BBQ and thought I'd try this place. Service was great and the food came out quickly. That is a plus! The chicken was tender and flavorful. The shrimp was \"okay\" - nothing to write home about. The macaroni salad was average. Let's face it - part of the Hawaiian BBQ experience is the awesome macaroni salad and this didn't cut it. It was dry and tasteless. They didn't have napkins available nor did they have sauces available other than the prepackaged soy sauce. Meh. I'll stick with my regular place from now on.
