EVERYTHING  about this bar is amazing!!!\n\nHappy hour is until 8pm - wine and beer around $3-4\nFull of childhood games to play whole you are getting hammered - operation, hungry hungry hippos, sock'em bop'em and tons of others\nBartender is the friendliest ever!!! And very knowledgeable\nBar food is limited but absolutely perfect to snack on.\n\nI am from jersey and I got wasted for $45. Best ever! I will return anytime I am in the area.
