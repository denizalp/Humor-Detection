Skip's Puppy Poo-Poo Pick-up is a great company and value. We have been using them for over a year and if there is any word that can describe them other than awesome it's consistent. They work with you on your schedule and always send out a text the day before they come.\n\nIf you have multiple dogs or work a lot or have simply thought, man, I don't want to pick up dog poop, (or even go in the backyard in our case) Skip is the company to call.\n\nThanks guys!
