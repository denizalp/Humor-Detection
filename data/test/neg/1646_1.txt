This place sure is yummy. I was introduced here by a regular and was informed that I should be ready to eat some good sushi. My friend sure did not disappoint!\nThe place has a neat idea in which you \"buy\" a set of chopsticks and everytime you go in, you get a discount.\nMy memory isn't so great with all of the names on the menu but basically they have an AYCE menu which isn't too shabby. Eat like you've never eaten before!
