Excellent service!!  I had just moved into a new home and wanted a rekeying of all locks. I called around and found prices varied quite a bit \"depending\" on this, that or another.  Lockaid USA gave be a flat rate and said he'd be at my house within an hour. He showed up sooner, did all of the work, was extremely professional and best of all, no surprises. He charged me a flat rate as promised and guaranteed his work.   Zero complaints and I highly recommend.
