The area the bakery is in can be a bit creepy and the parking lot needs to be repaved but it is so worth the trip! Their cheese danish is to die for -- one of my favorites of all time, and every cake I've ever gotten here has been delicious. The bakery is also quite nice and colorful inside, so bonus points for good decor!
