Can't say enough positive things about our experience with this company. Quality work at a fair and reasonable price. We just had wood look tile installed throughout our home, and are very happy with the results. Misty was easy to work with, Luis and the demolition crew were fantastic and Guy and Michael installed the tile flawlessly throughout the house. Professional, always on time, great communication and trustworthy. We are so glad the found this company and will definitely use them again.
