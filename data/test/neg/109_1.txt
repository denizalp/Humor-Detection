Once you get past the extremely long wait, yummy food awaits you.  I thought the food was tasty, especially the grilled vegetables but I thought the portions were kind of small overall.  The small grilled vegetables was supposed to feed two as a side but I could have devoured that thing myself in addition to the small flank steak plate I ordered.  If I ever visit Pittsburgh again, I would definitely like to come back and try the asado plate\/steak sampler.
