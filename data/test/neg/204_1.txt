Service here was great!  The hostess (even tho you sit on your own) was very friendly and helpful since it was my first time.  The udon was pretty good although the broth was not piping hot which is how it should be. It was like warm.  The tempura (I get it's already pre-made) was cold.  I wished it was made to order.  But other then that everything was pretty good.
