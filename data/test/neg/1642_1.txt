I love her! My family has gone to her for years. She saved my daughter's life by following her gut, and beyond the obvious tests given, and helping her find Thyroid cancer.  Dr Pingol has a great staff. While you are there you are her only concern. She is not like most doctors who give you an assembly line feel. She remembers me and genuinely cares about me and my health.
