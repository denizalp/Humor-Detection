We ordered several regular sized beef and chicken empanadas as well as the corn pie.  We placed our order as take-out and all the items were bagged cold from the refrigerator.  They provided heating instructions after we asked, and I assume the same empanadas are reheated in their ovens for the eat-in orders.  The empanadas reheated fine, but we found the filling a bit bland.  The corn pie also reheated fine and was different than what I had expected.  It was more of a cream of corn casserole, but maybe that is how it was supposed to be.
