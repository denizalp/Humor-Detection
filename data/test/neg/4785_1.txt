Came here because my husband saw that they have mussels in pernod sauce.  He was not disappointed.  A huge bowl of mussels, a glass of wine and live music and he left very happy!   I had the mushroom risotto which was delicious- well seasoned and a good portion.  We also started with the foie gras- excellent.  We didn't have room to have dessert, but based on the ones we saw around us, they all looked very good.
