After a few hours wandering and being touristy on the strip, we were questioning if we'd be able to find a truly local dinner spot in Las Vegas. Luckily we decided to head downtown earlier than originally planned and found this local hot spot. I felt immediately at home among the beards, thick-rimmed glasses and flannel diners. The food was delicious, the recipes unique and the drinks on point.
