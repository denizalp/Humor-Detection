My boyfriend and I come to this location often(baseline).We love Cafe Rio, the food is delicious. However as of late, the staff always seems to be in a shit mood and is very rude. Every time we ask for extra sour cream the employees acts as if we are cutting their paycheck in half. We know sour cream costs extra. Cafe Rio please hire people that want to work and not people that act like doing their job is such an inconvenience.
