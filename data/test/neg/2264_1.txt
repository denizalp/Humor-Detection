I fell for Big Daddy's Burger Bar right away. Another reviewer said Big Daddy's is the way to get out-of-town friends to visit again. As a visitor, I must agree. I definitely want to return on my next trip to Charlotte. \n\nEverything here was delicious. I enjoyed the Sam I Am burger with fried egg, rosemary ham, American cheese and pesto. YUM! The sweet potato fries were perfection. The strawberry milkshake made me want to sing with delight. \n\nThe friendly service and excellent patio atmosphere were cherries on top of a great dining experience.
