My FAVORITE buffet in Vegas! \n\nThe variety is not as big as other buffets, but the quality of the food makes up for it! For the food you get, the price is great! Prime rib, crab legs, risotto, lamb, asian food, pizza, cheese & crackers, chocolate covered strawberries, macarons, gelato, shrimp and grits, etc etc etc. Everything is on point!\n\nI love and hate the concept of portioning out the food in little dishes. Yes it's cute, but sometimes I don't want to try that much and I feel bad for wasting the food :(
