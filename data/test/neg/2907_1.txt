My wife wanted to try the crispy fried ears but they dont have it anymore :( but its one of the best restaurant ive been to in las vegas. We ordered kale salad, dates, chicken and carot cake soo yummy! I cant think of any negative things to say. They deserve more than five stars for their great service. My wife and I left the place with a happy tummy and a happy face :) i would definitely come back!
