Maybe I hyped it up too much in my head and my expectations were too high after hearing my friends rave about it. There were definitely many different genres of songs that the show incorporates - new and old, rock to rap to video games. Loved the fact that they also had quiet a lot of audience interaction - some lucky ladies even get to be pulled on stage. I just wish that there was more break dancing and acrobatic flips, cartwheels, and tumbles. They only had break dancing and acrobatics for like 1 song.
