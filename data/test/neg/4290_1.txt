I love that music and art make up such a big part of Loop's identify, but there have been several times that I've walked out because they're playing incredibly loud heavy metal music with lots of feedback and distortions. Heavy metal for a music shop? Totally fine and cool. Heavy metal for a coffee shop where I'm trying to relax, enjoy my beverage and maybe get some work done? No way.
