This restaurant offers excellent authentic Mexican food, drinks and service! We enjoyed everything we ordered from the margaritas to the queso dip to the fish tacos and burrito. It is in a hidden location which is the only downfall. Tucked in a business park\/building. If you like Mexican food please give this place a try you won't be disappointed. We will definitely be back!
