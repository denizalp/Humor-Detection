What started out as a tenuous relationship has become a welcome stop each morning.  Friendly and becoming efficient in their delivery.  Still a high turn over at the registers so things can get lost - I know now when it is someone new to be VERY PATIENT with them.  Remind them of my cup discount, always check to see if they used my rewards discount (they forget it most of the time).  But all in all it is a good location to stop in to get coffee...
