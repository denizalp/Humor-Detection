Vegas has plethora of fine dining and it can be really hard to choose.  We decided to go here based on the Yelp reviews. We weren't disappointed.  The space is very seductive with a view of the gorgeous pool at The Wynn. The wine selection is amazing and everything we ordered was outstanding.  We didn't have a single disappointing morsel.  We will definitely go back.
