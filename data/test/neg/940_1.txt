Great quick bite in the GTA. Portions are huge for lunch, be sure to go on an empty stomach or go for dinner. There is no specific \"lunch\" menu so the portion and price is the same for dinner. I tried the carbonara pork tender which I loved. Would recommend that dish. The carbonara complemented the dish well with a hint of spice.\n\nTip: free pop when you check in yelp!
