Food is eh. Service is TERRIBLE! They are rude and don't care about customers. Asked if they had more carrots because they were out in the front the lady went in the back and came out 15 minutes later because another employee told her I was there. I asked again about the carrots and she just said \"we don't have any\" she didn't even look!! Thanks for telling me and wasting my time! The armados a few blocks down is so much better!! I don't know how this place stays open for business.
