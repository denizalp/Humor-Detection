My friend has a timeshare here so I never have to pay a red cent when I come into town.  I love the dual two bedroom, kitchen, bathroom options.  I've never had any complaints all of the numerous times that I have stayed here.  It's close enough to the strip to take a cab, and also offers the convenience of an onsite ABC store (shhh...that sells alcohol) Subway, and a restaurant that I've never ventured to so I forgot the name.
