Once again wowed by ginko and the Dante experience.  Quentin and company accommodated our reservation of 9 with the best service.  It was like being a guest at a friend's house.  We were able to sample some of Coda's nightlife and cocktails next door before sitting down to a wonderful meal,  with great friends,  and a birthday dessert that made everyone smile.  Ginko is our favorite place for sushi,  and it's because of the food and friendliness.
