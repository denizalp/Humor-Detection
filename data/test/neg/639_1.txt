Went on a Sunday night for industry night. Started a little slow with music I wasnt into...house\/techno. There were moments of hip hop\/songs that I knew, but they were rare...\n\nIt's a good thing they had discounted tables and I drank a lot or else I would have had to give them 3 stars...\n\n\nWent on a Saturday night and LOVED it though.
