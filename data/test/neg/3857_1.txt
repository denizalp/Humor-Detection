Good and cheap Cuban food. they charge $5 per plate. You can't eat Cuban food for  $5 in Las Vegas. The only thing is you don't know what they'll have each day since the menu is not updated on Facebook. Sometimes the food is a little salty but other times it's good just like my mother in law cooking.
