Fantastic! We sat at the bar and let Helen create an impromptu tasting menu for us. We had no idea what we were going to be served and thoroughly enjoyed everything. This restaurant really knows how to pair flavors together. The duck, the lobster, the scallops, the dessert...all tasty. Well worth it even though we sat at the bar. Would eat there again.
