POOR MANAGEMENT - It will take forever to be served & the food is ok. We thought it would be different & gave it another try - it wasn't! Had to chase down the Manager after 20min. At least may be the table beside us will be waited on after we told him they had yet to be served too. Not one of the better restaurants (for service) in Huntersville. We left & ended up at LaUnica - service is the best around along with great food!
