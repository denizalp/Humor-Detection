I love SOHO Chicken + Whiskey! It is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland.  The chicken is the best that I have ever had, and there are so many different sides that you can get with it.  Although there aren't a ton of options for vegetarians, chicken is in the name of the restaurant, so it should be expected.  The place can is a little small and get pretty busy, but it is well worth the wait.  You are also able to make reservations, and the staff is always extremely accommodating.
