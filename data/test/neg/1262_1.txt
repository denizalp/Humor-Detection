Please don't go, I got BBQ pork and vegetables and sweet and sour soup with fried rice, and a crab rangoon. Let's just say the only thing I wanted to continue to eat was the rangoon... everything sucked, the pork tasted like it was a day old microwaved chicken and the veggies were way over cooked. Let's not even talk about the soup just horrible.
