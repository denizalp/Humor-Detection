Excellent service. Drinks were good and decent prices. Food was served hot and fresh. I had the chicken breast and I ate the whole thing. My friend did not like her French dip(had too much cheese) and they were nice enough took that off her tab. Chill spot to go with a few friends to have a drink and a small meal. Has TVs around to watch fights and sports. I like it.
