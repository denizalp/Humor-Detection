people be trippin.\n\nthis place is really yummy.  I eat here at least once a week.  They give a good amount of meat and it is very tasty.\n\nAs an asian, they got the flavors right.  I usually go for #4 Combo - chicken, beef and pork.  so tasty.  I don't know why other people don't like it here.  Maybe this food appeals more to an asian palate.   Asians unite for hawaiian BBQ!
