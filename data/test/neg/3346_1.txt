I really enjoy coming to this place!!!! I use to drive by it daily and never notice it, until a friend recommended going here for their $5 burger on Monday nights. Everything here is awesome! The design of the interior is very classy and the way it goes from indoor to outdoor is so cool! Food is great and staff is wonderful! Although ordering from the regular price menu is a little pricey but I'm sure it's all worth it!!!
