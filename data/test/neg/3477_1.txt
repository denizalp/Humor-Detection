followed Philip here from his place on the west side, and I live in Cave Creek which alone should say something about how awesome he is. He's famous for his work with the ladies (check out his website phildoeshair) but does a great job with balding men such as myself. I didn't see the salon before Deborah took over but it appears nearly all the negative reviews are prior to her running the place.
