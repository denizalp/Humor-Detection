By far, the best Indian food I've had the pleasure to eat!  Perfect, beautiful nan, delicious chutneys, carefully and lovingly spiced main dishes.  Excellent and attentive waitstaff.  The portions were large enough that we each had enough leftovers for lunch the next day.  Fantastic -- we'll be back!!
