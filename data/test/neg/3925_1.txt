This is definitely the cherry on top of a true vegas experience. My girls and I were escorted inside, comped drinks, and offered a room at the Encore. How amazing is that? The staff is fabulous, the crowd is down to party, the pool is gorgeous (watch out, my friend got thrown inside lol), and the music is seriously off the hook. I was dancing on poles and on pool beds all night lol. This is a great way to end a Vegas trip..you must, must, must come to this venue!
