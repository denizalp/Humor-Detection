Need to come here more often,  excellent rotisserie chicken, juicy and hot with awesome sides.  Dill potato salad is super creamy and baked beans are saucy with a hint of green pepper are my favorite ones, plenty more and some daily options.  Nice bar, this visit is way over due for a great eatery on a street with options, this is one of the best.  Cornbread muffins, you need more than one.
