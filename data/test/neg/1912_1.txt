For an after work spot or a steak and seafood night out, Eddie Merlot's is as good an option as any. High quality meat, incredible preparation, decedent desserts, and flavorful appetizers \/ sides. Large wine list, friendly service, and upbeat atmosphere in the heart of the business district round out the positives. Highly recommended!
