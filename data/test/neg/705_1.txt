Came here during a visit to the areafor my daughter's lax tournament. We stayed at a nearby hotel and decided to go here based on the reviews. \n\nI had wings. Half greek, half medium buffalo.  They were good although the roasted Greek could have been more flavorful. Daughter had the gyro which looked good. \n\nThe food was solid, they had a good local beer selection, reasonable prices and live music in the patio. If we lived close by we would definitely go back again.
