I have always been fascinated with anything that is Japanese. I recently found this Japanese Salon that is truly a \"standout\". It felt like i was given a VIP treatment! I can't emphasize enough their attention to details & excellent customer service. If you want a moment of relaxation, you may consider booking with Salon Chandelier soon :) btw, yes u get free Japanese candies :) awesome team! Shin was my hairstylist and he's exceptional! Kudos! Sugo-i! Kawaii!
