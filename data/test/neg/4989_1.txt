I have lived here for quite some time . I love living here !!! I have been at other apartments that are not well-kept up :( this place is well-kept up the maintenance men do their jobs very quickly and well and are very friendly . The manager here is very polite and respectful and very helpful! I would recommend living here to anyone!!!! I feel very safe with my family living here:)
