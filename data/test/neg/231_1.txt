Came here for the first time since a location opened up close to home. We tried the spicy karrage and gyoza. Both pretty good appetizers - gyoza was really yummy\n\nHad the spicy garlic pork ramen and original pork ramen. The broth on the original pork was rich but very very bland - even the seasoning in the shaker didn't help. The noodles itself were yummy though! And everything else was good\n\nNot the best ramen I've ever had but I would come back again to try the other ramen bowls - hope the others have more taste !
