My favorite BBQ spot in AZ. I usually get the beef brisket with macaroni and cheese and waffle fries. The meat is cooked really well: it is almost always tender and juicy. They also have good variety of BBQ sauces, from standard to sweet then spicy.\n\nIf you're really hungry you can get the sampler plate for around $11 though, that could feed two people in my opinion.\n\nDon't let the outside fool you, this place is great and there is plenty of room for overflow in the back.
