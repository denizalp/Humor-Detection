I usually see Amie at the Eastern location but I was in a bind and since my job was close by Genesis was able to get me in right away. She continued to keep the shape of my eyebrows and we both agreed we need to grow them out a little more. If you are in the area and want a knowledgeable eye brow person see Genesis at the N. Stephanie location!
