This is Streetsville's answer to Celebration Square.  Being a village and all, it is obviously a lot smaller.  However, what I like about it is it's brick road and the sense of community you feel.  \n\nThere's an ice cream shop, a Second Cup, a tailor and all the things you'd expect out of a village square. \n\nThey have yoga, movie nights and salsa dancing during the summer.  It's not a bad place to chill.\n\nAlso, on weekends, there is free parking down Main street in a little lot.
