Mint has an excellent lunch buffet. Delicious chicken tikka Masala or butter chicken is always on the buffet. Naan is included on the buffet and they keep replenishing. Buffet also includes tea found near the bar. Price goes up for lunch on Fridays and weekends but selection does not improve by that much. They are closed on Mondays
