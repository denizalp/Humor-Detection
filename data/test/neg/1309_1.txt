First time there. Food was good but was very disappointed that they ran out of Poblano peppers on a Friday night at 6:00.\n\nOne of the hostesses was very nice when we arrived and the other hostess that sat us down was very rude. The ladies at the bar were very attentive and very nice! I arrived at the bar and was helped immediately and they were busy! Drink was great!! 5 stars for the bar and 2 for the restaurant!
