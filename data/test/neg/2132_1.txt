Came here for a sunday lunch with my family.\nFood was okay but nothing spectacular. The menu was also very standard without any standout items.\nService was super slow... it took about 30m for all our food and our water was never refilled. The place seemed really understaffed.\n\nRestrooms downstairs were very clean and modern...... which is great but it didn't match the pub themed decor in the rest of the restaurant
