The food here is amazing! I tried the goodnight\/good cause burger (has bbq) and it was delicious! Ordered some chili cheese fries and they did not disappoint. The only reason why I have it a 4 star is there's no coke or Pepsi products, which I think is a must with burgers, but to each his own. Other than that this place was great.
