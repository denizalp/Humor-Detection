I really liked the atmosphere, walked in and was greeted by multiple employees! Don't go in if you're in a hurry because this will take awhile. George's has a very large menu and I had the 4 wing meal, these were whole wings with fries and a soda for a fair price! It's a small place located in the first Porktropolis spot and I hope there not jinxed cause they got good down home cooking. I'll be back to sample some more stuff.
