Jamie was working my local Glendale Enterprise location today (she works at this location normally) and I wanted to give her props for her stellar customer service, upbeat, cheerful can-do attitude!  This is why I continue to rent vehicles from Enterprise!  It is all about the people and the attention to detail when delivering that customer service!  Keep up the great work Jamie and thank you for hooking me up with an awesome weekend rental!  2019 Jeep Cherokee with just 30 miles on the car, Nice!!
