This place is nasty. Nothing seems appetizing and I came in hungry and honestly mc donalds even tastes better than this place. Not worth the $32.41 I paid for 2 people I only ate 1 plate and didnt even finish it and neither did my cousin. I don't like giving bad reviews but for the money jusy skip this place.
