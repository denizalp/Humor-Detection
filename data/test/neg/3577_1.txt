The Atomic Buffalo Style buffalo wings are NOT for \nthe faint of heart. There's a reason they have you \nsign a waiver because they are so hot. They have the distinction of having the hottest wings in the valley. Now I know why. Do love their honey mustard and will try their other flavors but never again will I order the Atomic. Ever.
