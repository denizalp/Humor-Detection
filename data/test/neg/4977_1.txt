Chengdu Taste is a small noodle shop nestled between small noodle shops. We ordered the Spicy braised beef noodle which had a nice flavor but was quite oily and not very spicy. \n\nThe dishes come in small ($7.99) or large ($10.99) sizes, the large portions should be ok to share between two people unless you're really hungry.\n\nOrdered: Spicy braised beef noodle\nPrice: $10.99 + tax\nFinal thought: The dish was very oily and in my opinion not very spicy. The broth was nice but i dont think it stands out from the other many noodle places in the area.
