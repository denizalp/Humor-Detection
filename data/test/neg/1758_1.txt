I hope the employees know CPR. I can feel my arteries clogging from the small fry, oh my goodness. The dog was tasty. It was a little different for me being a West Coast kid where I'm not use to my hot dogs crunching when I bite into them. The fries were delicious AND HUGE!!!!! I rolled out happy.\nP.S. I was told the small fry was big, nothing could have prepared me for the size of the small fry. It's huge. Order with caution.
