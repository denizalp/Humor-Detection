I have yet to discover something wrong with this place. I've been here for 2 brunches and a lunch so far, and each time I am more and more impressed with Marche Bacchus. Angelo, the manager, is extremely attentive and thoughtful in all aspects of service.  I am looking forward to trying this place for dinner some time soon. I hear it's amazing with live music to accompany your meal. :)  I'll be back for dinner soon!
