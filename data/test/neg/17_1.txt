I love all Sephoras...  this one is very nice and big.  People are helpful in asking you 3 times if you need help but don't really know what to do when you do ask a question.  I was working a convention and tired of standing on my feet so I asked for a relaxing foot cream.  The man kept pointing me towards scrubs for callused feet.  Not quite the same.  I looked on my own and settled on my usual Soul Owner from Philosophy, so not too helpful.
