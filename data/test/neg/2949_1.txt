We have lived in our home for a year and a half and we have had so many issues it's ridiculous. We try to contact our agent and he always just gives us a temporary fix. Our AC has broken down for the third time and we're left with no choice but to sleep in a 95 degree home. No alternate accommodation, I always have to call the AC company myself to come out because his company is slow with delivery and requests. DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!!!
