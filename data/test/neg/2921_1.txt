Amazing! We were in Vegas for 4 days, and wanted some indian food. The urban turban was the closest to our hotel, so we tried it out for lunch. The buffet was incredible! A good variety of flavors, at an amazing price! So we told everyone else at the convention about it, they went the next day, and totally agreed with us. Then we went again our final evening, for dinner service. Eric, our server, was phenomenal. Great energy, knowledgeable about the foods, and lots of fun. Most of the other employees there were also great!
