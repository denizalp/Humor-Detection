I've been eating here for years. Service can be slow at times, but they are always nice.\nI feel like their sushi has gone down in size and quality recently.  It was never my favorite sushi place but it was good enough, close to home, and the happy hour prices make it a great deal. I don't really have a favorite roll or menu item. Just happy to find a decent sushi place so close to home.
