Really enjoyed the meat-sampler which included pulled pork, ribs and BBQ chicken with two sides for less than $20.  Of course, this included their warm and tasty bread with all-you-can-eat peanuts.  Our server was spot-on with every need we had.  I noticed that a lot of people don't care for the food quality, but I personally didn't have any issues of great importance to speak of.
