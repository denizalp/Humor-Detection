I just had breakfast at Brenda's Kitchen.  The banter was friendly and a bit livelier today. Perhaps it is because the snowbirds have flown the nest and there were a few empty seats: Brenda and the crew had a chance to not only breathe but to talk with everyone.  \n\nI like Brenda's not only for the food, but the entertainment value and that feeling of being in a good friends kitchen, chatting with everyone; comfortable. \n\nI recommend this place but if no new people go, that would mean I could always find a seat.
