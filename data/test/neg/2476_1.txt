Grabbed some breakfast and late lunch here. SOOO GOOD! The croissants were HUGE! As big as my face! It was very delicious. I also ordered a Quiche Lorraine and it was probably one of the best I've had! The drink was average and the gelato was very good. If the prices weren't so high, I'd come here more often.
