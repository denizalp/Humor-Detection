I just recently went to see their show at the Monte Carlo resort and casino,I loved it,it consist of like 12 dancers they have such high energy,they did flips,hip-hop dance,and even brought audience members on stage to participate.they wore these white masksto cover there faces and didn't speak they talked with body gestures and dance,I took my 15 year old and my 9 year old,so it is great for all ages A+++++++++++
