Moved from the east coast and need to find a comfortable place for a Mens Brazilian .   What a great place.. Felt relaxed and not uncomfortable .. As anyone can expect, not totally painless but not bad at all.   My Esthetician , was also the owner - she was very professional at all times. Will be back.
