Terrible show and not worth the $.  We saw several people walk out which we should have done.  The dances were repetitive and our 9 yr old was asking if the show was going to get better which it did not.\n\nThe show rating on yelp is off by a long shot.  The you tube reference by another reviewer is right on target.  Save your $ and watch a real performance.
