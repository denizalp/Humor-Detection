I stopped in for a holster for my handgun and found the employees to be very helpful. Much more personable than I've come across at other local gun shops. They made several recommendations and allowed me to try them out to make sure I was comfortable with my choice. The selection was good and prices were fair. I wouldn't hesitate to return here down the road for my future purchases even though it's a bit out of the way for me. \n\nHighly recommended.
