Horrible since the remodel. I had to wait 10 min for an Iced Tea since they don't have Ice Tea dispensers in the dining room. Then she said they would bring it out. Nope. That's absurd. People waiting everywhere. Not like the good ole days. What a mistake. Maybe they lost the good staff when they closed. Big Mistake.
