Every time I go to Paul Mitchell, I am truly impressed! They have a killer deal on Groupon, which allows me to save money AND get an amazing hair color and style. Everyone (receptionists, teacher and stylists) are very professional and sweet. I love how the stylist works with you to achieve your desired look. The last time, I visited I had Alisa and I would highly recommend her. I came in to get my hair dyed and she advised me to get the Awapuhi treatment. I'm so glad that I did because my hair was incredibly soft.
