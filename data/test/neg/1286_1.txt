Went here for a cigar club event pairing cigars with scotch. We had a great time. The patio was very nice and the food was very good. I had the bistro burger and it was the best burger I had in a while. They could do a little better with the fries they offer. I also had a beef tongue appetizer that was offered as part of the event. I would never have tried it otherwise. It was very good. Good overall experience and I will be going back.
