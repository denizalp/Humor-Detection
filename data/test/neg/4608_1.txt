Delicious, unexpected, exactly what this California couple was hoping to find. Awesome charred octopus with a lovely sauce, then some deviled eggs, yum.... cauliflower with unexpected but delicious lemon.... asparagus with pickles and capers a delight. Then a shared burger and great Malbec rounded out our best meal in 5 days in Vegas. Thanks!
