I stop here every time I come to Vegas.  I am not a big drinker, but this is the place where I always enjoy a strawberry margarita.  Service has always been great.  I appreciate the fact that year-after-year some of the same people I recognize and are still working here.  I like the ambiance of this place and the chill and relaxed atmosphere, plus, you can't go wrong with the music selection.  I will be back next Vegas trip.
