They give you hugeee sample slices. \n\nBut they are slow and expensive and not very tasty. The bread is great. The insides, average.\n\nYou would save yourself a lot of money and time if you just bought a loaf and made your own sandwiches. Because I think their deli meats are like...just regular cold cuts from Smith's. And if you get the breakfast sandwiches here, the eggs are always SUPER well done.
