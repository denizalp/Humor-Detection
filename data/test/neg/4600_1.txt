My friends and I discovered this place while walking by on our way to Mont Royal. Despite a wait, we were seated quickly. The ambiance of the cafe is great, and the food did not disappoint. We split a scone (highly recommend the raspberry!) and we were blown away once our meals came. We each agreed that it was the best brunch we've had in a long time. The French toast is a must-try, and the poutine is delicious. I definitely plan to come back on my next trip to Montreal!
