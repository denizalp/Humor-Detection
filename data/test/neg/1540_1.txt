Really impressed by the customer service at this store. We've been to several different Verizon stores through our years as customers and always treated well but the sales people at this location really took their time to time explain different options and programs that were available. All of the employees worked together since they had just installed a new software program. Our salesperson, Josh, isn't always at this location, but if he's there, you can be sure you'll get great service!  A big thank you to all!
