This is your cozy, small-town feel kind of bowling facility.  I've been here a few times and I always enjoy my time there.  There are many lanes and I've been on a Friday night and they're usually not too busy.  The food is decent.  It's a bowling alley, don't expect anything 5 stars when it comes to cuisine.  I like that there are servers\/attendants that will come to you and take your order.  You don't necessarily have to go to the bar or the restaurant to order food.  What great service right?
