Hours say they are open until 11pm, but we went in at 10:30 and they only had two types of pizza available. The employees were apathetic, and didn't even consider trying to make another type pizza for the multiple patrons looking for a slice. There were 5 people ahead of us, and they all wanted something different than what was there. Worst customer service I have ever received.
