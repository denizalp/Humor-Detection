This is my go-to neighborhood korean restaurant. Love that they are always open late and never too crowded. We usually order the marinated short ribs or gaal-bi, and korean fried chicken which are musts. Stone pot bi bim bap is also very good, as well as their fried mackerel. They offer very few sides, but you can ask for more of something if you like it.
