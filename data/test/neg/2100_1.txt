Definitely recommend checking this place out! Think of a small coffee shop but with amazing food with great flavors. Their coffee's and drinks are good though too! The service has always been awesome and its the perfect little spot for a light breakfast\/lunch. But I would avoid the lunch time rush cause it definitely can get pretty busy with all the businesses around the cafe. Highly recommend getting their croissant's!
