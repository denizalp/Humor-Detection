Food was ok.  Some warm dishes were no longer warm once you reached your table. I like the portion controlling small containers of dishes to cut down on waste.  Some desserts looked better than they tasted.  (The gelato was very good!). Overall, lackluster buffet considering the $42\/person pricetag.
