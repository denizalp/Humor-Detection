Yes, it is a chain sushi joint but try it anyway! The sushi is amazing and the menu selection is really great.  They usually have some little sample to bring to the table.  They treat customers very well, and even have a special treat for the ladies after the meal- Poki sticks!  By far the best chain of sushi restaurants.\n\nPlus it is a very fun place for birthday dinner, because the staff will all come and sing.  You don't get that at very many places anymore, and it's really fun!
