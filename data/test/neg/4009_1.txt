Just moved into Crescent Scottsdale Quarter and can't say enough about this place. Pool area and gym are amazing with fantastic views, the property is well kept, and the apartment finishes are beautiful. \nAs a flight attendant, I needed something nice and convenient, and I love this area in town- so many restaurants within easy walking distance! The best part so far is that the sales team has been very helpful and accommodating getting me settled in.
