This is a fantastic workout. All of the instructors are patient, skilled, personable and committed to making each class worth the time and money. It takes a few classes to get into the rhythm of how the class flows so be patient with yourself.  \n\nIt is pricey, but so are personal trainers and these classes will deliver great results. It is worth every penny.
