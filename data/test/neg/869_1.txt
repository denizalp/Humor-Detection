Probably some of the best wings I have ever had. My favorite sauce is the Honey Habanero.\n\nMy wife and I ended up going when there was a special (60 cent wings), delicious and cheap :).\n\nIf you want to try out multiple flavors they do have a rule that a flavor can be applied to every 3 wings which is pretty good and allows you to try a lot of flavors quickly.\n\nOverall the wings were crispy, and delicious and will definitely come back.
