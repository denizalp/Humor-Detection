Everything was good, but for a high end restaurant I was expecting excellent. The food was tasty, a bit under seasoned.  There is an old school charm, a bit dated, ample parking. For a Friday it wasn't overly crowded which may explain why multiple servers kept asking if everything was okay (felt a bit swarmed). What was exceptional was a rose for my wife and a slice cake for our anniversary.  It was good.
