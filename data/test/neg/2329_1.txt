We walked in here because the decor looked really interesting and I am glad we did. The food was amazing. Having been to cuba, I had not expected much from this place but I was very wrong to think I knew anything about cuban food. \nThe meats were really tender and full of flavour, although the portions are a little small, you will be satisfied none the less.\n\nI would however stay away from the conch fritters. Not much conch, lots of fritter...\n\nDonuts are something to try too!
