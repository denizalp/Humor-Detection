Great cozy little spot. Had the salmon (3 ways) over rice and each was fantastic. Friend had the Take Kano box and the fried chicken was incredibly juicy and tender. Miso was served with the dishes as well and it was excellent. \n\nMy only suggestion would be to maybe have a little music playing? It was very quiet...
