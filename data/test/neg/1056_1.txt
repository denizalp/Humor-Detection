Oh Dear Lord I know gluttony is a sin but this food was the bomb diggity. Mrs. White did a awesome job teaching her son to cook soul food. Everything was just like I remember when eating at Mrs. White's and I was not disappointed.  The kool-aid drinks were delicious and refreshing. Steven our server was amazing, kind and energetic.  I know I will be back to try other things off the menu and I can't wait.
