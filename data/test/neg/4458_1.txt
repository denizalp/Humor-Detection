The Lexus dealership quoted us over $900 for the 30,000 mile service.  A friend recommended Bella at Dynamic Imports and he serviced the vehicle with everything that was actually needed at 30,000 for less than $200.  He even told us the brake fluid was fine, rather than charging us to replace it.  It is so refreshing to find an honest auto repair shop and we will definitely continue to go to Bella.
