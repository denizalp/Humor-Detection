Went to Vegas with friends for a mini vakay and we did the Club Crawl on November 7, 2015. Let me tell you we had a Blast. Our host Xavier was great and energetic made everything happen. We actually completely the Whole Crawl (which we were told alot dont do lol). Between the Clubs,  party bus, and the Vegas sign Xavier was great kept the energy going. We would definitely so this again.
