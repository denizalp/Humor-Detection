I had just received a reading from Shannon a few days ago and it was a great experience! She gave me a very thorough chakra and reiki reading and I left with a new feeling of affirmation. Her studio is very welcoming, neat and organized. Shannon is very informative and I definitely would recommend Shannon to anyone who wants a personal reading in a comfortable setting.
