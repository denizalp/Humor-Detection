Seek insurance elsewhere. Just tried to pay my monthly premium today and learned that my plan had been cancelled 3 days ago because my policy was discontinued. Furthermore, the representative I spoke with admitted that they did not bother to send out notification (as is legally required). Coverage was lacking even while I had the policy. Aetna tries to squirm out of making payments even when an event is blatantly covered by a policy. I would give negative stars if possible.
