The service was amazing, everyone is so sweet and friendly. I had the 2 eggs special and they were cooked perfectly. Our waitress suggested a lemon ricotta pancake and that was the icing on the cake for me. Everything was delicious, my wife had the Eggs Benedict and she swore they were one of the best she's ever had.
