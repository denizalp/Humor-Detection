Previously I worked for this location. I quit when the appliance manager was replaced with a Russian woman who harassed customers to buy insurance until they left the store without buying anything. Eventually I had to quit because the above mentioned manager started insisting that we lie to our customers telling them that whatever product they were looking at was likely to break. I strongly advise against doing business with this location and probably this company.
