Stopped in here for a drink one evening after work.  Bartender was very nice and made a great drink.  She was chatty and engaging, I think that's what makes a great bartender.  She maintained some small conversation and chatted with other guests.  Her martinis was awesome too.  The place is decorated very nicely.  Look forward to returning for a meal.
