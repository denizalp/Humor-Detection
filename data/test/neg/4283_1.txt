Lunch today. Ordered the Glenwood burger with fries and a coke.   I dragged a friend with me and headed out to finally experience the food. Heard great things about this place, but, it's a mistake for me to have believed them.   Burger was undercooked and the drink was flat.  Fries were fine.  .  I don't feel well about this, this is just my humble opinion, I don't recommend it.
