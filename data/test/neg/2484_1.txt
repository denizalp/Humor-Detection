Awesome little small business. Gelato is amazing. Didn't even know it was there because it doesn't face Rainbow. Thank you to my Dr. who said for a nice little treat this is the spot. Some of the flavors seem odd, but ask for a sample anyway. Who would have ever thought about pear and gorganzola or cheese and cracker gelato?They are amazing! I will definitely be back.
