Absurd pizza in Las Vegas. Furious at myself for having been to City Center 6 times in the last 5 years and only found Secret Pizza on this last trip. Secret Pizza is officially my mandatory stop when I'm in Vegas, like Takashi in SLC, El Tarasco (Rosecrans) in LA or Nando's in DC. \n\nIs this the best pizza I've ever had? No. Is this the best pizza in Vegas? No idea. Is this one of the best places I've eaten at in Vegas - ab-so-lutely
