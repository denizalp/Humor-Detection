Cherry was so great! I got my nails done for the very first time today. Cherry was very knowledgeable and guided my decision for my color (the one I thought I picked out wasn't what I really wanted). The shop was really clean. All the nail technicians were friendly and funny. The receptionist was great too! Would highly recommend!
