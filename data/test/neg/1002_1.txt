This place is a hidden jem just off the strip! It's a new favorite and I'll go back time and time again. This is the place if you want to settle in with a couple bottles of wine and are in no hurry. (if you have a time constraint then this might not be the best) The waiter has been in the business for years and has tons of amazing stories to share! Even the bus boy is personable and interesting.\nClassic, traditional, and cozy - amazing atmosphere!
