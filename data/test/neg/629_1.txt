Our first experience wasn't the best. We got food to go and basically our order was completely wrong. But the manager Elliott actually called us personally and emailed us 2 free meals. Upon coming back to claim our meals, he personally remembered us and was incredibly gracious and thankful we came back. The food is delicious when it's made right, and the management is great. Cool place
