If I could give this place zero stars I would! They screwed my hair up really bad and they did the same with my cousin. My hair looked ridiculous and on top of that they were rude. They're not friendly. I'm never coming back. They are lazy and cannot do their job right. I literally cried when I saw how my hair had turned out. Please take your hard earned money elsewhere.
