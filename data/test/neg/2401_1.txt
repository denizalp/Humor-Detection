I have an unhinged addiction to Starbucks and this is my local haunt. It's next to my gym which reduces the guilt of a moment of weakness resulting in the eating of some sort of mediocre loaf. Pike place drip has me right where it wants me. \nOnce a year I get a frappuccino or a PSL. The regular coffee is what I love. And the back patio. They changed the set up and it is super uncomfortable inside.
