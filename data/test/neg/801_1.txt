Amazing.  The food was fresh and ready in less than fifteen minutes with a line out the door. I work in the service industry and was very impressed with the service and unrushed presentation.  Only reason not 5 stars was the dressing. .i know the caesar is made fresh but the chunk of anchovy i found really turned me off. Less is more when making caesar! All in all a great experience but will not be eating the caesar salad anytime soon!
