As stated by another reviewer, not too sad that Kimmy'z is gone. (their help was not to helpful).  I went to Backyards last week and they are still getting their ducks in a row.  Still developing full menu & Happy Hour specials......I hope they run HH until 7:00pm.  They could grab a lot of business if they could just get people IN THE DOOR.  The ladies working the bar\/floor are a great improvement !!
