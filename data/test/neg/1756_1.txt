DANG AND WOAH are words that come to mind when I think about this Canes location!!!!! I couldn't be happier with the staff and taste of the food!!! On my last birthday, they all ( including everyone in the restaurant ) sang at the top of their lungs to me and I had a great time! 10 stars if I could! Check out the picture of the cool staff and me on my last bday on my profile!
