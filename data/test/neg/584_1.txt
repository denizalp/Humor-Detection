Really nice, modern club! They have everything you'd expect ... the best DJs and a huge dance floor. Somehow, it's still really really packed ... but I guess that's vegas. \n\nThe upstairs is where to be ... less crowded but still fun. Getting in can be an issue at times, but that's the same everywhere else. \n\nDrinks are pricey, but that's Vegas for you.
