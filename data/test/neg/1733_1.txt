Taco, taco, taccco ! TACO !! Had the tacos (could you tell?) They were mighty fine! Lengua and pastor were the yummier ones. Mulitas were also ordered but very forgettable. My Guatemalan co-worker recommend this place but for the tortas, so I guess that's next on the menu. They also had a good handful of soups which is nice for a taco joint. \n\nP.S. I got take out, the neighborhood seemed a bit sketch and the place is located behind a car wash... Totally up to you. Overall I give this place 5\/5 Pedros.
