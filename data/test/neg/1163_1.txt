Were nearby to Tender Fresh Food when on our way to Jetton Park. Family with picky two year old, yet everyone left satisfied. We ordered the chicken tenders with honey BBQ sauce, honey mustard and creamy garlic. All were delicious. They also offer tasty looking salads, milkshakes, and sides that rival Chick Fil A quality. Will definitely come back.
