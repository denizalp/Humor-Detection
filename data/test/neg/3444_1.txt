Very consistent Italian restaurant.  My son take martial arts near here so I am in quite often for a beer (If I am early) or afterwards treating him to pizza.  I have had several different menu items and have enjoyed them all.  Service is always wonderful and the prices are great.  Not the perfect place for a date, but perfect for enjoying a good meal with great service.
