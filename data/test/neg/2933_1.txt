Cool place. Went there for lunch, I ordered the Cha Cha Cha since everyone talked about it. It was a little overhyped, tasted real good in the beginning then it got a little too rich for my taste as I continued to try and devour it but unfortunately I didn't finish it. The fresh garlic was the highlight. Probably try something else next time. The gyoza was bomb tho and the service was good. Nice atmosphere.
