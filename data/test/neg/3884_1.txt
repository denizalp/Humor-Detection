The clerk was very rude. He asked several inappropriate questions about how much I get paid at my company. Was on his cell phone talking to someone in between his conversations with customers. The store was in good condition with the shelves stock but untidy. There was a kid that was in the store attempting to get a lighter or matches from the clerk. The clerk did not greet any of the customers that Lockton and even when I said hello he did not respond or reply.
