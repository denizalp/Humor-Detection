I've been a frequent visitor to the Bloomington location for over a year so I was very excited when this location was being built! Blaze is always spot on, I've never had a bad pizza from a location. Tried out the new spot in champaign in it's first week of being opened so I expected things to run a little rough but I was completely wrong. Congrats champaign location, everything was made correctly and quickly like normal and the staff seemed friendly enough without being over the top. Glad you're in town!
