I wish Adonis was around when I used to live in this area. They offer everything a regular grocery store has to offer plus more. They have some of my unique staple items like ezeikel bread and vegan products. The grocery store is clean and organized. There is plenty of staff available willing to offer help.\n\nThey have an extensive meat, seafood, hot food and dessert area along the back. I stopped by for a crepe. The sweetest jamaican lady behind the counter was attentive and friendly. I will definitely come back anytime I am in the area.
