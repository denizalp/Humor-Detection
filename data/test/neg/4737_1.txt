Just saw they were on Yelp.  Was on vacation in Arizona and they literally saved my life.  Care was top-notch from first walking into the ER through two surgeries and 16 days in the hospital.  Social work kept me informed every step of the way on what was going on (I had to be transferred to a rehab center).  You could have eaten off the floor--that's how clean EVERYTHING was.\n\nIf I lived in the area I would not hesitate to go back there with a medical issue.  Like I said, they literally saved my life.
