I was injured in the parking lot as I was leaving the adjacent Starbucks. I went in here to clean up and the staff was wonderful. They immediately provided water, ice and first aid materials. They offered to call an ambulance, but when I refused... they insisted that I rest and soak up the AC. On top of that, the food was great. Best service from a neighborhood bar I've ever received.
