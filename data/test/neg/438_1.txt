Ordered the fried spicy chicken and sausage which taste the same bec I think they use the same oil for frying.  The red bean soup with taro ball is quiet good, consistency of the soup is watery not thick as I expected, I hope they could add more of the taro balls though. Not happy with the hot tea (lemon)  that we had bec it's too sweet, not refreshing at all
