I dropped in here for lunch due to the high yelp rating, and was disappointed. \n\nThe grocery store is neat, and the takeout service was polite and quick, but the food was really substandard: my shawarma plate came with dry chicken, bland hummous, unseasoned rice, and barely any sauce. The tabouleh was decent, but I had a hard time finishing this meal.\n\nI'll be checking out a few more shawarma places around town before coming back here.
