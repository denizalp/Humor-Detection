Been driving past Tryst for years and we finally stopped.  SO GLAD we did.   I love Reuben sandwiches and they simply knocked it out of the park.  The fries are deliciously crispy- not wimpy.  The atmosphere is between an uptown funk feel and classically comfortable.   You can sit indoors or outside.  Service is a little slow- kinda like they were understaffed but very friendly.  We will be back.
