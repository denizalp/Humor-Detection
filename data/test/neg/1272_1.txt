From a foodie perspective this place wins.  Great bites to eat here.  I would recommend the spam sliders.  They are spot on delicious.\n\nFrom a craft beer perspective this place has a lot of good choices on tap and a cool canning machine for take home.  It appears no discount for going with a growler price.  Questionable pours for a flight.\n\nService is middle of the line.  This place could really use a beer expert behind the bar to push it to a 5* establishment.
