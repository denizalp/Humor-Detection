Delish! I went here for lunch after a coworker recommend it, and I ended up eating myself silly. I had the Penne alla Vodka, which was wonderful (but if you don't like salty sauces, maybe not for you) and the tiramisu was very light and fluffy. The cons are: the inside is tiny, so there only a few tables; parking is also limited; the service was a little slow. Still, though, the food is phenomenal.
