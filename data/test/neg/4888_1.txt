The Bison burger is delicious. The chicken quinoa salad was cool, fresh and tasty. Add avocado to everything because it's yummy. Add banana to the watermelon strawberry smoothie to make it a little creamier. The place is well decorated for a good atmosphere and well maintained. Bathrooms are clean too. Would love to have one of these in California.
