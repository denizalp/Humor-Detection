I have many issues that were needing medical attention.  There was a sebaceous cyst on my back. It has been there since I was 15. All of a sudden it was infected. I went back to dr and said to lance and drain it.. then come back to have it removed.   It took 8 weeks for me to go back, it was not healing. Come to find out it still had remnants of the infected \"sack\" .\nDoc removed it, now it has been 4 weeks and compmetely healed. I felt this office and Dr Paulsen did a fantastic job.
