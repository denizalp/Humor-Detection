Went here for lunch on a random Wednesday and was very glad I did. The food was bursting with flavors and just delicious. I tried sheesh tawook, zaatar, potato harra and a side of hummus and man everything was just yummmy in my tummy. All this and drink cost 20 bucks and we left happy campers from this place. Can't wait to come back try more items on the menu
