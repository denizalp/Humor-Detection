Very nice and spaceous rooms!!! Nice bathroom area. They have fitness center, tennis courts, spa, swimming pools (i think they have 2 on different places within the resort), bar, restaurant, and more. The area is beautiful, except the weather of course. Nevertheless, we are very satisfied with our stay.
