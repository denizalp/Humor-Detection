I like that this place isn't too stuffy or take themselves too seriously. I enjoyed our cocktails, great wine list by the glass, and excellent seafood. Dessert was tasty too, but for a key lime type dessert (served in a cute little glass jar), but it was too warm and the texture was a bit slimy. All things considered, I would revisit next time I'm in town and would recommend to others.
