The Copper Whisk menu is your pretty standard American breakfast, lunch, and dinner diner food. I would says it's maybe a step up from Denny's or IHOP. So if your looking for a culinary wonder, this might not be the place for you. But if you are looking for a decent breakfast, for a decent price before being your Las Vegas adventures, I would recommend this place. It's clean.  The service is quick, kind, and accommodating.
