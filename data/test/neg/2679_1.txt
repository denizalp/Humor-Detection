I went to the A&W restaurant for a quick lunch. It was a very hot day, but they left the door opened so the restaurant was hot and humid.\n\nI ordered the uncle Burger with sweet potatoes fries. The uncle Burger was okay, buy I prefer Wendy's or Harvey's burgers. A&W burgers are usually dry and not much flavor. I like their sweet potatoes fries and that is the only reason I will go to A&W.
