I've been to Lupies many times over the past 20+ years.  If this weren't a beloved dive restaurant it would have closed years ago.  My husband loves the chili, chicken and dumplings, and burgers.  \n\nHowever the  food comes mostly out of a can.  Today I had the daily quiche special, which was mostly melted cheese in a pie shell.   Salad was iceberg lettuce with some diced tomatoes, but also served with very nice orange and Apple slices. Service is very good, atmosphere divey, food is mediocre.
