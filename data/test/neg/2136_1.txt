I was visiting for a friend's wedding in Toronto one weekend. I used 7 11 taxi and will never be using it again. Uber is the way to go. The cab driver double charged me for the ride after saying my credit card payment did not go through (which it did) and had us pay cash. Called the company to sort out the issue and blatantly said they could not help me. Very unimpressed with Toronto cab drivers.
