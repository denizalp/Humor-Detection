This pharmacy is typical of any drugstore.  I am a little grossed out by the carpeting.  Who carpets the entire store these days?  It's not only outdated, how can you really get it cleaned without steaming it?  Aside from that it, it had the allergy medicine that I was looking for so it's alright in my book.  \n\nClose to the freeway and train\/rail station.
