This was our first visit to Fat Cats in Gilbert and it won't be our last.  We bowled on this visit and the lanes were clean and kept up to date with fun scoreboards that showed cute clips after each roll.  The glow in the dark vibe made it feel like a moonlight bowl even though it was in the middle of the day.  This place has a cinema with the latest releases, a miniature golf course, arcade, bowling alley, ​and pizzeria.  There is basically something for everyone.  I highly recommend​ this place​ for entertaining the family!
