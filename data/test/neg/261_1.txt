Loved the food here! No wait to be seated. Service was a little slow at first but the deliciousness of the food was well worth it. I got the broccoli cheese soup, salad and the filet. The best broccoli cheese soup I've ever had!! Good salad. The wheat bread that was on the table was ok, nothing special. My steak was delicious! A little on the pricey side, we used gift cards we had for this restaurant
