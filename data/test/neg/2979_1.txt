We loved the food though I felt it was a bit pricey. The grilled mushroom appetizer was awesome. I ordered the lamb chops which were great but it cost $26 and there were only three small lamb chops. This location seems more for tourists and is pretty similar to other Indian restaurants so as a localI would say just go to the one closest to you The service was great! I didn't try the buffet so I cannot comment on that.
