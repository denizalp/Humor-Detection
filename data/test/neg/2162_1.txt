I stopped by this Fry's on  Thanksgiving afternoon to pickup a couple of things I realized I needed.  This location is by my parents house.  I was grateful they were open until 5pm.  The store had everything I needed.  Cashier was in a really nice mood despite working on Thanksgiving.  The store was clean and well organized.  Thank you Fry's!
