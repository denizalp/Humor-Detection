Their portrait studio is pure TRASH. My family comes every few months and they recycle through photographers so much, there's never the same person there as the last time. But each one still uses the same techniques for \"posing\" so each time we go, it's literally the same poses different outfits. We're lucky if we find even one picture at the end to order. Will not return or ever recommend.
