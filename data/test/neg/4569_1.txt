We went as a group and had a family style dinner the following was incredible:\nCauliflower \nFig pizza\nSeared tuna\nPig cheek\nEggplant pasta\nKale\nSalmon \nEndives salad\n\nAnd the list goes on. I will say the meat is a bit salty but it was delicious and the family style dinner is well worth the price tag. You really get to enjoy the chefs choice.  \nYou can tell the staff takes great joy in the space and the food and the experience.  \nI definitely recommend going with a group
