Hmmm.... last time I went it was better...\n\nThe belly dancer didnt come til after 7:30 when they were suppose to come in at 7.\n\nThe lamb shank didnt have alot of spice that I would expect from a meditarean place\n\nThe vegetarian platter had a variety of stuff, but it's just not my taste except for the hummus.  \n\nOverall, I would still come here because of the ambiance and belly dance performances while you eat for visitors.
