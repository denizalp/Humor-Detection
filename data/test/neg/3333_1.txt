As the name implies this is a Mccafe and won't have your regular Big Mac or fries.\n\nService is prompt and professional.  There was also a self ordering kiosk which speeds up the ordering process.\n\nFacility was clean and well maintained.  Since it's close to work, it will be one of the regular coffee places for when the mood for mccafe strikes.
