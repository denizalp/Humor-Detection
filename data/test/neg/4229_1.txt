DO NOT USE.  I think this company is a SCAM.  They took my credit card info, scheduled an appointment and then nobody ever showed.  My husband called and they said they were \"running behind,\" but still never showed.  So the next day when I called they told me they called and left me a voice mail canceling the appointment, there were no technicians in my area and I would need to go to a different company.  They sounded a little fishy but I still gave them a try, don't make the same mistake I did.
