A very friendly and happy place to eat tasty Thai food. \nThe serving staff were splendid and lots of fun to talk to.\nFood was fresh - if a little lacking in finesse, but the proof was in the flavours. \nWe had various red and green curry's and some simple starters. It's not award winning stuff, but inexpensive, yummy and simple. \nI suspect this is a firm favourite with students during term time and who could blame them?\nDrinks prices were average and the whole meal (with tips) came to around $25 a head. Great value!
