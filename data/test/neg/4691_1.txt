Incredible restaurant.  The place is small, accessible, and funky.  The food blew me away.  We tried lots of stuff, including the bacon jam with Brie and toast, the devils eggs, crispy chicken skins, veal meatballs, mac and cheese, and donut bread pudding...the chicken skins were my favorite!  Seriously the best part of fried chicken in a basket with smoked honey.  Wow!
