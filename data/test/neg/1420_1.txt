I am happy that I had the opportunity to work with Carlmann Pepito. I went in looking for a desk for my son's room and he helped me to find what I was looking for, for a price I could afford. He listened to what I wanted, and led me to that instead of using unwanted, heavy-handed tactics to bully me into something more expensive. In the end I got a desk that my son likes for a price that didn't kill my checkbook. What more could a mother ask for?
