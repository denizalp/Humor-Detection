Crappy customer service. Short staffed front end & self check out is often not open. CHECK FOOD EXPIRATION DATES!!! This location is notorious for stocking expired food items. When informed, they don't remove it as we've seen the food still there on our next visit. Frozen items have been several MONTHS past the best by date. How gross is that???
