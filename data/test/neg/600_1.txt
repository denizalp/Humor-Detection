I hit up this spot at least once a week, sometimes more. By far one of the best places in the city to get \"Gamjatong\" or pork bone soup. The other favorite dishes are the soft tofu soups, BiBimBap, and seafood pancakes. But honestly everything on the menu is good. It's definately a very affordable place with just about every dish under $10. During th evenings it's usually very busy but table turnovers are very fast. Great spot to warm up on a cold winter night.
