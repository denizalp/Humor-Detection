We go to this pizza place almost every week for girls night out. I have tried almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed.  The Cesar Salad is delicious. The fried zucchini appetizer or the garlic knots are fantastic. The service is friendly and attentive.\n\nThe manager Cameron always speaks to us and makes sure that our food came out good. Not many managers make it a habit to know their frequent customers.  On occasion he has even brought out our food to us just to say hello.\n\nIf you love pizza or Italian you will not be disappointed.
