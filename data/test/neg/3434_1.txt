The space is vast; the bar is really long; it was too cold to sit on the patio, but it had a fire pit. There's a glassblowing place next door. The food was good. The service was excellent. They gave my uncle and me special complimentary cocktails because we were first-time guests at the new restaurant. The cocktails were the best, containing aperol, prosecco, and an orange rind garnish. Not too sweet. I ate the garnish.
