Good soup for the price. It could have been hotter as surprisingly it was tepid at best. Service was fast and efficient.  As there are not too many options for Vietnamese in Pittsburgh, you would be hard pressed to find another place better.  \n\nThat being said, the Pho was still tasty and the beef still tender.  The spring rolls were also hot and delicious.  It definitely is an authentic place, but they could do a bit more to make it even better.
