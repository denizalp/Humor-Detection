Oh yeah, I wanna go back already. Sadly I didn't grab photos because I gobbled it up. \nWe had the curried goat roti and the jerk chicken. One time I got the jimmy cakes (yum, like a fluffier festival that's less sweet) and one times I got the banana and dumplings. Didn't like the bananas but the dumplings were really good in the jerk sauce. \nThe festivals were great too. Slightly sweet and perfect with the jerk sauce. \nThings came out quickly and they come with salad (green or coleslaw)
