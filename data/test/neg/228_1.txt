I've been waiting to go to Tako for a very long time and let me just say that it was more than worth than wait!\n\nEverything from the food (in particular the thrice cooked wings, queso fundido, and papa bravas) to the drinks (my favorite was the spicy cucumber!) to the atmosphere (dark, swanky with lots of personality) was perfection!\n\nCan't wait to go back again!!!
