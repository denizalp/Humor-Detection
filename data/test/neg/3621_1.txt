Stopped by on a Friday night ended up going to Eggslut instead. Came back the next day and waited in line to see what all the buzz is about. The pizza was OK.. I think this place is mainly hyped up on the whole secret spot. The price is high for the quality but then again I've had a lot of good pizza. Don't think I will be returning but will be back at Eggslut :D
