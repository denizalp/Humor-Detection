On our first day at Vegas, I thought that my 4-year old daughter would really enjoy the theme at the Rainforest Cafe.  Instead, she was pretty freaked out by all the sounds and sights and couldn't wait to get outta there.  \n\nThe food is all right, just felt that everything was a little pricey.  For example, my Rasta Pasta (which is basically pesto penne with grilled chicken) was $17.99.  Fountain drinks are $2.99 each.  Service wasn't very good either.  \n\nBottom line:  Not worth your money unless you or your kids really enjoy the setting.
