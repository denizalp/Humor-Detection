One of the best saltwater fish store in my opinion.  Has great selection and price.  Staffs are always helpful.  Sonny is one of the nicest person you'll ever meet.  The store is very clean and you'll see the staff cleaning the tank all the time.  The store is pretty far from my house but I don't mind the drive because I know I'm getting a good quality fish and coral.
