I have heard so much about their food, and the chicken fingers are delicious and juicy.  The Texas toast is terrible, coleslaw not bad and thankfully they have real tea...not that flavored crappola. \n\nLocation is terribly busy, little parking and seating is difficult to find. All in all, certainly worth the chicken. \n\nGive it a try!!
