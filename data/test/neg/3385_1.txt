We have dined here about a year ago.  It wasn't that great.  We thought we give it another try this evening.  Unfortunately the food was still very bland, not appealing.  Snow crab are tasteless.  Not fresh.  Not a big WOW.  Mandarin is much better.  Imperial Buffet charges 50 cents for a cup of hot water (what gives)
