We went here for the first time yesterday. I got a burger which wasn't very good. The review above about it being precooked might be accurate because the burger was dry like it had been precooked or sitting out all day. If you're craving a burger I'd suggest going 100ft across the parking lot to Five Guys. They had a few craft beers which were decent and a great price ($3.50 for mine). If I go back, I will try the wings and update my review.
