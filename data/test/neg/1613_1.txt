Other reviews have covered everything about this place - it is small and located next to a Circle K, but the pizza is fantastic!  I actually like the pizza here better than Cibo.  I ordered the small Vegetarian pizza and the Caprese salad to share with a friend.  We were both stuffed and our total bill was only $18!  Great value for your money.  Plus the vegetarian was loaded with a variety of vegetables, including artichoke and zucchini.\n\nI'll be back!
