Not a table service location,  so you order from counter and you pick it up at a window.  The food was hot and fresh. Wings great with hot fresh fries.\n\nStreet parking only. Spots metered. It was dead but Pitt is out for summer.  I would go back. Not cars or hot rods indoors like the other. More of a quick stop but same food as the other locations.
