Want some overpriced taco's?  You've come to the right place!  I was just craving some taco's for some reason and ran into this place.  Meat was decent but nothing to write home about.  If you just happen to pass by and are craving some taco's, this place will do the trick, but if you want some really good taco's in vegas, go to Tacos El Gordo.
