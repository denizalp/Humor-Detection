My favourite place to eat in Toronto. If I was opening a restaurant, I would model the service after P&Ms, you are treated like family here. This is a place who's got it right, super nice people, variety of food on the menu including Greek, Italian and classics like fish and chips or a 24oz burger that's sure to send you home full. Nothing but good things to say about this place, been going there since it was just a little hole in the wall. 5 stars all year long.
