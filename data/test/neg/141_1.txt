Took me a while to get on here to review but I wanted to say thank you to Brooke for the awesome job she does on my lashes. I have been going to her for a month now and love them. She is amazing at the featherize style  I always leave feeling fab! I've been to other lash lounges in Vegas and none have had the quality Cherry does. It's worth every dollar to me.
