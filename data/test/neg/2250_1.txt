Left this office after I overheard a doctor talk about me before entering my room where she was rude to me during my visit. \n\nNow I keep calling to ask to be taken off their automatic appointment call list and am always on hold for 15 minutes or more waiting for someone to speak too. \n\nJust wish this place cared a little more about their patients.
