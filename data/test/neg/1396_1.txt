We decided to try this place instead of our usual Hakka place just to change it up. Prices are a bit higher here but the decor is nicer. Portions were good and if you like spicy, they deliver on that front.\n\nChicken pakoras were great but the other items we ordered, fried rice and shrimp in manchurian sauce I think were just OK.
