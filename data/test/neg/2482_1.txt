Cheap and hearty breakfast food! Pretty good stuff, especially for the reasonable prices. The corned beef hash and homefries was really delicious! But the biscuits and gravy was only so-so. \n\nThe waitstaff was really friendly and helpful, lots of coffee refills. Overall a fun atmosphere with lots of local charm.
