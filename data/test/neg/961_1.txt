As a Seattle transplant, I was excited to find an actual coffee house (just because I'm from Seattle doesn't mean I like Starbucks) they have a decent beverage menu and my latte was fantastic! Reminded me of home.\n\nSuper cute atmosphere with a selection of books to read while you hang. They also have a kid friendly area. I'm assuming a manager chatted with me shortly after coming in. The staff seemed a bit.... Reserved I guess, but overall it's a nice little neighborhood spot to go too. \n\nI'll definitely be going back.
