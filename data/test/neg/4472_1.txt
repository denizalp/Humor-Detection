I'm a vegetarian so I don't come here often but when I do I always order either a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and fresh jalape√±os , and it is always good...the cashiers are always friendly, and the wait is usually minimal...everything is pretty organized. Occasionally I will get fries but they are very filling and too greasy for frequent consumption. My only complaint is really the size of the grilled cheese sandwich. It's very small compared to the size of a veggie sandwich (with more veggies, roughly the same price) at Jimmy Johns next door
