I definitely wish there were more locations in town and wish they opened earlier than 7AM otherwise I would come more often. \n\nThis was my first time at this location. They were pretty busy for a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was clean and spacious. The staff was very friendly and helpful and definitely patient with my Son and I. It's been years since I've been to a Jamba Juice and I was a little indecisive. \n\nMy smoothie was the \"white gummy bear\" from their secret menu. It was my first time getting this and it was delicious!
