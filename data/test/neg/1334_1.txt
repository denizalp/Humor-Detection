Try the Burrito California....excellent.  Chips and salsa are also good.  \n\nWith that being said, the last time the wife and I ate here the service was terrible.  I actually wrote the waitress's name down to add to my review but now I can't find it.  I never got a drink refill.  She took forever to get the check.  She was too busy socializing with her coworkers.  I just can't understand where people find wait staff like this.  If they don't take action they will lose business.\n\nUpdate on 3-23-2013:  The waitress name on the reciept was Dulce M.
