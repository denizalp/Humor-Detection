Great selection of wine and beer! Beats the heck out of Bevmo or any other liquor store I've been to. I have been back several times...a bottle of wine is becoming my token gift when attending parties or events. The wine is well organized and easy to find if you're looking for something specific. If you are not sure what you'd like, the staff is very helpful and the labels will spell out for you which wines are the most popular.
