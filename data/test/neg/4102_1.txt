Paul quickly diagnosed the problem with my washer over the phone. He could have easily fixed it but ultimately recommended that I get the repair done by the store I purchased it from because he knew that option would be more cost effective given the brand of washer and type of problem. I greatly appreciated his honesty and will hire him in the future for any other washer\/dryer problems.
