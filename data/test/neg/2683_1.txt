We go to this Applebee's all the time! This is like a regular family hangout for us. My kids love the place, and we always try to get Vanessa to wait on us if she's available - she's absolutely the best! Great place to go for good food with the family! I also really like the new items on their menu - and Applebee's keeps on coming up with new items!
