Seriously I won't come here again! The lady who works for front desk, her attitude was awful! We came 5 minutes late, because the hotel was rebuilding, I spent little time to find it. If you come late, then the time will be cut off. I have an appointment on 11am for 50 minutes massage, and I was late for 5 minutes, they give me 40 minutes massage. And they never said about it! They will never tell you that. That's not fair to customers! Sucks
