This is a fantastic deli, which is a surprise to find in Arizona.  I instantly felt transported back to NYC when I walked in, accept for the fact that the average age of the dinner was over 50!  That said, the food was great and the pastrami and matzo ball soup was some of the best I've had.  \n\nI recommend the half sandwich and soup, unless you have a HUGHE appetite and can eat half a side of beef!  Enjoy!
