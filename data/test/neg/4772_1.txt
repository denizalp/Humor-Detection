I walked in and was immediately overwhelmed by the beautiful, earthy warm space.  Positive quotes everywhere, the smell of essential oils and comfy chairs and couches to sit on.  Then the people are comfortable, friendly, happy, the energy there is so wonderful.  The yoga classes are hot, sweaty, challenging and led by truly great teachers.  Love it there, and now call it my yoga home!
