I would give them 0 starts if I could \nWorst food ever and very expensive for the crap they selling \nI paid 45$ for an omelette which I send back, a burger, a cappuccino and a small green juice ...\nReally?\nI left hungry since I couldn't eat that thing \nToast was soaked in butter, omelette not cooked and taste awful
