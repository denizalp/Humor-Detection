I've recently gone vegetarian and decided to give Tommy's a try. The service wasn't too great; my boyfriend and I waited almost 20 minutes for a server to greet our table...but the food is delicious. My boyfriend ordered a veggie burger and I went the different route and tried their \"Dee-lite\".  Our bill came out to be pretty cheap and we both left satisfied customers.
