This girl will eat at Cane's whenever and wherever she can because they still inexplicably haven't come to Wisconsin. \n\nI loved that this was right outside the airport and easy to get in and out of. We got in late and it was later feeling for us with the time change. We just wanted something we knew would be quick and delicious before heading off to our lodging and my husband knows how much I love Cane's. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and fun, the restaurant was clean and the food, as always, was delicious.
