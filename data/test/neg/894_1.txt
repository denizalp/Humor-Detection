A1 customer service, clean restaurant and good food! Does it get any better?? I was greated by the team as soon as I stepped in the door. Everyone was so friendly and patient(this was my first visit, so I took a little while looking at the menu) all food is made fresh daily, their chili is amazing and so flavorful. I got the Ray's way and the all the way hot dog combo. The Ray's way one was my favorite of the two. I will be back to try more options.
