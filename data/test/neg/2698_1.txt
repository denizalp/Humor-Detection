While the staff was nice, the food and drink quality was poor. The carnitas were very oily and dry. The shrimp scallops enchilada was poorly mixed (sauce or cream mixture was not adequately spread out) and a square slice of cheddar cheese on top is just plain tacky. DONT get the margarita for two. It's pointless. Huge but barely any alcohol in it, so it tasted like a plain slushy. Oh, and the bathrooms smell horrible! You can smell them before you reach them. Totally a disappointing evening.
