The food is AMAZING!!! It was brought out fast, fresh and hot..It was so refreshing to walk into the mall and find a place with so many healthy options. The staff was friendly and the place was very clean..I have been back 4 additonal times already in 2 weeks. I pray that this place survives in Charlotte!!
