This was a delightful little patty joint,  the exterior is quite small and that's how you know the food gone be fire they don't even take care of the outside like they put in all the time and effort into this food and it is worth it. We found like of tail bones outside the restaurant it was that good and on our walk there was some coleslaw in the street two minutes away and a rapper from the store. Someone was walking home and finish their meal in two minutes that's impressive I recommend this joint.
