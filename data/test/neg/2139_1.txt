Great food and staff. at a very decent price.  Every staff member had a smile on their  face.  Live music on Tuesday night was a nice suprise. Staff gave special attention to our grandson who soaked it all in.  Combine the food, price and staff and this one is hard to beat....in my top five of all time!
