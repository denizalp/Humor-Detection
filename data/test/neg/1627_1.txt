My bf and I decided to come here for Sunday brunch. It was absolutely delicious. He ordered the stuffed French toast with a side of spicy turkey sausage and I ordered the red velvet waffle with berries. All dishes were amazing. Before delivery of our meal they served us fresh chocolate\/cherry scones. The scones were perfect. Our waitress was pleasant and tentative to our needs. We recommend Sunday brunch here.
