May was extremely pleasant and friendly! She was very knowledgable of the menu and explained everything to me very clearly. I tried the white coconut latti with boba, and it was so creamy and delicious!!!\nI also tried my friend's Scarlett iced tea. It was not my favourite thing, but it did have a very powerful taste to it.\nNext time, I will definitely be trying out the famous raindrop cake! Can't wait to come back!
