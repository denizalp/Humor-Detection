I am in love with the food at Cambod-Ican. Hands down, every time I visit Pittsburgh I stop here for the to-die-for seafood wontons in the amazingly delicious magical moon sauce. The tea is perfect, too. If there was one restaurant I could pick to eat at for the rest of my life, it would be this one. I've been coming here since 2007, and don't plan on stopping. Dan and his family are incredibly welcoming, and it feels like you're eating at their home. It's worth the wait. If you haven't tried it yet, shame on you.
