Quite costly for not many options. Only one type of protein for smoothies. For a small smoothie it cost me over $7.00. \n\nAlso no peanut options. Wanted to skip the fat and have peanut powder- much better for your body, but they only have peanut butter. My smoothie wasnt quite smooth, had hard bits of pea protein which was not too appetizing.\n\nThe shop itself was cute, with games and seats.
