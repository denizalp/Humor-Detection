The Silverton's Seasons Buffett is not bad for the price. It was free. The selection is good for the size of the buffet. If you sign up for the Players Club you may get a free meal at the buffet. (At least we did when we signed up).\n\nThey have a great selection of salads, Asian, Italian, American, carved meats and desserts. Service was very prompt and friendly.\n\nWhen in Vegas give Seasons Buffet a try.
