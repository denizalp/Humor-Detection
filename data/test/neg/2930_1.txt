A two hour quoted wait time ended up being only 30 minutes. Can't complain, the oil change with tire rotation and car wash was covered under the maintenance plan. The Gaudin staff I interacted with across service, sales and cashier were knowledgeable and helpful. I walked away feeling confident in my choice to service my vehicle here.
