Hannah is a wonderful massage therapist who asked insightful questions both about my experiences w\/ massage and preferences for it as well as offered the opportunity to chat if I wanted during the massage. She was strong, attentive to the work I needed done, and used a variety of different techniques to leave me feeling refreshed and my muscles relaxed. I'd recommend Hannah to anyone!
