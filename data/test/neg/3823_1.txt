My favorite tire place. I picked Discount tire at first because of the name. However, I keep coming back because they act like they really care. They might be faking it, but I believe it. The prices are good, but above that I've been in a bind a few times and they have really hooked me up with a better deal. Then if you need a tire balance or a flat fixed it.s included.
