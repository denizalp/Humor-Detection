DE-LI-CIOUS!! I am a cocktail snob and always bothered paying more than $15 for a meh cocktail. But the mandarin did not disappoint! I will definitely be coming back when I come back to Vegas. I had tried three other bars in Las Vegas before coming to the mandarin and was disappointed in the drinks that used mixers or were too sweet but the Mandarin drinks were perfect!! I ordered the smoke and mirrors ($20) but definitely worth the money!! I'll definitely be back!!!
