My family has had quite a few dinners here, and has never been disappointed. We usually get the Bento boxes which contain a good variety of items, with tasty sauces.The shrimp tempura is good. The restaurant is very clean and food is consistently well prepared. Never had a bad meal. The meals are topped off with those interesting little ice creams. Just a good experience.
