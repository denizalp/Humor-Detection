My 22-year-old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner on the patio on 2\/13\/14.  Our waitress enthusiastically guided us through the menu options, and we feasted on a wonderful assortment of dishes, including the Korean cauliflower, beet & orange salad, lentil meatballs over spaghetti squash, roasted brussel sprouts and gouda mac'n cheese.  Fortunately, the Thursday evening Art Gallery Walk allowed us to slowly work off our fine meal.  Lovely experience all around!
