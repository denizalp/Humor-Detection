Local here. I took my hubby to see the Jabbawockeez for his bday weekend. Our seats at first was horrible (to me) but Teresa (an employee) came up to us and moved us to Front Row. The show is AWESOME from the Music, Moves and Crowd Interaction.  I highly recommend seeing the show. Keep up the good work.  I can't wait to see the Jabbawockeez Again.
