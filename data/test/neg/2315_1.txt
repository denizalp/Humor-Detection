Our family ate here tonight although we were very hesitant based on the reviews we read.  We eat out often all over the country, and expect good food and service. We were greeted immediately and sat quickly.  The food was very good and the service amazing.  The servers passing the meats joked with our kids and made sure they had fun. We will be back and definitely recommend.
