Came in cause they were only one open and when I got here.  They told me my rotors were warped and it wasn't mentioned to me the week before so I said do nothing and I will take it back to where I had new rotors put on 4 months ago.  So at this point they took their time putting tires back on car.  Won't ever go to a firestone anywhere.
