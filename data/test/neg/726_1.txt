Probably the best steaks in the state. Great service every time I go. You never have to wait for anything to be refilled. Food can take a bit of time but it's worth it. Here are two musts when you go. Sea scallops and butter cream cake. If you're worried about not having room for dessert then order the butter cream cake first.  You won't be disappointed. The main dining area can be quite noisy so request a table in the back dining room it's much quieter and more spread out.
