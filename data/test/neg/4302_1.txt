Not fully authentic, but the restaurant offers a great array of Chinese dishes. It is usually packed full with customers and you may have to wait in line. The waiters are friendly but in peak hours they may be in a rush. Don't let that bother you, because they are very friendly even when they are very busy and the food is really great.
