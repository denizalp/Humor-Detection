Paul was incredibly quick to respond to my messages on Yelp, was incredibly flexible with scheduling the repair, was professional once he came to repair our dryer and was very thorough in completing the job. \nExcellent price too compared to some other people who gave me  a couple estimates. Definitely would suggest you call Paul first!!
