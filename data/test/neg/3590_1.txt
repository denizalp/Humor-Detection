This place is great for any meal but my wife and I have been hitting their breakfast and lunch often. I LOVE the short rib hash breakfast dish. Fantastic. One of the best burgers in the valley.....very underrated! Fries are to die for. Fun to people watch but it's the food that keeps us coming back. My wife likes many items also but seems to be drawn to their salads and believe it or not the oatmeal.
