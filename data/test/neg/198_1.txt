The pork ramen was good as was the carrot salad.  However I found it ludicrous that I could not substitute the beet salad. The beet salad was available with other lunch selections but not with the ramen or the sandwich. I even offered to pay extra and was told I couldn't (even though the beet salad was actually $1 cheaper on the menu).  The waitress even said its been a big point of contention with customers. That is terrible customer service!
