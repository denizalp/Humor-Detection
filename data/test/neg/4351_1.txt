I came here as a walk-in during busy lunch hours and only waited approx. 20 mins. Office staff was very kind, and 'Keisha' drew my blood with no problems, she was friendly, did her job well, was quick, and there was no pain involved. I will stick (no pun intended!) with this 9139 W Thunderbird location from now on.
