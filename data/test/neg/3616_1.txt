This is part a. of what will surely be a longer review, as we were only there to try their bourbon cocktails, and didn't sample anything from what looked like a delicious new-American menu (ok, so we did get a slice of bourbon pecan pie, but no dinner entrees!). \n\nWe tried their Sazerac, mint julep, and their house Tavern drink, which reminded me of a fall-spiced Manhattan. Definitely a great bar spot--a small restaurant with big potential in Shadyside.
