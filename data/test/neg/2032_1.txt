I bought a $2100 dollar couch in April . After the warranty its $2600. After 6 weeks of barely using the couch the motor stopped working on the couch.  Someone came to look at it and ordered a new motor. They never let us know when it would be fixed. I called after not hearing back for 3 Weeks! And they said about 4 more! So ridiculous will never buy again from here.
