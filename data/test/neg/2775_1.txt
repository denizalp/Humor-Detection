This place needs to get it together.  They open at 5:30am and I pass by every weekday about that time.  Most days they have no donuts.  Not delivered yet.  Other days I pass by and don't see the open sign which probably means no donuts yet.  Either get your delivery on time or change your open time.  BoSa down the road is a good alternative.
