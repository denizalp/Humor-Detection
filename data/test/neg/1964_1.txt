I rather enjoyed the Original burger, but it needed more than just ketchup. And the caramelized onions are a must I asked for the pattimelt sauce which helped. I was slightly disappointed after hearing good things, because it didn't seem like anything special but the burger was tasty and A+ on their fries.
