These people turned a bad experience with another rental agency into a very positive experience.  Guerillmo at the reservation desk was so helpful and friendly and then Alex down below in the car area was super nice and helpful!!  And of course, the cold water was such a great touch and badly needed after a long flight and the aggravation with the other agency.  Next time it will be National from the start!!
