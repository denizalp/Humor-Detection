Hard Drive Recovery on an iMac.\n\nMy hard drive went bad on my 2012 iMac. The Apple Store quoted me at over $200 to have the files recovered. A computer place in Hudson I called was $189, and I finally got good news when Computer ER was only $99. Thank god.\n\nIt didn't sit on a shelf and collect dust. He got to work on it right away. He was great at updating me throughout the couple of days he was working on it.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to come back if I had any computer needs.
