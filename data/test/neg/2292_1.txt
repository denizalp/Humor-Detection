24 hours a day of Yummy!\n\nI can stop at Amelie's anytime for a delicious meal or treat.  I can grab something and take it to go or sit and relax for hours in the unique atmosphere and feel like I'm in another land.  Food is fantastic, people are great and it's always open, what more could you ask for?
