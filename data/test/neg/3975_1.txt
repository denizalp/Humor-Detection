Ichiban in Japanese means \"best\" or \"number 1\". Personally I've had really good sushi at my local farm boy. The presentation on the plate was good save for the hair in my platter. It took 15 minutes to prepare. It was soft and well sliced. Taste wise was not as fresh and it lacked that direct from sea flavour. Price was expected for a chef's choice platter. Colour was a bit subpar. I did a takeout order but it may be quite nice to eat in.
