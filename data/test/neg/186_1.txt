Probably the best cocktail bar I've found on the strip. This is located in the Cromwell Hotel. Service is little weird\/awkward here. Our server didn't seem to know what to do, such as giving us the menu. However, the drinks are good here. The two drinks I liked were the Humadorita and Cromwell Fizz.
