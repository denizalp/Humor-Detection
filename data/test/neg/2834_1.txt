Fantastic burger? Sure. \nGreat atmosphere? Absolutely. \nFriendly wait staff? Yes sir. \n\nWe enjoyed our meals. I had the No Poblano Burger \"rehab 10oz\" and fries. She had the turkey burger with onion rings. Both meals were delicious! \n\nWe were engaged in great conversation with our server, Devon, (a local AZ). I am glad we were here before the spring training crowd, because I doubt we'd get the chance to talk. \n\nWe will be back to try another burger ASAP!
