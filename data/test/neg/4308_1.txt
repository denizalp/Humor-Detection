Been here a few times and never disappointed, love the corn karage, grilled eggplant and of course their udon. I preferred the soup udon as their cream version was a bit too heavy. Was expecting it to taste more like Guy Izakaya version but tasted more like alfredo sauce with cheese. Love the ambiance as it's a mixture of restaurant\/bar\/noodle house.
