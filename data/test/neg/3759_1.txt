This place is dope. The sashimi was awesome and the sushi chefs were super cool and chatty. Went there with my girlfriend and her workmate and even though we were eating close to closing time we didn't feel any pressure to hurry up... I mean we did cause who wants to be the jerk that makes everyone stay late, right? Anyhoo I would recommend this place to anyone in the valley and I'm gonna take all my friends from out of town there
