A solid choice when looking for a sandwich or salad or even soup.. a step above Panera and Few steps above a subway.. big portions for most sandwiches with choices of sides where you can get either chips, potato salads or coke slaw.\nAt this location the seating can be a challenge as the place fills up at lunchtime.\nThere are a ton of sweets to choose from but I noticed they don't ask for the sale when you order so they surely miss out on lots of sales of deserts.
