I loved the Fly Zone Sandwich, it  was delicious, juicy and amazing special taste. \nI came with my family and I got warm welcome from a worker \"Mohammed\", he was very friendly, helpful and smily.\n\nI loved the combination of having steak and chicken stripes in the burger. It was light and special.\n\nI definetly recommand that, if you are looking for a special taste.
