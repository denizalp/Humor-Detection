The food was okay. The beer was good. The service was great (Thank you, Paul!!!). But there was nothing particularly special about this restaurant, and I think the the term \"gastropub\" is a bit generous. If you want good food and good food, give it a try. But if you're looking for a \"gastropub,\" you should probably look elsewhere.
