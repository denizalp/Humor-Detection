I was extremely underwhelmed by this restaurant. All of our food was dry and lacked flavor. My husband regularly eats Cuban food, so he got the same meal (vaca fritas) that he normally gets. He said it doesn't come close. I've traveled through Miami a few times and a small stand that sells empanadas at the airport beats this restaurant. I was hoping for more since we only live 5 mins away!!
