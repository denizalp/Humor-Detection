It was a great experience at Harkins Theatres. It's very clean and the staffs were friendly. I can't even imagine myself that i watch movie without popcorn. Of course I got popcorn which is so fresh. what I realized here you always get fresh Popcorn which is an awesome info for popcorn lovers like me.\n\nI had no issue with parking also, It was quite easy. The seats were comfortable and neat. \n\nOverall, a great movie watching experience.
