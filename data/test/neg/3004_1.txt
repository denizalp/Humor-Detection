This is exactly how it's described.  It's huge.  It's awesome.  He's got things no one else can even think to have.  But make sure you look at all the discs. Don't take his word for it! I always inspect but caught up in it and took his word for a \"clean\" copy.  Not so much.   The price is right, tho, to try lots of new things.
