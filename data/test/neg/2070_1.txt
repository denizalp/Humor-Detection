Start witj the free bean dip and salsa, very good, but be careful not to spoil your dinner!  Big portions and very delicious.  I had a chicken taco and tamale that were excellent, my friends had chimichangas and the were good but recommend no sauce because it takes away the crunch, other than that mmmmm. No room for dessert, but they generously brought us a yummy treat to finish off the meal. A great experience, we'll be back, and tell our friends!
