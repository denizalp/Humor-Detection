Won't be back. Food was only fair. Gravy appears to be from a mix, no flavor, and the sausage patty reminded me of what you get at a fast food place, only much greasier. While the hashbrowns were plentiful, they were only crisp on one side. Coffee was on the weak side and quickly became lukewarm. Very disappointed.
