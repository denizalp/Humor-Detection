This is the best Denny's I have ever been to. The restaurant has a really cool look and is nice and new (a lot in part to the previous occupant Elephant Bar). The giant fork out front really makes the building stand out (in a good way). A lot of unique seating options and very comfortable. Our waitress was very friendly and provided great service. Our lunch was really good. I highly suggest this location!
