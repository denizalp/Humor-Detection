Suzanne and her staff treated me like family. They were my first and last stop for dress hunting.\nThey helped me to find the exact dress I was looking for and even called up the designer to get it to me quickly. Suzanne painstakingly altered my dress to fit me perfectly- all in less than three months. Every person I have interacted with at Suzanne's has been very kind and helpful and my dress is absolutely stunning. This was an enjoyable pain-free process.
