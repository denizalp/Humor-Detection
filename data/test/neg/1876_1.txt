I come here with my girlfriend and it was quite a find.As soon as we sit down a bottled water is brought to you,  the ladies make sure you get all settled in the spa chair and then the experience begins. Don't be afraid to get the gel manicure or pedicure,  I wasn't and loved it. Today I got limes rubbed on me, didn't ask it just happened,  nice. Plenty of magazines and two tv's. Looking good.
