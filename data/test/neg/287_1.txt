Great quality meat! We did the Woo Combo for 2-3 and it was VERY FILLING! Staff is very friendly and they even will cook the meat for you so that it's perfect. Combo came with a lot of extras and lots of sides. \n\nIf you are looking for ALL YOU CAN EAT this place IS NOT AYCE!  However, you will be just as FULL as if you were eating AYCE!
