Joy did our design for the front yard.  She worked within our budget and guided two very inexperienced xeriscapers through the process.  Six month later, our yard is beautiful.  The trees were very healthy and grew tremendously over the summer.  All the people who worked on the crew were delightful.  We will be using them again for the back yard.
