I work just down the street and really like the food here. You can sample any of soups and they always have something that I like. The sandwiches that I have tried are very nice as well. It can get busy at lunchtime but the service is really good. Parking can be a bit of a problem at times.\n\nWent for lunch today and had the chicken fajita soup and a maple ham and bacon sandwich. My work colleague had the chicken pot pie soup and he said it was very good.
