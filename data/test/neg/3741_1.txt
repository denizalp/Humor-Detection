Clean store, with plenty of fresh produce.  Well organized with a wicked little Indian dessert section.  \n\nPrices are reasonable too.  We picked up about 10 desserts for less than $6.  Awesome!\n\nI'm giving it 3 stars for cleanliness and for their dessert section.  I'm sure to update my review once I've returned and purchased more :)\n\nOne thing of note, there is a minumum $10 purchase in order to use debit, OR a $.30 surcharge.
