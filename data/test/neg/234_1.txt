Pretty much in line with the usual Cha Chan tang stuff. Service is a little slow, but I do expect that for a newly opened place. \n\nThis location is much more spacious than their other location, so sitting here is more comfortable than their other store.\n\nStill no complaints about the food, it is what I expected no more no less.\n\nPricing is in line with their other store, but priced on the higher end scale for HK style Cha chan tang.
