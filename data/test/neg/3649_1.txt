I agree with some of the other reviews.  No, the selection isn't the best in quality or quantity, but it is very clean, well organized and everyone is very helpful and pleasant.  It's less busy than the Middleton location, so if you're looking for a quick visit or aren't too picky about what you're buying then it's a great option.
