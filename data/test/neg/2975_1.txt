My grandchildren and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience at his studio. I visited prior to coming with my gchildren and was able to make an appointment. Our table was ready for us when we arrived. No waiting.They had re-stocked many pieces and my Miracles found exactly what they were looking for.  We all had a wonderful experience. I will be back for sure
