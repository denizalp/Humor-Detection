Very good tamale and egg breakfast with a side of GF pancakes.  Server Emily was extremely helpful in helping me sort through the menu to avoid my food sensitivities and come up with this great menu choice.  I also appreciated how upbeat she was with all her customers.  A little expensive for me, but not unlike many other popular breakfast places in the valley.
