Awesome HP themed bar. My only gripe with this place is that it's not as HP themed as I'd thought. It's very much a dive bar. VERY cool though - I love the Dobby pictures on the wall - the \"Dementor's Kiss\" drink, the bathrooms are lined with quotes from the books (why couldn't it be follow the BUTTERFLIES? Why did it have to be spiders?!?), and my absolute favorite part of the bar - a neon sign that says \"all was well\". If you don't know what that line is from, you probably won't enjoy this bar.
