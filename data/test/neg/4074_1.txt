Great!  I'm a fan of escape room games, and this is one of the better designed games.  The owners themselves clearly take pride in their establishment, as it seems like they put a lot of time into making creative puzzles. They just opened in early 2016 - so, the rooms are clean and taken care of.  I played the FBI and failed though still had a blast. Will definitely return to try one of the other rooms in the near future.  Recommended!
