I stopped in to see what e cig stuff they had to offer and was pleasantly surprised! They have a decent selection of juices and gear. The employee that helped me was also great he seemed to know a decent amount about e cigs in general and the products they sell. \nHeadquarters is of course a smoke shop so they sell a lot of other products and since I have no interest in anything other than e cigs I took of one star.  which is probably not fair.... sorry.
