I love BWW in general. Good wings with delicious sauces: Spicy Garlic, Hot BBQ, Garlic Parmesan, and Asian Zing are so good! Now they have some delicious dry rub seasonings as well, I like the Desert Heat. \nService can be not great at this location in particular, but the recently remodeled, added a lot of draft beers, and it looks like they are trying to do the right things.
