First of all name on review is spelled wrong...should be Porto.....    Ordered a Sicilian pizza and then 2 slices of regular to go.  The very courteous gentleman who made the pie let me sit and enjoy 2 Sicilian slices and one thin slice.  The thin traditional slice was better....but the sauce is very good and the extraordinary customer service pushes the rating from 3 to 4.
