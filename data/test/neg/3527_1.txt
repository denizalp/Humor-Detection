Went for a Valentine's Day special and really enjoyed the experience!  I have not one artistic bone in me, so I was purely there for a laugh.  The space was a bit smaller than I expected, but it didn't feel crowded!  The staff members were friendly and offered advice and suggestions.  There are inspiration books if you have no idea what to paint.  Beverages were available as well.  I recommend painting with a glass of wine, makes it that much better!
