If you are looking for a great classic pizzeria, Olympic 76 is the best.  Besides the pizza being amazing, the chicken parm is outstanding.  \n\nIn the summer the patio is fantastic, inside it hasn't been renovated since 1976 but that is the appeal.  Amazing pizzeria with classic family restaurant look.  Great place for a date or when you need something classic and good.
