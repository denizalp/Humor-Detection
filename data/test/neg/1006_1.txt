De'lish comfort food - have heard how good this place is, so finally decided to give it a try. Big menu and lots of choices. I started with the mushroom stuffed ecargo, & it totally hit the spot. Next I went for the maple glazed scallops served on a bed of kale & brussel sprouts. I am not a big kale fan, but this was so good. We will so be back!
