This is my first year getting my taxes done by Mr. Sherman and I will be using him every year from now on.  He is knowledgeable, professional and courteous as is his staff.  He made what is normally a very stressful process, at least for me, a very pleasant experience overall.  I will definitely recommend him to everyone I know.
