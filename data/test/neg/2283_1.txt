I'm here with my Dallas...he's gonna need a canine (is it still called a canine on a kitty?) extracted. Dr Smith just came in and he's wonderful gentle man...he took Dallas back and bam tooth came right out. No anesthesia needed. And they only charged me for the office visit. They did recommend that he come back for a teeth cleaning. I have a new kitty vet.
