We had reservations at 7:45pm.. Here's 8:01pm and we are still waiting to be seated. What's the point on making a reservation when you have to wait to be called while the whole time I see people that came in after us and have been seated before us. Disappointing. This is why we like to go to Via Brasil better. We only came here because we have friends in town from Reno. Way to go on putting on a first impression. Customer service is not the greatest at the front. \n\nI will update after dinner with service.
