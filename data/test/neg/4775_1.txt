I have been here a few times and it's safe to say that they have great smoothies and horrible service. The general atmosphere seems very sketchy and thrown together.  The mint green walls and plastic override booth tables makes me thing I am in a run-down hospital.\n\nI haven't really dissected the menu but the garlic toast I had was pretty lacklustre. I would probably just stick to the smoothies next time.
