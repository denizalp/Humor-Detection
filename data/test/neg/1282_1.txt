A MUST for lunch.  Don't worry if they say a 30 min wait.  Worth it and we didn't wait that long.  Female chef\/owner.  Homemade breads.  We had the warm Miami and Cuban Panini's.  YUM.  I had the Elixer tea.if you like Ginger it was so tasty.  Too full to have the chocolate croissants....I will go back.  The table beside me had a gorgeous Greek salad.  I should have ordered that as well.
