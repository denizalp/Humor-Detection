Very tasty drinks, went after a hot day and was greeted by the owner Paul, who recommended a very delicious tea, as well as the custard with cereal.  It was absolutely yummy.  The environment matches the name \"chill\", i have gone back several times since to try multiple items on the menu, including the secret menu.  My favorite is still the custard.  Highly recommend this establishment for anyone looking for a quick drink or relaxing environment to escape the heat.
