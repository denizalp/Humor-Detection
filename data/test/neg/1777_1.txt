First impression was great upon walking in. The front desk gal was pleasant. But that's where it ended. The salad bar was underwhelming (like the whole experience). All the ingredients were nearly gone. The dressings were on the last drops. The pizza is subpar. I think it's the crust. It is not good. I tried multiple flavors and rhey all had a strange flavor. The only answer is the crust. Also, the plates for the pizza are big enough for one slice. What the heck?!?! Probably won't return.
