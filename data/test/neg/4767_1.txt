I was told the KITCHEN was closed forty minutes before closing and that they would not be refilling their empty bowl of orange chicken. The most popular item in the restaurant. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? And every time I've come here in the past, I'd have to wait FIFTEEN minutes for their orange chicken because the bowl was empty again. As if they were waiting one me to signal to them they need to do their jobs. What a JOKE of a franchise. Thoroughly disappointed.
