I'm a professional athlete and I've been getting all my meals from Foodie Fit. They break down everything in each meal (calories, fats, carbs, protein) on the label, and the calories from from about 200-600. There is a ton of variety and flavor in all the meals.. I haven't had anything I don't like! Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Highly recommend!
