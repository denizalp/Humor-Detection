I am only giving them a  2 star because the girl at the register was very polite, but the food SUCKS.  We ordered jjajangmyun(black bean noodle) and jjambbong(spicy seafood noodle soup).  \n\nThe jjajangmyun was ok-nothing bad or special about the dish BUT the jjambbong was HORRIBLE.  It literally tasted like they poured red pepper flakes to make the broth. EW.   I love a good hearty broth, but this place is a NO GO.  \n\nSave yourself some time and money and go elsewhere.
