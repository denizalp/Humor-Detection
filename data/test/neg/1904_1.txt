We love this place. My family all loves the gelato and I love the sorbet. The flavors are delicious, which I can say from sampling each one, and the atmosphere is so inviting. The employees are so friendly and helpful. It is a hot spot but they bring out samples and water for everyone while they wait. The owners are always there and just as friendly as their employees. I would highly recommend.
