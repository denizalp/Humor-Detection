Love this place! For what it is, it's the best I've had! Who doesn't love Chinese take out? I always order the Singapore Mei Fung and sometimes we get the General Tso or Hunan Chicken (can't go wrong with any of them but they are spicy!)  \n\nEvery single time we order they arrive at my house in less than 30 minutes, it's magic! I can't cook dinner that fast most nights.\n\nAlso, if you order a minimum amount ($15 I think) you get free crab rangoons, which are AMAZING!
