I been to umiya for second time already and this place never disappoints me. This restaurant serves the most freshest uni nigiri in town. To stand corrected all the nigiri fish are fresh here !!! I love the location of this place Becuase it's close to my house. Customer service is always  great to us would definetly visit again with a whole group of friends and recommend this place. Also it's a plus here when you write a review you get a free mug !!!! There you go yelpers.
