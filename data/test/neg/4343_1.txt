Looking for somewhere to chill, smoke some hookah, and listen to great music while outside in the patio area? Rhumbar, located in the front of The Mirage, is where you need to be. The feature $65 unlimited hookah with excellent drink specials. This is a cool place to vibe in the afternoon right before your sinful shenanigans at night.
