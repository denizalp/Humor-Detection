I've never been disappointed with the customer service I've received here. \n\nA few times I've gone in just to ask questions and I was taken just as seriously as the customer who was looking to get a ring designed for his wife. \n\nThe showroom is roomy and tasteful, displaying lots of crystal figurines, diamond rings and gold jewelry. \n\nThere's a parking lot right beside the store, so you don't have to worry about having to park on the street. \n\nI got a pendant made with some old gold necklaces, and they did a wonderful job on it.
