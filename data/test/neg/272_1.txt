I loved this hotel. My room was like staying in someone's apartment! I had a full kitchen in my room. Stove, and dishwasher! And, they even give you pots and utensils!! The staff was friendly, and they give complimentary breakfast everyday! I really enjoyed that because if you stay for a week, you do not want to be buying breakfast every morning.. I also enjoyed the fact that if you need to use the computer, you can free of charge. If you need a place in Henderson, try here.
