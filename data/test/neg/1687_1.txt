We love this dentist office! I have had very bad luck and experiences with dentists and hygienists and this office made me feel comfortable. They are very knowledgeable if you have any questions and we've actually referred multiple people here for procedures like root canals, pulling teeth, fillings, and routine cleanings and all of them have loved it as much as we do.
