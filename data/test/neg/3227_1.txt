What Happened!?!  \n\nThe recent changes made at FlatIron have taken this from one of my favorite restaurants to somewhere I will never eat again. I used to eat at FlatIron regularly and loved their food, but they have changed the way they prepare their steaks and they are awful now. My wife and I ordered two different steaks. They were both bland and tasteless. The portions were small and given the product overpriced. \n\nI am extremely disappointed in the changes and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
