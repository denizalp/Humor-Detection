Very friendly girl at counter.  Beef and chicken were plentiful and flavorful. The pita bread was hard, seemed old, was gross. The hummus was good but we couldn't eat it since the pita bread it came with was old and gross. I don't think pitas are supposed to fall apart and crumble. Prices are a bit high if you compare to fast food,  but this is a category above so prices are average.
