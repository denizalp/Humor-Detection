I made reservations about a month in advance for a Trevi Ray boat. It was perfect for my sister's family husband, 5 year old and three year old) and me. It was very relaxing because you could bring snacks and water. The only time consuming thing was signing up waivers as expected. Thanks for the great time and I will definitely do it again and would recommend for families.
