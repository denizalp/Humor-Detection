I really liked this place! Both of the appetizers we got were very flavorful. I've never had deep-fried tofu that was so great in a while. The vegetarian egg roll was a little oily but still was good. The main course were amazing with HUGE , flavorful portions. Price was right. Service was spot-on. Can't complain.
