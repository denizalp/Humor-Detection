One of the best nights of my senior year at UW Madison was had at Gennas, a hot summer night spent sipping Grey Goose & cranberry and becoming increasingly sweaty in the middle of a dancefloor with my friends, shakin' it to 80s music and loving life.\n\nFun, chill crowd, drinks to please everyone, a classy Capitol Square locale, and two floors to accomodate you & all your friends.  Such a nice break from the fratty bars on State St.
