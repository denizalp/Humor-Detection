The nachos we got were the supreme tostada nachos. They didn't blow me away and the jalape√±os were too spicy and overpowered the flavor. For a place with nacho in the name I expected better. Also the service was slow and we didn't get offered refills on our water. Don't get me wrong the nachos were good, I just expected better!
