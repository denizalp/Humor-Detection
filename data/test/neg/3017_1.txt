Crepe Expectations is simply AMAZING! Light and fluffy crepes that always hit the spot. And now..... AN EVEN BIGGER LOCATION! No more hoping and waiting for a table. The staff is awesome. They constantly make sure you are having the best experience possible. They will talk with you and just are genuinely nice people. If you are ever in Las Vegas\/ Henderson you need to check out this place.
