I absolutely love this location of Body Heat! I used to go to Palm Beach Tan (which I hated) but here they have lower prices and great beds! Half off upgrades on Sunday's and always has great guest service. Regardless of when I go in there is always someone super upbeat! They don't pressure me when I go in to buy something, just to verify that I'm good on lotions. I would recommend this place to anyone!
