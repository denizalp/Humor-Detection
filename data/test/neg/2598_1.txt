One of the worst pedicures I've ever had. The polish has streaks even after she took it off and redid it. Overall the staff is not very friendly. The gentleman that greets you was nice, everyone else not so much. I could deal with the lack of friendliness if they had at least done a good job. Definitely will not be returning.
