Fantastic breakfast. Sat at the bar. Got seated quickly. Friendly waitstaff at the bar. Food was delicious. I had the chicken and waffles and the banana bread French toast, fantastic. Friendly people seated at the bar too, great conversation. I'll definitely be looking forward to coming back when visiting Scottsdale again. I love Scottsdale Arizona.
