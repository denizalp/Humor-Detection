5\/28\/16, I ate there for the first time.  The double cheese burger was good not better then in & out burger but pretty good.  The curly fries were very good, you can't get those at in & out.  What I like best was all the variety they have.  Next time I'll have to try something healthier.  They have a grilled chicken avocado salad that looked really good.  The owner\/ manager was very friendly checking with dinner's as to how their meals were tasting.
