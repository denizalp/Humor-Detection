I've gone to Juniper Grill several times with my family and we have always enjoyed it. The atmosphere is nice, but, as others have mentioned, it gets a little loud as it gets more crowded. \nThe fish tacos, steak, mahi, and guacamole are all excellent. I would also recommend the cornbread (watch out for the jalapenos!). Juniper Grill also has several delicious varieties of mojitos and good margaritas, as well. \nThe service here has been consistently excellent.
