Sadly, Shun Lee is really going downhill. It used to be one of the best Chinese restaurants in Charlotte. I have been going there for over 30 years and have noticed the general decline. I ate there a few weeks ago and it wasn't good. I hoped it was just a fluke but then tonight we had Generals Tso's chicken and it was horrible - no flavor at all. I won't be back.
