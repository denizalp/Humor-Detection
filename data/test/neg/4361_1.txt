I LOVE this place! Tried the SNS nails and love the process and the colors so much better than acrylics and gels. The quality of their work is outstanding! This place has SO many colors to choose from for any nail treatment you choose. Had a pedicure and it was awesome! They take so much pride in their work and the salon! The salon is super clean. Everyone is friendly and the atmosphere is low key and relaxing. Thank you!
