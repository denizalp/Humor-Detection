Great vibes and service! I ordered the 10oz Brisket and it was delicious! Also their happy drink menu does not disappoint! I was only let down by their gumbo which was too thick and coleslaw which lacked flavor. Also the bar seats are pretty uncomfortable! I will be returning and trying a different meal though because the meat was a 10!
