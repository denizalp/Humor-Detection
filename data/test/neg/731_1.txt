This place has a lot of potential but it's not there yet.  They're known for their cocktails and many of them sound very interesting and intriguing to order, But execution is poor and I immediately regretted not getting beer\/wine.  I'm used to paying $15 for one drink but after trying two different cocktails, I can confidently say it's not worth trying any more. The people and place is great which is why I gave three stars, but drinks are disappointing.
