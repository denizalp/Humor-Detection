It's crawfish season so I stopped in to see if they had live crawfish to boil. They did! Ordered 2 lbs of the Cajun boil, hot. They came out piping hot and the flavor was perfect. Not too spicy but perfect. They were so good I ordered another 2 lbs. The crawfish were good sized too.  I give them 4 stars for their boiled live crawfish. If you like boiled crawfish stop here. Nows the time, it's Crawfish season!
