Once again, the summer camp at B.E.S.T was my twins favorite this summer.  Their staff and Mitch are so fun with the kids. They never get bored because they're always doing something new and exciting. The place is always very clean and organized and most importantly safe! Thank you so much for taking such good care of my kids so I can have a week to myself during the day.
