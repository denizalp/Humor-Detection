The food is good and consistent, but we like to sit at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs don't seem to enjoy their jobs as much as other sushi places we go to.  Personality is a big part of sitting at the sushi bar and its disappointing when they don't have that.   We'd order a lot more interesting stuff if we trusted the person making it more.
