To my knowledge The Putt Park is the only outdoor mini golf place in Vegas.  Unfortunately the footprint it has in the parking lot is about as big as an indoor course.  One thing I do enjoy is the challenge though, and the sand traps strategically placed behind the hole keep the course interesting.\n\nI feel like I've played much better courses in Florida, Michigan and California for the price, however the Putt Park is what we've got and it satisfies my mini golf craving every few months.
