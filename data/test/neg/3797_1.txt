I love this particular store because I always get consistency on my drinks and on staff . Thanks Elaine and Lincoln you guys do such a great job. One morning I dropped my drink by accident went back and they gave me another one for free . That's what I call customer service. Everybody and their mothers are always packing in that place bright and early. There's always a line.
