The side dishes were so good and they have all the popular ones not just a few. It was a good sign right from the start. \n\nThe meat was not really anything special but it got the job done. Meaning it was standard Korean BBQ albeit not being super authentic. \n\nThe service was mediocre. Did not smile but was overall polite. \n\nWould come again when carnivorous craves resurfaces.
