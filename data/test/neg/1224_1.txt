On the weekends, We have been exploring all the craft breweries in greater Phoenix.  Goldwater is probably around the 12th one we visited and has become our favorite so far.  The beers were great (we tried Bertha's, Birthday Suit, AU and Desert Rose) and the environment is a pleasing industrial look highlighted by a copper-topped bar.  The jalape√±o popcorn was tasty as well.  We also got a chance to head downstairs in the basement, a  shooting range converted into a barrel-aged tasting room (only open weekend evenings). We'll be back for sure!
