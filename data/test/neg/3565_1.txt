Decided to try this place out for a family brunch today.   We waited 20 minutes for the server to arrive at our table and when she finally did, she looked annoyed that we were sitting there.  She NEVER checked on us and got annoyed when we requested separate checks.  If she would have came by when we were sat, we could have explained that to her.  If it wasn't for the nice blonde woman, we would have never received water or coffee. The food was mediocre, not worth the horrible service.
