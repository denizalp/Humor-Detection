This place is great.  The food was interesting and prepared well. The wine shop attached to the restaurant was what really set this place apart. Being able to select your wine from the fantastic selection based upon your menu choices was fun and only added to the wonderful evening. Believe me when I say I will be back. This place is a true hidden gem in Vegas.
