I'm originally from the west valley, and i go to visit my parents often on the west side--my mom and i love to come here after a little shopping.\n\nFirst off the service is very good, our server was so attentive and nice.  \nSpicy Kani Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll were so good!  And of course--a Sapporo to go with it:)  \n\nAnd after your done eating, they bring a complimentary dessert of a fancy cut orange bowl with wedges pre-diced to pick with tooth picks, such a nice topping to a great lunch and pallet cleansing as well:)
