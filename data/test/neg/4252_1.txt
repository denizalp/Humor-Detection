We were strolling around the mall at the Venetian hotel when this gallery caught my eye...the photographs are amazing!!!  I have never heard of Peter Lik but I love his work.  His photographs are all mostly panoramic landscape images.  I saw multiple photos that I would love to have hanging on my wall.  I'm just jealous that I can't take photos like these & get to travel all over the world in order to take them!
