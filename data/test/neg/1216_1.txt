Just went to Tim Hortons at 680 Sheppard (Bathurst and Sheppard). Brand new not even on Yelp yet\nWorst customer service...guy was so rude...Ordered an ice coffee with a gift card. He threw my gift card at me...grunted....and gave me  warm drink. I said how rude....then he smiled at next  customer. Wanted to contact his manager....and still may do so. I had couple of sips....and actually thought this ass probably spit in it... and threw that crap out. DON'T GO THERE 0 stars
