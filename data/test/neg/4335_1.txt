Great little ice cream shop in the corner mall area. You can taste the fresh and natural ingredients. Tanya, the owner, was very nice and very helpful. I would recommend anyone in the area to give this cute and charming ice cream parlour a try.  \n\nMy son loved the a watermelon sorbet. I also found that the pralines and cream was very creamy and naturally sweet.
