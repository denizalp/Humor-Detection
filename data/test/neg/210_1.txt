This place is cute and quaint. It used to be a plant nursery and the grounds are nicely groomed and there is plenty of parking. We were seated outside on a nice cool evening on a Monday. I ordered the  marguerita  pizza with a white sauce. My friend ordered a Cesar salad and a beer. The food was great, but the ambiance was amazing. Will definitely recommend.
