My friends have been telling me I needed to try this place and tonight I went and it didn't disappoint! Had the spinach dip for an appetizer. It came out bubbly hot in a little cast iron skillet. The cheese was creamy. Topped with fresh green onion and served with very fresh pita bread. I would highly recommend this dish. \n\nHad the Cuban sandwich for my meal and it was loaded with meat. Great flavor and taste. The garlic fries it was served with were fresh and crispy. Amazing! Will definitely be back!
