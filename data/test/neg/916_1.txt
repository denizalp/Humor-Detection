Okay so I picked up a friend from the airport and we were all hungry. I had those 'Friday' commercials going through my head that with the unlimited appetizers. So we decided to go here. Now I want to say that while the server was a little slow (we think she was new) she was very friendly and this review is NOT against her. This is against the food. We got the appetizers and when we got back to the hotel...well all of us had stomach issues. All 3 of us. So no I don't recommend this place.
