So tasty, great decor, and service is excellent! You have to try the garlic chicken and basil noodles or panang curry! If you can save room for desert, order the fried banana. It melts in your mouth and is served with coconut ice cream. I go to this place every couple of weeks and try to take new friends. It's so delicious and great service!
