Not sure why the negative reviews.  Based on my experience on Saturday night, it was a satisfactory visit.  The portions were good and the wings came out nice and hot.  Service was friendly - it was about 80% full and environment was decent.  It's no michellin star restaurant but it does provide decent wings.
