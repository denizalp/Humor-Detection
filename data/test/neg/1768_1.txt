I just finished lunch at Bakersfield with my two year old son, wife and parents. \n\nI used to really like this place. Sadly we were made to feel rather unwelcome.  The food was good as usual, but the service was cold and rude. The staffs demeanor was that of a group of people that did not want to be at work. \n\nI probably won't go back!!
