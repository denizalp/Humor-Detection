This place is one of my favourites. The chef does some truly great Italian dishes and does them very well. The antipasto is great, a good mix of hot and cold items and a really good price. \n\nTheir soups are awesome as well, like the seasonal butternut squash soup. Comforting, flavourful, delicious!\n\nAll the dishes I've had here have been great, like the lunch items (lobster ravioli) and dinner items (risotto marinara).  Even the classics are done very well, like veal and chicken parmigiana or chicken Marsala. \n\nYou must go here!!!! Love the place, love the service. An all-time favourite!
