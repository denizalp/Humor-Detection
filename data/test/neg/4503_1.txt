I am a Mexican foodaholic. Jalapeno Inferno is one of the better Mexican food restaurants in North Phoenix\/Scottsdale. The restaurant is quite busy so be prepared to wait if you come right around dinner time. They have excellent chips and salsa, the food is flawless and the prices aren't bad either.
