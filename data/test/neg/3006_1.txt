The sushi here was just....OK.\nI've definitely had better.\n\nThe service was really attentive and friendly.\nIt's located in the Plaza, where they pump that air-freshner crap into the casino to mask the cigarette smoke....which seeped into the restaurant a little bit.\n\nMaybe if I go back I'll try the Polynesian offerings instead.
