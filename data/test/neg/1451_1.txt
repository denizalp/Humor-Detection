I would give this place a zero star but that's not an option. First time coming here and it was horrible !!! I got the steak and shrimp teriyaki, the shrimp taste like dirt, the steak was salty, there was no teriyaki sauce what so ever, the sweet carrots were sitting in the pot for too long they were so mushy and tasted very old, the rice had no flavor and not to mention the shrimp sauce which it was pure mayo with pink dye in it . Would not recommend this place at all.
