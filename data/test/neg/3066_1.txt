Update: I've been coming here for about two and half years and they are just the best. Always straight forward. They never hustle you into repairs that aren't absolutely necessary but are very great about explaining the cost\/ benefit of repairs needed on your vehicle. Honestly, they are such a great mechanic that I will probably never get anything other than a Honda just so I can keep going to them. (or maybe an Acura)
