Worst worst Thai food , we came visit family and we wanted to try some Thai food decided to try this place and omg it had 4 stars not good at all my pad Thai was so sweet and their egg rolls had no flavor and it seems like the vegetables in the egg rolls was so mushy. \n\nWe are from California we wanted to try some good Thai food and this is not the best Thai food.
