What a beautiful shop! Located right on State St, this shop is a great place to eat some chocolate or buy some fudge. Everything is made in house and it's to die for. I'm not a fudge fan, but the fudge here is melt in your mouth delicious. Did you know fudge could do that?! I didn't! I highly recommend their turtle fudge - it's chocolate, pecans and caramel all wrapped up in one. If you're looking for something different, try the peanut butter fudge. You can't go wrong!
