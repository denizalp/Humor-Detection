This is the best sushi in Phoenix. Yasu truly cares about making GREAT food. All he wants is everyone to expierence great food and what that taste like. It is worth the wait. I've read a lot of poor reviews from people who are better off eating sushi at a super market they don't appreciate good quality sushi or even good food for that matter. I've eaten sushi all over the world including michelin star restaurants like sushi nakazawa. Yasu is as good if not better.
