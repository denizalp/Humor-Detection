My husband and I are forever grateful for the care and professional help that Emily provided during our labour and delivery. Having that confident and reassuring voice in my corner was crucial and there wasn't a moment during my labour that I didn't feel supported either physically or emotionally. Emily's personable care made it feel like she was a longtime friend on the journey with us and my husband and I don't know what we have done without her. We'd recommend her services in a heartbeat!
