I just moved to the area and was really craving Pho. I always drive pass this place, so I decided to give it a try and I am so happy that I did! The food is delicious! I LOVE the fried shrimp egg rolls. They are seriously my favorite and I would go here just to get them! The Pho is also delicious! I always get the rare steak and brisket pho and it does not disappoint! The staff is so nice and quick! I will return!
