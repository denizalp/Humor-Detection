After a hectic week, I (like many before) dropped my phone on a tile floor. Liz and the team at ifixaz came to the rescue and were able to fix my screen right away. After a delay in getting parts, Liz saved the day and the team stayed super late to find my part and get the job done. Kudos and many thanks to ifixAZ.
