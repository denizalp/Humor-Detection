Whenever I go to the Rogers centre it's an okay experience. It's really easy to get in and the lines move pretty quickly. What takes time is ordering food. The lines are atrocious. If you are gluten and lactose free you can bring your own hot dog bun and purchase a vegetarian hotdog at gate #106, since it's gluten and dairy free. \n\nAllover, I have a good time when I visit the Rogers center and the best sections for baseball games are the sections behind home plate.
