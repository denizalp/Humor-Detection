Retro Bakery is surely helping the property values in the Centennial Hills area! \n\nI love all their flavors especially Maple Bacon, Coconut, and Peanut Butter. I also like the fact that they are always introducing new flavor combinations on a regular basis. \n\nIm so glad i live around the block from them...
