My favorite koobideh place. So tender and juicy! And the rice is airy and slightly buttered. Highly addicting when combined. This $8.99 dish is a big portion and can last 1-4 meals depending on how you hungry you are or how much you ration it.\n\nTheir Mahicheh and Baghali Polo (Lamb Shank with dill\/broad bean rice) is also so good! The lamb shank is fall of the bone tender and the sauce is so flavourful. I'm not a big fan of their dill rice though and prefer the rice that comes with the Koobideh.
