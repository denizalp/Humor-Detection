This is easy the best dive bar in Pittsburgh. Staff is is always incredibly friendly. Drinks are very reasonably priced. Darts and pool is available.  I spent time at this bar nearly every day when I was at pitt. To get the best experience come on a Thursday night when they have wing night and get some wings to go with you darts and beer.
