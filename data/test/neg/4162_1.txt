Can't  believe  how bad food was!!!!\nI ordered 2 Gorditas, when I got to work( 4 min away) craving to eat my gorditas I  opened  the box and what a surprise \nthe tortilla  was cold with a slap of meat inside, sour cream on the side with a little  lettuce .\nNEVER AGAIN.....\n\n\nI don't  recommend this  Place at all...
