Fast and great service.  Most of the cars in my class were taken by the time I got there late in the evening.  As an Emerald car holder,  they upgraded me to another car free of charge.  The total fee for two day rental car was ridiculously cheap.  I can't complain at all...  Definitely a fan of National.
