Cool place to stay, very centrally located with an awesome shopping complex right next door. Free and easy parking. However, if you get a place for its kitchen (which I did) then DON'T book here. No pots or pans, strainers, kitchen knives. Literally nothing to cook with other than a faulty stove top that is useless with out kitchen supplies. Certainly won't be using is as an extended stay ever again but it's not a bad hotel.
