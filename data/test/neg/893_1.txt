This place is frozen in time and reminds me of every awesome diner and ice cream shop I remember as a kid. Including a game room in the back for the grands been here multiple times and I would not say the food is great but the ice cream is amazing. They know how to make a Sunday and the are awesome. Club sandwich and chef salad are tasty but would avoid the burger.
