I love the Nekter franchise, and this location didn't disappoint! The store itself was clean and had lots of fresh fruit and vegetables on display.\n\nMy açai banana berry bowl was smooth and refreshing, just what I was looking for on a hot Phoenix day! They also had a good balance of açai to granola. \n\nI would definitely recommend a Nekter bowl for a healthy, cold snack!
