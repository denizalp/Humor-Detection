We stumbled across this quaint cafe while we out in Leslieville. Inside - there is a warm laid back feel - I can imagine grabbing a coffee and sitting out by the window. There are comfy chairs by the window, small round tables and 3-4 Muskoka chair out front. Coffee was good and there was a great selection of food (sweets and sandwiches). If I lived close by, this would be my go to place for coffee. Love the vibe and coffee
