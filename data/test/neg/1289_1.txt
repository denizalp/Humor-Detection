Went for the first time this week.  Had an 8pm reservation, hostess staff was rude and didn't seat us until 8:45.  Wait staff was just as bad.  Took 15 minutes for WATER.  Food came out sporadically, most of which was cold.  All the guys at our table enjoyed their burgers, but the rest of us found the food was nothing special.  A waste of a Saturday night.  RUDE STAFF AND POOR SERVICE.
