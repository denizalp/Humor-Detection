Kathy is the best, a true nail artist. French manicure by hand and a light touch with the files. Worth every penny.\nMy first visit I was a walk in and they got me in right away. Nice clean shop with a friendly staff.\nMy second visit I called for an appointment and they were able to schedule me for same day. \nThis is my new \"go to\" salon!
