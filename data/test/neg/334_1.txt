the food at this restaurant is horrible out of 10 dishes only 2 people didn't have complaints and they ordered the fries and onion rings\n\neverything else was microwaved and the beef and chicken were very dry and tasted old\n\nand the place has a very stale smell like it hasn't been cleaned in a long time
