I've seen Dr. Fu and she is great.  Very thorough.\nMy issue is with the office\/billing department.  I had two visits and I paid what I was told was my part.  After insurance processed the claims, I found out that I was overbilled for both appointments.  I've left two messages with the billing department, one per week, and have yet to hear back about the refund for the difference in what I paid and what my insurance says I owe.  \nSo, the doctor is great but the office billing isn't.
