I love it here.  I tried their 30 days for $30 special.  The first time I picked up a racket in 30 years.  I am hooked. Every morning I bounce out of bed to go play. The coaches are fantastic. The staff is friendly and very helpful when I've had the smallest of problems.  Not to mention the facility itself is gorgeous. Any player of any level would be lucky to work out here.
