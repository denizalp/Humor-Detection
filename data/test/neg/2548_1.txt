Had a deluxe pizza from here last night, and it was delicious!  Lots of toppings, nice sauce and great crust!  Cooked perfectly, even gave us some really good ranch dressing to dip the crust in!  My brother picked it up and commented on how nice the young man was that took care of our order.  Looking forward to ordering from them again!
