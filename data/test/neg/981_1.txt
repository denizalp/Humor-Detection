Suuuuper happy about bei. Up until they came into town, my bf and I would drive all the way from n. Scottsdale to Tempe marketplace for kabuki. Bei is easily as good as Kabuki, with super fresh sushi served at the exact right temperature. Very attentive and timely service. I judge a sushi restaurant by the hamachi and sake, and bei passed with flying colors. I'm also thankful they don't overdo the whole Americanized fried rolls with heavy mayo sauces. Always nice to see Mochi ice cream on the menu:)
