I love this place, it's one of my favorite go-to's. Food always comes out quick. My only complaint is sometimes the servers don't come around quite often enough, as they don't have to refill the water since it's self serve in those big pitchers. Sometimes I want to order another drink or get my check and have to wait a while.
