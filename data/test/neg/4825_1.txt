A charming vibe, with a great selection of beers brewed in house. Beers were varied and delicious, and not lacking for a certain unique flavor. Food was hearty and filling, especially the cheese curds and the Bratzel Burger. Unfortunately, the service was particularly slow during my time there, due to a recent update of the menu, or so they said. Took us nearly an hour to get our food, and 15 minutes alone to get our drink order. All in all, tasty food, but maybe save a trip until they're back in the groove with their new menu.
