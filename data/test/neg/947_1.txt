Place rocks!\n\nIt IS a bit more $$ then ur usual Asian joint but its really good and portions are rather large. You do order your food yourself at the counter, get your number and find yourself a seat you like. I do not see anything wrong with that, do you? No longer then a few minutes they bring out your food to your table. And ... Yummm.. Yummm its good.\n\nGood lil' joint.\n\n\"I like\"\n\nEugene
