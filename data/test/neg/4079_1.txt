This has become our \"neighborhood\" Thai place, although its not really in my hood - but totally worth the drive.  I normally get the pad see ew (sometimes known as Drunken Noodle).  It is very good as are their curries.  Everything tastes very authentic and thankfully not \"Americanized\".  We ordered their catfish last night which wasn't up to par - but nothing to get salty about.  They also have lunch specials that are well priced.
