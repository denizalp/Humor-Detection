The brunch is filled with luxury food options including eggs benedict, carved meats, Asian, and also standard lunch fare like fried chicken, pizza, and pasta.  Atmosphere is very trendy and spacious.  Wait staff is prompt and polite as you would expect here on the strip.  This is one of the best buffets I've been to anywhere, and maybe top three in Vegas where the buffet is king.
