They don't have much choices on their menu but it makes no difference for them to make the donburi superb and amazing. The shogayaki pork is very very delicious. It's a magic for ginger lover such as me! It seems like they change and replace items on the menu sometimes. Come regularly to check what they have changed for the menus.
