Could not say enough good things about Vera's. We had Tammy as our consultant and absolutely adored her. With a short conversation she understood exactly what I was looking for, and threw in a few curve balls -- one of which ended up being the one! I felt listened to, respected, and my mother also felt so included in the process. I am SO happy to be a Vera's bride and recommend it to anyone wanting to feel special and un-rushed for their wedding dress process.
