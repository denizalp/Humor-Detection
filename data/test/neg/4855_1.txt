Had a coupon so I ordered for pick up.  The place was very dark inside and tiny.  The guy at the counter was nice and friendly.  The pizza I got was with pineapple and ham.  What I thought had been medium pizza's are actually their larges.  Their pizzas run on the small side.  I enjoyed the pizza, but my mom did not really like their red sauce.  The price was good with the coupon, but without one I won't be back.
