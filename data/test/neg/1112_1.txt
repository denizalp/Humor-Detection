Best drive-thru $5 wash in the area. Great for a quickie if you can't afford a \"hand-job\" at one of the fancier places. This is one of the few drive through washes that will actually get my rear end clean. Typically my tailgate is filthy after driving through one of these tunnel washes. Not here. They leave my rear squeaky clean. Free high pressure suck and blow at the end.
