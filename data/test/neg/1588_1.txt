My first photoshoot with Martina was a little over a year ago. I was nervous as I'm really shy in front of the camera. Martina was so friendly and welcoming that the shoot was like hanging out with an old friend. I've since done several shoots with her. She is so creative and is extremely passionate about her work. She's the absolute best at capturing one's personality on camera. Highly recommended. She knows her stuff!!!
