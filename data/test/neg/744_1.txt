A regular in my rotation. I generally always go with the tasting menu. The only bad things I can really say is that the menu changes periodically and I run into situations where something I really enjoyed is no longer available. Any pizza appetizer has been great - thinner crust than most places which I prefer. Honey laquered rotisserie chicken is also good. Hard ot screw up a wedge salad. Nice atmosphere. I always eat at the bar and the service there has always been great - great view of the oven for the pizza there as well.
