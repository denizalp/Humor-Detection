Ommhgggssssshhhhh me & my families very first time here...& we are ALL amazed. Food was off the chain, waiters were incredibly accommodating. To be honest I am going to cut this review short because I am too satisfied (full) to concentrate lol. \n\nBtw this is my first time even feeling the need to write a review raving about any place.\n\nOoohhh, & be sure to ask for the,\"pink\" sauce....no questions....just ask!! Will def. Be back next time visiting Vegas
