Covernotes feels like one of those places that is a home away from home.  It's so inviting and comfortable that you can't help but spend hours there.\nThe loose leaf teas are a big selling point for me.  The variety is good and I have yet to try one that I didn't like.  The food is wonderful.  It's fresh and delicious every time.  It' one of those places where once you go, you can't help but go back again and again.... and again.
