Had i read this review earlier, i wouldn't go for this c grade company.\nI dont think they deserve to be rated at all. On phone they wont tell you any thing just give a quote and then they will create a series of problems for you. The charged me double of waht they said over phone and damaged the item and my wall. And now they dont even pick my call.\n\nDONT HIRE THEM THEY ARE ROBBERS.\n\nEdit: this review was written by me when I lived in Mississauga, Canada
