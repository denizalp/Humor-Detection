Great service, friendly staff, and some of the best prices around.  I can also say with 100% certainty that the owners genuinely do care about their establishment and their customers and it shows.  Nice place, relatively quiet (unless is karaoke night!), and just around the corner.  Best neighborhood bar I've found in this neck of the woods.
