Worse experience ever! Ver rude technician cut my skin while she was doing my manicure because she was too busy looking to see what other technicians are doing! The pedicure design that I paid extra $10 for just one toe is looking like a child did it. I could of done a better job myself!!!\nI left the place with Uneven toe nails and she cut my finger nails way too short!!\nI would never go back and I would not recommend this palace to anyone!
