My Italian father said the pastry he ate from here was the best he has had in Toronto.  \n\nThe bread - amazing! I love the walnut rye sourdough. \nThe almond cookies - amazing! They are so moist and flavourful. \n\nCounter style service is super friendly and attentive.\n\nReally I haven't had anything here that was a miss.\n\nOh yah - the foccacia with rosemary and tomatoes. It is a must try!
