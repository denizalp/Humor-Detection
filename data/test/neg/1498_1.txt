Located in the Grand Canal Shoppes in the Venetian, it's a very quaint and beautiful restaurant inside. The dining area is located upstairs, request to sit near the ledge so you can see the canal. \n\nOur server was Fadhil, I'm pretty sure I spelled his name wrong. He was very attentive. The service here was actually amazing. All of the food was very good. My friends got the special seafood boat item and it was incredible, highly recommend getting that and sharing.
