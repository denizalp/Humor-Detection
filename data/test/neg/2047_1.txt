After my friend had said she had her wedding at this hotel I felt comfortable in booking a room for a long weekend. I couldn't have been happier with our accommodations. The room was so big I probably could have put another bed into it. The staff was helpful when we needed to exchange money and where we could go for a quick breakfast. With such great prices I wouldn't hesitate staying here again. The location was also very close to Notre Dame Cathedral which is one of the things you must see when you're in Montreal.
