Please....pay attention to the reviews.  Save yourself some time and money by driving past this place.   Our server was very nice, Bonnie but she was the only nice thing there.   Slowest service ever and so not worth the wait.  Marginal food at best.   I heard that the greens and okra were good but I only saw them on my bill, they never made it to the table and after being there for 3 hours I couldn't bear another second waiting to take them to go.   Not worth a trip to the valley.
