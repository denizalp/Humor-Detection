Any place that has $1 per oz wine, I will be a huge fan. The beef Carpaccio was pretty salty. Pizze Funghi  was good enough. I enjoyed the atmosphere. It's a cool space and good for a group of friends to go hang out and eat. I don't know about a date because its pretty loud in there - and that was on a Monday. Worth checking out for sure.
