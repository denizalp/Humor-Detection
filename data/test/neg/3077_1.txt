Nice ambiance, and very clean.  Friendly staff.  The atmosphere said that jazz or standards should be playing, but instead, they seemed to have found a copy of \"Greatest Hits of the 90's,\" so it was odd to have \"Mmm-Bop\" by Hanson playing while eating at a borderline-upscale restaurant.  I'd go back, but only if they promise not to bombard me with the Spice Girls. ;)
