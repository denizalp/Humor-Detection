Used to be one of my favorite buffet places in Vegas but after my two recent visits here, I don't think I will be back again. They have less food choices compared to before, also not as beautifully presented anymore. Food is average here - the ox bone pho soup (or something like that) was COLD, the risotto was undercooked and the tuna poke was not fresh at all. For $53 (tax and tips not included) per person, the quality of the food here is unacceptable. No wonder we didn't have to line up anymore like before :(
