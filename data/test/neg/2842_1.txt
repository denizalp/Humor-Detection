Ate here late night after flying in. Was starved, and the Burger Joint was in the Flamingo where we were staying.\nExpected overpriced food (it was) but did not expect the Quesadilla i ordered to be pretty much a tortilla with a full block of cheese inside. Too greasy really to eat.\nMy bf's burger however was not too bad (although pricey)\nDefinitely said I'd avoid it the rest of the trip, however once friends arrived ended up there another late night for wings...guess convenience wins in Vegas.\n(one bonus is getting a discount if you are a Total Rewards member)
