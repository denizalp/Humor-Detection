The best Italian restaurant in Boulder City! The blackened salmon and the chicken Marsala are my favorite dishes. The cook is amazing! Very friendly place they treat you like family I feel like I am back home. Tracy was my waitress she had a very bubbly and positive attitude, was always checking on us making sure we had everything we needed! I would rate this restaurant a 10\/10 hands down! Definitely an amazing place to try!!!
