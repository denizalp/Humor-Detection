The service was mediocre and unfortunately the burger wasn't much better. It was my first visit and I tried the 'ghost' burger. The patty was nothing special and it had no spice whatsoever. I was meeting friends and the waitress just let us sit there with nothing to drink because we had already received our checks. I will not be back. So not impressed.
