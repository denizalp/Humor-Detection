This is the nicest Swiss chalet I've been into- well lit,  nice decor. Once I walked in there was a chef talking to the customers so that's one impressive sign. Manager gave me a the spc deal for free app even though they don't accept it anymore. Coconut shrimp was amazing. Better than frozen ones I've had in other restaurants.  The wait was a little long,  they were low on chicken.  I didn't made the wait,  it just means I'm getting it fresh!  Quality of food is impressive.  Service is a little slow tho
