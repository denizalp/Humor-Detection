The search process was effortless. The MLS listings were very informative and helped me from my out-of-state search. Stacy Calvert was always available for phone calls emails texts and of course in person viewing of properties. My three purchases went through seamlessly one little tiny hitch but we Got past it. Three properties purchased and closed without barely a problem. Good work capstone and especially Stacy thank you.
