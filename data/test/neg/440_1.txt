Very pleasantly surprised!! My husband and I purchased Foodie Fit meals - we will definitely keep ordering- organic meat is used and the meals taste so fresh and homemade!! I am so happy I took the chance and placed an order online- oh, they deliver next day too!! So convenient- very happy customer!! Two thumbs up for sure.
