This place is great! It's new and very clean. The owners are very friendly and actually interact with u and your kids. They have a play yard, ball pit, bounce house w\/slide, little trampoline, lots of activities. I'm glad they opened one on this side of town even tho it's a little hard to get to since it's smack in the middle of sunset. Will definitely be coming back
