The small plates provide a great selection and they are very good as well as creative. The entrees are well done but the selection is limited and uninspired -- short ribs, skirt steak, roasted chicken. I liked the food and the drinks were fantastic, but the ambience is as if you are in a mall. I'd go back but wouldn't seek it out. The food at the Mandalay is generally mediocre, so this is one of the best spots if you need to stay on site.
