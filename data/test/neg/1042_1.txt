Retired from a Fortune 500 company focused on customer service, I pay close attention to that detail when experiencing someone servicing our home. John at Castle Electric goes above and beyond with service. He \"more than satisfies\" his customers. When he left our home, we were not only more than satisfied, but also pleased with his professional attitude and the incredible work that John did. I highly recommend John at Castle Electric & Lighting.
