I like the restaurant.  I like the guy who works there.  I used to really like the lunch buffet. Unfortunately my lunch changed from 11:30 to 1:00.  At 1:00 the buffet food has a look like it might have been there from 11:00  am and looks old.  I have asked but that's what ya get. So I can say the food is really good when they first open in the morning not so good as the lunch buffet sits.
