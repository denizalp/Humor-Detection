Initially I was concerned about my purchase experience. After calling and speaking with the finance manager, I am thrilled with the service. The finance manager went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with my experience. I'm still a little miffed with the salesperson, but the post-sale service more than made up for the issue I had. I recommend San Tan Volkswagen.
