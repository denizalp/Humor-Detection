Great space and welcoming atmosphere with some Toronto historic nostalgia. The instructors are very knowledgeable, encouraging and motivational. I've taken classes with Marya and Winnie (forgive me if I spelled your names wrong) who were really helpful when it came to form and theory. Really can not ask for more when it comes to a drop in class, as I hit this studio up whenever I am in town!
