Worst dentist office ever. They over work there employees, all they care about is money. This is a business not a real caring dental office. They will schedule you an appointment even if you did not schedule one, just to fill their schedule so that hopefully you will come in. They treat the hygienist like cleaning machines making them see 3 patients in one hour. DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!!!
