I was looking for an alkaline water delivery company and I found Nevada Crystal Premium on the internet.  I called after 4:30pm on Wednesday and they came to my home the next day with my new crock and 3-3 gal bottles of water!  Much cheaper than buying water in retail stores and they offer alkaline water which is healthy for the body.  The water is also available in BPA Free bottles which I selected.  I signed a one year contract which is ok with me since I'm the winner in getting the water I want!
