Went here while visiting Las Vegas and glad we did. The atmosphere had upbeat vibe but still a homey and cozy. Bar area was huge, I like that the restaurant and bar area where two separate rooms but were accessible easily from the outside. Portions of food we're very well portioned not too much but just enough to fill you up, food was fresh and drinks were cold. Waitress was very friendly and attentive will definitely go back on our next visit.
