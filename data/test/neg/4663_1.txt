We sat down for the late night menu, because that's what the hostess said to do. Sat down.... waited for 20 minutes. We asked a waiter to have to the server of our table to please come see us. 10 more minutes. Nothing. We walked out and left. Terrible service. Decent atmosphere. Would be way better if the service had actually been decent.
