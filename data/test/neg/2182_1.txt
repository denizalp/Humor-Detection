Hubby and I were looking for a bar with live music and food that would act as a precursor to the Jackson Browne concert at The Phoenix Symphony Hall. It was an excellent choice and was walking distance from the venue. The music was very enjoyable! Food was above average. Great start to what would prove to be a memorable date night! Will definitely go again! \n\nWe split the turkey club. They use a basil mayo that was out of this world YUMMY!
