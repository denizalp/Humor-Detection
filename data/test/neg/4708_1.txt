Delivery.   They overload on the veggiesi unless you order beef no broccoli.  Higher prices than the quality of food .  Really nice girl takes phone orders .  Delivery driver quicker than their eta usually.  But overall  fair-good.  We order from there often (mostly due to lack of options ) but more often than not are pleased when we do.
