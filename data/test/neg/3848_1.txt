Ordered the veggie combo, and it took forever to come out of the kitchen. Well over 30 minutes, with no explanation. No one even checked on us.  And then the food itself was completely underwhelming.  It was heavy and oily, and not particularly flavorful.  Bottom line: It comes no where close to Abugida Cafe, so next time we will go there instead.  Plus Abugida has the friendliest staff and the flavorful, fresh food comes out promptly.  It's a no brainer.
