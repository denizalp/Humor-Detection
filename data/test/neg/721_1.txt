For me, Indian food should be plenty and delicious! Like Real Mexican food, you should feel special and having lots of options with fresh vegetables an inexpensive luxury. \nWell, this is not the case here. Although I understand it's Vegas, I don't understand the tiny portions and the exhorbitante costs. It's Indian food, for heaven's sake! It's not 15 year old jam√≥n serrano!!!!
