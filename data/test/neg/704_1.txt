This place was highly rated, but honestly its nothing really to special. Nothing more then a regular burger. No real distinctive favour to make it memorable. It wasnt a bad burger but it wasn't great. It's a bit more pricy for a simple burger. Probably not going head back for the reason it is out of my way and it's nothing special.
