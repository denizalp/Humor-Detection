Visiting my parents and found this place on yelp so decided to give it a try.  I had carnitas torta, dad had enchiladas and mom had wet asada burrito.  We each really enjoyed our meals.  Flavor, freshness, portion size, price - very good.  Yum salsa bar as well.  I would like it better if they sold beer!  Would have given 5 stars, but I thought it was strange my torta came with stinky Parmesan fries... if I'd paid more attention when I ordered I would have substituted.  Will definitely be back, use the drive thru and\/or uber eats.
