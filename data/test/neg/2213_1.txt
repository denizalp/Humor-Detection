Really enjoyed this restaurant. The salad bar was unique, featuring items that are not on your typical salad bar. I liked that in addition to the endless meat and salad bar, they also bring garlic mashed potatoes, fried bananas, and small Brazilian breads to your table. The meat was really good, besides some of the VERY fatty pieces I was served that were inedible. I ordered the specialty Brazilian cocktail they serve, which was good, but too sweet for my taste. Others at my table enjoyed the drink very much.
