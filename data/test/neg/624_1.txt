Under normal circumstances Darband would get a 4\/5 rating. However because they are open 24\/7 and serve proper food around the clock they deserve a 5\/5. Their quality of food has recently improved a lot and their prices are very reasonable for what you get. It is not a high-end restaurant of course. The newly improved Halim is a great choice, which is also a bit rare to find in the GTA.
