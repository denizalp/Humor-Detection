After being quoted an astronomical fee from Mini of Las Vegas for repair work, I took my Cooper to FH at the recommendation of a friend.  I could not be happier!  The \"issue\" that Mini originally advised of didn't even exist - 75% of my original quote later I was on my way.  Thank you to the off the charts customer service from Jesse, Judy, Christian & Gavin on the Service Team.  Everyone I came into contact with went out of their way to help and were super friendly!  Thank you, I will be back!
