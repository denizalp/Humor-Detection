Open 24\/7 throwback to East Coast bars. Surprisingly large menu of italian favorites(in house made sausage), the best wings in LV and and a decent selection of beer. Prices are very reasonable and the service is good.  Tremendous amount of cigarette smoke is the only drawback. Good place to watch a game, drink ice cold beer and eat simply done bar food.
