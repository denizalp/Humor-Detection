In a nutshell, these guys suck. I don't know if it's limited to this location or if it's just the company in general, but I am given a hard time and lied to about pricing every time I have had to use them. They have unfortunately been the most convenient option over the past year, which is why I have used them a handful of times. After my most recent experience, however, I don't care how convenient they are, they are scumbags. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else for a rental car.
