Went in for a simple oil change, I was told the engine mounts were leaking and needed replacing. The engine mounts on my car do not have contain fluid .  I had the car engine mounts inspected at the car dealer , and were found to be in good condition and did not need replacement. Shame on this repair shop trying to add on repairs that do not need to be repaired.
