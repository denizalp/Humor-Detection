This wasn't my first time of poke experience. I went to New York and fell in love with Poke. I like Hoki poke because they offer all the basic toppings without extra charge. We had veggie bowl and veggie burrito. The combination with the sauce and other ingredients taste good. small place like any other poke shops. fast& friendly service.
