We were a parry of seven with five Asians and the consensus was an exceptional cuisine and service.  We had over seven different dishes we shared and they were all just perfect so no need to suggest any particular dish \n.. Any type that suits you I'm sure will be tasty.  The server was very attentive with proper settings with dishes and soup bowl. Definitely worth a return trip.
