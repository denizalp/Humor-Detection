I was so excited for my food order-being that they are rated high on DoorDash .. I ordered orange chicken, fried rice , and spring rolls. It unfortunately tasted like bad oil. Every single part has a horrible after taste( like the kind you get after taking a liquid medicine. ) I am so bummed this had to be my first experience with DoorDash.
