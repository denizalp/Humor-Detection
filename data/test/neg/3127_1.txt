I had a positive experience visiting this location. Mike and Pat were very helpful, thorough, and pleasant. I was in need of a new bed set and they were able to direct me towards my budget and preferences. \n\nOverall, the inventory is conveniently displayed and there are many great deals to explore, especially around the holidays. I would recommend this location and company to all!
