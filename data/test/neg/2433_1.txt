Mcfate is a good brewery with a great selection of beers on tap. I think there were at least 15 of their beers available on top which is pretty remarkable. There's lots of indoor seating as well as indoor and outdoor bar seating and a large patio area. The only downside to the patio is that there's a lot of road traffic from Scottsdale Road. The food is good and the service was prompt and accurate.
