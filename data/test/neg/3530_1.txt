One of the best things I've done in Las Vegas. I'm a designer and typographer so it was paradise for me, but my friends who are not found it amazing too. It was nice to get off the strip and learn a little history and get close to the sheer scale of the old signs. i'm so glad someone decided to preserve these treasures instead of blowing them up!
