We came here for dinner before a show at Playhouse Square on a Thursday and sadly, both the food and service was average. We tried the arancini and meatball appetizers, the arancini ended up being the best thing we ate all night. The meatballs were good size but the sauce was bland and it's the same sauce they put on top of the overly breaded chicken parm entree. We also tried the carbonara pasta and the sauce was fairly decent but the chicken made everything kind of slimy. Overall it seemed like a 'high end' Macaroni Grill.
