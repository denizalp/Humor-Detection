Great service - great looking arrangements. I was just about to drive away because the front doors were locked, when the owner came back from getting a drink at a store in the same parking lot. Suggestion - leave a note on the window saying you will be back in 5 minutes. You almost  lost a sale because I was in the process of driving away when I saw you unlock the front door. Will definitely use again.
