We had a good experience with Fair Ride Sedan going from our hotel near Talking Stick to the airport. The SUV was clean and comfortable. The driver was an attorney who was knowledgeable about Phoenix and arrived 10 minutes early. While the price, $43, was a few dollars more than the Shuttle, it was worth it.
