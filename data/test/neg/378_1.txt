I get my Thanksgiving turkey religiously every year from Seven Grains.  With that being said, I rarely head over to Tallmadge to randomly shop, since the roundabout drives me mad.\n\nI agree with the others, it's small, so the selection isn't that great.  They do have an ok size gluten free selection.\n\nThe turkey is wonderful, and I would recommend it to anyone.  My family is still talking about last years turkey.
