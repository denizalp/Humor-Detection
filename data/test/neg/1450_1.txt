Last day of the year and only two ppl behind counter at 11:00 am.  Wait was 1.5 hrs and line was doubled back on itself.  Staff didnt seem motivated or concerned about customer service.  This is we what keeps the stereotype alive.  I've been to dmv offices that are speedy and service oriented, this aint it.
