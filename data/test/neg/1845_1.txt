Too bad this place is not a secret! \nHowever it is a hidden gem at the cosmopolitan. The line looks long, but moves quick! \n\nI only had a chance to try the white cheese pizza. Wished I had room for pepperoni!\nI believe it's cottage cheese on top of this pizza.. And I'm not a cottage cheese person at all! Nice thin crust. \n\nThis is one my top 5 places for piazza!
