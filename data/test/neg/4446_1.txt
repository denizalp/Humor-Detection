This little gem was the location of a \"Pittsburgh Pop Up Yoga Event.\" I never knew it existed prior to tonight. The wine cellar is amazing. I would love to host a private party in this location. Parking was easy and convenient. The aesthetics were awesome and the space for the event was beautiful. We fit 75 yogis on the main floor.
