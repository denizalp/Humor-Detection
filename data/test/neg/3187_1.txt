We have been going to Jeff for about 17 years. He is a very straight shooter and a most pleasant person to work with. He does a thorough job of producing a honest tax return with a complete printed record folder. It is worth the drive and the reasonable expense to go to him every year for this. He also always has some accurate advice if requested.
