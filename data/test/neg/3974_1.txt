I ordered a cake for my son's 13th birthday I told them which one I wanted from the book they had and when I went to pick it up the next day it was completely different from the picture sold me a cake from the front cooler instead of making me a fresh cake when I went to go back to complain about my cake they made me a new one that looked exactly the same way they have horrible customer service I will never order a cake here again or shop at the Smiths again!
