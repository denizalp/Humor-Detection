For a Tuesday evening the place was jam-packed. The staff was very polite and efficient, we were seated fairly quickly. The food was absolutely fantastic. I ordered the rigatoni which was cooked exactly how I like it. I polished off the plate in minutes. Best meal I've had in a while. Will definitely be going back for more.
