This was my first time eating at this place . The food was good but we ordered mild and it was anything but mild. We like some kick but this felt like it was more of medium to hot level of spice. If you put mild on the menu you need to honor that. It was so hot for us that we didn't enjoy it as much had it actually been mild. Service was average.
