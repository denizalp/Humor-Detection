I'm so glad I came to this studio in 2011, (formally known as Bikram Yoga) which is now, The Foundry.  They have added more diverse classes to change up your workout, Yoga, Pilates, Barre and you never know what they might add next! It's Fantastic!. \nOnce you come here you NEVER want to leave! All the yogis that come here make up such a welcoming community!\nLove this Place...
