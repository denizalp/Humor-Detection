What a joke and scam this place is trying to charge me $140 to tell me if my warranty is going to cover a broken part when its covered it before. I would stay away from this place and go to Earnhardt Chevrolet where they got have diagnostic fees for only $75 instead of a hundred and forty and they let you know ahead of time if your warranty covers it
