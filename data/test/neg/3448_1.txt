I have lived here for over a year and haven't eaten at the Herb Box until last night. Didn't realize what I've been missing out on! This place was amazing! Ashton our server was awesome and gave us excellent recommendations (ahem Thai Ribs...) Not only was the service great the whole ambiance topped it off. The Art Festival and Live Music. Love it.
