After seven visits, Kobe kills me. Service is always a hit or miss. Food is standard, not great, not bad. Portions are usually fair. Very unusual policies, no AYCE if anyone in your party does normal menu or happy hour, and vice, some other weird things. Manager always ready to apologize for issues, an indication apologizes are routine. My recommendation would be drive a mile or two in either direction and try your luck elsewhere if branching out or looking for a new go to spot.
