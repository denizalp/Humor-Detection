Great barber shop! You can be in and out in less than 30 min. I got my hair cut by, Nelson, yesterday and it was probably the best hair cut I've ever gotten. I'm particular about my hair cut and even had a picture to show him of what I was going for and he was very detailed through the process. I also liked that he didn't push for a bunch of conversation. Just a clean haircut and you're on your way. Great experience.
