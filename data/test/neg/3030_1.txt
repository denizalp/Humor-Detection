RATING: B +\n\nSERVICE: B\n\nAMBIANCE: B \n\nOVERVIEW: Great variety on their menu. The presentation of the food was one of the best parts of this spot. Nothing too special about this place. Definitely a great breakfast spot to check out. They have a wide array of different coffee options. I will definitely return if I am in the mood for a breakfast spot.
