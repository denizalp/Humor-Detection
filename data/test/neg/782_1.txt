I love this place. Good food, great atmosphere, and awesome service. I really enjoy the lunch bento combos and everything tastes pretty fresh The tempura isn't that great but overall it's always an enjoyable dining experience. The prices are great too, I would highly recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone.
