This is a great family owed spot with good food, good drinks, and well-chosen live music.  It's very casual, so if you want fancy, this is not for you...but if you want a friendly staff and crowd and great food at reasonable prices, this is a real find.  Good job to Jerry and Lisa for making the Clearview Inn such a winner.
