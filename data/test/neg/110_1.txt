After a long journey up Interstate 15, we arrived to the welcoming, bright lights of the Strip.  The first thing we needed to do was kill the hunger from the long road trip.  Someone suggested Raising Canes and promised we wouldn't be disappointed.  He was correct.  Tasty chicken fingers and the bread was good too.  The best sweet tea since I was in North Carolina.  Five days later, we had to return to this place before our journey home.
