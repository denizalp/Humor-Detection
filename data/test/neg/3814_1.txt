Took the hubby here for his birthday so that we could enjoy the lakeside view and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience! We both thought our food was fire and our son enjoyed watching the singers go back and forth for birthdays. Prior to our visit, I had told the hostess over the phone that it was his birthday night and she passed it along. Our waiter and singers waited until we were just about ready to go, then swarmed the table with music and a shot of tequila for the birthday boy! Great atmosphere, food and a scenic view
