Great place to get some Pho! Delicious food and great drinks! Had the Beef Pho and the taste was quite authentic, the only drawback was the portion for a large and extra large were the same? Which was not too much.\nIt's a mom and pop place so the service is very friendly and makes you feel welcome. It is also their weak point as they have to multi-task so the service is slower.
