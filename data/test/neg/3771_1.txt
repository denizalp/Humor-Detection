Sounds like we found a new place to dine at! Decor and ambience fit perfectly at this location! Salad bar and All meats were great! We will definitely return to this place as we have already been to this location several times.  The Manager Shawna and our Server Erin were fantastic and very nice! Never a bad experience, Second to none in the Valley!
