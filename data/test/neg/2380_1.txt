My home inspection report was detailed with explanations & photos. Tim Ganey & Sky inspected my house. They were very friendly, professional and attentive to every detail of my house. Tim gave great recommendations on what needed to be addressed. I am so happy that I hired them because I can tell they take pride & integrity in their work. I got a full report the next day. I highly recommend them. Worth every dollar.
