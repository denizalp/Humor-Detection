Was very pleasant atmosphere and the staff was great, very attentive.  Had the Sushi Combo lunch and it was fresh and tasty.  The only thing I was disappointed with was the Portion size of the Nigri was small compared to other Japanese restaurant in the area.  Loved their Crunch Roll and their Miso soup too.  All in all a great addition to the neighborhood.
