I hate when my appliances break down, but I'm happy to know that I can count on E&J to provide an honest fix. When it's not worth repairing, they'll tell you. If it's an easy repair, they won't overcharge you. \n\nNo high pressure sales tactics here. Just reliable trustworthy service. \n\nKeep up the great work.
