if you are looking for authentic Chinese food, this is the place.    I have tried several restaurants in Chinatown but found others taste more \"fusion\" than authentic.\nI ordered several small dishes, great price and goes well with the pulled noodles.  \nIf you enjoy noodles, I would highly recommend this place.
