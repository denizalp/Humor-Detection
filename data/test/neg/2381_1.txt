My hair stylist rents a space at this location.  It's kept neat and clean.  There are nail stations to the right, private hair styling rooms to the left as well as products for sale on shelving in the foyer.  There are rows of styling chairs and a hair washing area behind the front desk foyer.  I've always had a pleasant experience each time I go there for my haircuts.  I've not tried any other service at this location.
