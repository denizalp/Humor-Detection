I haven't been to an El Pollo Loco for ages for some reason I can't explain, I guess I forgot how good they were. Juicy flame-broiled chicken, a great selection of sides, warm tortilla, and salsa bar with fresh ingredients, what's not to like?! This location is very nice, clean and well maintained.
