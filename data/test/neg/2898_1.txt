Booked and had to reschedule due to weather. Did the Hoover dam Express. 4 mile kayak, 3 mile hike. \nKayak was easy. Kayaked with current on flat water. Was pretty weather was nice. Guide preston was informative. \n\nThe hike was more difficult. Weather outside the canyon was much warmer. Jenna our guide was very energetic and kept the convo going. \n\nThomas the driver was fun also. Told stories. Showed pics of his trips. \n\n\nGet you some water shoes and quick drying shorts. You'll get wet. \n\nBut go for the trip.  Dont be scared
