The sushi\/maki is poor (avocado was all brown for example) the hot food is not very good (even edamame tasted weird) and the service is mediocre. The way you order is different than other restaurants and very annoying.  Only decent thing was the sashimi which tasted pretty much normal. The restaurant itself looks nice and seemed clean.
