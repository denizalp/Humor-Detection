yum yum tasty mochas.\n\ni haven't sampled all the other drinks, but i'm a mocha girl, so i was happy.  a great blend of stronger coffee but not burnt beans like other places tend to do, mike's place makes a darn good cup o' joe.\n\ni will be back, and after all, supporting other yelpers and their great businesses is what it's all about.\n\nword, mike.  keep on rockin' in the bean world.\n\ni mean, even neil young thinks so.\n\ncongrats on opening, and i will be back for more tasty caffeinated goodness, and to sample the food :)
