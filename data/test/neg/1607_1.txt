It starts with great management-Nick! The waitstaff is knowledgable and friendly. \nThe mussels are terrific. Drinks top notch. Seafood tastes fresh with sauces and spices to complement but not commandeer the dishes.\n\nThe atmosphere is inviting and understandably nautical. Whether it's for happy hour drink and a bite, fun group dining or romantic dinner for two, Tempest will not disappoint!
