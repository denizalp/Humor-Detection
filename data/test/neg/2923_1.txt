I would agree that Metclafe's is best for speciality foods and arrangements that you aren't going to find elsewhere. For me the shining star in this category would have to be their fantastic selection of cheeses. They offer every kind imaginable, prioritizing on showcasing local creameries. Well the prices may seem a little steep in comparison to the day to day connivence of Woodman's, it's well worth it for the premium selection of local and international cheeses.
