Nice shaping of the brows done by the main lady. The other lady there, not so much because she messed up my daughter's eyebrows. It came out a bit crooked and certain hairs that my daughter wanted to be removed were still there.. Also, customer service is not so great. I said bye to the ladies twice as I was walking out and I never got a response.
