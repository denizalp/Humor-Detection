Hands down some of THE best ramen I've ever had and I'm from Hawaii where we have some awesome ramen places. I got the shoyu ramen. The broth really makes it delicious! Its not too salty which is perfect! Also, the bamboo shoots and mushrooms in it were amazing! The restaurants a small and we went around 5 and it was slowly getting packed, but the food comes out fast so service is speedy. I probably wont go anywhere else for ramen in Vegas ever again!
