I really enjoyed my dinner tonight. They sat me pretty quickly and my waiter, Rafael, was great. I am pretty much eating healthy so it was great to see all the salads they had. No one rushed me and I was able to just able to take my time and enjoy the evening, I wouldn't make this a regular place because of the price, but special occasions will see me back there.
