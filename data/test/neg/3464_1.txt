Got to visit silver post two days after opening their new location in downtown Summerlin. I brought my mother who lives in Georgia to silver post to get some authentic southwestern jewelry, which she found lots of! The owner, Aaron, was there to give us lots of information on the native American artist an actual stones. Wonderful experience and great staff just like the town Square location!
