The food was on the downside of average and the service was non-existent.  The two waiters really appeared as though they did not want to be bothered.  I really never should have sat down.  I had Thai fried rice and soup.  Nothing difficult.  Needless to say, that was my first and last time there.  The place was not inviting.
