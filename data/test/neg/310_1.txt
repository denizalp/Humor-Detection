I came here on a busy Saturday afternoon to get a TAG watch bracelet band with links repaired (I needed a new bar and pin). They were friendly, assisted me right away, charged a fair price (compared to others downtown), replaced the bar and pin and reattached the link on the spot, and even did a quick clean of the watch band bracelet which was not expected but appreciated. Highly recommend this place!
