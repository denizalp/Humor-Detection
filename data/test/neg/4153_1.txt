Recently stopped at cold beer and cheeseburgers, thought I would try one of their sandwiches, the atmosphere was nice the service was good and the burger ,I'd give it a 8 out of 10. I did find it it was a little pricey for this type of establishment. But all in all if you're looking for a good place to eat ,good food ,good service, give it a try !
