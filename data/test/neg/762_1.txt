I guess this review won't be of use to anyone but still think that I have to speak up my mind. Indeed, it is always empty, no crowds, no distractions. You just walk the aisles and choose what you want. You can find good deals there but watch out for the price tags. You want find popular brand there, though. Mass market goods are good and worth of consideration.
