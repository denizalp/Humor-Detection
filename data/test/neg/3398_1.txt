If I could give 3.5 stars I would. The food was really good, the menu was up to par for a regular BBQ joint. I guess I felt like it would be a little more unique. The decor is decent, but they could have done more with the inside. It has a little bit of a stale feeling inside. However, the food made up for it and I hope they make it. I will be back.
