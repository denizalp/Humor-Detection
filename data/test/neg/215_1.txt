The first time I visited this location, my wax was $25 because I was a first time client. I have been coming back ever since. I really appreciate that I am able to change my appointment time if it conflicts with my schedule and I don't have to pay a fee. The only thing I don't like is every time I make an appointment, I have to wait at least 10 minutes for my waxer to service me. I would much rather be able to walk in and be serviced right away.
