I recently had some crown work done at Festival Dental. Dr Brown was impressive. I've never had a dentist call me after the fact to make sure I was satisfied with the results and if not, to make it right no matter what. To me, it showed she really cared about her patients and not just profit in her pocket. The staff is really friendly and organized - the technology up to date.I would highly recommend this office & Dr Brown.
