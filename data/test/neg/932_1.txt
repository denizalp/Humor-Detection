LOVE Arriverderci! My husband & I were introduced to the restaurant by friends and we've been several times since. The food is always excellent (I get the chicken parm) and my husband has never been disappointed with an order. The dessert is delicious too! We either get the chocomisu (they don't call it tiramisu) ) or the pistachio\/chocolate dessert. I want to try the hazelnut one too! \nThe staff is so friendly and accommodating; they really make it a great experience. \nWe will definitely be returning!
