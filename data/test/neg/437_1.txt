We had a wonderful experience here. We were scheduled to fly to Chicago with our two dogs in the evening  when suddenly our one dog became sick. We called 1st Pet and headed over. They saw us immediately. Our dog had a very upset stomach and we were unsure if she ate something she shouldn't have. After testing her and treating her. We left feeling confident she was well enough to travel with that night. She was. 1St Pet is pricey when you're dealing with an emergency but the care they give and immediate results are worth it!
