The first thing I noticed upon sitting down was the noise.  Wow is it noisy!  I will not return as I could not enjoy being there due to the noise.  I could not hear the person I was with, who sat across the table from me.  Everytime someone pushed out their chair, I crindged!  Regarding the food, it was so,so.  I had an omelet with onions and peppers (blah), chunk potatoes hash browns (they were overly peppered), and sour dough bread (looked great, but no taste).  Coffee was the best!  Customer Service was excellent!  Disappointed after all the hype!
