Delicious food, reasonable price, clean dining, clean restrooms, their teriyaki sauce taste really good I could finish the whole bottle, customer service is great, they were all friendly! The guy at the cashier smiles a lot and greets customers well, I am here every other night and the guy is really nice and already knows what I am going to order, he is funny. Seems like he and his co workers really love what they are doing, would recommend this place for all teriyaki lovers.
