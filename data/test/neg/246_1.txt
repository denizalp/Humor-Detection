I am re-editing to a 5 as my last post is no longer true once they opened up the second location on Cimarron.   My 4 star was from the small waiting area, packed hallways, and the rush of kids going in and out of class when the hour is up during the evening classes but now it's so much nicer. I can find parking. There is a seat for me to wait!\nThe instructors are great.  Daughter now in Pink team and my little one just started in Super Cubs and she loves it.
