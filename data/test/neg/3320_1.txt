It was hard to get to as the MGM Park Hotel is being remodeled\/ f\/k\/a the Monte Carlo, we had to walk all the way around the strip to a side street....The acoustics were good and a lot of seats had great stage views due to the layout of the theatre-  we saw Queen and it rocked - exceeded my expectations - it's Vegas and shows can be pricey - but again the cheaper seats are not BAD seats
