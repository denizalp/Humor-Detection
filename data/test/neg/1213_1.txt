I love Kirklands! This is my favorite \"To Go\" store when shopping for Home Decor, they have such a beautiful selection of home accessories. Whether you're looking for candles, wall art, decorative pillows, mirrors... This place has it! The ladies at this particular store where very friendly and made me feel very welcomed. I can't wait to go back and get some more stuff! We are updating our guest room and guess where Im getting my items from? Yup! Kirklands 100%
