What has happen to SS over the last few months. Waiting over an hour 2 times to get a van even though i had a reservation and waiting at the airport for more fares and making people wait. Last driver did not move from lot for 30 to 40 minutes after being assigned as we watched him on the app. Customer service rep at curb side called him to fet him moving
