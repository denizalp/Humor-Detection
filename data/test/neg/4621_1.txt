Pretty good beer  selection (with a name like Draught, I would expect no less). Solid food offerings too. Jill did a nice job steering us to the scallop salad and the Caesar chicken sandwich. Both were filing, tasty and satisfying. Don't miss the pretzel with beer cheese!\n\nSunday brunch tends to skew young and the service on Sundays can be a bit (we'll just be generous here) relaxed (which is really to say absent, indifferent, and slow).
