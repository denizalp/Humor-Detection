This place only stays open till 1am so make sure you get there in decent time.  The food was great the service was great the prices were reasonable. The portions are big and the leftovers the next day tasted even better!!!  They have the largest variety of Boba I've ever seen in my entire life. They have tofu dishes good for vegetarians like myself.
