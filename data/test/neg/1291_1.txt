Best sandwiches of my life! Friendly staff, too. I get bored easily with sandwiches, but the Goodwich sandwiches are inspirational. The patty is so rich and flavorful without being greasy or overwhelming. The pork of the day last week was incredible, such a work of art! Many of their sandwiches are twists on classic ones that make you wonder how people lived so long with just the normal, boring version. Wish I could eat here every day!\n\nLove love love!
