This is the cutest little bakery and their breads and goodies are just simply the best!  We went from eating another brand of good, popular bread to this and we will never go back!  We are totally spoiled!  Their apple Cinnamon loaf is the best for making French toast!  My sister asked me today what my favorite thing there is and I couldn't pick!  Love it all!  Everyone who works there is super sweet as well!  (No pun intended!). If you live in Gilbert or East Mesa you have to check this place out!
