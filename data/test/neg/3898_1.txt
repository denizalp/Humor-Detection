A decent little market with plenty of snack and drink options. A great bar with tons of local crafts beers. A fine deli but you can easily find better deli options in the CLT area within the same radius. The big turn off at the market to me was the staff. Deli employees were great and friendly. Cashiers and other workers came off as rude and, for a local market place\/deli, i would expect more.
