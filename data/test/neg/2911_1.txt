Thanks Yelpers, I found this place when looking for a place to have breakfast and all the good reviews were spot on.  The menu is limited but the food is delicious.  The only reason why I don't give it 5 starts is because of space in the restaurant, but other than that, it is a great place and I'm definitely coming back when I'm back in Phoenix.
