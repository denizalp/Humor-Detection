The casual atmosphere was great. The was very fresh. Side salad with house dressing and hot fresh Italian bread was wonderful. The entrees were Shrimp Scampi and Chicken Sorrento. fresh shrimp and tomatoes, angel hair pasta. Reminded us of the same quality food we had while in Italy. Rated it a four because my wife likes her tomatoes chopped a little smaller. Other than that it is a 5. Friendly staff and very attentive. Price was very good. $40.71 for the two entrees with salad and one glass of wine. Very reasonable price.
