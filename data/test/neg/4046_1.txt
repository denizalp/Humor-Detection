I won't be coming back to this location because two phlebotomists now have demonstrated that they don't know what they're doing. Their multiple attempts and using the needle to chase veins under the skin are painful and leave black and blue bruises. This is supposed to be a professional services office but I've had no luck finding a professional to draw my blood here.
