Once again some time has passed before we came here for dinner but we find ourselves happy we made our way back. The meal starts off with a simple salad and some fabulous biscuits and the entree was a massive serving of chicken fried chicken. We left happy and stuffed. The service was friendly efficient and there is a lot of look at on the walls and ceiling. It does appear that the menu is much smaller since our last visit but we got what we went there for so that was no concern to us.
