I finally decided to give this place a try and it was nothing but great. I've had a few different baristas every time but they're always very quick, efficient and nice. The coffee itself is pretty decent as well. Ice American is my favorite! Their other drinks are good too, not overpowered by sugars like a lot of other places drinks. Haven't gotten a chance to fully enjoy the inside but I'm really looking forward to go in and working on some hw with a good cup of Joe.
