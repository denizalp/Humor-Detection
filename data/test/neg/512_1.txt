The only thing good about this place was a soda and karaoke night the food wasn't good at all I had to nachos the buffalo wings and mozzarella sticks the mozzarella sticks were poorly season didn't taste like much the nachos were borderline disgusting and actually then buffalo wings weren't that bad.
