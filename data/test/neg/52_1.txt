Nice ambiance inside and outside but just OK beyond that.  The service was good but there ends the pros. The beer selection was minimal (and no IPAs) and the food OK but nothing special.  When I think I could have made a much better meal at home I realize why we don't eat out that often.  The salad was Iceberg lettuce which to me is a turn off = no nutritional value and no flavor.  In summary, our first and last visit here.
