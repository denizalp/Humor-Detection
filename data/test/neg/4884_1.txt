The tellers (or I should say teller) try's there best. Way understaffed for a high volume location... They know it and don't care. Huge lines and the tellers have no sense of urgency, they ramble on with customers about personal life talk. I'm standing here on a Monday at 4:40 ... The line has 17 people in it now. People are frustrated
