I walked into this small shop today around 12pm after a massage appointment across the street. I had some time to kill before lunch with a friend and their pedis were reasonably priced ($28+tax), so I decided to try them out. The staff offered me freshly made coffee upon entering and I was sitting down within five minutes. It appears to be family run, a mom and her daughter were working, at the time. I had a really good conversation with the daughter, who worked on me. Everything looked really clean and my pedicure turned out great.
