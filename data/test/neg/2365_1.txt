I'm on vacation in Ohio and my family and I had lunch and breakfast at Tommy's on 2 different days and the food was delicious, the service was wonderful! There isn't anything I didn't like. It's had a retro vibe and there is a cute little book store next door that you can explore for yourself or fun little to do with the kids.
