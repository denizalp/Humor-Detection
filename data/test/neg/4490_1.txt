Have been here 3 times already in one week!!  Sat at the bar and the service was great.  The fresh complimentary chips and salsa are wonderful.  We ordered the \"bob style\" queso and the short rib nachos.  Both were amazing!!  Each would be enough for a meal.  A cold Pacifico or a margarita is the perfect combination.  The atmosphere is super casual but don't let that fool you for the amazing food coming out of the kitchen.
