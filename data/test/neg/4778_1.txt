This is my second time renting their hall area and I have to say again I was very impressed.  The staff were helpful and very accommodating.  The price options are spot on and I believe the service alone is incomparable for the price.  The food is always fresh and the whole hall is set up to exactly your specifications.... last minute changes are no problem at all.  I've used their hall twice in the past and plan to use them for my baby shower in the near future as well.
