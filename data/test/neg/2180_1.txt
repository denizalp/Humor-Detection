This place is absolutely gorgeous! We went to this place on a Saturday night. We've been waiting in a line for about 20mins. The mix steak sample(6 different steaks, 6oz for each) are awesome! The grilled shrimp is also great! The size of the salad is really big! The fish of the day was tilapia which is not very impressive. The service was excellent! Definitely will go back for the steak and desert
