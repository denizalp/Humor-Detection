Ordered the Veggy Cheeseburger and it was fabulous! I'm excited to try more options on their menu. Order was ready super quick. I would highly recommend checking them out. They use the Beyond Meat burgers, which as a recently former meat eater, I can say are the closest thing you'll get to a traditional burger--but waaaaaayyy better!!
