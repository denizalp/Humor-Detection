Definitely a tummy pleaser ! Firefly has yet to disappoint me on my birthdays or even just group gatherings with friends. Besides the delicious tapas, the ambience is set to perfection . It reminds you being at a family get together plus the music on Latin nights makes you want to dance the entire time .
