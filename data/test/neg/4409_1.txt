This is my family's first and last time eating at this place. The staff was great but the food was absolutely horrible. I ordered $60 worth of horrendous foods. The chicken tenders I ordered with chipotle lime flavor with an extra kick was flavorless. The wings I ordered were flavorless. The cucumbers had this extremely old taste. My kids wouldn't even eat the plain cheese quesadilla and that's theyre favorite food! I'm so disappointed. For the amount of money I spent its all going to waste. I cannot force my family to eat this.
