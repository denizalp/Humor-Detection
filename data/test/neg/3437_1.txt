This was one of the best chinese buffets that I have eaten in Phoenix.  Went for lunch around 1pm.  Everything was fresh when I went.  The sushi was limited and not a great selection, but sushi can be expensive so I understand.  The price was great at $10.  I tried so many things on the buffet and liked them all.
