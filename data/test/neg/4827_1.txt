The weld on my computer chair broke, so I took it into these guys.  They are a machine and machine repair shop but they can do any welding or metal work for everyday household things.  It took about 15 minutes for them to weld the chair back together, on the same day, so I didn't need to drop something off and pick it up later.  Real friendly, quick, great service.   I highly recommend for any repair work you may need !!
