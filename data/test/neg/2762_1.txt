Really disappointed with the service. Came in at 9 and 5 employees were cleaning while only 1 person managed the line and register with 3 customers. (They close at 10). The workers cleaning were also cleaning the tubs that sit right next to the food with chemical products and were seen touching food areas with dirty rags and not changing gloves in between cleaning and handling food containers. Not cool.
