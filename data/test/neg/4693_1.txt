Definitely one of, if not the best stations casinos. A far drive for me but being right off of the 215 it wasn't that bad of a drive. Plenty of parking on all sides of the casino depending on what you looking to do. The slot area is very clean and there is not an overwhelming smoke clouds as some casinos suffer from. The Dodd court has decent options and there are plenty of dining options around the casino. I definitely wish it was a closer drive.
