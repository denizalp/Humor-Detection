They owe me $300 and I've been waiting for like 7 months. I've been calling them and even spoke to Brendan (the owner). Apparently, he has no control whatsoever over the checks and how long they take to get sent so if you want to deal with professionals that have control over these matters then don't shop here... seriously. I'm not the only person that's had this experience. Look at the other reviews to see for yourself.
