Not sure about anything other than Dee is the most personable and attentive server\/bartender on earth. Service here is awesome and the Tai Cobb Salad is off the charts. I can't speak for anything other than that as I believe I've order it about 75 times and something else about twice. If you like salmon and salad, go here and get the above-mentioned salad during lunch. Your afternoon will be better for it!
