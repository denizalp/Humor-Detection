Went for dinner.  For a $20 dinner for 2 I could have had way better.  The Beijing Style Noodle with Beef were OK yes the noodles were thick but that's about it, nothing special about the flavor.  Then ordered the Beef Soup with noodles, mushrooms.  It was the same noodles used in the Beijing style bowl.  Too much fat stuck to the beef.  The flavor was OK.  Would not go back for the amount I spent and the quantity of food I got.
