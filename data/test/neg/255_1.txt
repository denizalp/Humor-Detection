Sashimi Trio was pricey but really fantastic.  It's a modern miracle that I had fresh, appetizing sashimi on Sunday night and several hundred miles from the Pacific.  Came with a large cucumber salad that was crisp and nicely seasoned.  Also a nice miso soup--though a bit too much tofu.  I also had them bring me a small bowl of sushi rice, which they were happy to oblige.
