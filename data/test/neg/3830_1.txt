My boyfriend and I stayed at this location for a holiday weekend and we LOVED IT!! Out of all the hotels we've traveled to, this one has thee BEST breakfast! We always find ourselves comparing other hotels complimentary breakfasts to theirs. If you can, stay in the suite! We'll def. be back again next time we are in AZ!
