Cash only, friendly faces (you will get to know everyone here fairly quickly!), lively atmosphere and the highlight of my night walk with my dog in Little Italy. This place is especially great in the summer when the outdoor seating is there, but the coffee is great all year round, especially their cappucino. Free fizzy water also makes me happy!
