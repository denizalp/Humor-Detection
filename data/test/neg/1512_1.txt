Great place! Got here at 11:00 on a Saturday, only a small line, got in at about 11:20. I noticed at noon the line got quite longer so glad we came a bit early.\n\nVery elegant decor! Food was amazing, especially the desserts! A bit of a lack of seafood though (ie no crab legs), which is only negative and why 4\/5. Service was excellent, was attended to immediately after sitting down. Plates were cleared quickly.\n\nGreat overall experience. About $35 for brunch or so (we didn't get alcohol). Would come again but will prolly try Bellagio or Wynn next time.
