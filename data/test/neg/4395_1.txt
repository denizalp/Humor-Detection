This place is great!! The greeters at the front door all the way back to the service department. I would like to point out a great service consultant Brian Cross who went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect on my Road King. I could not be happier. So the next time you want to make sure you are taken care of and you want a great service consultant go to Arrowhead Harley and ask for Brian Cross.
