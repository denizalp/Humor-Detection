I like London Drugs as an alternative to Walmart. Most of my purchases there have been electronics and the sales people always know their stuff and are quite helpful.\n\nThis location , however, disappointed me. They weren't too busy, but I couldn't find one person to ask a question to. So I answered my own questions and left. Strike One, London Drugs....\n\nAnyway, for the most part, they are a quality outfit and offer good prices on batteries and other items on a consistent basis.
