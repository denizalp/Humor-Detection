For Christmas I was wanting to give Oil and Vinegar sets for gifts so I searched several stores before finding these guys in Old Town Scottsdale. They have an excellent selection that is fresh and flavorful with samples and knowledgable staff. They are not the easiest to find but well worth it when you do.
