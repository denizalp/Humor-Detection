Tried this place out recently for dinner and was not very impressed.  Delivery, however, was very quick and they were very friendly on the phone.  Prices are decent, but the pizza was extremely bland.  The wings weren't very tasty either and the fried zucchini\/mozzarella was equally as bland.  I would not go so far as to say I would recommend them to a friend.
