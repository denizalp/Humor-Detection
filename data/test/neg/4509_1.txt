They just opened up an I just happened to see it in a corner n mesa an decided to stop by. They have amazing customer service an treated me with respect even tho I came crawling in with no shoes an puffy eyes on a Sunday Hung over needing some pho to help my hang over. The food is amazing as well!!! Customer service tho really took me back.
