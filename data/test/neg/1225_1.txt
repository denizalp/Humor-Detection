Peter the Manager refused to refund the Zagg protective shield WHICH IS GARBAGE for the Note 8!  He stated 14 day refund policy but I gave it a full month as a loyal customer.  Not knowing the difference without this so-called protector, it fell off and using the phone without, I discovered the lack of screen sensitivity IMMEDIATELY!!!  DO NOT BUY THAT PROTECTOR!  IT IS WORTHLESS!  THIS STORE LOST MY BUSINESS!
