Stayed here on my cross-country trip. La Quinta was the only place in Phoenix that was affordable would let me bring my 90 lbs lab. The hotel is well lit outside and the staff is very friendly--they even provided a wine opener. The one downside is the rooms are run down, but if you are staying to just sleep you will be fine.
