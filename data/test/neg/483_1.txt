Conveniently located for us. We love the ambience. My kids enjoy it here too. They think it's kind of cool how the waiters are in PJ's. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is a must here! As well as the bread in a pot. All the entrees we all order, we all enjoy and continue to re-order whenever we come back. \n\nSunday's have loooong waits. Don't go hungry.
