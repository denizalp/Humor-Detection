It's a local joint with tasty food, huge portions and good service- no dirty looks, no attitude, and I'm not even Hawaiian to be deserving of their consistently good customer service.  The furikake chicken and roast pork loco are excellent.  Chantilly cake is to die for.  Rule of thumb: pace yourself.  Otherwise, you won't have room for dessert that is so worth having.
