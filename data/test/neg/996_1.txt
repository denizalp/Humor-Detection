Rainy Sunday's calls for duck donuts! Please come completely prepared, the line was out the door, be ready to order when you get to the register. Super cheap for made to order donuts. There were two employees assembling donuts and one frying donuts and they were rapid fast. It's fun getting to mix and match different combinations on your own. Maple bacon donuts, yes please!
