This is hands down the best breakfast spot in Montreal! Ambiance and service are spot on, it is always busy but you never feel rushed. The coffees and juice are top notch. You have to try the eggs benedict they are phenomenal. I don't know how they get the ham to taste as great as it does. Potatoes roasted in duck fat and fresh fruit round out a fantastic plate. For the quality of food and experience you cannot beat the price either. Can't wait to make it back there!
