People are constantly asking me where I got my tattoos done. Dave Glantz opened his own studio 6 months ago, and hasn't looked back. His work is incredible and entirely original. His precision and attention to detail puts him in a league all his own. You'll probably have to put your name on a rather long waiting list, but considering you'll be wearing his art forever your patience will be well rewarded.
