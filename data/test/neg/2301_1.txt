Coffee aficionados rejoice! The Humble Lion may have just opened but they make seriously delicious coffee. The baristas are very knowledgeable and also very friendly. They have delicious baked goods, great tunes, and their counter is recycled from the lane of a bowling alley.\nThis is one of the only places in Montreal that I can order a Flat White and have it made perfectly without explanation.\nThank you!
