UHaul generally has the cheapest propane prices around and I usually fill up there.  However, this morning I waited in the sun for 15 minutes for someone to service my tank and was told twice by personnel working in the vicinity that \"someone will be with you shortly\".  Not so.  I have better things to do with my time.\n\nJohn A
