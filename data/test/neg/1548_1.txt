Ambience is nice but service is so-so. Went there for the AYCE hot pot. If you are a beef lover, do not go there as base on how I was served on the beef, it looks like the beef has been pre-sliced, then left frozen in the freezer as such all areas of beef are exposed to frost. Once cooked in the hot pot, the beef are not tender but rough. Whereas the rest of the food are alright.
