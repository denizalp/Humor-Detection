Amazing Latin Food!! Best Cubano sandwich in Ohio! \nThe service is great and restaurant is very festive. Warmer weather the restaurant has an outside dining available. After ordering your food the wait is not long at all. \n\nI would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for delicious affordable food! \n\n(Don't forget to bring a marker!) :)
