IF YOU WANT YOUR IDENTITY STOLEN THEN GO HERE... OTHERWISE AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! Its sad because we never use our credit cards and when we did for our son's surgery it was magically stolen with all of my identity information used as my son's guarantor. They have a major breech of security there! Sadly I have learned that this happens a lot there... This is too bad because the nurses and staff were amazing with our child. Still NOT WORTH having to fight for the rest of my life for identity theft.
