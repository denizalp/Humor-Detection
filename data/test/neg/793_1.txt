1st time here...for an appetizer we had the Burrata - roasted beets, chive, pistachio, beet green pesto, chili oil was. We also had the Peas and Carrots.  Very light and extremely tasty! For the main course, the Smoked Potato Gnocchi was AMAZING and the Wild Striped Bass was very flavorful! The wife enjoyed the bass thoroughly,  but we both agree the smoked potato gnocchi was the winner! Nice atmosphere and friendly staff!  We will definitely come back!!!
