I've only been through YYZ two times, but this is a pretty standard airport. It has the usual fast food joints, wifi and plenty of televisions screens. Pretty clean airport and it has a nice bustle and pace to it. \n\nThe main drawback for me was the amount of walking I had to do when in transit. I don't think it helped that I had less than an hour to catch to Europe. \n\nNot great, not horrible. Pretty average.
