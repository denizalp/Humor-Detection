Seems like a secret bar...we only found out about it through a local. No downstairs reception, just go in and take the elevator to the 23rd floor. Hostess was very nice. Drinks were okay, same overpricing as every other nice Vegas lounge. We didn't try the food. The bartender was not very friendly. The views however, are awesome! Come for the views, maybe get a drink
