Meh. Ordered traditional boil medium spice with shrimp, 1 potato, and sausage. Also got an order of hush puppies to start. Hush puppies were mediocre. Shrimp was rubbery and tasted muddy. The potato was very bland. Nothing tasted spicy to me. Waiter screwed up and wrote down corn instead of sausage, corn was ok, sad i didn't get to try the sausage though. Service was ok considering how busy it was (regular refills, etc.). But overall not an experience I'd care to repeat.
