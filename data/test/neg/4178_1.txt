I am not sure who is writing all these bad reviews I am having the Espresso and Gelato and it is the perfect cool pick me up on a summer afternoon, a good friend of mine told me about this place and the people are friendly and helpful, the espresso has a great flavour, but when you add in some tiramisu gelato its outstanding! Not too many European style cafes in their neighbourhood if you ask me and this one is worth trying.
