The food was surprisingly delicious. Surprisingly because, I just had an expectation of \"good\" since the menu was decorated with items that didn't need much to satisfy my palate. I ultimately knew that I was going to be satisfied but the restaurant exceeded my expectations. In fact, my response was displayed by sitting back in my seat after the first bit to regather my thoughts.
