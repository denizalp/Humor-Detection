Staff are wonderful .\n\nThe movie selection is good.\n\nBut a renovation is in order.  Two of the theaters have urine soaked seats.  Sometimes you can smell it before you sit.  Sometimes it isn't until I have \"heated\" the seat up a bit, then the smell hits .   Getting up 20 minutes into a movie to find a different seat shouldn't be part of a movie experience.  \n\nParking is often an issue on weekends.  Plan to leave early or park  around the back of the building.
