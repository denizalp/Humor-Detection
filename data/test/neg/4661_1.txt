Disappointing first visit. Yelp sounded great w cool setup. Great setting. Americana etc. but all food was mediocre (hash brown looked like it came scooped out of a can) and all of it was cold.  We came at 10 am yet they clearly left it out on server counter while we waited over 20 mins for our 3 dishes.  \nOverall maybe this is an exception but wanna be true to a review.
