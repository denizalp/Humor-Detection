Food mediocre at best, way over priced 1.19 for tiny scoop guacamole. Plus, they charge for every dressing or salsa to a company dry burrito.  Tried this for friends recommendation so he can try Zabaz..which is far superior.  No management in site and employees don't know how to handle unhappy guest. Never again. ...too bad
