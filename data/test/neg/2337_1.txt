TLDR: Service was good, appetizers came quickly and was delicious, entrees were slower. I had the chachacha, decent, had better elsewhere in Los Angeles.\n\nTakoyaki, tasty and generously portioned. Chachacha, garlic flavors, chasiu was good, not a fan of the thick noodles, extremely filling.\n\nWorth a try!
