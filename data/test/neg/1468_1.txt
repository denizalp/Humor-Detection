Didn't fix issue even when I asked them to check the air conditioning fan, which was the issue. Didn't want to get in the attic, just tried to sell me maintenance packages while putting their sticker on my unit..This was a waste of money, they never responded when I called and wanted to talk to someone about it. I don't think they know much more than simple fixes and get told to sell sell sell on maintenance...
