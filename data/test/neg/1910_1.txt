Great pizza! Not overly friendly though.... There was about 8 employees working, and not ONE said hi when I walked in! (Same thing to the people behind me)  and when my order was ready he just handed to me and said nothing... I would  eat there again cause it was yummy and the prices are good! But I will get delivery so u wouldn't have to face that issue again and if the driver isn't friendly there will b no tip and I won't try it again!
