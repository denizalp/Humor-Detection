I would probably put it at 4.5 stars if there was an option. This has been the best overall dining experience in Pittsburgh since I moved here a few months ago. A lot of places in Pitt are hype machines, but this is the real deal if you like good old fashion American-style breakfast grub. The place has character, too.
