This was my first high tea. Figured I had to try it since we were in Toronto. The meal was filling and satisfying. Nice variety of tasty sandwiches. Large variety of tea choices, I tried the chia tea. There were 3 of us and we each had a different tea and we were all satisfied. The sweets were a little different but good. We were served by Monique, the owner  I believe. Prior to going I emailed the shop with a question and the response was quick. I would definitely return here.
