Great service. The mochi pancakes were fully and delicious. I now need to figure out how to make the green tea syrup!  Soooo good! The only thing I do have to comment is they have a limited dessert menu and when they sell out you are out of luck. There was one late afternoon my husband and I came in to have dessert and they only had a chocolate cupcake. Nothing else....so we did leave disappointed. However, if they have everything in stock try the cheesecake!
