Tony's has a cozy ambiance that reflects a Cafe setup.  The wait staff is nice and the booths are comfortable.  I ordered the John Z omelet with a side of hash browns. It had falafel, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms. It was delicious.  I was disappointed with the hash browns because it was \"home fries\". The cook did not shred the potatoes. I still recommend visiting Tommy's.
