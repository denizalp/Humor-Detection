Takara never disappoints, I have tried almost everything on the menu and it is always; fresh and tasty. The best sushi and the half price days are a treat. We go as often as possible and plan to go Sunday for 1\/2 price sushi. I tell everyone how great this place is. The staff are always friendly and attentive and they always remember my order. Maybe we do go to much? Nah! Takara beats Red bowl hands down, you will not be disappointed.
