This place has it all: lots of wine, beer, great customer service, and fast check out.\n\nDo you need to know where something is?  Just ask.  But better is the advice on what is the best wine for the price you want to pay.  Every time I go there, I get the same great service.  \n\nAdmittedly, I usually walk out of there with more than I intended.  But they have so many great products!
