Favorite club in Vegas!!! Awesome layout - a huge open room with tables lining to the dance floor. Bars to the left and right - just great!\n\nMusic was my favorite - electronic beats all night long. Best DJs there. Great crowd, younger around 20s to late 20s. DEFINITELy COMING BACK!\n\nA promoter got us in early by cutting the line and also we each got two free drinks and free entry. Best deal! Loved it!
