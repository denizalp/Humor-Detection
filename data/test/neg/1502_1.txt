This place is an old Calgary institution, I have been coming here for years and years, mainly after the bar on Fridays or Saturday nights, but since I don't stay out late anymore, I now do takeouts from here, it's still good as always, there is still an occasional Saturday night out where I end up here, the food to stay is always great, the common ginger beef, soups, but i love the crab, in whatever style of sauce you're craving, they are fast, and good. A staple in my view!
