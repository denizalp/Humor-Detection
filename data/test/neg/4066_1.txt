I did the Sky Jump this morning. If your like me, an average guy. This will be an amazing experience you will remember!\nIt's not skydiving! But I also didn't have to take any safety bs or be strapped to anyone tandem. You fall at 40 mph for about 30 seconds. Staff was professional and triple checked each other's safety rigging.  They were pros. Lockers for your stuff. Go potty first. Then jump!
