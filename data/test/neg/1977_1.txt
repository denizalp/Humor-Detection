Great Pizza. Great concept. For a hotel that builds its brand off of opulence and grandiosity. Its good to know that the Cosmopolitan isn't without a sense of humor or irony.  To find the joint,  just go down the out of place white tile hallway with crappy florescent lighting, you'll arrive in a room the size of a shoebox serving some of the best pizza I've had in recent memory.\n\n\nGreat food, great concept. Well done Cosmopolitan. It looks like management has a few risk takers.
