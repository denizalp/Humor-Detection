Visiting from San Antonio and didn't want the normal tourist places on the strip. About a 15 minute drive from the strip. \n\nFair priced. A lot of unique and delicious choices. Each of us got two flavors per cup \nHoney comb gelato and melon and bacon sorbet. \nThai tea gelato and green tea gelato\nPeanut butter gelato and cheese cake gelato\nSour cream potato chip gelato and pistachio gelato. \n\nEvery day new flavors are put out. \n\nThey also have all sort of other choices for food allergies, shakes  and baked goods.  Well worth the trip south of town.
