Loved this place because instead of salad as an appetizer they give you sopa de fideo and chips and salsa. The cheese and chorizo appetizer is also delicious and the hand made tortillas are so thick and fluffy.\nThe waiters were very attentive. The interior is quite comfortable with wooden chairs or upholstered booths to sit in. Very dim lighting and a lot of classic Mexican decore.\n*My sister accidentally broke a salt shaker and they were super nice about it. So extra points for friendliness.
