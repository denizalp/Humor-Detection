This is my favorite breakfast spot!  The menu is so diverse and the food is delicious.  The Bloody Mary's and coffee are good too.  They also open early which is nice.  too many good breakfast spots don't open early enough to be breakfast and not brunch.\nI have yet to come here for any other meals or to enjoy the drinks that look incredible but I will soon :)
