I was amazed and really impressed with the Service I received today at ServiceOntario.\n\nIt was busy, but the line moved - efficiently.  There were tons of people - the line went all the way out the door, but I was seen in about 17-20 minutes, to renew my health card.\n\nVery impressed.  Swift service for me.  Why?  Because I read over what I needed to bring and made sure I had everything with me.  It was a seamless experience.
