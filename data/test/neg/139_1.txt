Jo is out favorite server. She gets five stars. Unfortunately, the screeching hostess who greeted us at the door, and the rude manager shushing the servers when they would explain something to the cooks through the window were more than irritating. \n\nI don't know what it is about businesses lately, but they all seem to think they need to post someone at the door to scream at me when I walk in. \n\nAnd managers who work with their employees are more effective than those who lord over them.
