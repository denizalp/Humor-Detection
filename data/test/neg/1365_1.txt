Good place for lunch. I ordered Steak Teriyaki for $7.95 and my father ordered Chicken Teriyaki for $6.95. We tried a little of both. Both dishes were prepared over a bed of saut√©ed onions and served with a cup of white rice. The steak and chicken were tender and flavorful. The onions were a little strong but did enhance the flavor of the meats. \n\nThe only real knock I could give is that you're only allowed one free refill per beverage. \n\nOverall, it was good food at a reasonable price.
