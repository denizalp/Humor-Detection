Absolutely best place for a burger in madison!  I've been here numerous times and they never let us down. It's a small place with an old tavern feel. The bar seats maybe 20, there's also limited table seating...either option gets busy for dinner. Bar selection is average nothing really stands out here, the burgers are definitely the highlight. Give this place a try if you haven't yet...its our go to for burgers!
