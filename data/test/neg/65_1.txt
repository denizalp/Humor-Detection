I enjoy this bakery.  Their baguette is quite good, though maybe not quite crusty enough to my taste.  I'll often stop by for a croissant as well.  Plus, they make lovely chocolates with interesting combinations of flavours.  The service is usually quite friendly, and I sometimes even get served in French, which is a nice bonus. :)
