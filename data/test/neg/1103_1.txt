Best place for fresh original Hawaiian style pokes. I would highly recommend this place. If it wasn't so expensive, I would eat poke from this place every single day. My favorite is their spicy garlic, then the limu, and the shoyu. They also have kimchi, seaweed salad, taco poke and all sorts of yumminess! The owners are awesome as well.
