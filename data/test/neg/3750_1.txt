Went there last night for dinner with friends.  This visit kind of reaffirmed my previous visit!  The prices are high and the quality of food is not very good...the best thing I find is the soup and salad combo with the bread sticks.  Hard to mess up soup or salad, especially if they have a special.  Our waiter talked so loud, I think everyone in the place knew what we had ordered.  I think he was a little hard of hearing!
