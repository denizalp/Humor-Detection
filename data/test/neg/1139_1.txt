I cam in here a few weekends ago and was impressed. All I had were some apps - chourico, sardines and grilled calamari, but I can say that next time I'm in Montreal, I'm going to tear into this menu. Can't believe I left without trying the black cod or the octopus.\n\nFor the record, if you're used to Luso-American cuisine - this is not it. Don't get me wrong, it's excellent. But if you come here, expect Portuguese inspired, well thought-out dishes at a premium price point.\n\nRecommended.
