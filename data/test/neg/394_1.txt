Awesome pool. I go here every summer on my own as well as with a group of children.  \n\nI like that this pool has ample chairs to sit around the kiddie area so I could watch my kids.  What I DON'T like is that the lifeguards are all clueless.  There are times when we'd be sitting in the shallow end and almost get knocked down by kids who were fighting in the area. We even mentioned it to the lifeguards on duty and they don't seem to care.
