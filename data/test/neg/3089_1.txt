I bought a Samsung Fridge from the Brick and purchased a 4 year warranty.  They insisted they had a great warranty. My fridge has been down for a week .  I finally contacted the company that deals with it.  Never buy from the Brick.  Sleazy salesman.   And their warranties are a joke.  You have to  go him through hoops to get who does the work!!! \n\nWay to go Brick.  Tell your salesmen to tell the customer the truth !!!!5
