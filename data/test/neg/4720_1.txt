Modena Laser gets a 5 star because I got results! I commend the staff on the  excellent service that they provided each time that I received my (laser) treatments. \nThe office is well maintained.\nI DROVE to Henderson because the cost was much more effective in my wallet than in Santa Monica and it was more FUN!\nI almost forgot! I received 50% off! My first treatment!
