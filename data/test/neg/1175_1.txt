Ramen was $30. \nChicken and waffles: $30\nSide of rice:  undercooked, had a little crunch. \nAll were pretty bland. If the food was good it would've been worth it. We really were hoping for the food to taste good.  All I could think of was all the different places I could've went had we not gone there. \n\nCustomer service was great.
