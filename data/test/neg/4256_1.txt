Appetizers were great. Lobster taco exceptional.\nRib eye steak, one of the worst ever. Under cooked and full of gristle.\nNo response from complaint to server. \nLamb chop mediocre at best. \nPork tenderloin good.\n2 beers one mixed drink no dessert, bill 180 per couple.\nReally?\nWould never go back.
