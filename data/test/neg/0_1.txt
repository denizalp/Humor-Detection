First off their hours are not good. Anyone knows that with young kids, by 10:30 you've had half of your day done. Second, they can NEVER get my kid in. I walked in and there were literally 3 people standing there yet they couldn't give her a quick trim?! If they just stop taking then they could throw her in the chair for a quick trim.  We ended up going to the Village Barber shop around the corner and the woman did a great job.
