Brian in service is fantastic! If ever my car has an issue he takes care of the problem immediately no matter how minor it is. The entire service team seems to strive to get you in and out so as not to waste your time. Much appreciated for that since most other dealerships will take all day on your issue. I highly recommend seeing him for any issue or oil change you may need.
