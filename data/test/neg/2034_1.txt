I have always had a good experience here. I call give them my price i want to pay and i get such a beautiful arrangement way bigger than i would have gotten elsewhere. I enjoy working with Jennifer. She does an amazing job, integrates my thoughts and ideas and thee flowers i want in the arrangement and she turns out with a masterpiece! I will continue to go here in the future for my floral needs. Make sure you ask for jennifer!! You will not be steered wrong with her!
