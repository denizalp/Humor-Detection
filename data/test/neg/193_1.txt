These crepes are absolutely AMAZING! I have to eat gluten free and they were so amazing about making sure that my food didn't get mixed up with anyone else's and even took the time to ask me about my celiac disease. The owner shared with me how his friend has a very bad case of celiac disease so he understood my food concerns. I always go here and they are so friendly and food is delicious!
