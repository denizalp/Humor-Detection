Very very decent. My friend had the burger and I the piggie pizza. I'm a super fan for cured meats so no surprise I loved the prosciutto. Apparently they cure in-house which impressed me. (They train their servers well to sell the place). Best things on the menu need to be the skilet cornbread and the pork belly (but come on it's literally impossible to mess up pork belly). Their beer selection is decent too though not extensive. I'll definitely go back again!
