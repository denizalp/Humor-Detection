This place rocks its a Artsy French Bakery with a cool laid back vibe. Its open 24 hours a day 7 days a week which makes this an awesome night spot to grab a great dessert or croissant. It also makes a really great place to study and great first date spot. One warning though if you are super hungry this is not the spot to go. The portions are small but on the other hand the prices are very reasonable.
