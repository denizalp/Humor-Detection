Went as a group of 7 for a birthday for supper on Super Bowl Sunday. There was a ton of space and the atmosphere was relaxing and cozy. \n\nDrinks were tasty and the food was above average. I had the spicy salmon sandwich and my husband had the curry chicken Poutine both of which were very tasty. \n\nService was average but fast.
