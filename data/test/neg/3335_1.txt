Definitely the best sushi you'll get on the North side of Phoenix. Tonight I ordered to-go from this new restaurant, and I chose 3 different rolls, the lion king, the baked scallop roll, and the caterpillar, in order to sample some items. All of the sushi was delicious. I normally go for the raw rolls or nigiri when I order sushi, but the baked rolls at this restaurant were outstanding. I highly recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone in the North Phoenix area...delicious!
