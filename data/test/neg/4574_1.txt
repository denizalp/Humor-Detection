After 14 years of shopping here, I am done. EVERY TIME I shop here, I am am disappointed. The staff is miserable and unhappy. They don't know what customer service is. There are a few that care, Pat especially. Most times there is only one lane open. People in the deli are very rude. The store smells and is not clean and needs to be renovated.It's convenient to drive right across the street, but moving forward, I will go to Frys or Safeway,
