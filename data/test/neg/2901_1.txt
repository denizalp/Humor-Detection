I really enjoyed the ambiance here.  The setting in an old house with original trim was really lovely.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and garlic Naan with Mango Lassi.  The spices were just right and the portions were decent for the price.  The mango lassi was very sweet and tasty, if a little warm, but overall still yummy.
