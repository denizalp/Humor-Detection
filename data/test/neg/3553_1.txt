I have used Union Plumbing for the past two years and have been thrilled with their service. I have found them to be honest in assessing the problem and always available to fit us into their schedule in an emergency. Our home has had many issues with the plumbing since moving in, and Union Plumbing has always been able to fix the issues within a reasonable price point. This evening Eric J came out to unclog the powder room toilet and was in and out in five minutes. I highly recommend this company.
