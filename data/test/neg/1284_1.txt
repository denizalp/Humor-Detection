Pastries are good, and coffee is okay. If your a coffee lover this is not your place. If your a pastry lover then it is. Also, some of the rooms were awkwardly quiet while other rooms where playing music in the background. Maybe your thing if your studying to sit in the quiet rooms, but I prefer music playing in the background.
