I have a crack in my ac hard line and asked for a quote, we were quoted OEM prices, when we suggested an after market vendor we were told it would be the same price even tho they would be after market parts. The price difference from an honest mechanic is 600$ just in parts. Who knows what the bottom line would have been for labor for our 600$ minimum labor quote.
