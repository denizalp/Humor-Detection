Julie is an amazing server. Ask for Julie when you arrive. She didn't steer us wrong on anything. I had the beets salad and salmon my date had the  salmon dinner. He enjoyed an Old Fashioned and I had a glass of red Zinfandel. Place is lovely and fun.  The manager, Haley, is approachable and checks on guests. Fabulous food. Great vibe.
