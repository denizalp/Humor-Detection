Good god these are the best wings I've ever had.  These guys have the best combo of crispness and sauciness on a wing.   These wings are good size, not sure why people are saying they are small.  If you want skimpy wings, go to Oreganos.   I'm scared I discovered the this place because I'll be craving them all the time.  Highly recommend the Chefs Special sauce.
