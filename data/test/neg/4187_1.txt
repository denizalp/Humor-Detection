Went here on a lunch date w my husband and youngest son. Was very happy with the service, atmosphere and food. I ordered the carnitas plate w\/ side of sour cream, my husband got the carne Asada plate, and our son got a quesadilla. Our plates were good size and cooked so perfectly. My husband is from Mexico; and he was very impressed with the food and music selection. Highly recommend and will definitely return to try more menu entrees!!!! And the chips & salsa are amazing
