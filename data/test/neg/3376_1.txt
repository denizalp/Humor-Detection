We are avid workout fanatics and crossfitters.  On a whim, we decided to check out Sol.  While the programming was good, the instructor offered no support or guidance for our first drop-in at this location.  There was no encouragement from her and we were left wondering if our workout wouldn't have been better if we just would have looked at the WOD online and did it on our own.  Disappointing to say the least.
