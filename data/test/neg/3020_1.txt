This Aamco was awesome!  My friend referred me to this shop to get a second opinion after going to the dealership.  Thankfully I did because the head guy, Wendel, was able to give me an accurate assessment and do what exactly what needed to be done.  It turns out that the dealership was 100% wrong.  In addition to saving money, I now also have a Honda that runs perfectly straight.
