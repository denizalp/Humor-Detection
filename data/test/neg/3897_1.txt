I LOVE this place.\nI have been attending the Boxing for Parkinson's class.\nI never knew there was such a thing.\nIf you have  Parkinson's or know of someone who does...\nI highly recommend this classs.\nSo IMPRESSED  with the trainer Marty and her assistants.\nThey have so much compassion and care for there clients.\nTheir attitude is so \"uplifting\" and \"motivating\".\nThe \"camaraderie'\" is fantastic among the trainer and the clients.\nBelieve me.....THIS IS A WORKOUT....not just boxing.\nI'm am so PUMPED after the class....also sweaty and tired.\nCheck it out....you will love it.
