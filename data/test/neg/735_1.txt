I came here with a co-worker for a quick dinner when I was in Madison on business.  The food, drinks, and service was all good!\n\nWe enjoyed our Great Dane-brewed beers, the cheese curds were delicious, and our burgers were good too!\n\nThe service was polite and prompt, and the ambiance was very \"old school\" pub-like.\n\nGood spot!
