We had a marvelous Thanksgiving at our home in Scottsdale thanks to Unique Luxury Catering and Chef Jose and his assistant Tara.  The food was excellent and displayed beautifully and we just loved it all and there was no clean up as they did it all and we had leftovers that were so good the next day.  We will definitely use them again.  What a yummy dessert they also served.  WONDERFUL!!!
