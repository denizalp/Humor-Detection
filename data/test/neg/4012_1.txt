I was very impressed with menu variety, portions, price and service. I was not expecting such good food for a chain restaurant. No comparison to the Olive Garden. I highly suggest the Penne San Remo. They use family style for the entrees. Two small entrees more than enough for three people. Take this into consideration before adding on appetizers, breads and salads.
