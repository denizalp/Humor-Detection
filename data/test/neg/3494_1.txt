I called Eternal Plumbing Solutions because the bathroom shower was draining slow. They put me right on the schedule for the next day. Not only did they show up on time, but they also provided an estimate right then and there. After I approved the estimate he went right to work and it was done within the hour. I paid exactly what I was quoted and was very happy with the service I received. I would definitely recommend Eternal Plumbing Solutions!
