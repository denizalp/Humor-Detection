Love the atmosphere!  Food is decent.  A few suggestions...  Not like they will listen being tied to Grayhawk Golf Club...  Lol.  The prices are too high for the quality of food period!!!  Re-work that hummus recipe.  Some of the worst I've had.  Most of the food is ok, but nothing wows you.  The staff is really nice and the table service has been good.  The bar staff is always super nice.  It's really down to food and pricing.... We would frequent more often if those two were fixed...
