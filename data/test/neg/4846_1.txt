terrible customer service\nSigned up for a $ 200 a month program that no one could tell me exactly what I bought. I finally got fed up with it, the owner contacted me,I sent an email per her request regarding exactly what happened, then never heard form anyone . I left a vm on the owners cell phone, explaining no one had gotten back to me, and still no word, no answer, no nothing. \\
