Service was gracious, but inattentive. \n\nFood was tasty, but not stellar.\n\nDesserts sounded charming, but fell flat.\n\nDrinks were good, but over priced. \n\nRooftop patio was lovely, but atmosphere was okay. \n\nI actually had a very nice time at Czehoski, and probably would return for a drink and maybe some snacks on the patio, but I don't find it worth it to have a whole meal again.
