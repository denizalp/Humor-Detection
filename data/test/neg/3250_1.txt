Service: average, mostly cos they are so busy all the time\n\nThere's almost always a line if you go between 6-7 pm on weekends. \n\nFood: I love their side dishes, especially their pancake and glass noddles. Their table cooking is average, the meat isn't the best quality. My favorite dish there is the seafood pancake, cos they don't cheap out on the seafood. They have a patio for table cooking, but it gets insanely hot in the summer. \n\nPrice: average
