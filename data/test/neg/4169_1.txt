This place is amazing, I have had steak at many many places and this one is by far tastiest. Usually I'll have steak rare, but this meat it is so good next time I'll have it blue. \nIt's bit on a pricy side but if you want quality u gotta pay for it. \n\nAmbiance is really, really cool, lighting, music this place is really relaxing. There is lounge area where you can have drinks. \n\nBathrooms are really modern and the cleanest you will ever see. \n\nIf you wanna impress someone from out of town take them there.
