Nice hotel without casino, which means no smoke. Not grand like many other hotels, but meets the purpose. Less crowded, comfortable stay. Staff is friendly. Maintenance is good. Breakfast package comes with 46$ breakfast for two at envy steakhouse. Good Continental breakfast, but service was really slow. Less seating, longer wait time. Had to switch between parking elevator and elevators to the rooms. View from the room was nice, facing golf court. Greenest you could get in Vegas.
