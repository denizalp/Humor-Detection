At first glance, I thought that Blick might offer more fun, craft-type products for a not-very-artistic sort like myself. Unfortunately for me - but fortunately for actual artists - this store has an extensive selection of supplies for the serious artist. I highly recommend that artists check out this shop when on the hunt for new supplies.
