I don't really know why this place has such bad reviews?! Well we did go during the probably least crowded time possible but still our waitress was so nice and friendly! She kept telling us that although life can seem bad right now, that things will get better and turn around the next day. She was just soooooo sweet and getting out food was so quick! As for the food, amazing! And reasonably priced. My friend and I went the other day and it was only 24 dollars!
