I have to put an other review!!!this Is so far my favorite French bakery, they have a new manager (Christof who is French!!) he is fantastic, helpful and you really get transported to France!!\nThe pastries looks good and taste as delicious as they look!!!\nIf you go there once you will definitely go back!!thats the type of place that is worst driving 30minutes!!!
