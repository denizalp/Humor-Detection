Not great on how to treat their customers but some are good at what they do. I came in for a pedicure and a manicure and was only given the service of the pedicure due to the fact that the person who was doing my feet had a scheduled appointment to get to. I volunteered to let her deal with her appointment because I did not want sloppy work done to my manicure. I never received the manicure. There should be free gift certificates or something when things like this happens.
