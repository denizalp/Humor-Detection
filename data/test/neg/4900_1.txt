Delicious and authentic! Bread is homemade, marinara sauce is divine, service is excellent! Prices are very reasonable. Family owned, unassuming restaurant. We feel like we stumbled upon a gem in the heart of Phoenix\/Arcadia. Also, this family owns a water and ice store so the water is SO GOOD! I know that sounds funny but most restaurants serve nasty Phoenix tap water...this one does not. We'll definitely be coming back.
