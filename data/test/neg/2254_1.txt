I enrolled for 10 hr driving lessons. I had very little behind the experience. I was lucky to have Mr. Sam Llyod who is the best driving instructor in Vegas.  He taught me all the tricks and tips to pass the test. A knowledgeble and very patient teacher.\n\nWe drove around flamingo,downtown and freeways. Did parallel parking practice for a day. I practiced my own for 2 weeks and passed today.\n\nStrongly recommended.
