I looked at all the reviews and wanted to give this place a try.  A lot of places here in Vegas are pretty expensive when it comes to repair.  Abe was very helpful at offering the best price he could.  He was also very helpful in general. Very great guy and staff at this company. I will definitely be back here for any other auto body work I need. Check them out!
