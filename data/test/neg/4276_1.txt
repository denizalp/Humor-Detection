The Cave Creek Road Phoenix Costco always does an outstanding job. Nathan the front end manager works quite hard and manages his employees well. Amy is very outgoing and genuine. Her co worker who I don't know her name (sorry) does a magnificent job at supporting Amy's team. They have a good team. I do request that the District manager recognize these employee's and this store. Fantastic work.
