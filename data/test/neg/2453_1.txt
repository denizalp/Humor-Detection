I was experiencing some issues with the service I had when I had my front brakes done here back in February,  I came into the store and was salty when they wouldn't address the issue. As a business owner I know customer service is key, and salty customers are the worst to deal with, but Butch took great care of me and ensured I understood the situation. I'm definitely come back to this location in the future because of him.
