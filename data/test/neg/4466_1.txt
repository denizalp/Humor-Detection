Went to play blackjack after ten years and dealer treated me like I'm an idiot. She could have Taken time to teach me instead of being rude and condescending ...it was slow and only my friend and I playing but no! Then went to Lucky or circle bar and stood there for 10 minutes without an acknowledgement!!' As someone in service industry for over 14 years  I'm disgusted ...won't be back!!!
