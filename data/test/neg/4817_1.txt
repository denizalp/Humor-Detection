Visiting from California and I can say with authority that the quality and value of this steakhouse outstanding. The steak and the crust were amazing. In fact all the sides and everyone's meal was top notch. Best brussel sprouts I have ever consumed. Prices are also reasonable for the quality and the service was also great. For the main the bone-in ribeye was cooked perfectly and the flavor of the steak was ahhhhh~ highly recommended
