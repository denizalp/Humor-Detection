Foods super good. Service kinda sucks.. they seem to not care you're there or in their presence. Maybe I'm just high maintenance since I work at a super nice high end bar but when I sit down at the bar and three bartenders look at me and then the other way..  Automatic sour taste in my mouth. I have to be super nice and kiss ass of my guests so you should too. Be friendly people! You guys have a killer gig, make the best of it.
