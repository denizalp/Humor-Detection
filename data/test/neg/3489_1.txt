Farley's was recommended to me a few days ago and I must say the overall experience was good. We were greeted as we walked in and ordering was easy due to the cashier at the front and her knowledge of the menu. The manager, Quintin (I think that was his name) came out to make sure the food was good and to our satisfaction which was nice. Quintin and the staff made us feel welcomed and a part of Farley's. We will be back for sure.
