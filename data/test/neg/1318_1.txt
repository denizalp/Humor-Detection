Great selection, friendly and welcoming service, all-around this place rocks. Spoke with several regulars who all thought highly of the owner and an outstanding level of service. Only stopped by once but got some great recommendations and enjoyed one of them in perhaps the most comfy recliner I have ever sat in. Reminded me of a barber shop sort of hang out. Looking forward to my next visit to this shop.
