Good selection of sushi. Good service.\n\nSmall restaurant.\n\nYou mark a list and they bring food to you.\n\nNot on the strip, so plan it on the way to or back from Vegas.\n\nIce cream tempura hits the spot.\n\nBottom line: Not anything different or special, but a good place to eat sushi in Vegas if you crave it!
