I think this is the best bar in Charlotte, if not the best bar I've ever been too next to the heralded grappa bar at La Famiglia Ristorante in old city, Philadelphia. Yes one is Irish and one is Italian, but wow how breathtaking they both are.\n\nIt's a charming place to drink. Impeccable service and the owner likes to hang around and drink with the patrons; right!?\n\nIf you are in \"uptown\" Charlotte, take a cab to Belfast Mill and do yourself a favor with a shot of Jameson and a pint of Guinness.
