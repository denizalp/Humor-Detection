Came here  with my classmate to celebrate after graduating.I had the famous chicken tenders and I have to say they were the best.I cannot remember the waitress name to save my life but she was awesome. I would recommend this place for the food and for someone who isn't into the party scene and just want to mingle with a older crowd.
