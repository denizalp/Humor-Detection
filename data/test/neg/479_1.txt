Overall this Fry's is pretty good.  It's much better stocked than the one at Val Vista Lakes, and it's not as crowded as the Fry's Marketplace on Baseline & Gilbert Rd.  The one thing that annoys me about this Fry's is that every time I go it seems the Kids Club is closed.  The hours are very inconsistent.  I just wish they would post a schedule and stick to it so I don't have to haul my 3 yr old all over the store.
