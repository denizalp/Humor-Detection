2nd visit to this place since they opened. Had the same waitress, must say I am surprised she is still there. She needs training on how to speak with customers.  Management is not much better, no enthusiasm or appreciation for customers. Customary things like hello, how is everything, thank you for coming etc. DÃ©cor is awful, had to step over a banner laying in the middle of the floor to get to the restroom.  Find somewhere else, like Good China or Chang Lee. Food is mediocre here.
