This place is in one of the hotels in Vegas in a small food court. It has all things lobster. However, as a mid court place implies, it was not the greatest. Then again, what silly person has lobster in a food court. Our mistake. The only thing that was kind of good was the lobster bisque. The lobster sandwich was lame with a small amount of lobster in it and the croquet was soggy. If you want lobster, don't eat it at a food court. Lesson learned.
