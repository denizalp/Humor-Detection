Had a flat tire on our trailer while on vacation. AAA recommended a place 20 miles away that we had to drive to on the flat. Yea right. I yelped for a tire shop and this place came up as 3.5 miles away. Hubby called and they had 4 of the correct tires in stock. They got us in immediately and charged us a cheaper price than AAA quoted.
