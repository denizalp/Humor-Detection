Best Thai food in Vegas!  In my opinion way way way way way better than Lotus of Siam, puts them to shame actually.  Satay, Tao, and Lemongrass is also very good, but I like this one the  best, not sure how it was rated 10th and Lotus was #1, other than the god awful press in this town barging about it.  Honestly if you have not tried this place, give them a try, great food, good prices, however it is very small and sometimes hard to get a seat inside.
