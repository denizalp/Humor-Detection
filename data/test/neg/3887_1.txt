This place sucks, I would stay away I heard bad things and still gave them a try because they said they would give me a good deal on a truck with a payment that I want and told me they to drive up because I'm out of town and sure enough it was all BS wasted 4 hours driving and 2 waiting for them to say no. I will be taking legal actions for the false promises!
