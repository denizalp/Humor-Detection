This is the only place to go to on a Sunday night. It's a pool party and night club at the same time. You either wear swim attire or dress to impress, the choice is yours. I went through Brian Pfeiffer, VIP host for XS night club. He met us in front of XS walked us in, didn't have to wait in the long line and got right in. If you're ever in Vegas this is the guy to go to. His number is +1 (773) 459-8133 and tell him that Jason T sent you. You won't regret it!
