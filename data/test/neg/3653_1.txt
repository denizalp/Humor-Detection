Good stuff. Glad they open one of these closer to my home. The chicken curry is really tasty. It's set up like Chipotle where are you go through a line and pick out what you want. I have only been open a month but the \"server\" was a real newbie and had trouble  answering some basic questions about the menu. And the manager only helped  her  at the end. But overall everyone there was very friendly and no issues with me using the Yelp check-in coupon and a Groupon.
