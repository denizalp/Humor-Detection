Friendly, upbeat environment. It may look intimidating at first, but the instructors are very helpful and encouraging. I've been wanting to go to Pure Barre since having my first baby, but never made the time to go. By chance, I won a 1 month unlimited classes raffle at a charity event. I've taken 2 classes so far and have several more scheduled for next week. I really feel the burn during class and a few days after class. I've also been inviting my patients to join me. I'm excited that my office team will also join me too!
