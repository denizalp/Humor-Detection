I had an appointment for an eye exam and I waited over an hour before even being taken in for the pretest.  After the exam was finally over, I had to wait at least another 30 minutes before getting help to buy my contacts.  All and all I spend over 2 hours before everything was done and I could leave and it wasn't even busy.  The Dr is good but all other service is horrific!  I will definitely be finding somewhere else to go!
