This place is awesome ! Everything I've tried has been delicious. My only complaint is the way the waiters and waitresses watch you eat, if someone at your table got the all you can eat and you didn't they watch you the entire time to make sure you don't eat any of their food! Very uncomfortable! Other than that it's worth a little awkward staring.
