Since last week, they've added the gooey egg custard bun! I asked about it last week but they didn't have it. Well they have it now! And its delicious!! I'm used to it being in a golden and crispy bun. Theirs is in a plain white bun. But still good. Its a must try! Not sure what its called in English but in Cantonese its pronounced \"lau-sa-bao\". Get it!
