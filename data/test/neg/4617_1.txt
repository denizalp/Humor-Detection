Visited on a cold and rainy day.  Parked in a nearby lot at the adjacent museum.  Beautiful location on the waterfront.  Interior is nice with 3 or 4 levels.  Music lovers will be blown away by the extensive coverage of decades of music.  Really liked the presentation of the newest inductees,  listening stations highlighting music pioneers, and timelines for various important periods.  The displays with costumes, Grammys, vintage photos, instruments, and memorabilia are wonderful.  Will visit again.
