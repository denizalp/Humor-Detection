Absolutely delicious!! Fresh sushi, creative rolls, and super friendly service. Try the miso soup with the salmon dumplings. The miso is not too salty and the dumplings are melt in your mouth. \nThey also have a fresh seaweed salad, which is a mix of sweet and crunchy, and a really cool Japanese soda that's a mix between cream soda and sprite, but on the less sweet side. Comes in a neat bottle that they will show you how to use. Yes, the bottle requires instructions.
