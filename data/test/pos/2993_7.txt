Came here after getting my massage at Bali Foot Spa. \n\nShrimp and chive dumplings : Good. I liked it. Inside was seasoned nicely and the outside was nice and soft like how any fresh made dumpling should be. \n\nChinese pancake : Like any other. Slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Could use a little more seasoning but I guess the dip makes up for it.\n\nSo I ordered 2 pancakes and they ended up putting in only 1 order and a wrong order of squid balls\n\nSquid balls : ok. Actual squid inside. Seasoned ok
