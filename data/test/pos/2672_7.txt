Ok here is the thing, the seats here are soo uncomfortable!. they curve like he letter C and your neck is curved down??!? Why would they make a seat like that.\n\nI will say the sound is supierior to Harkins but the ticket is also like a buck or two more.\n\nSince I am a cheap bastard I look up ways to save. I signed up for their card and now I get free popcorn on wednesdays and a free ticket like every 4 tickets I buy. Here is the link it makes it a little more worth it than Harkins.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.moviewatcher.com\/index.html
