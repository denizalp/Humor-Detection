In reference to the gentleman's review on this being the zoo, he is completely accurate . However , the zoo is more tamed and worth the visit than this run down KFC . Inappropriate behavior from the staff in front of customers , horrible manager , rude in-store cashiers , cold food , incorrect orders . \n\nDon't waste your time .
