My parents took their Volvos and Saab to Harry and everyone else and got nothing but high quality service. Phoenix is great for European cars, and Harry is very straight up. \n\nWhen we asked him about buying an Audi - Harry told us straight up \"They drive really nicely - but you'll be seeing me A LOT.\" (We didn't get the Audi).
