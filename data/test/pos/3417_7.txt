We came on a Thursday and ordered the beer sampler and Southwest egg rolls. \n\n- Happy hour extended! Great Waitress! It ended at 630 but she was kind enough to let it slide. \n- Egg rolls taste more like a flauta. \n- Sample 6 beers. 3rd one is too hoppy. 1st and last are the best. good deal for $7. \n- Lots of TVs. Big party friendly.\n- Just like SD and SJ.
