My favorite restaurant in Vegas. I fantasize about the fusion burrito with kimchi whenever I'm eating anything that isn't a fusion burrito with kimchi. Also the food quantity to cost ratio and flavor to cost ratio is more mind blowing than quantum mechanics. I just can't get my mind around it. But it doesn't matter, because every time I wrap my lips around a fusion burrito my mind instantly drifts away from rationality and enters an altered state of consciousness that consists of unadulterated bliss and euphoria. It's a profoundly addictive experience.
