It's an airport. Definitely not one of the best I've been to. Kind of dated, has the usual overpriced shops, long security lines, etc. There are slot machines everywhere you go. They do have free wifi, a good redeeming factor. \nI'm allergic to this airport, though. No, seriously; something in this airport makes my eyes run. Happened when I arrived here and as soon as I returned for my departure.
