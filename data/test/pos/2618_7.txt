This place is cool, weird, fun, and cute! Oh, and birdy! They have a great location and their place is full of eye candy! Interesting patterns, art, bird cage art, wall paper, carpets... Just wow! It's kind of one of those things you have to check out for yourself :) very interesting concept.\nStaff is great, it has it's own personality, and the beds are comfy :)
