It was in our last visit to Vegas that my bf mentioned the Jabbawockeez.  I've never heard of it, but he raved about it.  I've been dating my bf a little shy of a year, and he is relatively a good bf so I decided to take him to watch this show for St. Patrick's day.\n\nThis show was nothing short of incredible.  It was funny, creative, inspiring, motivational, and exceptional all around.  Although my primary reason for attending this event was to make my bf happy, I really think that I may have enjoyed it more.
