They have a nice terrasse on the iconic Jacques-Cartier square. Service was good, the waitress was always available, even though food came late. \nWe had a breakfast, which had a fancy name, but not that great taste, I chose the terroir; two eggs, bacon, sausages, baked beans, roasted potatoes, creton, homemade jams, fresh fruits and variety of toast. The homemade jam is tasty with their bread.\nTheir coffee was average.
