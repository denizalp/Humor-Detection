I love everything they make. My 'must haves' would definitely be the chick\/tortilla soup. The portabella taco is always good. The shrimp\/mandarin salad is fabulous. Fresh brewed ice tea and the most unexpected music playing. I like it, I don't think most folks even know what they are hearing, and that makes me giggle. Hooray, Rubio's!
