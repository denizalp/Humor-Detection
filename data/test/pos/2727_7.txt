First vegas show ever. It was amazing. The guys are so talented and really put on a show!!!\n\nI say call in to order tickets instead of waiting in line hoping to get good seats. My friends and I ordered our tickets over the phone a few hours before the show and got great seats!! (Row 7 right in the center for 100\/person)\n\nSuper entertaining show!!!
