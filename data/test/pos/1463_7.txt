Literally the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Got the yang chow fried rice and it was bland, so I added salt. Little did I know that it would only bring out the cardboard flavor.\n\nMy friend ordered the general tso's chicken. It was too fried, too sweet, too salty, and too HORRIBLE.\n\nDO NOT EAT HERE (unless you have no taste buds and love drinking grease).
