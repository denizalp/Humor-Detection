Really liked this place. Great big outdoor patio, decent crowd. Its not too casual, but not too dressy. Took a bit long to get my drinks, but hey- it was a Saturday night. I'd say overall, one of my top 5 places in old town. \nTip- check in & get specials\nOh, and they are also open late, Friday night they still let me order food at 3am! How cool is that?
