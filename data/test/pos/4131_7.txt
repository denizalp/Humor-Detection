I heard so much about this place, I had such high expectations... I ordered a chocolate cereal milk (milkshake) and it literally tasted like baby food, I couldn't eat it anymore... I had to throw it away. \nI felt like the people working there didn't know what they were doing. The place is overrated and overpriced, not worth it.
