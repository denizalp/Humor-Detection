Free shave for breast cancer!  Valinda, our beautician even wore all pink lol.  She was sweet, gently w\/ my mom & shaved the rest of mom's hair off.  Her hair was coming off in globs so I cut it off, kind of uneven so she shaved it cleanly off. \n\nThey have a program called Clips for Kindness to google the other complimentary services they offer.
