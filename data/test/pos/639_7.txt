After pigging out at Caplansky's a few doors down and rolling my fat ass down the street, I stumbled upon this little store that I have nicknamed \"Heaven\"\n\nI love doughnuts. Love. LOVE. I also love bacon. Love. LOVE. \n\nSo when I saw a Maple Bacon doughnut I pretty much pushed over a pregnant lady and an elderly woman standing in the doorway to get inside. \n\nThe store is really cool. Looks crisp and clean. \n\nI was so full I could only have 1 doughnut but they all looked pretty amazing. \n\nImma go back. Probably tomorrow.\n\n#jellymoderndoughnuts - mmm mmmmm mmmm
