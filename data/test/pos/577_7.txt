Hakkasan has good resident DJ's like Calvin Harris, but the layout of the club is meant for people with bottle service. The dance floor is tiny, and there is pretty much nowhere to sit for people who don't have a table (unless you go to the Ling Ling Lounge, where it's basically empty). If you're able to get a table to let you pass by them to get to the little stage-ish part in front of the dance floor, you can stand there and get a great view. Still had a great time, but wouldn't come back.
