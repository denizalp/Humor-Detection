I love Prado.  I have dined there several times and every time the food options are better and better. The Halibut is out of this world.  The service can be slow at sometimes but the atmosphere and live music makes up for it.  Prado practices the slo food movement and I think that is why the servers take their time.  The Mbar in the front of the venue has happy hours that are a lot of fun $5 wine and tapas which allow you to sample the menu at an affordable price.  Definitely going back!
