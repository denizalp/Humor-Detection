The menu has changed!!! No sandwiches, just mediterranean...\n\nSuper bummed. Don't get me wrong, falafels and donairs are delicious, but they're no deli sandwich with chips, and a pickle.\n\nAll I wanted was a delicious deli sandwich, but all that stood in front of me was quinoa, donair, samosas, and falafels. I felt like crying. I am heartbroken.
