Decided to chill with a buddy, a sexy buddy. I go to The Vig Uptown as a regular and enjoy it so I knew meeting my friend at Arcadia Vig would be really fun. The outdoor patio is large and this evening, full. The staff and patrons are super pleasant. We chat the evening away.\n\nIt was mainly cocktail hour but knowing the menu I will look forward to wining, dining and sixty nine degree weather hopefully. Big Hugs Shorty, it was good to see you; )
