How can I not give 5 stars to a place that gave me a Philly-Steak the size of a 747 for $9? \n\n The gentleman working the counter was nice and even delivered our sandwich to the adjacent bar. Now that's what I call customer service. \n\n This behemoth of a sandwich was messy, gooey and loaded with meaty flavor. It was one of the better sandwiches I've eaten. The next time I'm in Cleveland, I'm definitely stopping back.
