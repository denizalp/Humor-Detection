We rent a 3 bedroom house from manny,there have been little problems here and there but he's always fixed them and pretty fast.I really have nothing bad to say.So I'll talk about the good.1st our air went out he had someone there the next day.Had some electronic problem he had someone there fast.We also have a pool,yes we have had 2 different guys now,but who cares the pool is getting taken care of.So all in all I believe they are great landlords.
