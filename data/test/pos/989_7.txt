Genius for Cosmopolitan to have a Pizza joint open after clubbing hour!  I don't want to go to an overpriced caf√© out of desperation and pay $20 for a LOWER THAN Denny's quality meals anymore!  Just under $5 you can get a delicious slice of NY pizza just enough to coat the stomach after a night of drinking.\n\nI went on a Wednesday night after an event at Marquee so there was no line, but I wonder how long the wait is on a busy night!
