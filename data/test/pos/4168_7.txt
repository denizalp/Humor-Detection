Imagine every hipster, Pinterest-inspired wedding you've ever seen. Then mix all that into an overblown cliche. The Duce would be the result.\n\nMason jars everywhere. Park benches as tables. Barnyard and rustic \"chic.\" And they ask for your \"crazy nickname\" when you order. I was waiting to find the photo booth.\n\nOverhyped if you ask me. I can see why Guy Fieri would recommend it.\n\nMega overpriced menu with very limited options. The kitchen is an airstream trailer.\n\nAlso, it's half gym...? Weird.
