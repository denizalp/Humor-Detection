Tarot, wands, wicca, estrogen.\n\nI actually collect Tarot decks, don't look at me like that. It's about the art. THE ART. The Lady had some classic decks and some I'd never seen - def leaning more toward the 60s\/70s stuff than newer, and all super-reasonably priced. \n\nSome random bedroom articles - sex checks, etc - but this is more about naturey, dreamcatchery, gemstones and tonics and lotiony womanhood. You can smell the patchouli from a half mile away.\n\nAnd that's just fine.
