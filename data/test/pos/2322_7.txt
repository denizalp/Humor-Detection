Great tourist attraction. feature shops, botquies, night clubs, art museums, Good Luck with finding a place to park. I highly recommend valet.\n\nThere is so much history in Old Town. You can find historical museums or take a ride on the trolley. My favorites are all the options to dine at after taking a stroll through all the shops. \n\nFarmers Market on Saturday's with local vendors. That is another great perk about old down many local shops and boutiques with a variety of things to enjoy.
