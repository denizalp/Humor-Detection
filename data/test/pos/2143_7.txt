I called to see if I could get my dog in for a grooming. Left a message and received a call back. The first thing they asked was, what kind of dog I have. (Aussiedoodle) After I told them what kind of dog I have they said there are no openings till after Christmas, \"especially for new customers.\" So are there no openings? Or no openings for my Aussiedoodle? Interesting.
