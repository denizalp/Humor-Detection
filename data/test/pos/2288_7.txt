OMG HERSHEY'S WORLD. Walking in, I noticed the huge cupcake in the display. All those desserts looked so delicious. So sad, I didn't get to try any but OMGOMGOMG.\n\nGet all your Hershey's related items here. From many different flavors to different sub-brands under Hershey's like Jolly Ranchers. There's HUGE bars of chocolates yee! It's a good 2 level walk around. Just make sure you don't go crazy and go home with an empty wallet and cavities hehe.
