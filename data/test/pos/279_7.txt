This place always looks crowded from the outside. Hmmm if its this crowded all the time, this place must be a great place to check out! Or maybe not. \n\nDid I just get a kids cup of beer for $6?  \n\nWhy is it crowded outside but not inside? Maybe everyone is trying to leave the place but no one is moving out the way! \n\nI wonder if the food is good here though, because the wings and nachos looked good. \n\nTime to move on. I was out of there as soon as I got my drink.
