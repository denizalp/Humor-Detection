Very unprofessional.. Can't understand \/ speak English. My conversation with these people was a disaster, just asked if they deliver & it took the lady 10 minutes to reply.. Asking me if I have a baby? ..then the husband comes on the phone and says he has no car. Um.. Definitely not even going to attempt to order from here in the future.
