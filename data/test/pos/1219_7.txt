The waitress started by saying she was off - she was off, off in timbuktu. The service was lacking. But the pad thai was great as usually. The sweet potatoe fries were so hot, the roof, the roof, the roof of my mouth was on fire. \n\nThis is a great place to eat when you can't think of another place to eat.
