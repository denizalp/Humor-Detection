I enjoyed this place in the 90's. But I really don't see why it still exists. Does anyone buy CD's anymore? I can get any DVD\/BluRay I want on Ebay. \n\nIf I wanted tacky trinkets I could go to some place like Spencer's in the mall or Red Hot Robot if I fancied myself \"cool.\" \n\nPerhaps its time Zia faded away like the VCR or countless other  pieces of 20th century technology.
