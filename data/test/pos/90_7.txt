I haven't had very good experiences with this place.  I came here when they first opened and it still hasn't improved.\n\nThe last time, my sandwich was made incorrectly and I was given the incorrect side.\n\nWhen you're in this business, you can't really afford to get simple things wrong since there are plenty of other options.\n\nFor that reason, I won't be visiting NY Slicers Deli for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf you're in that area, just drive up to Romanelli's on 35th and Dunlap.
