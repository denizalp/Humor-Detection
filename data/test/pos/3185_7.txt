the colors attract the essence\nthe presence fulfills that aura \nthat no other casino has, have\nor is yet to have.  atmosphere is\nlively and inviting enough to \nenjoy anything and everything\nstrong enough to over come \nthe sudden loss of money at\nrisk.  workers work and have\nthat extra umff of having THE\nfun table.  not the sad, killing\ntime table that only talks when\nthe bartender comes around\nor when you win or lose.  but\nthose in between moments \nthat only the fun table has.  \nenjoy planet hollywood.  the \nname is their reputation.  and\ni thank you planet hollywood.\nthank you. =P
