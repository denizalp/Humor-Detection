simonster's version of hell on earth (part 2)...\n\n-  huge crowds of idiots milling about that make these businesses prosper\n-  people that can't handle their liquor but insist on ordering and drinking tons of it, leading to ridiculous drunkenness and drama\n-  insufficient number of bathrooms\n-  establishment that prioritizes making a buck over service\n-  ridiculously expensive\n-  rude staff with a serious god complex\n-  crazy lines\n-  smokers everywhere
