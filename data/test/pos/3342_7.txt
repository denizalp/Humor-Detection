Do not recommend this restaurant. Fried rice was tasty. But, overall meal was not to my liking. The egg drop soup had corn in it....which was weird. Then the meat in my Mongolian beef did not taste like normal beef, unsure how it was prepared or possibly they used processed meat.  The service was good though, the price was low, and nothing was wrong with my meal or my order. But, I will not be returning.
