They have a wide variety of men's cologne here and that was the purpose of the visit. At the same time,I didn't miss the chance to browse for a good tinted moisturizer and I was helped by a lovely male staff and he suggested better products for my extremely sensitive skin. He applied it on my face,blended and did my eye brows too for just 8 minutes! \n\nThe staff were amazing! I got a free item for using the rewards. We walked out happy and I looked 6 months younger! Thanks....(blushes).
