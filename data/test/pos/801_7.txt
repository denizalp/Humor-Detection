Just wanted to try since they just opened very recently. Was seated by the door with other tables available and gave up after waiting 10 minutes with no waitress\/server coming by. The place was not busy. As far as the menu goes, they have typical plain pizza with many chices, calzones, rib, sandwiches, dinners. Nothing that fancy.
