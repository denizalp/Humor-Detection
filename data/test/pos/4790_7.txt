I'll start with the decor and atmosphere - it's great. Bollywood posters and pictures give it fun and interesting feel as opposed to a traditional Indian vibe. \n\nBut that's where the good stops. I had the jumbo chicken tikka, which for $11 should be filling. However, it fell short of being enough and moreover, was lacking taste and flavour. This was literally the first time I've had to add hot sauce and flavour to Indian food. Overpriced and not worth it.
