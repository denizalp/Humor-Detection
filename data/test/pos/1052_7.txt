Yelp steered us here for brunch, but your only option is a buffet.  And it's not good.\n\nMy waffle was okay, but the syrup dish had a lot of \"skin\" that had developed in the tray.  Kinda chunky when pouring it out.\n\nThe bacon and sausage weren't particularly flavorful.  The \"homemade\" biscuits were hard.\n\nOf all the places we ate in Champaign, this was the worst.  Definitely not worth $20+ for the same kind of Sterno-warmed slop you'd find at Old Country Buffet.\n\nGo get a cup of Jarling's Custard and make that your brunch.
