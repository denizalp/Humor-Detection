Nice big stadium.  However, the entrance they had us go in made us walk almost the whole of the stadium to find the escalator.  Other than that, found the stadium to be fairly clean.  The downgraded review is based on some fairly jerkish patrons who thought it was okay to manhandle across two other attendees and scream in her ear because she was rooting for the other team.  In that, I seriously think security was lacking and the ability to stop serving certain patrons adult beverages.
