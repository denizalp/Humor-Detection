I'm pretty stoked that another rolled ice cream place opened up in town AND one that's near my house. I definitely like this place more than the other rolled ice cream place down Flamingo. This little shop is really cute and IKEA-d out. There's only two ice pans there but they also have gelato. \n\nI like the rolled ice cream here because the flavors are unique (like Thai tea) and they don't leave the ice cream on the pan too long, so it's wayyyy creamier and doesn't taste like freezer burn.
