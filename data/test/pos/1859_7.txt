This school is terrible! At first they come off as very nice. They'll promise you anything to trap you into enrolling there! Once you're hooked, you're pretty much on your own. If you have any issues, their Student Services Advisers are extremely rude and unhelpful. You're treated almost as if you're another figure on a spreadsheet. I've been treated with more respect at other learning institutions. I would recommend that you do not waste your time here.
