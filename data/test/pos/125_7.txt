This eventually will have someone die. The strap is not safe enough. More straps to hold you in your seat is needed.  When you go backwards I almost fell out of my seat.  Most unsafe ride\/amusement in Las Vegas by far!!!   I have done everything in Vegas but I would never EVER do this one again.  \n\nThink long and hard before you do this ride. I pray you have a will made. \n\n\nHotel is great-miss the party from the ceilings.
