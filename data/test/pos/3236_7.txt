Okay, still a solid 4 stars, but I have to update to make sure everyone is aware that if there was a soup good enough to warrant putting up with the beratings of a moody Saddam Hussein doppelganger a la Seinfeld, it would be the #15 soup at Thai Lahna.  It's absolutely incredible.  Mouthgasm in every spoonful.  I don't even want to know what's in it because it definitely tastes like \"butter\" is one of the top 3 ingredients, which makes it awesome for my mouth but not so awesome for my ass. But it's totally worth it.
