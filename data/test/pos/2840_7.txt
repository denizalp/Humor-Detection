Been craving honey hot wings and Native is the place to go. However, today's visit was a complete fail. Although my service was good, the food was very poor and disappointing. \nI order a dozen wings with 2 different sauces. The honey hot was good, however the medium wings were minus the sauce, completely!!!!\nThe carrots were the saddest carrots ever. Completely dried out with bad spots. \nI did ask for a side of extra sauce for my dried out wings and it was given without charging me but that's not the way the wings should be served.
