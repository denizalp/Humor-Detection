Stay away from these people.\n\nThis is one of those companies that overpromises and underdelivers.  \n\nThey botched a simple exterior door installation in our home - it took them 3 tries to get it done (this after we had waited over 14 weeks when they had promised to do the job within 8 weeks after contract signing.)
