I like the Our Gang Salon because it has a friendly, skilled staff and offers a variety of services and products for both hair and nails.  I've been going there for many years, and I have recommended Our Gang to lots of people because I know they will appreciate the quality of service that they will receive from the stylists and nail technicians.
