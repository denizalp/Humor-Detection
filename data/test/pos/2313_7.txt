Dollar Blackjack...Wah?! I'm there\nThe dealers are ornery but I don't care.\nEveryone says this place is run down but I don't think so.  It seems good to me, maybe a bit dated with their decor, but I'm here to gamble and get drunk.  Who cares what it looks like?\nI always win so every time I'm in Vegas I come here for a bit to make me some money.\n*rubs card on nipple*\nI always end up paying for the gas because everyone else lost :(\n*shakes fist at Vegas*\n\nI got super drunk one time and peed in the corner...and then ran away.\nSowwwwwwrrrrryyy
