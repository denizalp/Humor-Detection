This place is dark, loud, and filled with enough perfume\/cologne to make me go home with a headache. Really, its so dark that I can't get a good look at the clothing they are trying to sell me. Plus, theres a bench or couch outside (can't remember) that is a constant hangout for 13 year olds - making it hard to enter or exit the store. \n\nIt was one of those \"oh, cool, a new store, lets check it out!\" and after entering I immediately pulled a 180 and left. I'll be staying far, far away.
