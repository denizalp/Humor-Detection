Such an amazing restaurant!!!!\n\nI have been here a few times and I'm definitely addicted to that cauliflower shawarma!!!!! Honestly it's the only thing I have ever tried. I would love to try their version of falafel and their fries. \n\nThe owners are amazing and sweet. \n\nTry the hibiscus tea it's very yummy. \n\nAll veggie with a few items of dairy. \nExtremely plant based friendly.  \n\nGo ASAP!
