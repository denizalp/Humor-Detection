The one star is because that's the absolute minimum I can give. Sat at the bar near the POS for fifteen minutes, watching other guests who arrived after me receive immediate service. Finally was able to place an order, which the bartender Chris got wrong when he was repeating it back to me. He forgot to bring my girlfriend's drink, and we waited an eternity for the bill. I can't stress enough how angry I am to receive such dismal service. Will not be back.
