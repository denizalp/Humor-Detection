Tried this place out for the first time and my wife and I loved it. Friendly and fast service, the jack Johnson banana pancakes were awesome and whatever my wife had was great too. They have toy baskets for kids and you get to write or draw on their wall (don't forget to like my ninja turtle in between the m\/f bathroom).\n\nOur only complaints were the random \/uncomfortable chairs and their cheap and flimsy eating utensils. \n\nOther than that, we will be back for sure.
