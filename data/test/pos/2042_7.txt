I attempted Lin's, to be honest, but it was inhumanely packed, had too long of a line, and was highly priced.  I went with 80% as good for 50% the price and came here.  I think I made a fine decision.\n\nRand is the GRand Boofay Master, and I can add very little to his well-written review.  \nEverything he says about New Great China is true:\n\nThe food is pretty darned good.\nThe booth was uncomfortable.\nIt deserves to survive amidst nearly insurmountable competition.\nThe server was really cute.
