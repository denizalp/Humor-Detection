Nice store, brand new, smells good. But this is supposed to be a nonprofit store & give good deals. This store is extremely overpriced & a complete rip off. I have a picture posted to show proof. I had to giggle when I seen it.... they're selling old crusty Christmas decor for $0.99 when I can buy it brand new for $0.97 the price tags are literally on the front, they didn't even attempt to cover the original price. Pathetic.
