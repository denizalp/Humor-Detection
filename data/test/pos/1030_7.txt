Came here for a UYE.  If you took the boston memorabilia down, this place would rock.  The pizza reminds me of my east coast youth and they rock with Faygo Rock and Rye and Red Pop.  They make beignets and let you put your own powdered sugar on yourself.  A small kid table in the corner.  The staff is friendly and the pizza is reasonably priced.  I wish it was a little larger and the seating more comfortable.
