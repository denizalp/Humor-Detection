It was probably about a year ago that Pam did my nails. I had no idea she had a Yelp page, or I would have submitted a review earlier.\n\nShe made me feel pretty bad about the state of my nails. I was there to get pretty nails and she just kept putting me down about the fact that my nails were so short.\n\nThe nail job was fine, it wast just a very uncomfortable experience. Pam didn't really seem like she wanted to be doing my nails.
