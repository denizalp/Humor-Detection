Certainly one of the best offered here in Phoenix. With 5 different haunted houses and lots of ghouls working the event, you can tell there is a lot of work put into it. It's almost a whole night event if you don't go with the fast pass. Each attraction you wait in line for. I found the sets very well done. \nI found the only downside is actually the street lights were blinding at times. \nDefinitely worth the money and top of my list for places to return to. Not for those who scare easily.
