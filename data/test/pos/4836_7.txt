I can't believe I'm going to type this, but......getting a new drivers license was pleasant....yes, I said it....it was pleasant.  Here's why:\n\n+ The total process from start to finish on a Friday morning took 25 minutes.\n\n+ Everyone was friendly.\n\n+ Forms were short and easy to fill out.\n\n+ The process flow was fluid and logical.\n\nMost of my experience with a joint like this are frustrating...not here.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%....at some point I have to come back, right? :)
