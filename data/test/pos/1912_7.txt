Back when this place was open, I've been to Sweet-o twice.\n\nThe atmosphere at Sweet-o was very nice.  It seemed like a perfect place to take your date.  Each time I went with my guy friend, we ordered the sparkling white wine, a panini, and some sort of dessert.  Although the price was kind of high [you can go to Cheesecake Factory!], it was okay.  It was a good place to go if you just want to relax.
