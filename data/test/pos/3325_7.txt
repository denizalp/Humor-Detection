Pro: Ask for Carmello... he is an excellent Italian tailor and such a nice man.  He did great work for me!  I go back because he knows what he is doing.\n\nCon: Josie the owner is never in the in AM (if you drop off at that time) and so she calls you back with a price.   I found this annoying\/frustrating.... I already left my stuff, I need it done, so what now about the price?
