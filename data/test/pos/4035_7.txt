I manage a few rental properties in Wisconsin and this was my first time hiring a cleaning service, and I was so very satisfied! I love that they use eco-friendly cleaning products as well!   After they got done cleaning, my rental home looked immaculate and smelled amazing! They are very easy to contact and book- and offer every option you would want (one time, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly). I hired them for a one time cleaning and will be rehiring for bi-weekly or on as as-needed basis when rental volume is high.
