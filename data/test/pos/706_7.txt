My egg foo young was...different today. Not the flavorful patty to which I've become accustomed. It was kind of a bummer because I was having major cravings for the Combination #1. The chow mein was good, the shrimp was very good and the fried rice was noticeably not fried rice. Humpf! Even my fortune sucked sticks: \"If you're riding ahead of the herd, look back once in a while to make sure it's still there.\" Dafuq?!
