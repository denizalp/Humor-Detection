Very fun experience I must say they kept the theme through and through... all they sell is basically burgers and hot dogs so please be a beef fan.. all the alcohol drinks come in the coolest props.. and you get to keep them! Definitely a fun spot to take the family! And experience the fun. (The minus 1 star for the food , the burgers were just ok but not horrible)
