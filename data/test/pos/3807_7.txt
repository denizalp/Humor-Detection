I have been waiting for The Chicken Shack to open since I saw the signs about a month ago. This new  location on Rainbow is great for your chicken cravings. Deliciously juicy chicken fingers and wings for a good price. Wings are quite large. My boyfriend and I were able to share three fingers and a few wings. Ask for sauces on the side as the chicken is fine and a bit salty (and oily) on its own. That is probably the only downfall but good in an unhealthy way ha. Shoe string fries have a nice crunch.
