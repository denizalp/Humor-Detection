Best Vegas clubbing experience ever! EVER!!\n\nEven arriving early, we couldn't beat the other eager-beavers. Good thing the line moved fast. \n\nThe outdoor pool area is so beautiful with the cabana and all. Lounge beds in the pool. I can just lay there and people-watch all night.\n\nNo shoving or elbowing. At least for the early part of the night, but by then I was having too much of a good time to care. \n\nDrinks are pricey ($15 for a red bull vodka!) and the dance floor is small for the amount of ppl they let in.
