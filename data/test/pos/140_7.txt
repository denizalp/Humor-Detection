We came here on a saturday night.\n\n- with vcard, it only grants free admission (no $10 cover) and you got to wait in gen admission. \n- extremely crowded. for the non-smokers, it is a definitely problem. \n- seems more like a karaoke bar. everyone just yells the songs together. top40, some classic rock.  \n-  didn't stay very long. get a boot drink. jump up and down with the crowd while buzzed. someone blows smoke in your face. time to leave.
