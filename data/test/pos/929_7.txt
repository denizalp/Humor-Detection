Hadn't had any cavities in a long time... All of a sudden had 10??? Since 7 were on one side but multiple surfaces of teeth equal the 7 (not 7 teeth), decided to do one side at a time. Had horrible sensitivity and pain. Decided to go elsewhere for 2nd opinion. Gave them my last digital X-rays and they took new ones. Said NO cavities... So where are those last 3 that were on the other side???? Beware! Never going back there. Ask their front office staff how long they've been there... They keep getting new people, wonder why.
