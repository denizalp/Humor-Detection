Gary is awesome. After discovering a dark spot on our ceiling, right under our bathroom, we feared the worst. Called Gary on Friday afternoon, came Saturday morning. Instead of going through the ceiling like everyone else wanted to, he pulled the toilet, found that our seal was broken, fixed it within 30 minutes, no need to reschedule for him to come back another time!!!!! And for a surprisingly low price. \nJust an awesome guy, fixing everything without trying to rip you off.
