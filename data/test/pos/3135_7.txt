Let me actually edit this a little more, before I say fuck this place a few times more. We stayed here in March, it was great, we stayed in August it was great but this is the first time I've ever been treated like I was some bum. Kyle, the manager, a prick! He needs a lesson in hospitality and respect.\n\nAfter the treatment we received from that man, not even a gentleman, I immediately cancelled our room and got a full refund and paid double to stay at a more accommodating place.
