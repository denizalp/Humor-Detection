Burger was cold and dry. For $13 I should at least get hot food. I only forced myself to eat more than one bite because I had to get on a long flight. Even then I only took 4 bites. I recommend going to the Indian restaurant \"Marathi\" where they take more pride in their food. I just spent the last twenty minutes talking to this young American guy about his burnt hamburger. We are not happy right now.\nOh and we had to wait a loooooong time to receive said crappy food, and this place isn't even busy.
