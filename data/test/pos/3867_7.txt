Sauce tastes canned. Service is meh. Great if you don't know about how great Italian food should be, perfect for the plethora of anglos in the area. Pasta was overcooked too. At least the bread they serve you at the beginning is warm. If a friend has a party here I usually just skip it, theres better Italian along StJeans, no need to waste time and money here in my opinion.
