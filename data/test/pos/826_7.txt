If I could give zero stars, I would.  I have never had a more condescending staff \"serve\" me as a customer there.  The wait times are horrible (even if you book an appointment ahead of time).  The staff (including management) is really arrogant.  I LOVE Apple products, but if this is a reflection of how the company views their consumers, I will happily buy a different brand.
