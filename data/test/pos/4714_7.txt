First impressions are everything.  The people who greeted us at the front were rude and not at all personable. There were barriers to even talking to a salesperson.  When a customer walks in to spend thousands of dollars in your store, we don't expect to be treated like it's a hospital emergency room.  Please work on customer service.  We are going elsewhere.
