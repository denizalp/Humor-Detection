Busy weekend for Memorial day and Freemont street was hopping with live music which could be heard from the machines near by the door, which was kind of nice. \n\nThe casino was hoppin too! lots of people, the machines were busy ringing out with all their lights, bells and whistles, and it was never too dark or too seedy for it being down town.  All in all, a place I'd visit again.
