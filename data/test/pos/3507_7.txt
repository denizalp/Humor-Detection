I will say this: they do have big, fat Greek Gyros. Personally I wouldn't be ordering anything else off the menu. The gyros are filling and delicious. Some of you may be asking, \"But are they authentic?!\" Who cares! They're massive! \n\nThe service could be a little quicker, but in their defense it was quite busy on a Saturday afternoon. Also, one of the plants was dead, which just confirms that this shop is run by a bunch of guys. \n\nConclusion: Eat a gyro. Enjoy.
