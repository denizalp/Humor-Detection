Staff more concerned about each other than customers who are shopping. The staff tend to be all talking amongst each other and not worried about the paying customers in the store. I don't want to be hounded but being acknowledged would be nice. They have great sales when they have end of season, the only reason they get two stars because if I had to base it on staff, they would get a 0.
