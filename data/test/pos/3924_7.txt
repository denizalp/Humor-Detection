one of the newer bars in coventry, there's a bar area and then tons of couches\/chairs if you want the hookah scene.\n\nnormally i would give a place like this 2 stars since there's nothing special about it, but one time a friend knocked a hookah on the floor, broke it, and almost set the place on fire...and they didn't kick us out - there my friends is the reason for the 3rd star.
