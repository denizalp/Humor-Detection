No matter how good the food, if the restaurant doesn't have good customer service, they aren't worth my time. Is it that hard to fake being nice? Employees are rude (and quite obvious about it) and their portions are too expensive for what you get. Food wasn't bad, wasn't great. Obviously won't be coming back.
