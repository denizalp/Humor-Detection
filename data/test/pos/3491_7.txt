Yeh!!!\n\n- New location with modern, casual, welcoming feel. Yeh!\n\n- Great concept: Self serve. You take a cup and you fill it with whatever you want! That includes any combination of frozen yogurt flavours (at least 10) and toppings (more than 40!). Yeh!  And you pay by weight at the end. \n\n- Must try flavour: pina colada. Must try topping: brownies. \n\n- Amazing staff! Even though it was already passed closing time, they explained everything to us and they let us try EVERY single flavour!  Yeh!\n\nhighly recommended!
