I came here to dinner with my friend. It was during the week, so it wasn't too busy and the wait wasn't too long for a table either. \n\nI ordered the gnocchi and short ribs. The short ribs were so tender and the sauce was very good. I thought the entree was very filling though and my friend felt the same way about hers. \n\nThey also have really good cocktails here and the service was really good. They have a brunch menu as well as happy hour. I'd come back to try some other items!
