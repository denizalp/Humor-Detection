I am from Atlanta and I been drinking alcohol 20 years nows this is the worst bar I ever visit. All drinks I have order I couldn't test any alcohol. When I complained to the manager he was like that's how we make it. If you really do make this kind of drinks then you need to learn again. Horrible drinks \n\nI do like the food though. Best pork tacos.
