So nice! It's a really clean, comfortable place with great service. My nails have never looked better. They take the time to clean all the edges and create perfect lines at the base of the nail which highlights their attention to detail.  Just a great place to spend some time to relax and be pampered.  I'm only in Vegas for a short time, but I wish this place could come with me when I leave.  The place is inexpensive for the level of quality treatment and service provided.
