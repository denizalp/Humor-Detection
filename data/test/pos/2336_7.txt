Great service. If you can't find the bag you're looking for, they'll check with all the other Chanel boutiques in the area and (if it's available) make sure it's ready for you by the following day or two. I asked the SA (sadly can't remember her name) about a limited edition bag that was about 3 seasons old, and although I knew it was most likely not going to be available, they still tried their best to locate it.\n\nLove the view of the Wynn's waterfall from the patio here.
