The only reason I'm giving this spot a 3 out of 5 is I asked for a leaf design on my Nutella latte and I didn't get it. Everything from the entry way to the outdoor seating and upstairs seating as well as the nice decorations was on point. The customer service was fantastic.\n\nI suggest to train your baristas more in coffee art. I am in the entrepreneurial business in coffee and that is my passion. The espresso is delightful medium roast and is not bitter to the taste.
