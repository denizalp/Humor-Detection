Coming from the West Coast, I have been dissapointed time and time again with the flavor and overall quality of tacos out here. \n\nLa Unica has proved to me that you can always find a gem in the rough! I have not had anything but tacos there and I don't expect to have anything but tacos the next time I visit. Great place, service is quick and polite. Bonus points for giving out a very substantial amount of salsa to go with the chips! \n\nAs Arnold once said, 'I'll be back\"
