Awful awful aweful. This was our first time eating Dom  Demarcos and we got 2 large pizzas and garlic knots for carry out. I understand the pizza is supposed to have a char ,but these are burnt beyond belief and the crust is hard as a rock and inedible.  I called and the manager said I could have 10% off my next bill. Seriously?  I would never order again. $51 for food we can't eat the dang stuff. Super disappointed!!! I will post pictures of the crust. Someone really dropped the ball today at my expense.
