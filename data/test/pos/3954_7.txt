The Jack Singer Hall is one of the best concert venues I know in Canada. They have great acoustics and with the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra a fantastic main feature.\n\nOne impressing thing about the Jack Singer Concert Hall is, that it can be like a chameleon: it suits for classical concerts as well as pop, rock or even theatre. It can be a romantic place, an upscale or casual event or a tourist attraction - it all depends on what YOU as visitor want it to be.
