What can I say that hasn't been said?  \n\nXS is huge.\nXS is grandiose.\nXS is opulent.\nXS is expensive (if you don't have boys paying for your drinks and free admission)\nXS has a huge pool in the middle.\nXS played great music on a Friday night.\nXS had all the beautiful people in Vegas.\nXS has stripper poles everywhere.  Even the lights are stripper poles.\n\nThis is by far the best club I have ever been to in my life....and I've been to a lot of them.
