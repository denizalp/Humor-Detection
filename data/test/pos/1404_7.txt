Review for the gym:\n\nI don't understand the point of planet Hollywood charging you resort fees when you book your room & you still get charged for only using the gym. For the free weights, cardio equipment, & weight machines the gym is decent but being ripped off for 25 bucks when every other hotel doesn't charge to use the gym since its included in the resort fee is BS.
