**BUBBLY PEEPS AND BUBBLY DRINKS**\n\nIt is located inside a mall which I thought was odd, but it worked.\n\nDecor was Las Vegas-y with lofty ceilings, dripping chandeliers, and VIP tables. \n\n*LIKES:\n-Decor\n-Some bubbly was affordable at $7 a glass\n-Young, hip, and attractive peeps (yes, eye candy for everyone)\n-Owners walked around and introduced themselves\n-No flip flops or Uggs inside\n-DJ music\n-Nice staff\n-Free drinks from lots of sugar daddies\n\n*DISLIKES:\n-Teeny dance floor\n-$30 cab ride from Old Town\n-Too trendy\n-Not really a Tea Lounge\n\nThe girls and I had a great time and we would return in a heart beat.\n\nRECOMMEND.
