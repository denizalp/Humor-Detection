Springs Preserve, blues, and beer...or should I start with beer, Springs Preserve, and blues.  these are but a few of my favorite things.  It was a great event with many a different brew to sample in the beautiful splendor that is the Springs Preserve.  \n\nThe exploration of cold beer good to go and everyone that I came into contact with was in good spirits.  Not one \"hard guy,\" just happy peoples enjoying fermented fellowship.\n\nI see this come around again....and I will be there with bells on.
