Solid brewery\n\nDesert Rose Cactus Ale - really sour and tart at first, but as you drink it, the sweetness comes through. It's also gorgeous!!! What a hue\n\nMan their IPAs are ABV heavy hitters. the 24k Imperial IPA boasts a 9.2 ABV. Many other IPAs all really good and smooth\n\nBartender had a little fiery curt attitude with the way she talked. Had to ask her 100 questions and she would never explain anything.. but she kinda become nicer later\n\nOverall, good brewery, prices were higher than most breweries I've been to, but free jalapeno popcorn is yours for the taking
