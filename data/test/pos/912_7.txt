Went to buy a shoe sponge to clean my shoes prior to a meeting. Was told that I could only use cash since the purchase is below $10. \n\nWith no cash on hand and no need for me to buy anything else he refused my credit card and debit card without even the offer to charge a surcharge.  \n\nHe said they get \"dinged\" 2.5% on card purchases. Why not just build that into your costs instead refusing business? You just got dinged with a lost customer.
