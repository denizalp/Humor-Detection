I'm sorry that I'm unable to articulate the greatness that resides within this establishment.\n\nMy life course was forever changed on that blissful Wednesday morning when I happened upon Sorry Coffee Co.  \n\nThe Americano was quite possibly the best coffee that I have ever come into contact with.  I dressed my Americano with 2 packets of brown sugar granules and a splash of milk.  \n\nAdditionally, I purchased a chocolate croissant, but it was mediocre.\n\n-1 star because this place is tiny w\/ very limited seating.
