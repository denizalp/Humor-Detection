Went there for lunch and all the tables were dirty, they had to search for a clean one for us to sit. \n\nUnfortunately they don't speak very good English, they are in Mississauga after all. \n\nYou get a free soup dish if you order over $40 but it has nuts in it and our waiter didn't understand the question \"does this have nuts in it?\". It's a cold soup that's basically noodles floating in oil, told them to keep it. \n\nThe food was quite sub par, goto the pho restaurant instead, same plaza.
