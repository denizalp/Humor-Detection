This is a very pretentious dump, designed to impress the socialites who neither value money or service. Apparently \"Baku\" is Japanese for tiny little portions that we charge way too much for. There were a total of four tables sitting yet we had to constantly wait for service... I had to get up at one point to wave down our server to get another $22 drink.\nThe only positive is that what little food we got was actually pretty good, and the servers were all friendly.
