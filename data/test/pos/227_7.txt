This place is OKAY at best. The setup of the club is awesome but the dj sucks. I came because they said after 12 they start playing regular music like hip hop and mainstream music. But they lied. It was Mexican music all night. My group purchased 4 bottles and still couldn't have fun. A little honesty goes a long ways. If you only play Latin, then let me know that before I bring in a huge group that doesn't listen to that type of music.
