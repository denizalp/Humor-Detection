good sandwich,  tax-inclusive prices,  fair value and friendly staff ..  all good!   the dining area has that sterile sparse feel that a lot of independent and newly opened shops tend to have,   i'm sure they will flourish and get comfortable.      \n\nturkey avocado was surprisingly good.   like that austrian dude said,  i'll be back
