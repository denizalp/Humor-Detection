I want to make love to a cream puff sundae.  Maybe even marry one.  They're that good.  Other than totally awesome desserts, this pace is a dump. The g-damn flickering fluorescent lights give me a headache.\n\nGo there for dessert, inhale it before the flickering lights give you a seizure then run before you get sucked into a shit-hole linoleum time-warp.
