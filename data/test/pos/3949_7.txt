Someone let their wife loose in this casino with her butterfly infatuation. The decor in this casino is absolutely butterfly obnoxious. I found myself running from place to place trying to escape them. Thank goodness I was able to retreat into an endless glass of tito's and soda while playing switch black jack. Like a good end to a bad LSD trip the butterflies weren't so bothersome after getting wasted. Nonetheless, the restaurant options were good and the beach club rocks.
