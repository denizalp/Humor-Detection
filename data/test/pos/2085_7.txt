i wanted some bourbon and they didn't have any, not even maker's.\n\nmy friend wanted a jack and coke and they didn't have jack daniels.\n\nthis music venue was woefully inadequate in the booze department.  unless a tidal wave of heavy drinkers wiped them out the night before and they didn't have a chance to re-stock IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS.\n\nplease up your booze ante.
