My beautiful wife and I came here for lunch on Sunday. Not busy at all. We came for the KFC. Was disappointed they did not have wings but they did have the whole fried chicken.\n\nWe had a half and half spicy and half soy glarkic chicken.  Amazing. So delicious. \n\nWe also had a  spicy pork hot pot. So good. \n\nService was 5\/5. This place seems to be run by a family. The parents cook the food and the son and daughter were waiting tables. So good to see this type of family business. Food was 5\/5.
