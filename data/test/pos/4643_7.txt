Dear Holsteins,\n\nWhen I first laid eyes on you, I knew it was meant to be. Your name. Your hip, too-good-to-be-a-burger-joint atmosphere. Your alcohol-infused, belly-busting milkshakes. Your everything. \n\nThen I tasted you. Again and again. I couldn't get enough. Now I'm sitting here missing you, wishing I could be near you again, gazing at you and inhaling your savory offerings.\n\nWhy did I leave you behind? I want to be close to you again. I want to make sweet, sweaty love to you. I want to bury my face in your buns. \n\nOh Holsteins, how I love you.
