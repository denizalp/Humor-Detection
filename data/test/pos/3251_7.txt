I had a Groupon for a full set of lashes, decided to go with the mink instead of the synthetic & I'm glad I did! Ty was wonderful, the chairs they have are wonderful one can fall a sleep in them while they are putting on your lashes! Everyone was so nice & quick to answer any questions. Everyone loves my lashes, I wouldn't go anywhere else! \n\nSara from Vegas
