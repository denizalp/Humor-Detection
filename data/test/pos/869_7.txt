If you love to sing and practice this place is the place to be! This place is cheap and a great hangout place and sing.\n\nFor an hour I only paid 20$\n\nThey also serve alchol their for those of you guys who need to be drunk to sing.. lol\n\nThe only thing i did not like about this place was it was so HOT! they were cooling the place with electric fans..\n\nBut overall all i rate this place a 4 you can't complain cheap karaoke with drinks and your own private room cant go wrong with that..
