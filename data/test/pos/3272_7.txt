ARO Plumbing (www.aroplumbing.ca) also go by the name Need A Plumber (www.needaplumbercanada.ca). They are a complete RIP Off!! STAY AWAY. We had them come fix some plumbing issues for us. They claimed to be replacing a very expensive plumbing part that cost almost $4000. After further investigation we discovered the part (Liberty Pumps LE51A 1\/2-Horse Power) actually only costs $350 to a max of $600. Given the highest range they actually charged us $400\/hr per person for the work done. Stay away. HUGE RIP OFF ARTISTS.
