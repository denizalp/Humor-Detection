This restaurant met all of our expectations. The ambiance, the food and the service was great! And the prices are decent. We stuck to the basics being that it was our first time and ordered Pad Thai, Yellow Curry and Spring Rolls. The Spring Rolls were my least favorite only because the herbs were too strong for my liking. The best part was the Sticky Rice with Ice Cream for dessert. Loved it! We've been waiting for an authentic Thai restaurant in our area! We'll definitely be back!
