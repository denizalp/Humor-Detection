I got a groupon and decided to try this place.  I got a lomi lomi message with a coconut touch.    The front staff was super friendly and helpful.  I got undressed and chilled out in the wait area that was stocked with drink, hot tea, snacks, etc.  Place was very clean and nice.  The showers are awesome.  The therapist explained the lomi lomi and she was AWESOME sauce.  I feel like butter after the massage.
