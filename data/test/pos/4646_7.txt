I love las vegas airport.. very friendly personal working all over the airport.. first airport i ever went where I got treated very good !! Normally at most airports you get treated like shit... Also loved the lay out and that it has casinos at the airport and smoking area casino !!! Nowadays nowhere you can smoke at any airport once you crossed costumes... and when you have a 13 hour flight ahead of you with fear of flying and you're a smoker.. then this comes in very handy !!!
