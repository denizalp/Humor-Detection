VERY DISAPPOINTED. The owner displays items that are derogatory to Native Americans and African Americans. When this was brought to her attention she said \"shop elsewhere\" rather than trying to understand the impact cigar store Indians and statutes of Blacks holding lanterns has on those of this race. Thumbs down on ignorance!
