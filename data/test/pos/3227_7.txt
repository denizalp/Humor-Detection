Gah! I still love this place! There's such a variety of great shows to see!\n\nWe caught Nick Swardson this past Saturday. Sixth row seats for $29 each. What a deal!\n\nAnd just stellar concessions - A Triple C IPA, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Bag of chips and $5 discount parking voucher only $20.  Someone in a bow tie pours your drink in a cup for you, your chips in a bowl and a sparkle gleams from their smile - *ding*. Feeling pampered yet? You can bring your drinks and snacks in theater too!\n\nSWEET!!!!
