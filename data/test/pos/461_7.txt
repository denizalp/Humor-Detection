We had the Patty on marble rye bread and Reuben-ish on wheat. It was so good. Prices are reasonable. Menu is seasonal ..I think thats a great thing, no one wants bitter heirloom tomatoes! You can text in your order as well. Teo and Josh (who I think are owners) were friendly and made us feel welcome! Gotta try this place sandwich lovers!!!!\n\nThnx to Janelle for hippin a brotha to this spot!
