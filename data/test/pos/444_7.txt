Best latte I have ever had so I keep coming back here, but the customer service always makes me feel like I do not belong there! Their is an air about the place that they just know I typically frequent Starbucks- and they make me feel ashamed for doing so!!\n\nWhile the place is expensive and I almost dread coming in for fear I will not fit in and the judgmental stares from the barista- I keep coming back because the lattes are to die for!
