Out of the 5 car dealers we visited on this past Saturday, this was by far the worst one.  If you think that by treating your customers rudely, demeaning them, talking bad about their current vehicle and bashing other brands is a good way to sell cars, then good luck.  Our money went elsewhere and we will never ever visit this place again.
