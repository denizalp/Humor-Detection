The food  at this place is TERRIBLE!! I ordered the butter chicken breast  thinking it was a chicken breast cooked in covered with butter but it was not. It came out in a bowl smothered in a terrible orange sauce. My coworker ordered a burger medium rare and its came out well done and dry is the desert. I've been ordered the filet bass and it came out under cook and very jelly like with a terrible taste. Overall 1 out of the 4 meals was edible. But they had cheap beer and it was cold.
