Went here for a few drinks after getting dinner nearby and came away really impressed.Lots of great beer choices, some good scotch too, good service at the huge bar, and really open space - easy to hear everyone you're talking to.\n\nHave heard you'll never get a seat if you get here right after work - but can't comment on that.
