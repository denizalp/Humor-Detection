Just stopped in randomly for the ole' beer after work thing. Not usually in Mesa, but the one beer I tried at $4.50 was good enough. It was the Black Cherry ale. I did detect some notes of cherry, so that was positive. The rest of my 30 minute experience was normal, but the inside of the place does resemble an old barn. Well at least the beer was good and cold.
