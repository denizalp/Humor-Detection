I like fruits...a bouquet of them...dipped in chocolate. Pineapples, cantaloupe, grapes, honeydew and strawberries; in a box, a basket, or in decorative containers.\n\nI would rather pay the delivery fee than pick up an arrangement from this location. Customer service at this location isn't the greatest. I wish the ladies that worked here were as sweet as the products they carry but unfortunately, that is not the case.
