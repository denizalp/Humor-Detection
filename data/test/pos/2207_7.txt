Max is the best!  I brought my Christmas Rolex in to get resized & set on the right time & date.  He did it complimentary & refused a tip.  He immediately fixed it.  Guess when I'm back in I'll have to bring him something else like a Starbucks gift card.  I love this watch store, it's like heaven w\/ the escalator up to the service department & more watches.  Watches galore & friendly helpful people.  Located in the middle of the Caesars Forum Shops, it's perfect for any watchlover.  I highly recommend them.
