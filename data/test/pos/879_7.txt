\"Most\" of the teachers are good, but the financial aid borders on sadism. Also, some students are \"randomly\" chosen to have to prove every aspect of their existence to registration in order to be considered a Nevada resident and be able to get in state rates and financial aid.\nGlad I'm transferring to UNLV.
