My friends and had dinner here before our movie that AMC in the same complex and the food was phenomenal! It was kinda dead due to the odd time of day we visited but the service was awesome. I wish I could remember our servers name but she really seemed to know a lot about the dishes and care about her job. We partook in the $4.95 mojitos which were yummy too! \n\nPS: We used a restaurant.com coupon too! :)
