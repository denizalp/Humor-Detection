STILL A 5 STAR RATING...but I would just like to add out of all the flavors I've tried so far (loaded baked potato, ranch, parmesean & garlic, southwest hot wings, pizza, hot and spicy cheese, southwest jalepenos, blueberry, coconut, watermelon)....my favs are:\n\n-hot and spicy cheese\n-southwest jalepenos\n-watermelon  (i only got a mini sized bag of this only because whenever i get a craving for something sweet...this does the trick. too much of this can be way too sweet.)\n\nCrap. Now I'm craving for some but I'm at work...in this damn boring cubicle....=(
