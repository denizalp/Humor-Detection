This is a long over due review.\n\nI attended the Bruno Mars concert back on September 2nd, 2017. There were no disappointing areas for viewing. The audio in the theater was flawless! The lighting and special effects were spectacular!\n\nIf you're planning to see Bruno Mars in February 2018, you will not regret watching here at the Park Theater.
