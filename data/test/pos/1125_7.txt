This place I am a fan of. It's close to where I live. Fun thing to do on any night of the week. I like all kinds of comedy.\n\nThere was a crazy lady laughing veyr loud at everything which was funny in itself. I recommend checking this place out on a Friday when they do more of the Improv (Catch 23) but I would also want to check it out on other days to see the things they have to offer.
