WAY WAY WAY too crowded, lame layout, a hassle getting in, employees with attitude on power trips, expensive drinks even for Vegas, plus a TON of people got their phones and wallets stolen out of their purses (while they were holding them on the dance floor!) the night I was there and I see from other reviews that it wasn't an isolated incident! Too bad because I'm a fan of several of the DJs that are currently residents there. \n\nI won't be going back and I suggest you stay away as well.
