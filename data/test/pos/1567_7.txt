Sadly one star for this disaster. While service was friendly it was unhygienic and disgusting. The gentleman who sat us was wearing food prep gloves handling the menus and then the tablecloth was stained so it was a bad start...then onto the food...bread and hummus were good but the lamb chops were fatty and both the chicken and beef shawarma were flavorless as was the rice. Not surprisingly even with a huge restaurant there were only two other parties at 6:00.
