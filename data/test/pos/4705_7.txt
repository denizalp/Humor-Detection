Finally, I was able to stop by Butterfields for the first time.  (The line is usually pretty long on the weekend.). Thank God for Columbus Day and a day off from work .   The wild berry pancakes are so freaking awesome, makes you want to slap your mama!   Better yet, I wanted to go into  the kitchen and slap the cook for making such a delicious masterpiece.   Lastly, The grits I ordered tasted superb with perfect consistency.   I could have drank a 16 ounce glass of that alone.
