They now accept credit cards with a minimum purchase of $10, which I may not be able to take advantage of too often given that my normal order is a large iced green tea to sip while I enjoy some free Wi-Fi and spacious tables. However, with this latest added convenience, and given that they are open 24-hours, I am going to have to say that Lee is OK. I still think the food clocks in at a tid below average, but the Wi-Fi, spaciousness and iced tea serve a handy purpose that I plunder with content.
