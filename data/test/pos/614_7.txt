I went to Dr Michaels for almost 2 years. At first she seemed thorough, knowledgable, etc.  I've learned to be proactive with my health, I research.  I found she was prescribing meds for me that not only I didn't need, but twice prescribed things that were dead wrong, and could've been a disaster had I not checked. I have her 1 star because there was no option for ZERO stars.  Be VERY careful if you go to her.
