It's like a hike to get from my car to the milk section.\n\nThe clothes are tacky, pet department is something you'd see on a 20\/20 investigation, and the cashiers are wore-out overworked and rude.\n\nI am literally five feet away from the granny-panties section when I'm buying wine.\n\nThis is the downfall of the grocery store.
