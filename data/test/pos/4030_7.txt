Dropped by this Walmart on the way to my friend's house to pick up some supplies for a BBQ.  It's a Walmart.....\n\n- Long lines.\n\n- Lots of products.\n\n- Good prices.\n\nI picked up some Chips & Sodas and made my way out.  The place was clean and I didn't have to wait too long in line.\n\nReturn Factor - 20%.....will probably only come here when I visit this friend.
