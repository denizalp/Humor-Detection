I ordered Satay chicken, shrimp pad Thai and Larb. I only like the satay chicken, the pad Thai and larb aren't as tasty as what I'm used to. The Pad Thai also only have 7 shrimps with a huge serving of noodles and it's lacking on sauce and no lime and fresh bean sprouts. Overall the delivery was fast but I don't think I'll order here again.
