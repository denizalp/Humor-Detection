Horrible experience.  Drinks were overpriced and mediocre.  Music that played was cool about a year ago.  A waitress asked my friend to move so some douchebag could set his coat down because heaven forbid something get in the way of his bud light.  It's not New York City, Los Angeles or Chicago, its a stinkin' Cleveland bar\/club!
