I don't get the negative reviews of this place.\n\nI went there with a date after we saw a movie at the Arizona Center. The food was great (the sauteed spinach was the best I've ever had and the steak gave Durants a run for its money at half the price). My date said his food was equally great and planned to go back,\n\nThe service was perfect. \n\nThe only thing that left me puzzled why why it was so empty on a weekend night. Kind of made me wonder.
