Granted the place was pretty busy but the salesman I talked to Jeff made it clear he wasn't interested in helping me. Too bad - I was prepared to drop a few grand on a couple new pieces to add to my collection and accessories. With that kind of treatment I have no problem taking my business elsewhere.
