Wow!   Very impressed with this new location.  I don't live in Henderson but I had been to the original Bad Owl a few times.  \n\nI came here this morning and got a Iced Chai, Power Puck and a awesome breakfast burrito.  \n\nThe food and drink was great.  Possibly the BEST ICED CHAI I've ever had.  \n\nThe guy at taking the order was very cool and polite and he delivered the drinks\/food in a timely fashion.  \n\nI'll be back!!!
