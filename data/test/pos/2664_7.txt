I hired this buisness to be a photographer for a non profit  for breast cancer 2016 calender . This buisness was to finish the project  to customers liking and be quality work. \nUnfortunatly , this work has not been completed. This buisness had blocked every way to be contacted   . I have asked several times to have this work completed and all photos done appropriately for calender ready worldly. \nI would advise not to entertain a connection .
