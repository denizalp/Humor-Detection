Korean noodles served up cheap and fast across from LVAC and BodyHeat. What more could you ask for? The perfect amount of spice in the BBQ pork meatballs and noodles, and if there isn't, there's always sriracha or chili paste. \n\nThis place has an enormous menu for the trying, but the first thing I wanted, they were out of. Credit card minimum of $10 so make sure to bring cash.
