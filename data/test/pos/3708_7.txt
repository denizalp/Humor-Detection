I came here for an early dinner today, and it was practically empty with two other tables. This time around, I ordered the oven baked udon because 1) I love cheese and 2) I also love cream sauce. And my bf ordered the original kama udon. My oven baked udon turned out to be very creamy with a lot of sauce, and it had a few pieces of shrimp, one scallop and bits of bacon. \n\nI found the service to be very attentive..because well there weren't a lot of people to begin with. But overall, great place for udon!
