While I'm still trying to find more awesome breakfast spots when I visit my friend in AZ, I keep coming to this place since I find it to be an acceptable place to get decent early morning fare. \n\nI received nice and prompt service and most importantly, my coffee kept getting refilled so no complaints there. The menu options will give people a chance to find something they like and I do appreciate a good amount of healthy options.\n\nI still wish I can find some local brunch gems but this place suffices in the meantime.
