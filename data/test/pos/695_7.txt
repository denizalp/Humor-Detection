i usually am NOT a fan of buffets.. but this place really puts other buffets to SHAME!\n\nthey have a lot of individually-sized portion items & some not.. if you want to try everything.. your table should just get one of each & then decide what you want 2nds of!\n\nAMAZING DESSERT SELECTION.. especially the humungo chocolate covered strawberries!!!\n\nWAY BETTER than the wynn buffet & cheaper too!!!
