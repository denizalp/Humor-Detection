why was I here? BECAUSE I WILL PARTY ANYWHERE PARTYING NEEDS TO BE DONE! Cheap brew and very interesting atmosphere............like.....the most interesting. Have you ever been to a trinket shop?......there's a ton of shit to look at.....and it doesn't get old.....until you barf on your silk button up shirt and have to be dragged to the nearest dumpster to get some much needed rest.
