Not a huge fan of this place. There's plenty  of other all you can eat sushi places (Sushi Freak) that serves similar items with better service. The time it took them to bring out cooked dishes was insanely slow. We ordered chicken skewers and it took about 30 mins to get there. We had to flag down the waitress to get our tea refilled but the only plus was we got our sushi fast cause we sat at the bar.
