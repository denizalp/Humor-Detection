I don't have a Mac.  I can't afford a Mac.  I was given an iPod as a gift, and it's been wonderful to me.  I'd like to do more editing, so I'd like a Mac, but that'd be an expensive hobby.\n\nThat being said, the Apple Store here is awesome.  It's just like any other one - full of things to play with.  The Geniuses are actually helpful, or they'll leave you alone and just help you fiddle.  Not a high pressure environment.\n\nA friend of mine ran into Alton Brown here once.  His mom almost cried. Hilarity.
