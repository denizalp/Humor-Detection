I used to love Yeti when I lived in the neighborhood. I recently was in the area and stopped in for a mani pedi.  It took over two hours and was just OK. The salon is very popular and busy and never turns people away and instead keeps clients waiting. I have had way better treatments done in less time elsewhere. I am happy that they've gotten so popular, but I want an in and out salon and this isn't it anymore.
