I was referred to Mark and so glad! He has been our best and most knowledgeable CPA by far! Last we pulled out a pretty hefty loan from our 401k and some how Mark worked a miracle and we still received money back.  We are working with Mark again this year and once again he had some really great advice on how to begin adding some assets to our finances.  He has tons of experience and can help you with all of it! Definitely recommend Mark for financial advice and of course your taxes!! $
