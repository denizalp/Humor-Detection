New ownership has taken over and the name is SO CUTE. I love the logo. The owner Peggy is so sweet and has top-notch customer service. \n\nThese use fresh ingredients and their Creama is super tasty! The drinks are refreshing and has a great variety. I'll have to stop by and try their food some other time. \n\nGreat place to relax with good selfie lighting with giant Brown plush that serves as your background. \n\nRecommended Drinks:\n-Jasmine Green Tea with creama \n-Earl Grey Milk tea
