We had another good meal at Bartolotta but the prices are getting out of control.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I go to expensive places a lot.  We went to Cut also on this trip.  Bartolotta's prices are on the high side for fining dining and if you are not seriously into fish there are other higher on my list.
