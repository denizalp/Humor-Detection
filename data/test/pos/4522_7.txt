Came here for the Cormier fight and the manager refused to open the bay door - they don't make 'specialty drinks ' on fight night . All the tvs broken and the food wasn't even great ... would NOT ever come back or recommend this place. Thumbs down.\n\nUpdate the only beer I had before I left had food in it - I didn't order food .
