I went here a few weeks ago with my sister for lunch. It was not crowded at all, and actually we were the only ones in there. The service was great, everyone was super nice and friendly, and the food was even better. The prices for all of the food is great! We split a salad and a pizza and it was only $15. The food is real authentic Italian and I would recommend it to anyone! I will definitely be going back!!
