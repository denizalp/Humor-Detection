If I wanted to wait an hour for small portions of mediocre food while having lies about where the cooking was at.. well, this is where I'd go.  I'm probably never going to come back.  Why bother?  It's not cheap, the food tastes meh, and you are going to have to wait, and wait, and wait.  And be lied to.  Bye forever!
