When it's a Tuesday night, and Cadillac Ranch is in dive-bar mode, I like it a lot. Chill music, nice patio, great specials on beer. Since the bar was outdoors, my pals didn't have wander off to have a smoke.\n\nWeeknight specials are awesome. $3 pints of some good stuff like Mission Blonde Ale. I can relax here, and the interior looks so nice I'll definitely come back during peak hours. I'm a fan.
