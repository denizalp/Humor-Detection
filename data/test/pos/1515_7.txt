I've recently started getting pedicures and found this place to be an ok one to use for my pedicures.  \n\nI like the location because I'm out in this area a lot tanning and visiting friends, plus being in the mall (even if it's an empty one) is a perk.  \n\nI have a friend who wasn't a fan, he said that they didn't massage with enough pressure for him, but he's a bigger guy  and they are somewhat small women.
