Everything from the menu is good and their potato & leek soup is the bomb!\n\nDon't go there if you are on a rush, it will take usually 20 mins for food.  And I'm serious.  \n\nMy favs are as below:\nQuiche (all of them)\nProsciutto sandwiches\nMoroccan grilled sandwiches\nThe gerson (juice)\nSoups, especially the veg one they are really good
