I FEEL SORRY FOR THE OWNERS!\n\nThe bartenders don't seem to know they work there being that they're never 'working' there.\n\nTHIS PLACE SUCKS DICK FULL TIME  \n\nIf you decide to ruin your night going here, enjoy sitting around like an idiot who expects service. Your friends will think you're super cool for suggesting the place.\n\n:) Cheers Dickheads!
