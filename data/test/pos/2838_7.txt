Dr. Radoff is a quack at best and pushes non proven techniques and snake oil medications in the name of homeopathy.     He used a Zyto scan on me that is considered fake science and charged me $400\/- for it.    Then came the sweet water in 3 vials that did not make any sense at all to me.    \nI got out of his 'treatment'  $750\/-  poorer by the experience.
