I used to think that Whole Foods was too expensive and only for vegetarians. Boy was I wrong! I freaking love this place. They have everything from fresh meats, cheeses, fruits, produce and so much more. Their cakes and other deserts are utterly amazing. \n\nThis is also where I fell in love with Naked Juices. They are delicious. \nThe only thing I don't like is that parking is a bitch at times.
