Best gel design in town. Fair prices, quick service. Tony always makes time for me and creates the most awesome nail art! Always get a pedi, too, and I love that hot stones are included :) I trust Tony and have never had my personal items touched by employees without them asking first. I've even forgotten my wallet and owed THEM and they trusted me to pay them next time, which, of course, I did.
