Classic NDG dive. Pool tables, air hockey, cheap pitchers and a very interesting mixed crowd. The antithesis of neighbor bar Honey Martin. Worth a weekend trip for the people watching alone! I have witnessed: a full makeover in the women's bathroom, girl vs. man fight-where the girl was winning, a dance off and someone claiming to be Drake's manager buying pitchers! That being said, weeknights seem to be quieter. Not for the timid. A great time for the adventurous!
