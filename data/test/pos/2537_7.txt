Crepe Cellar- Take Two.  We went out last night on a Tuesday 948p night wanting to find a restaurant that served food till 11p, Crepe Cellar was open and our server was pleasant.  We had brussel sprouts, pasta with roasted red peppers & goat cheese and a spinach mushroom crepe.  Everything was delish.  Good to know for a school night.  Have I mentioned how spectacular the brussel sprouts are?  OMG.
