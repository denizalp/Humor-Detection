I pretty much only buy dress shirts and ties from H&M thesedays since I'm probably their marketing demographics equivalent of a senior citizen.  Decor is cool.  What did they end up doing with that huge FAO Schwartz horse?  \n\nAvoid the fitting rooms on the 2nd floor at all costs.  Especially on the weekend.  Third floor is pretty empty and even the first floor is usually a better option.  I would also pass on the 2nd floor for purchasing since it's easily the most crammed area.
