I love it. Really Quality food with excellent service all served up with a smile. Seriously, awesome staff and particularly fresh items from this place. I've heard so many awesome things and it did not disappoint. \n\nScallops, \"street noodles\" and one of my favorites - garlic baby bok Choy... Even the house soup of the day.. Simple, and delicious. So awesome. I'll be back :)\n\nIt's open very late and you will be happy you went if you are fan of Chinese\/Asian flavors.
