Another great shopping excursion at Smiths!\nThe deli has some great Mexican entrees and salads this week, check it out! I picked up some green enchiladas w\/carnitas already prepared, just need to heat up in the oven, yummy!\nGreat staff, so friendly and helpful. And a super clean store! Neighborhood favorite!
