A no frills mall packed during the lunch hour with students and the elderly.\n\nDecent size food court if you decide to take a break from shopping.\n\nDon't let the front entrance fool you, once you enter, this is a rather large mall involving plenty of walking distance.  Watch out for the elderly racing in their motorized carts.\n\nAnother older lady was apparently screaming at no one in particular while I was enjoying my poutinue in the food court.\n\nIf the elderly don't scare you, then you'll enjoy this mall
