Delicious! This was my first time here & I thought it was really good! It's always fun to build your food how you like it. The staff were friendly & accommodating to my request for some small sides of toppings for my baby to eat. I ate half my pizza there & the rest later at home & it was just as tasty! I especially like the flavor of the sauce - tangy!
