If you hate Jared and his collection of stupid jingles and bland sammiches, you could try this shop. It is in the heart of Willoughby and by all the bars. Also a stone's throw from the courthouse(going away for a few years? have one last sub). I had the veggie( okay dressing, jar mushrooms and chewy bread). They make ten kinds of subs with a corresponding ten varieties of wraps. Throw in a few salads to boot. Very good value.\n\nAnd how about the name? Love that movie.
