We brought our dog (baby) in for a routine procedure and they crushed a disc in his back.  First they denied it even though he was a perfectly happy and healthy 6 year old dachshund.  Then the owner told us it was bound to happen anyways.  Not only are they incompetent but they believe they can predict the future.  Avoid this place at all cost!!!
