Mansions on Fifth are two lovely homes from the early 1900's that have been turned into a stunning bed and breakfast.  The new owners have done a fabulous job of restoring the homes to their original grandeur while adding modern touches (think high-end cozy bedding and Restoration Hardware like bathrooms).  There are several sizes of rooms for overnight guests including a honeymoon suite.  There are also a range of rental space options: wine cellar, intimate chapel, parlor and dining areas to name a few.  The homes provide a luxurious atmosphere and friendly staff.
