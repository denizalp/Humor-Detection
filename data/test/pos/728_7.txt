A store with no return policy without receipt? Really? \n\nCalled corporate and they said oh,well your stuck with it. \n\nFor a company that states 100% satisfaction guarantee all over their website! They're advertising a lie. Don't bother with this place, plenty of other sport store business that deserve my business.
