First time in my life I've ever walked out of a restaurant.     8pm on a Friday night,  not very crowded at all. Got waters and waited over 20 minutes so got up and left. Meanwhile, watched the server on his phone and watching the TV at the bar completely clueless that we were waiting to order dinner and drinks. Way too many good places around this area to afford to have such awful service.
