To the CHEAP ba****ds who own this location!\n\nI'm looking at YOU, Terry McMillan! \n\nWhere do you get the NERVE to charge me 24 CENTS for a cup of water?\n\nFree water is MY RIGHT as a fast-food customer. \n\nIf I could afford to pay for water, I'd go to a classier place!\n\nYou should get into the sporting goods business McMillan, because you've got SOME B***S!
