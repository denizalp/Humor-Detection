This is a must try! I'm from the Chicago area so I know how Chicago style dogs are supposed to taste! This place, my friends, is the real deal! The fries are delish and the service was great! Oh yeah, it's cheap too! I got a hotdog, vienna beef of course, with all of the trimmings-Tomato, sport peppers, pickle, relish, onions and celery salt, fries and a grape pop for $4.59!  Love it! Da Bears!
