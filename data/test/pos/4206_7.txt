LAS is getting tired. The Southwest check-in counters are mainly self-serve and dated.\n\nThe security lines are long and leisurely. TSA agents are rude and dressed in blue uniforms with blue nitrile gloves. \n\nFree WiFi is available throughout the terminal. I think one needs to \"log in\" every 90 minutes though...
