Color me unimpressed. I wanted Starbucks before work and decided to stop at a location I had never been to. No drive-thru, so I had to go inside to place my order. \n\nThe workers weren't the chipper, friendly, polite baristas I come to expect when I am paying $5 for a cup of coffee. \n\nI won't be back.
