In one word - AVOID! Petco could do a better job. I took my dog here, and they had her ready in one hour. One hour? That isn't enough time to wash her. They do not hand trim. There was no fresh smell on my dog like there should be for a few days after a complete grooming, I am sure there are better groomers in Madison, I will find them.
