This is a good theatre. Tickets are $5.00 in the morning, the seats are comfortable and the service is friendly. Plus, how many places can you pay $5.00 to see a show and then share a bottle of prosecco? Plus, the prosecco was a decent bottle. \n\nIf you are going here to eat really amazing good, you may be disappointed. This eat-in theatre is good for the classic popcorn, candy, nachos and does have a couple of decent appetizers such as the pretzel bites, I recommend shying away from the sushi and seafood choices.
