Yea, this place is a bit sketchy at first glance but...don't we all go for the nostalgia?\n\nBoth employees where we 1) purchased tickets, and 2) purchased snacks were really quite sweet and seemed to enjoy their jobs.\n\nI was a little baffled at the lack of navigation markers but, what the hell, I wasn't driving.\n\nAnd what's to complain about when you are in your own car with people you really enjoy spending time with?\n\nThrow in a little making out with your significant other and you have a quaint little date night!
