This place really don't deserve 1 star, 4 the simple reason I ordered a chicken burrito with rice & beans. & I pacifically asked 4 no peppers & onions. I explained when ordering ice been 2 your other locations & had it without. Let alone it seamed that the chicken was missing. So if u happen 2 order from their other locations take key & notice the difference on your item compared 2 their.  I took 3 bites & gave it 2 my dogs........
