Friendly Staff\n\nI really enjoy ever time I visit a  Bath & Body Works store.  This store has it all, shower gels, lotions, candles and accessories and their is always some type of sale going on.\n\nThe staff is always extremely friendly, accommodating, and will take their time to help you locate exactly what you are looking for. \n\nGreat products, wallet friendly prices, and excellent customer service, what more can you ask for.
