Probably the cleanest Roberto's in town. There's a huge window that allows complete visual of the kitchen. Every time I go the service is awesome. Guy at the front was incredible, and the food was great (by fast food standards, of course). Horchata was awesome, tamales were fresh, and the burrito was a very well put together burrito. c:
