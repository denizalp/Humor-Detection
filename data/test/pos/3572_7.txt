Never in my life have I seen, or rather waited in, a 50+ line deep for a taxi!! Granted, they are organized about it....but it was over an hour wait to get out of the damn place! \n\nThe airport is small, smoky and confusing. And who wants to play slots after losing at their hotel casino? I didn't see anyone playing anything when I arrived at the airport, nor when I left 3 days later.....
