$4.25 for a tiny square box of plain rice. Are you kidding me? These guys are brutal. . Only place I've ever been to, in the history of restaurants, that charges less money for French fries than plain rice.  \n\nChicken shawarma wrap had the least amount of chicken I've ever received in a shawarma, and it was $7.99\n\nHope your extreme cheapness was worth the 1 star rating
