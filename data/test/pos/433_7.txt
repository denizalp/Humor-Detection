Came here today for a take out beef bowl.\nFor some reason, the entire store smelled weird today. \nThe last time I ate here, everything tasted OK. Just like any Yoshinoya in Japan.\nToday, their beef bowl was way too salty and the beef had a lot of fatty parts in it.\nMaybe I came here the wrong time. \nI'll come back next time I have Yoshinoya withdrawals.
