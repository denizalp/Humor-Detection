I get it.  I got it.  It delivers okay.  For a place that is suppose to have superior barbecue, I got to say... BLAH.  Marketing and hype folks.  The energy or decor comes from the yuppies who want to slum it, but still know they can get their Heinie.\nIf it was not so staged, this would be the diamond in the rough... but it is staged... it feels fake.  You feel dooped.
