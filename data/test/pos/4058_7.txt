I ordered dinner from the Yelp app and arrived ten minutes later to pick it up. It was just about ready and that's awesome.\n\nA whole chicken with sides. The chicken was tasty but I thought that it was a bit dry. Good and spicy just not especially moist. The beans were excellent as was the rice. Plenty of both which was great. Plantains? OMG. Awesome. A star just for them because they were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious.
