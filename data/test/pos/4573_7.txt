The wife and younger son wanted something nonbready for dessert so they opted for a softserve from Mickey D's. This location is in a decent location and the exterior seems  well maintained but the interior could stand for some TLC.   The drink area was dirty and the restaurant  overall smelled like rotten ketchup.  Also, the manager was yelling at the employees while just standing there listening to music.  Disappointing to see this occurring in plain sight of customers.  The softserbers were good which is the o my reason why I didn't give 2 stars.
