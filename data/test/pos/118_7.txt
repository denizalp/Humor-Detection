Honestly, I want to love Wicked Spoon but I just can't...\n\nSuper expensive for underwhelming food presented in a kitchy way \n\nAmbiance is gorgeous and dessert bar is great are the only highlights I can come up with\n\nOverall Thoughts\n\nSecond time wasn't the charm...I don't foresee a third attempt...
