I am known far and wide as a sucker for theme restaurants. And as a sucker in general.\n\nOn a recent trip to Vegas, I all but coerced my family into eating here. Once seated, I literally clapped my hands with excitement as my hypoglycemic brethren rolled their eyes. I got the chicken wings and they were delicious, but everyone elses dish came out either incorrect in some way, or just plain disgusting.\n\nI win!
