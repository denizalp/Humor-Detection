Italian? Umm, nope, not even close. \n\nWe ordered food from the \"hot\" table, but when we finished picking out our 3 small items shoved into a bowl, the woman turned and put it into a microwave! Its no wonder the potatoes tasted dry and flavorless, the peas were uncooked and the gnocchi were a salty mess of cold dumplings.\n\n10.00\/plate and a free side of Filipino attitude.  Horrible experience.
