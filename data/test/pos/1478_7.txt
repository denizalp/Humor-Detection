Came back here last weekend for the first time in a year when the Yelp Elite party took place.\n\nThe vibe is simply too douchey, as Natalie mentioned it's pure 905ers. There is a large variety of age groups here, but it is 80% 19-21s.\n\nIt gets very busy and if you're trying to hang out and have a conversation, you're more than likely going to end up with balls in your face. Seating is scarce, a few picnic tables scattered around between tables. \n\nIt's probably a lot more fun if you actually want to play ping pong....
