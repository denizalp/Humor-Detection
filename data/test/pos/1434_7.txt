I was in Henderson for a play and I saw the Wells Fargo branch near where I was parked.  I drove up to use the ATM and realized I had to go around and enter from Water Street after missing a quicker way from the side street.\n\nTypical ATM for Wells and once to the machine, my transaction was complete and I was on my way.  Not much to review because I had no interaction with staff.
