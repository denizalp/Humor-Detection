Maybe because I live in New York, it's hard for me to take a store like this seriously.  It carries a weird vibe I've seen in smaller cities where shop assistants think high-end stuff and a sense of humor are mutually exclusive.  Everyone's very s-e-r-i-o-u-s.  Lighten up, people.  It's clothing.  It's meant to be fun.  And, honestly, some of the clothes you stock are a bit silly.
