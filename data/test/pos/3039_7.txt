I could not be more pleased with the whole process with Renaissance.  Heather spent a great deal of time discussing options, pool types and colors   Ruben, who supervises the entire delivery and installation, was involved, friendly and detailed.   The scheduling was almost flawless.   Ruben answered every question and the office staff coordinated each phase quickly and efficiently.   The decking is perfect.  I love my completed pool  Renaissance performed as promised and then some.   These ceramic pools are awesome!!!   Thank you Renaissance for everything.  You are simply the best,
