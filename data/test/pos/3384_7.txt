Beware! After eating here 12\/16\/16 on 12\/17\/16 I developed severe (8 out of 10 on the pain scale) stomach cramping, diarrhea, and vomiting. I had the wonton soup and the fried dumplings. I missed work.  No other person in my party had the dumplings or wonton soup.  One person from my party had diarrhea, but none of the pain that I am having.  I will be contacting a lawyer as I missed work.
