Pros:\n- Obscene amount of food for the price you pay\n- Good garlic bread\n\nCons:\n- Feels less authentic than Olive Garden if that's even possible\n- Kitschy decorations\n- The waitress asked my coworker if I'm over 21. Why didn't she ask me? Did she think I needed a translator because I can't speak English? Or did she think I'm so young that my only response would've been goo goo ga ga pppllllffttttt?
