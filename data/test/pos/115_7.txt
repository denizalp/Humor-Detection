The rolls we ordered were cold and the sushi was small . The rice was really sticky. It was a little on the high side when it came to the price,the sauce in the rolls was too sweet.  The waitress was hard to communicate with but she was nice. I don't think I will becoming back here again there are other sushi joints in the area that are better when it comes to food service & prices.
