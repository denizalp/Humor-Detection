Five stars for the ladies' room alone. Though I'll admit, an odd juxtaposition--breathtaking view while you're relieving yourself, pants around ankles, TP in hand. Best bar restroom, without a doubt. \n\nThe rest of it was fine. I was here for a private party, and service, drinks and munchies were top-notch. Vibe was live yet relaxed, perfect lounge feel. Decor is hip and modern, and the roomy balcony is a lovely place to sip a cocktail while viewing Vegas.
