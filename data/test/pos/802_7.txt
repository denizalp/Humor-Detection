Was there for the very first time for a bridal shower. The upstairs was HUGE! Food was pretty good. \n\nI took my husband there specifically for the beer store & We've never been more disrespected in our lives! The so-called beer guru is a joke. My husband likes to drink and knows more about beer then this guy. He literally leaned against the front counter, arms crossed, not once did he make eye contact with us, it felt & sounded like he was talking down to us like we were nothing!
