I love this place! If you are familiar with Mon Ami than this is similar ambiance without the crowd or long wait to sit on the patio. Now granted, you don't have the view of the spectacular Bellagio fountains, however, it's still Strip side and... NO WAIT! Amazing spot for breakfast or romantic dinner. Staff has always been great. I love that they make their Bloody Mary's from scratch and table side. Not to mention the bottomless mimosas option.
