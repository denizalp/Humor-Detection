Okay, the place creeps me out a bit. The two guys in there, I felt were following me around. One did in fact keep close tabs on me. I wasn't even wearing a purse... how could I take something? \n\nAnywho, good selection of books. Granted I am not into half of them, but the chakra collection and the yoga collection were abundant. They offer some aromatherapy stuff too. LOTS of choices for incense!! \n\nIf you are into NewAge, Chakra balancing, not Christian stuff, this is the place to go.
