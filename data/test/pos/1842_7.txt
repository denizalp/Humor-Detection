The yogurt is great and they have the usual assortment of flavors. But unfortunately they were a little short handed on staff. I could have actually walked out of the place without paying if I wanted. But waited several minutes for the dude to reappear from the bowels of the store to take my payment. I just patted myself on the back and was glad that I didn't own the store. It's no telling how many drive offs that they have had.
