Pulled into the drive thru the other day for the first time. When I heard the Baristas voice I casually looked over at the menu to make my order and.......I could see the Barista while she was taking my order!  Knowing that most drive-thrus can see you but you can't see them, this made for a much more personal experience.  The location is great.  The inside is peasant and presents a suitable atmosphere to chill in. Being that Buck's is the apex predator of coffee shops, the coffee is as Starbucks does.
