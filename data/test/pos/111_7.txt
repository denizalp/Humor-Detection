***Located in the hip, stylish Hotel Palomar is the perfectly hip and stylish Lustre Bar, which features a dark and contemporary bar and lounge area as well as an upscale but more casual pool-side bar (the pool is open to the public on weekends in the summer); I did not try much of their food, but their grilled shishito peppers were nicely done***\n\nI am not sure what the parking situation is at the Hotel Palomar.
