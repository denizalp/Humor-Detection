I came in tonight ready to buy a bike.  In fact, I called to see if they had the specific bike I was looking for.  There were plenty of workers there, and I waited around for ten minutes before I left.  I was really disappointed.  It was only when I was leaving when a guy asked me if I needed help.  Maybe it was because I am a woman?  The only people getting help in there tonight were two other guys.  What a terrible experience.  I'm glad I took my money elsewhere.
