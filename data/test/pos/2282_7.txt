Cannot begin to describe the distaste I have for this company and how they serve their customers.\n\nFor a company who's tagline is \"The customer is king\", it is far from the truth.\n\nWill be making complaints to many sources of business and compliance agencies to ask for an audit and review of their business practices.  \n\nStay FAR FAR FAR away from this one...
