No good. Not freah.  \n\nI ordered poke bowl with yellowtail n salmon for to go. \nI would like to add some avocado but color of avocado was too dark. So i didnt add it.\n\nYellowtail has viniger taste n color of fish was too dark. \n\nGinger has so nasty smell like wiping clothes. It was horrible \n\nPortion was small too. \n\nOnly good thing in here was cahier JAlen was so nice to me. \n\nTo keep the business, u should control the food.\nNever come back.
