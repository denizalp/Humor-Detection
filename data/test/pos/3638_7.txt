They do not offer self-parking, the parking is all valet.  We parked on the lot, and the valet company used someone's car to block us while demanding keys.  We said \"no\" and were further harassed.  When asked about self-parking we were told to park at a different business.  Now furious, trying to leave, the valet used the patrons automobile to block the exit.  \n\nBe very afraid of a valet person using your auto as a weapon.
