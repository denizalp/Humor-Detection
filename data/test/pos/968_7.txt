First time here and experienced a few mishaps. Wrong drinks being delivered and a pizza not being placed to order. Ended up getting a comped drink and pizza though. I appreciate them fixing the situation. \n\nI like the overall vibe of this place and of course, the food is fantastic. My only complaint with the overall place is that people turn their lights off as they're pulling away from the windows. Bright shiny car lights right in my eyes is not the business.
