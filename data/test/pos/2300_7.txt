Went here to pick up pizza dough. At the register, two packages of dough came out to $10. I rubbed my eyes and asked if there was a mistake. Nope, each package is $5...\n\n... So I drove to No a Frills where I bought, wait for it, Nino D'Aversa pizza dough for, wait for it, $2 each.\n\nAnd that was the last time I went to this Nino D'Aversa.
