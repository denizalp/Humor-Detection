I've been here several times over the years and am consistently satisfied. The place is shabby in a really perfect way; it's no frills, clean, grilled Mexican food that is delicious and budget minded. What they don't spend on decor goes into making delicious pastries and entrees. \n\nThis is my go to spot when I need a lot of salsa and don't have the time or patience to make my own. And I generally feel quite like the proud genius for my idea, and people eat what I bring to the party, then. Win, win!
