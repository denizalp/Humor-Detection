I understand the reason why the fish is expensive.  I can appreciate the fact that it is at the Wynn and the Koi water area is a very nice place to dine....HOWEVER...I will never, ever, ever pay $135 for a piece of cooked fish.  I just can't.  So we just got a bunch of pasta dishes and split a very nice octopus salad.  Those were all quite good but I would rather spend the $ at Mimmo Ferraro's instead of this place.
