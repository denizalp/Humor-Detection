This is our go to family style Greek restaurant. The food is excellent and reasonably priced. I loved - I mean love, the grilled chicken, freshly cooked before serving. All the sides are perfectly made for a great meal - Greek salad, rice, French fries. This place is always busy because of the great taste and value. Make sure to reserve or come early to be seated.
