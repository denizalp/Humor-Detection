The deuce was extremely convenient. We did not know about it until our last night in Vegas, though. Someone who was riding the bus from our timeshare told us about it.\n\nPrices were $6 for 2hr and $8 for 24hr. You have to purchase tickets on the street.\n\nThe prices are fantastic. However, there are a few problems.\n-Extremely slow; there are just too many stops\n-The bus got full because people refuse to sit next to strangers. The driver was then forced to pull the bus over and 'assign seats' to people.
