Wow...why is it so hard to find even half way decent Mexican food in Arizona???\n\nAnother attempt and failure today. Chips and salsa- chips over cooked and burned. El Jefe burrito- 2 lbs of overly salty nasty.  Even if it was free I would never come back.\n\nI have no idea how this scoop and serve dump has a single good review. So far Arizona has the lowest standards for food I've ever seen.
