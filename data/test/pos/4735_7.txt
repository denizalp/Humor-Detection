Beautiful cathedral in Sin City located right off the strip, right by Encore\/Wynn. I frequent Vegas a few times a month, and amongst the hustle and bustle of the city, I come here to center myself and feel at peace at the 5pm mass. Not too many locals frequent this church, though. The crucifix\/altar area in the center of the church is very elaborate art and super gorgeous. High ceilings.\nI always see a different array of faces, from tattooed bikers to conservative older ladies in their cardigans. Beautiful, welcoming church.
