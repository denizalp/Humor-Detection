It was my first time taking the Deuce.  The experience was better than I thought it would be.  I arrived in Las Vegas at the South Bay Terminal from Los Angeles via the BOLT bus.  Here, I picked up the Deuce to take me to my hotel (Ballys).  It was easy, convenient, cool, and not confusing.  It's very easy to use and I think I will use it again when I come back.
