day 56 hi bob\n\ni came in. the hostess didn't really greet me. just asked how many. seated me without a word. i waited around 10-15 minutes and no one came by while everyone around me got helped. i read the menu over 5 times. food must have been alright cuz the place had a good number of people. i figured at this rate a quick dinner will turn into a 2 hour ordeal and i decided to leave for wendy's.
