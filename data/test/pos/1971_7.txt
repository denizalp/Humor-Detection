The food is horrible, took girl friend there and she died that night. Before she died I bought us a double beers. Draft beer of miller light is 4 bucks, are u fucking killing me. Bottles are 3 bucks. How in the fuck is a draft of miller more than a bottle. Don't eat here or drink. Place is always dead. Don't waste your time. I even asked the owner Shawn, why a draft of miller costs 4 bills and he said, \" um not sure, but can I get you a beer\" I laughed at him.
