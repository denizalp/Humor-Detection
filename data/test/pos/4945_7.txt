This Jack in the Box location is very convenient if you're on your way out to visit Hoover Dam passing through Boulder City, NV. They are very speedy and the customer service here is excellent. Even when you see the drive-thru packed with cars believe me they will get that line moving as quick as possible. I've never had an issue at the location and the food is prepped made and ready to eat.
