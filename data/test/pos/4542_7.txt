If you are looking for a good all you can eat Korean bbq place and are in the Henderson area (or close by), this is the place to go to.  The price for the meal is not too bad. The atmosphere is open and has a modern\/hip feel to it. Our server, Shea, was very helpful with our large party. \n\nThe quality of food is pretty decent and they have a good selection of prepared foods...including the volcano chicken and tofu soup. This is my friend's favorite place,so whenever we are in Vegas, it's a must GO place!
