If a really outstanding farmers market mated with Faneuil Hall in Boston and if Fairway in NYC mated with Chelsea Market - also in NYC, and if their resulting offspring got it on, the super hybrid grandchild would be the St. Lawrence Market. They should really be proud of their grandchild. \n\nI got to pass through and wanted to pitch a tent. All local ingredients, good looking produce and meats. Everything we picked up was of superior quality. \n\nCan we get one of these in New York? I promise we'll take care of it. Please?
