If you are a complete house-head and have an Asian fetish, this may be the club for you. Actually, in regards to the latter, seems like most of the Asian crowd has moved towards Marquee. I call it the far east movement...not that there's anything wrong with that. Fellas, be sure to scrape around the outside pool area if you're looking to pick up. Some bored hidden treasures tend to flock there. Perfect pick-up line: \"Are you from North or South Korea?\" (get slapped)...but after that you are TOTALLY in.
