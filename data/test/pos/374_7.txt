Don't waste your time, hit up Lone Star or Applebee's down the street. The service took 15 minutes before taking the drink order- \"I couldn't find your table\". The dry, stringy ribs were too tough to cut with a steak knife. Worse yet, the prime rib turned out to be a fatty piece of substandard beef (I think it may have been beef). The only saving grace were run-of-the-mill crab cakes. I had to beg for a refill.
