I had a terrible experience here.\n\nBrief summary explaining why:\n\n- coffee is very weak and bland\n\n- the portion sizes of the sandwiches are tiny and overpriced\n\n- salad ingredients do not look that fresh\n\n- cashier incorrectly charged me for something I did not order and refused to refund me the difference, stating that it was impossible\n\n- wifi internet is unreliable and cuts in and out constantly\n\n\nIt was my second time there and needless to say, I will not be back.
