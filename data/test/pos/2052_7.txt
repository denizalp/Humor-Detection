So I'm walking through Kensington Market with Jim Halsey and Nash. Jim says: \"I want to eat something different.\"\nI laugh and say: \"That's what the Other Guy said!\"\nAnd the Other Guy was right! The French-Caribbean flavour of Le Ti Colibri is a winner. Salt fish, pineapple, sliced beef patties with sluce bish, 12 hour brisket and ham, raisins, apricots, nuts. It's not just tropical, it's CRUCIAL!\nNext time I'm bringing Captain Estridge to see what he thinks.
