Need to stop by when I can stay awhile.\n\nI need a need a friend and have 30 minutes to spare so I thought I'd stop in at Cactus Tavern and I'm so glad I did\n\nCactus Tavsrn is a nice comfortable place. Great environment. Food is excellent. Beer on point. Great price. Highly recommend. Nice day bar for happy hour. \n\nI wish I had more time to spend I will have to revisit very soon.
