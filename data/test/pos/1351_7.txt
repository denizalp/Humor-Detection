Love it! Unlike all the other Hawaiian BBQ shops around that just copy L&L, this is a true mom and pop kinda place.  Big menu, Big portions.  Friendly service.  Food is good and not very healthy but hey! it's island food! I do think most people get take out versus dining in though.  The Lau Lau is the size of a brick and so much katsu in one serving i can eat it for 3 meals.
