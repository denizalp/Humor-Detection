Omg! This place was mouth watering delicciousssss!\n\nI finally got to check out this place, bookmark complete!\n\nApple cobbler pancakes! Need I say more? I was a bit worries they were going to be sweet but they weren't. They were perfect! Red velvet pancakes topped with white chocolate shavings and sweet cream cheese frosting! Turkey Benedict was surprisingly really delicious..turkey wasn't dry and the avocado smash was a great added touch!\n\nI'll go back!
