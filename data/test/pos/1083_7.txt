Started here for an UYE (Harry Potter pub crawl). \n\nThis is a pretty typical British pub in America. Waitstaff missing the British accents (although I could just listen to the hubby's accent and pretend that I'm in England).\n\nFast, attentive service. Didn't eat anything from the menu, but it had a few possibilities. Might be back to try food at some point as the location was pretty convenient.
