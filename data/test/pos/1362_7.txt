I like the product. Customer service has a lot of room for improvement. If your the only person there at the time, then you're good. If not plan to be ignored and waiting 20 minutes even if you just need a quick purchase. I told my brother about my experience who vapes himself and he said he ran into the same issue there.  I hope the owners read this and address this problem.
