First time coming to Gen Korean BBQ with my girlfriend and it's was really good! I've been to Korean BBQ joints before but I've been wanting to go to one where I cook it myself. This was my girlfriend's first time at a Korean BBQ place and she loved it!! It wasn't too busy, it was nice to have a small high top for just us. The one girl, I didn't catch her name was a great server at explaining everything and being attentive!! It was great! A lot of good options and it was relaxing!! Will return definitely!!
