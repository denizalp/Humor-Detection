I'm only leaving one star cause I can't leave none. This place was weak. I didn't get lost in the sauce. It was too watery. It was almost like you could make this at home with Ragu and some noodles. It just seems like they threw this together. Not impressed. You can't mess up spaghetti and salad. This place succeeded. I could make better food and I can't even cook.
