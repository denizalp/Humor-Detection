Whoever gave this one star needs to get a life. The food was great. The service was exceptional. The restaurant was spotless. The servers were personable and bubbly. Regulars came in and were greeted with hugs. My coffee cup was never empty AND they give you your own creamer bottle! (Flavored no less)! I'm so glad we found this diner, it's our new favorite spot!
