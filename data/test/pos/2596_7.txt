What can you love about an Ice Cream shop? A lot I say. This BR has a lot to love.\nIt is nice and clean, there is a lot of parking in the lot.\nThe staff is friendly and the Ice Cream is divine!\nLots of flavors, lots of choices. It is an old favorite that just keeps going. Thank you for still being around after all these years.
