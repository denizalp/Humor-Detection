Do not do business with this company! They don't clean up after themselves and do horrible installation of screens and black out curtains! If you need them to fix anything like we have had to have done repeatedly,they will give you the run around. All I can say is they out source everything to other companies! Who will push their business cards on you! Our screens are all fraying and black out curtains were not installed properly! What a headache. Now we need to pay someone else to fix a $20,000 job!
