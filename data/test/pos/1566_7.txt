Welcome to wonderland.\n\nCrack for designers and anyone who loves paper goods, stationary, design books, etc.\n\nRussell, the owner, is full of knowledge. They have the space pen referenced in Seinfeld for sale! He so graciously showed me various pens and answered every question. New and vintage designs.\n\nI could spend hours here.\nI'll probably go tomorrow. Yup, sounds good.
