Lacy at the Planet Hollywood Casino is a complete saint. Her boss Richard is a nice guy. Their welcoming attitude and kind demeanor made our trip amazing.\n\nLacy in particular was extremely helpful at not only engaging with the table but making sure everyone felt comfortable. She is great luck and I highly recommend playing with her and checking out this amazing hotel and casino.
