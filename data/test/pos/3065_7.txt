I do love Stanleys, so I was very disappointed to learn that the location on McDowell and 22nd Street is now closed.  The shop that took over in the space is nothing similar, so don't bother going in if you showed up there looking for Stanleys, as I did.  I haven't made it up to the location on Bell yet, but I might have to make the trek up there.  How else will I get my Christmas Eve pierogi?   :(
