Red Velvet Cupcake - it's been years, but I remember being quite impressed considering it's not one of my favorite flavors in general. \n\nPumpkin Cupcake - The cake was light, not too moist, not too dry and it was perfectly spiced. The cream cheese icing was delicious. Only complaint - not enough icing. They should put some inside! \n\nCaptain Crunch Ice Cream - It has a light cereal flavor and great texture due to the bits of cereal mixed in! I will definitely be coming back for this one!
