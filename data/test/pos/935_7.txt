I can say I do like Costco but there now treating dogs not very well they've got a new rule can't bring the little dogs in,  I just noticed that on their outside sign has nothing to do with service dogs it has to do with little dogs so if they're not letting the little dogs in the store\n DON T Buy there dog food or any pet items . sometimes little dogs deserve to be part of the party
