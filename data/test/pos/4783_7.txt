A place that bills itself as a \"5 star dive bar\" and pretty much fits the description. \n(I mean, you wouldn't expect them to label THEMSELVES as 4 stars)\n\nThey serve a variety of non-bar foods, like soft-corn tortilla sreet-style tacos. \nThere are a few good beers mixed in with the usual regulars.\n\nThey spice up the week with nightly trivia and weekly free comedy shows.\nReally nice people on staff, too.
