This pizza puts the 'zing in AMAZING!!!!!!!\n\nI haven't had pizza-by-slice this good since NYC... for those who don't think it's possible, make the trek out here to this truly, truly hidden spot inside the Cosmopolitan (behind STK).\n\nBy the way, they will deliver to your room if you bribe them. Just sayin...
