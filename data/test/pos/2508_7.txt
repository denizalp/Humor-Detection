Wow - I just read all of the reviews after my visit and am totally shocked.  The owners were nothing but lovely to my friend and I.  We completely enjoyed our Raspberry Champagne cocktails, the caramelized pear salad and our pastas.  The decor is french bistro and I love it, the patisserie case is exquisite and the service was impeccable!  I will definitely be coming back for a repeat visit!
