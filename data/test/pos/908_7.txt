Omg this year sucked ass forreal! I always buy the fast pass and I got to go to the bonus house but the wait was forever and then they all made us go into groups of 3 which sucked ass cause it's supposed to be a solo house! The best one was the clown house. Other than that, I'm starting to see more and more younger kids each year which is so dam annoying! It should be 18+ only!!! 18 & under should have parents supervision!
