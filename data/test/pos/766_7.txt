20 minutes to seat, outside very limited water misters that dont cover the patio,15 minutes for water, 20 minutes for food. Server didn't want to work and it showed. Other servers came around but ours stayed inside. One server came out to the middle of the patio and asked who had what as she didn't know what food went with what tables...sorry , this place isn't The Good Egg .. We will stick with US Egg and few miles down the road.
