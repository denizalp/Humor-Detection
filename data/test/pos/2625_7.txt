Another hole in the wall.. but it's decent when you walk inside. \n\nLast time I was in there wasn't a huge selection of reptiles, and the lighting was very poor. Who knows, it might have changed since last time I went. But the guy at the desk was more than happy to show me his snake (not the one in his pants, perv.). There is also the biggest leopard gecko I've ever seen in my life residing in this place.\n\nNeat store.
