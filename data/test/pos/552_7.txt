Great spot to get your car fixed up!\n\nMy car was in really bad shape (breaks were pretty much non existent, issues with transmission, shocks had holes in them, etc.), and these guys got it done in a day and a half and offered a great deal in the process. The new manager, Robert, is a class act guy - super professional and easy to work with. \n\nWill definitely be coming back for all my car needs!
