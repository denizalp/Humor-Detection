I just moved to Pittsburgh a few months ago and have been ordering pizza like it's my job. Yinz like your pizzerias!\n\nSLICE has been my favorite by far! I ordered a Margherita pizza and it was fantastic. I could tell the ingredients were fresh and high-quality. The crust was the best part! So perfectly crispy and with great flavor.
