Upgrading to 4-stars. Since the new terminal has been completed and I now have TSA pre check, getting in and out of the LV airport is much more efficient. \n\nThe shopping options inside T3 are pretty impressive. Unfortunately the dining options leave something to be desired (unless you count Aunt Annie's pretzels). \n\nThat being said, it'd definitely one of the quicker and cleaner airports that I fly in and out of on the regular.
