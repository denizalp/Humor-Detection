Since my last visit they appear to have repainted the course and changed some of the holes.  Gone are the pop up hazards and in is a moving cup.  However some of the rooms get very hot and the holes are very close together making for a difficult time of it if there is a slow group or two in front of you.  They do serve alcohol and have some creative holes.  Add to that video games and laser tag and you have yourself a winner.
