I went in looking for buying a new bike looked at all the bikes for 10 minutes-1 other customer in the store. As I'm about to leave a sales associate who I'd noticed standing around the whole time then approaches me.  I advise him I'm looking for a new bike & I've seen everything at this point & I'm going to broadway cycle to compare.  The sales person just says ok as I look at him & then leave.  I guess this store is doing so well they aren't interested in obtaining new customers.
