My mom used to make me care packages with Lee sandwiches. She'd pack up 10 sandwiches, box them up, and send them up with me whenever I went home to visit her. Every time I ate a sandwich, it would remind me of my mom and home. \n\nThese are some of my favorite sandwiches in the world: warm french bread with grilled meats and fresh veggies. Mmm.. I miss you mom!
