I should have come here a lot sooner. The beer is delicious.  I had a 24k IPA and was pleasantly surprised.  I was not expecting such good beer from a small local brewery.  The staff was absolutely phenomenal, very friendly and inviting.  Kyle took us around the brewery which is tiny and then downstairs to the Goldmine- a small tasting room.  It has these large concrete tunnels that used to serve as a gun range, just a super cool place to chill with some beers but it's only open for special events.  I will most definitely be back!
