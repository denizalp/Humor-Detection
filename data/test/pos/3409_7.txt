Great place to find a gift here for the young gal or teenager in your life. I saw HK but really didn't see HK items.\n\nVery cute jewelry, accessories found here but also cute plushies as well. I'm so glad my Christmas shopping is done now! Woot woot!\n\nYours can be done too. I think there's a Claire's in almost every traditional mall except this is a Claire's Etc bc it's in an outlet mall!
