Am I the ONLY one that finds it bizarre that you have to order a side of fries with a burger??? An a la carte hamburger, are you kidding me? This place was a joke. The food was cold, the service was horrible and apparently there is only ONE person who knows how to make a milkshake as it took over 30 minutes for us to get ours. \n\nPlease don't waste your time OR money here. Head down to the Yardhouse and enjoy a REAL burger\/fries as well as excellent customer service. You won't be sorry!
