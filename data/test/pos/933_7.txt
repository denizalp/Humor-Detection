FIRST--this place does NOT serve authentic Chinese food. If you haven't had the opportunity to try authentic, then you might not know the difference. This is the WORST Chinese food that I have ever had...tasteless and greasy (be sure to bring your Tums or Rolaids).\n\nIf you want authentic, then go to the Gourmet House of Hong Kong on 16th St and McDowell (it's a real dive, but very authentic!) or have Dim Sum at the Great Wall at 35th Ave\/Camelback (sadly, the Silver Dragon is gone...)\n\nYou'd be better off eating at Panda Express.
