Those that love this type of heavy, savory and filling food would give it a most favorable review.  That being said I gotta go with 2 stars for being overpriced and not good.\n\nPerhaps German food is an acquired taste but in my book it was not prepared with care and it showed.  Nobody in our party was happy with our choice of restaurants and for sure none of us will return.  Btw it is expensive and we had no drinks either.\n\nThe waitperson acted like she wanted us outta there.
