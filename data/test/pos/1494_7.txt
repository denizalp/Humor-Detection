The reviews are correct. This place is a waste of your time. Bouncers try to strong-arm you with their insecurities. Bottle service girls think they're hotter than they are and make you bow to them even tho they're 6 out of 10s. Hakkasan is the epitome of try hard desperate Vegas club to fit in. Save your time and go to a more reputable place like XS or Marquee. Please learn from my mistake.
