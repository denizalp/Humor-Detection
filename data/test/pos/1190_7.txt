So honestly I feel like this place is getting a bad wrap. I saw the reviews of this place but still wanted to check it out despite it only having three stars. Everyone was saying how awful the customer service was but I've only heard great things about it from friends. Despite the poor reviews about bad customer service I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I ordered the pork salad because I've heard how amazing their pork was and it definitely did not disappoint. The salad dressing\/pork combo was pretty fantastic.
