ABSOLUTELY UNHYGENIC & IRRESPONSIBLE!! \nIm giving them 1 star because u cannot give 0stars.. \nIts the WORST place to have food. \nI had hair in my food and when i complained the waiter said \"so many people have taken food from the buffet so we dont know whose hair it is.\" \nHe blamed other customers very comfortably. The attitude is worst and he said.. sir we cannot help. \n\nPLEASE DONT GO HERE!!!
