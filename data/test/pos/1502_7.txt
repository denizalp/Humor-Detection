This little shop is located in the new Korean Plaza in Mesa. Service was so friendly and fast, I wish I could give them more stars. They are so accommodating every time I came in before closing, but they always ran out of the regular boba! Even when I came in an hour before closing, they ran out of boba AND jelly! :( The tea was pretty good, but nothing too special - enough to satisfy my craving though.  \n\nEnvironment: 3\/5\nFood: 3\/5\nPrice: 4\/5\nService: 5\/5
