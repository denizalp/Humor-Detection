Yes the food is good, BUT twice i've ordered the Kimchi stew \"without meat\" and had to pick out little tiny pieces of pork, which makes me think they just scoop out the  bigger pieces.  \n\nAlso, the last time I was in there one of the servers had a fresh, open, third degree burn on his arm that he acquired in the Kitchen, and he just continued serving like it ain't no thang.  Which was kind of gross, to be honest.
