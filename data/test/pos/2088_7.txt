Yelp alerted me that I have a review to complete, from nearly 2 years ago. \n\nI remember how I felt about this place back then, and still feel strongly about this place now. Recollections of how much I would not like to return to this place again. \n\nFind a place that serves Cuban-inspired food, or if there is a frozen aisle that does, heat it up in a microwave, transfer it onto a plate, and voila! Of course you'll remember to remove that non-microwaveable plastic film that Havana overlooked.
