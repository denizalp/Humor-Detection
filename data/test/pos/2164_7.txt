After hearing that a Rita's had opened, I surprised my wife ( who grew up eating Rita's in Philly ) yesterday. She was in heaven after her 1st taste of the delicious chocolate water ice. I consider her an expert!\nWe tried a variety of flavors, and found them all to be exactly like they're in Philly. The owner and his employees are incredibly nice. \nMy youngest son (10) had the custard, and was in heaven.\nNo more snow cones for this family, just water ice!
