This seems like a nice establishment, however I am weary on if they can handle large dogs. When I picked up my Bernise Mountain dog from here, they did not seem too pleased with him. He is big and strong, but shouldn't they have some experience with that? He was barely groomed at all, she said all they trimmed were his feet. His feet?? For $80?? Why else would I bring him in? He now still desperately needs to be groomed because he just has so much hair. Guess we will do it ourselves and never return here
