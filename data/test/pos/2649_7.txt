Absolutely, a four and a half star restaurant.  Grandma B's is the best diner in Pittsburgh. I ordered French toast with beef sausage which was good. Though the highlight of the meal was certainly the Philly cheesesteak my friend ordered. It was the best cheesesteak that I've ever tried. I highly recommend ordering the cheesesteak for your first meal here. I take full responsibility if you don't find the cheesesteak to be outstanding.
