Apparently the owner saw my review the next day because she called me asking me to come in to take a look at my lashes because they \"guarantee\" their work.  For some reason, beyond me, she failed to mention this to me in the beginning.  Why tell me after the fact??  Especially when i've already decided that I was done doing business with your establishment.  Then she started yelling at me about how she was a busy, busy woman with a busy agenda and that i shouldn't be bad mouthing her company.  Yea, whatever.. she brought that upon herself.
