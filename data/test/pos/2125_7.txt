This Ultra Night Club has an excellent restaurant, several fully stocked and ready to rock bars, a giant dance floor and so much more!! The Entertainment is truly amazing from Tiesto to Aoki. They really have the best in all out, world class Entertainment!! Located in the heart of one of my favorite places in Viva Las Vegas... MGM Grand, the City of Entertainment! The vibe is always awesome, the service prompt, friendly and fun, fun, fun!!!
