Gas and so much more.\n\nQuikTrip is always a great choice when it comes to refueling.  I find it a challenge to just purchase \"gas\" when I visit a QuikTrip.  I like the soda fountain station, and the  multitude of snacks QuikTrip has to offer. I always manage to find a snack I hadn't had in quite some time, and it just calls my name.  In addition,  just like all quick trips this store is extremely clean, even more so then normal.\n\n Reasonably priced gas, ice cold drinks, and snacks, it doesn't  get any better.
