These guys do same-day dry cleanings (drop it off in the morning, pick it up on the way home) which has never failed me. Always on time, never holes in my clothes. Great.\n\nBut they have branched out from dry cleaning, and an appreciable part of their business is now cigarettes and lottery tickets. Given the location I suppose they cater to banking-types, but it still drags down my perception of the place.\n\nThey also sell postcards. 80%+ involve jokes about genitalia.
