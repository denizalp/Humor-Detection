As I've mentioned in other posts, I have 15 years experience in the pizza world. Of course this affects my reviews.\n\nThat being said, this pizza is absolute garbage. Seriously, I'd rather do my own open heart surgery than eat here ever again.  Utter crap.\n\nAdd to this how dirty everything is and it is no wonder that this company went from 20 stores to 2 in little over 3 years. Zero adherence to food codes. \n\nYou want to spend days throwing up? Eat here.
