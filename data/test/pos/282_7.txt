$5 a slice!\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=X6KFkFPwPA8My53L3XTX4g#X6KFkFPwPA8My53L3XTX4g\n\nSure them be some damn good slices of NY style pie, but damn Gina, even in Vegas $5 felt a bit steep for cheese and bread. Just know that if you go on any busy night, it will be a long wait in a long hallway. Bring some drinks or something to kill the time. \n\nIf the line is out of the hall, expect to wait almost an hour for above average $5 a slice pizza.
