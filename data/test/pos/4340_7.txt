I love love love their happy hour! Their appetizers all go for $5 (which is a definite steal because it's REALLY good food, not your average bar food). We got the chicken wings (delish), mac and cheese fried balls (OMG yes), and the fried calamari (spicy). They also have $4 beers and well drinks. It's very spacious and our server was MC. She was sweet and helped us out a lot. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed being there and we'll definitely be back again!
