Probably the best doubles and roti I've gotten from Brampton so far.  Tried Brampton Roti Shop prior to this and was pretty underwhelmed.  Vishnu's I'd consider a \"dry\" style compared to Brampton Roti Shop which was pretty wet (lots of gravy).  Boneless chicken roti and doubles were both delicious and included a homemade pepper sauce, but I shouldn't have asked for \"Medium Hot\" because it was a little too much for this white guy LOL.  Loved those doubles though.
