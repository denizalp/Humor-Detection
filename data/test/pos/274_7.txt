I will never order or visit this restaurant again. I used to order via the local number and place curbside pick up. After getting my order wrong and an hour and a half on the phone, I talked to Kelly at the restaurant who refused to credit me a comped dish for a wrong order. Zero customer service. Never again, PF Changs! You guys suck!!
