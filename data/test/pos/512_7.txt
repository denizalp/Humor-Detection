After the long cattle line leading to the door, you are led through a maze of steep stairs that lead to nowhere. After the hike you find a room with nowhere to sit unless you want to drop a grand, and order two drinks as you watch the bartender say $46 with a straight face. Then get bossed around by bouncers and finally leave exhausted after an hour.\nOh yeah and the pleasant piss smell in the hall ways seals the deal.
