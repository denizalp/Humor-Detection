Visited on a Saturday in February 2013 for a sinus infection and received a prescription. All is good until I receive the bill. My insurance was billed $390 for my 10 minute office visit!!  I am responsible for over $160!!!  If I would have said I didn't have insurance it would have cost $99. So now I pay for insurance and also a higher amount for my care.  I agree with Aimee A's 1\/30\/2013 review, basically the same conversation when I called to question the charges. Something doesn't sound fair with this set-up.
