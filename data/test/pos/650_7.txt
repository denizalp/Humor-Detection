Food was good, service was good. Aside from the server telling me my 4 month old is not a good looking baby. I mean, who does that? He later told me he was sorry and that my baby is beautiful, but that was back-pedalling, and unfortunately his insensitive remark is what stands out from an otherwise lovely meal shared with good friends.
