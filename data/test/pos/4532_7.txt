You're effing kidding me? A coffee place this good....and in Richmond Hill? Doesn't make any sense.\n\nWhat's so special about this place? They have Intelligenstia coffee. And for those in the know, this is a coffee house in Chicago and is exceptionally good. \n\nTo make things even more interesting, they are the sole distributors for intelligentsia all over toronto. \n\nSorry Merchants of Green Coffee, as good as you are, i just found a new place where i'm getting my home brew from.
