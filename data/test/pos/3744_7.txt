This buffet at red rock casino is pretty good compare to other station casino buffet, at breakfast they've a live cooking omelet station, cook to order, lunch they have sushi  which is so so, the pork roast is good, sausage and turkey are ok too, the salad station is the best, lots to choose from, dessert I like is the coconut cream pie...overall very good for the price....
