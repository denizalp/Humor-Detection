Highly priced!!!\n(none of the prices include anything other than the burger or dog)\n\nBacon cheeseburger.... 6.89\nCheeseburger ..... 5.99\nBacon hotdog.... 4.49\nBacon cheesedog.... 5.09\nBottled water...... 2.09\nYou have to order a \"lil\" to get a \"JR\" that is reasonably priced. But the burgers are almost child size.\n\nWhile waiting on my Burger I noticed the \"grill master \" smashing the burgers to make em paper thin... Smh. I consider myself a Grill Master. NOTE TO 5 guys.. SMASHING your burgers is NOT whats up!!!....\n\nNew commercial should ask \"Where's the juice\" (as in juicy burger).... not where's the Beef.
