No other clubs in Vegas compares to XS. It is the hottest club with the hottest people.\n\nI went early December so it wasn't crazy packed but still had a good amount of people so it was perfect!  Skipped the long line and zoomed right in, thanks!!  The layout of club is much better than lets say, Marquee, and the bouncers don't wave their flashlights herding people like cattle.  \n\nThe vibe is great, music is bumpin, drinks are flowing, and eye candy everywhere!! My new favorite club!!
