The interior is nice and cozy here.  So many Edison light bulbs. All the wines across the bar.  Server had no problem changing the sauce on the pasta I chose.  Had tortellini with the black truffle creme.  It was very good.  The tortellini are mini. I enjoyed that, never seen it before.  Attentive service here from everyone.  They didn't mind we took the table for 4 hours chit chatting.  We love Brad, request him!
