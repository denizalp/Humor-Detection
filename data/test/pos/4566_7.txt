I've been to a really dirty Roberto's (the one on Craig next to Nellis AFB,) and the expression \"dirty Roberto's\" just sounds... terrible. This particular shop was very clean in the morning, and the cashier was wonderfully warm. \n\nMassive breakfast burrito that can feed you for three days straight- or so it seems- for about $5. Load up on your own salsa and pickled condiments, but pico gonna cost you extra- this ain't Texas. \n\nFood is straight forward but hot and satisfying... Sounds like a lot of things in Vegas.
