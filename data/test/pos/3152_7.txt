Another perfect ten (literally). This time I went to get my nails done by Lily (also known as \"Smiley\" as she always has a smile plastered across her face) and she expertly applied OPI's MonSoon Or Later to my nails. She was meticulous about post-mani cleanup and gave me the best hand massage I think I've ever experienced during a mani - no doubt I'll be asking for her again and again. \n\nReminder: $8. I'm actually quivering at how good this deal is!
