I really enjoy the McDowell's. It's a bit of a drive to get here but there are some good trails and even better views. My only complaint is this place gets packed! It's a haven for trail runners and climbers. If you are okay with a lot of traffic then it's a place you should visit. Good trail system, some interesting geological facts, and an overall good worthwhile experience.
