We just discovered this awesome restaurant! We have not ventured past pizza and garlic tomato bread yet. The pizza was so good and the toppings were perfect. The staff is attentive, the atmosphere is low key, brick walls, nice soundtrack and tv's for sports viewing. We will definitely be back again.
