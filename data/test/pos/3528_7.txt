We used to always hit this place when we were in Vegas back in the day... even back when they were located on the other side...  (don't go as often now since the comps at the Cal are lame)  Local plate with beef teri, chicken teri, and spam musubi is killer.  Get an extra side of their mac salad as well.  Their saimin and teri burgers are decent as well.
