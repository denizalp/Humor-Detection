Salad bar is where it's at.\n\nI stopped by on my way home and had to pick up olives and of course they had a bunch. I decided to pick up a few pickled turnips to because how could I not.\n\nThey have pizza ready to go a slice is about $2 something but it's not my fav but definitely not the worst I've ever had.\n\nSmart that they're open 24\/7 because who wants to go to McDonald's every time\nYou have a craving? It's cheap it's close and it's right beside guy metro.
