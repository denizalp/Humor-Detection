Love diplo. Saw diplo. Hate diplo. Don't come. I'm disappointed-I was expecting Ratchet diplo and I got a shitty remix of \"no scrubs\"\n1. First of all you do not remix no scrubs unless you are completely confident that you can effing bring it. Like No scrubs is iconic TLC but that is beside he point,\n2.DIPLO is an incre√≠ble average guy. Average white dude who can't throw down bc he's basic af\n3. Don't come here
