Very disappointed. Not what it used to be. We ordered beef ribs and they are full of fats and no meat!  We still ate them but will stop recommending these to family and friends. If you change your supplier or vendor, I suggest you ge them back! asap! Before you loose many customers. What happened to the meaty beef ribs that you used to serve?!?
