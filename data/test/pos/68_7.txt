I wanted some pouting and this was first time coming here, well they didn't appoint me. The feel and look of the place was great but their are few seating in the place. The cashier was friendly and helpful with the menu.\n\nI went ahead and ordered their Vege Mushroom Melt Poutine... basically it was fries topped with sauteed mushrooms and plenty of cheddar! The poutine was quite tasty and enjoyable.  \n\nThe only off thing was if you have a stroller you will have pick it up as they have 2 steps in the front.
