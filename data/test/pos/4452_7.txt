I went to Gen couple days ago! I love the food and the service they provide. My experience there was excellent! My server is \"Yuhao\" ( I think I spell it correctly lol), and he provides the best customer service!!! Literally!! He came back to check on us really often, and he always has his big smile on! And whenever we had some dumb questions, he explained it patiently~and he definitely knows his stuff!! Me and my friend love the food! But Yuhao made our experience in Gen excellent excellent! We will definitely come back for Yuhao :)
