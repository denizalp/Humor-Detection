Uh. They took twenty five minutes to make my sandwich without an explanation. We were the only ones in the place. Nancy Grace was blaring. The walls and floors are yellow. Somebody was coughing in the back. \n\nI love snobby stoner jocks with after school jobs, but not when they act like snobby stoner jocks with after school jobs while I\"m waiting. Forever. With Nancy Grace yelling. \n\nPass. \n\n(Actually though, the veggie cheeseburger was amazing and, with one other sandwich, fifteen dollars. I was looking to see if they put unicorn hooves or diamonds into it. None sighted.)
