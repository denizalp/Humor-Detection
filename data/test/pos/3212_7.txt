So happy to see another location pop up in the valley and it's in a great location - Ray Rd and i10 right next to Bosa Donuts. \n\nMy favorite lemonades are the Lava Flow and the Pineapple Mango. I love that they are always adding new \"colors\" for their mason jars. 50 cents off anytime you bring it back. \n\nNote: They have a new Blue Hawaii menu for the month of September!
