Excellent communication from Rob the chief dude and Samantha who came and did my hair. Punctual and terrific service :)  I couldn't have asked for anything to go smoother for my wedding day!\nBoth of them were extremely friendly and I loved every minute!  It was like having my hair done by a good friend.  You can;t go wrong with using Amelia C and Co.
