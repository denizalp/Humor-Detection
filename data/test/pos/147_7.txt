Truly lives up to the name \"terrible\" . $30 for a dry wipe across the dash. The only thing that kept this from 1 star is the outside looked nice. Besides that, the cup holder was sticky, debris still on the vents and seats... I asked for my money back. The assistant manager offered for it to be redone, but it could have easily been done right the FIRST time (since I was the only car in the place) --so I declined. I will do a better job with my eyes closed.
