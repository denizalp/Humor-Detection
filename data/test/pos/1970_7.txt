Yo fuck this place.\n\nI ordered their gringo burrito because it sounded good (as does all of their menu items).  When I got it, it was puny AF, cold in the middle, and the wrapper stuck to the burrito, so when I opened it, it all fell out. When I said something, my waiter offered me a cookie or a muffin...\n\nThis place is overpriced and overrated. It should've never taken over IHOP.
