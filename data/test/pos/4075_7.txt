Went in with my friends today, it was 110 degrees outside and was looking for some beer to cool it down - it didn't live up to the expectations. We had a look for a table which was closest to the Fan to get some good air. \n\nThe food was good but not great , the menu had all the interesting keywords (jalape√±o, chipotle , pickles , bell peppers ) but lacked Flavours.
