I used to make fun of this place as a teenager but secretly buy everything here. I'm pretty sure everyone did that in high school, right?\n\nWell now I'm an adult or whatever and I stopped in to pick up some things for a party. The girls working here are spunky, fashionable and extremely nice. They were friendly and helpful and also went away quickly when I just wanted to browse. \n\nThe prices are a bit high for what you're getting, but that's nothing new.
