Great local food for being in the mainland.  I miss the food in Hawaii, but I can count on this place to help me reminisce of my favorites at great prices.  I love the Korean fried chicken and I always order it.  Yummy!  My friend's tease me for getting this every single time we go here.  The ahi poke is also pretty decent and the saimin bowls are great hangover eats.  Definitely come here for some local food, but be wary that sometimes there is a long line at lunch hour.
