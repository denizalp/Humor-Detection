Yep, the reviews don't lie. This place is easy to miss but we finally found it. We arrived on a Wednesday night and had no issues getting a table for two after we called the number outside. We tried a few cocktails and enjoyed them all! The Kapu Kulu, Alacrity Get Your Pears, Isle of the Cross and Ships High in Transit. This is a cozy spot so it's perfect for a date night!
