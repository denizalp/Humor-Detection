I dropped off a ton of things here when I was liquidating my life in this town and it was a terrific experience.\n\nTheir donation program is quick and easy (just drive around to the back of the store and put it in a bin) and really helps out people by selling things at affordable prices and the profits go to provide assistance to the community.\n\nSuch great people at this location especially.
