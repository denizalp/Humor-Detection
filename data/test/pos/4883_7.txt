So I called this place to get a price on a handgun. The reply I got was; \" four hundred something.\"  Hmm, I never realized that four hundred something was an actual price. I guess It was to much trouble for the guy to actually look and see what the actual price was.  I would have probably got a better answer to my question if I consulted one of those magic 8 balls. Guess what Legendary Guns, I will take my four hundred something dollars and happily spend it at another gun shop.
