The tacos were super delicious and I really enjoyed the elote! I hadn't had elote since Mexico City and the corn here was really delicious and memorable. I wanted more of it. They cut it for you tableside which is satisfying. The horchata was pretty basic but still delicious. Service was a bit slow for a Sunday lunch, but the food quality made up for that.
