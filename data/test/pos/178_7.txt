You can always find something for your inner hipster here. \n\nI have a hate\/love\/hate relationship with this chain of stores. \n\nThey have very cute stuff, they know how to choose what is trendy - but at the same time - they aren't very original and a lot of the same items can be found at other stores or online, amazon.com etc for less.\n\nThey are known for hijacking designs by individual artists without paying for them - so that's kind've a turn off.
