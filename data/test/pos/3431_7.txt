RUN!  Don't walk, RUN as far away from this place.  The place is a typical chop shop.  The minute you walk into there establishment, you are hounded by a half a dozen sales reps.  I came here with a friend and before even looking at a car, they wanted to run credit.  Blue (Genie) insisted on pulling credit.  Fernando is the worse low class salesman I have ever dealt with in my life.  Called me, text me and cursed me out because we left after being ignored for over 10 minutes.  Horribly unprofessional.
