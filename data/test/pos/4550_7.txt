Another one of those cheap Chinese buffets (5.95) that puts out a few tasty dishes that get you up to 3 stars.The decor sucks and the washrooms need to be torn out and rebuilt. On the brighter side I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I would return to this place because of the food, cheap price and the friendly staff , and to see if they remodeled it.
