My sometime guilty pleasure.  It's got a nice salad bar and taco station with fresco salsa.  You can get away with eating moderately healthy here so long as you avoid the 'American' stations of red meat and dishes lather in butter.\n\nTheir deserts are pretty good with many toppings at the soft serve stations. \n\nThe clientele leaves little to be desired.  Only come here for pure gluttony but nothing else.
