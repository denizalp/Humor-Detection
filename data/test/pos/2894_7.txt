Love, actually!\n\nI've waited at a cold, dark airport late on a Sunday night to welcome Brian Sipe and the boys back from a road trip.  I sat through games in the Dawg Pound at the old stadium in January.  I wear orange and brown during football season - even though I really hate both colors.\n\nThis relationship with my favorite NFL team has lasted longer than my marriage.  Guess it's \"till death do us part\" for me and my Cleveland Browns!
