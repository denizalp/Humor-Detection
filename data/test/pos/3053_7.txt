So tried this place a couple of times and was disappointed. The crepes are okay and the sides are pretty bad. The soup as a side is not worth truing and the side salad wasn't the best. The place is pretty small and limited in seating. Each time that i go there is aleays someone looking over you while you eat waiting for the table....
