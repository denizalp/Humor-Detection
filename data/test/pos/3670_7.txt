I already ranted about the CF that was my TSA experience. And I ranted on how much I dislike airports that have shared buses to their \"rental car pavilion\" and so that leaves me to describe how much I dislike LAS for the tremendous amount of walking involved in getting from the ticket counters, through security and to the gates. Ever heard of a slidewalk?\n\nDid you know that Las Vegas has a monorail? Sure it does. But it doesn't go to the airport.
