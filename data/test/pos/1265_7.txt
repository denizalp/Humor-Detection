I've been coming to this place when Sammie Sr.  Was still young.  I've never had an issue with the staff. I've never seen them say anything rude or act rude.  You put garbage out, you get garbage back, so if you treated someone with disrespect, you'll get garbage back, don't bitch about it. \n\nGlad this joint is back open, let's keep it this way!!!
