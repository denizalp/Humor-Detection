Well, something new is out here at Sonic and it tasted good as well. The French Toaster sandwich seems like a great invention of two slices of said toast which is filled with a good egg patty and bacon in my case. It tasted pretty good. I would ask for a pack of syrup next time to dip sandwich, but if this thing stays on the menu, I would order it again for a random meal at any time of the day.
