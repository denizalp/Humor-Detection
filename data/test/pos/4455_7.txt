Screw these guys. They decide to expand their store and in the process kill a small business. The Mail Vault was closed with 2 days notice to accommodate their expansion. I am all for saving money on food, but I will never spend a dime there after they had shown their true colors. I don't care if its the leasing companies fault, they managed to kill a the type of small business that supports the American economy. If I could post a huge middle finger to this company I would!
