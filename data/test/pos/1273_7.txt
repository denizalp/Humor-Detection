Note: I only give out 5 stars to surprisingly EXCEPTIONAL, best-in-class establishments.\n\nThis is the best gym on base. Wait, it's the only gym on base. In any case, the facility is clean and awesome.  Locker rooms are great, with more of a nicer \"country club-ish\" feel than \"hood gym.\"  Why go off base and waste your money?  You're not going to find a better gym, and definitely not at a reasonable price.
