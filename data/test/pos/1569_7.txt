I like to stay off the strip which also means staying at a hotel as well, off the strip.  I went and checked out all the stations for my next stay and this is the best place of all the Stations Hotel and Casinos.  There's is much more to do and see.  \n\nOh..yes, I am hotel hunting already...and so far I like what I see.\n\nSunset Station Hotel & Casino...here I come!
