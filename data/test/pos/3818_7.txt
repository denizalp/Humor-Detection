Madame tussauds was such a treat.  Not only did they have various modern day singers and actors scattered around,  they had porn stars, mobsters, the cast from 'the hangover', and a short fun 3d film for marvel superheros at the end of the tour.  \n\nMany of the wax models have been updated, like Britney spears and shakira.  My favorite one was Nicholas Cage.  I can't wait to come back here again!
