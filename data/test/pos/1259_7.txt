Love this place.  Excellent breakfast menu that I had to come back a second time for.  The Oeuf Coquette, poached egg on your face panini, and their baked goods like chocolate and almond croissants are all excellent.\n\nSeating is tight because it's very busy so either go early or pray that you get lucky.
