I just bought the awesome 2016 Honda Civic. I cant be happier. First Taylor our sakesman actually lustened to what I wanted and kept in mind my budget.  Then working with Kevin to work out our numbers made the buying process easy and timely. I normalky dislike the home process but I have to give All the Findlay Honda In Henderson 10+. Defiantly wirth all 5 stars.\n.Thanks Taylor and Kwvin. I am really thriiled with getting this awesome, quality Civic!!!
