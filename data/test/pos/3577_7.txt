I asked for soy because I'm lactose intolerant and the barista was extremely snooty and rude about it (\"We don't *do* that.\"). The guy's ego was almost as big as his moustache.  I guess I get that it's a 'no frills' place\/coffee purist destination\/whatever, but there's really no need to alienate me because I have an intestinal condition.
