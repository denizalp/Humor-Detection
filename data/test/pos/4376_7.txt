This store kinda sucks...very limited selection of items, especially if you're dairy free. I came here in hopes of getting a late night snack...cashew milk ice cream but they don't carry it. Practically every grocer in town carries this now...all Winco has is coconut milk ice cream and only two or three flavors. Kind of annoying. \n\nThe store was neat and tidy, which is nice...just wish they carried more variety especially with a 24-hour Walmart a hop, skip, and a jump away.
