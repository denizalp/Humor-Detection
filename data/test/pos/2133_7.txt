Garage door would not open. Jeff, came out today and in 15 minutes repaired the broken part.  Not only did he perform repair quickly he also adjusted my door, lubricated the rollers and tightened up the springs.  Didn't try to up sell me like so many repair companies do.  He also offered a 90 day come back for any reason warranty as well as one year on the repair.  Oh yes, he showed up 10 minutes before scheduled appointment.  Very impressed.
