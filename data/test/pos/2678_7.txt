Butta...with extra butta.  My new favorite post first friday's hang out.  It's sure to soak up any linguring \"33\" from Sens or Kiltlifter from \"fate.\"  I found myself dipping or should I say soaking the waffles in the delicious maple surup and washing it down with a big glass of Kool-Aid.  I think the pictures provided offer a good representation of what you can expect to find when you dine at Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles.
