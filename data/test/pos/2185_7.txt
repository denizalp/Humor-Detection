We went on an adventure to check out the second location of this famed ice cream chain and it was great! Same menu and they also make their ice cream on the spot.\n\nOnly wish there was a way for us to vote for their next new flavour. Been craving the Salted Caramel Brownie for the longest time.  Alas, we will have to wait until next time.\n\nFavourite flavours so far:\n1.  Phil and Sebastian\n2.  Toasted Coconut\n\nDelicious.
