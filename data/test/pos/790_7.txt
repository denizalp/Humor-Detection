This trail has received a bit of a well-needed make-over that I really like.  The lights all work and are now brighter, the trail has been re-paved and there are these cool artsy-type trail markers now with the name of the trail.\n\nI don't go often, especially right now because spring out here gives me a headache, but I really enjoy the trail.  My dogs do, too!  The new pavement is much nicer on their paws.\n\nGreat because it's next to my house and you see the occasional exercise enthusiast, but whenever I go it's never too busy.
