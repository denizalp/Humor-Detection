went to this store because my grandson needed reeds for his instrument. he had a card from his high school that gave him a 45% discount. after the discount, the box of vandoren contra bass reeds was 52.25 before taxes. I was stunned. I immediately went home and got on my computer and checked out amazon and found the same box for 46.00, without a discount. they must raise the prices to reflect the discount. I won't be buying them there again.
