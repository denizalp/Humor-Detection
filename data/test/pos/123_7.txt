This is a qualified 4 stars: I started seeing Dr. Askari within the last year and really, really like him. The practice seems rather well-run, too. But when I saw him a couple of months ago, he delivered the unfortunate news that he's leaving and going back to California.\n\nI saw him again a couple of weeks ago for the last time, and he talked up his replacement. But I can't find any information about her, so I'm not sure I will continue to use the Women's Specialty Care practice.
