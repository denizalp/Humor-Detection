Can't speak for the spa, but with all the money PH appears to have...how is the gym equipment so old and out dated? The elliptical I was on didn't even turn on. The weight equipment is from late 90s at best. Carpet is worn and stained. Come on! How are you suppose to feel like a rock star when you feel like you are working out in your uncles basement.
