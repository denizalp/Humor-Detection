I love this park!!! \n\nThey have it all! Walking trails, kids playgrounds, tennis courts, gazebo, open grassy places, porch swings, picnic areas, a sandy beach, and lake Norman waters on aspects of the property for beautiful views. \n\nA great get a way with a bit if everything for everyone. During the summers months there is typically a charge for entry, however for winter the charging center is closed. \n\nI'd highly recommend going the speed limit and stopping at the permitted signs as on more than one occasion I've seen cops on the look out.
