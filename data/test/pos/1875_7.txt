They will kick you out even if you checked in online.  I checked in at 4:25pm and they said (the app) about a sixty minute wait.  So I came in at 5:15 pm and they said sorry we closed at 5pm (even their sign and yelp said 7p).  The lady inside was very rude, saying \"we closed\".  Go to Sports Clips near Walmart or Fantastic Sams down the street at Smiths (near Windmill) instead.  I will never go to another GreatClips again and I will tell all my clients, friends, and family members to avoid all GreatClips as well.
