Love the Salsa Bar. The Santisma Veggie Taco is Da Bomb. I did not care too much for the Cactus Veggie Taco but do not hold that against them. The street tacos and Mole are both wonderful too. Great food, divey interior. Great find says the gal who is not the biggest lover of Mexican food. I would go here again. Service was a bit slow though but nice ladies.
