Did you bother to read the review?  So busy being defensive and passive aggressive you completely missed the point. In my opinion (and, coincidentally, my friend) we didn't like your food.  Our opinion.  Being an a$$ doesn't change my opinion.  \n\nAnd fat shaming?  In a time when discrimination is running rampant in our country you want to drag that into things? Becuse you got a well deserved low rating?  Very lame and unoriginal of you.  Keep your hate to yourself.\n\nP.s. use the time you are taking writing petty revenge messages and use them to bettering your crappy restaurant.
