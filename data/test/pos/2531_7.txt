Had some time before going to catch our flight home and didn't want airport food. Dumplings were the the craving so we headed to Chinatown Fat Dumpling. No other customers was there before and after we finished 6 pm.  \n\nDrinks no boba were good.\nHuge bowl of Hot and Sour soup ( some of the lotus stem roots were left on)\nString beans were good \npork and chive dumplings were good.\n\nThis place has a large menu maybe if they made a couple of items well they would get better reviews. Service was excellent since we were the only customers.
