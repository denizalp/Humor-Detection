【WORST EXPERIENCE！！！】\n\nThis is the worst where I lived in Las Vegas hotel, front desk staff is so mean，he gave us to arrange the most remote corner rooms in the hotel, outside the window is a wall,blocked all of the view and there is no any light come in.That is Wednesday,all the way around the room should be nobody to live, the front desk guy is so mean to gave us this Disgusting room !Remind everybody, when you check-in the hotel,if room number is 383 or 384, do not live, go ask to change other rooms.
