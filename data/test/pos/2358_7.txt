Nice little sandwich shop near my gym. They do have vegetarian sandwiches, and burgers. I cut out cheese from my healthy eating habit, so my sandwich was a little boring. I wish they'd add some sauce or other spread for the burgers or subs. Maybe some southwest sauce? Still a great value, and the sandwiches taste great.
