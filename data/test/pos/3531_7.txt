It's been a while since I've went out of my comfort zone to try a new AYCE Korean BBQ place. But tonight I finally went to Gen, and was more than pleased! The food was amazing! Better than I expected. And for once, it wasn't just another overhyped restaurant. Jan, who helped us, was great and made the experience even better by her great service and charismatic personality. Already excited to bring my friends and family here in the future!
