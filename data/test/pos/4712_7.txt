I'm going to keep this short.\n\nThis place advertises itself as an \"Irish Pub\" - being British I can categorically tell you this place is not a pub.  It's a restaurant.  It doesn't even have a proper bar area so the whole place is no smoking.\n\nMaybe the foods good, I wouldn't be able to tell you.  I left.
