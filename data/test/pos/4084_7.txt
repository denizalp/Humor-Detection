Don't ever more to this place!!!! They have major bug problems! Spider infestation!!! And right by the airport and right by a train so u can always hear both! Also right next to sunset park so there's always a lot of homeless!!!! My apartment got robbed!!! There was like 10 other robberies and they never got security! U think they would! It will be a huge mistake moving to that sht hole.
