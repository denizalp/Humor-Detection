I think this place is great! Not only do they have the ethnic supplies as the reviewer listed below, but it also has lots of other \"salon only\" options like redken and paul mitchell. I didn't have any problems with the service, and when I asked a question it was answered in a knowledgeable fashion.\n\nHey, what other place can you get your earrings, shampoo, and bedroom slippers for cheap? I know, I know you can get that all at Wal Mart, but I'd rather support the small businesses than the corporate juggernauts that are ruining America.
