I was not impressed at all.... And yes, my friends I know my fry bread. \nI had the combo... the meat was bland, the cheese was old, and the lettuce was wilted, not to mention that the bread was greasy (which it really shouldn't) and overcooked. \nI know that they're natives, as am I, maybe that was why I was expecting a little bit more \"wow\" since they opened a restaurant, but I left disappointed.\nNonetheless, I will not be coming back. For the price I paid I could've made better in my home, with tons more flavor.
