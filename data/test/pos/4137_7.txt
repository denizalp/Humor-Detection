If you are looking for a place that serves meatballs, plays dance music while you eat, and offers spankings, LAVO is your place!! \n\nCame for a Bachelorette party, as did many other groups of girls.  Each bachelorette was publicly spanked by the hunky waiter with a paddle.  It was a creepy and silly spectacle. \n\nThe chopped Louie Salad was one of the best Louie's I have ever had tho.
