Grapevine has the best Karaoke system in Arizona and it runs EVERY night after 5pm. They have another cute bar upstairs that's covered but open-air and allows for smoking and conversation. They also have a huge upstairs patio for dining which tends to be very popular during the winter months. Grapevine is a fun place to hang out - not a culinary adventure. While the food is decent it certainly wont impress Yelpers. However, the atmosphere in general, the staff, and the late night Karaoke are perfect.
