I really like this hotel it's got a great location and is pretty quiet.  The gym has good cardio pieces (mostly), the treads and bikes are pretty good but the strength equipment is terrrrrrrrrrrible.\n\nSo I had left a 4 star review but I tried to use that piece of strength gym equipment they have in here and it doesn't work properly at all.  It's basically a giant 1000lb paperweight so I changed my review to 1 star
