I have been going to Gus's since the late 90's the pizza is consistently good, they finally fixed the overcharging issue where they were charging a higher rate than current 8.1%.  They  only sell pizza by the slice certain times of the day and the slice I bought this morning was smaller than the it has been in the past.  My guess is minimum wage went up so they adjusted the slice size.  Bottom line Good Pizza with occasional issues with there service, prices and portion.
