There is almost zero reason to go here *unless* you drove your boyfriend to the airport, missed the flight, have 5 hours to kill, and develop an evangelical drive to take this 27 year old man on a healthful nature excursion at Claireville Conservation Area, after which you promise to Yelp-out the nearest chicken wings locale, so he can \"rebalance\". \n\nFood was totally fine for a bar by the highway. Service was friendly!
