Stopped by here yesterday in the pouring rain.\n\nIt was dirt cheap. Possibly the only reason I rated it 2 stars.\n\nThe food was heated up in a microwave.\n\nI got the tandoori chicken with rice and salad.\n\nSalad was old. The chicken was flavourful. The rice was meh.\n\nMy friends got the biryani.\n\nI was shocked at their portions.\n\nNote : They do a student discount on top of their ridiculously cheap prices.\n\nFor that price, you have to wonder what kinda meat they're using..
