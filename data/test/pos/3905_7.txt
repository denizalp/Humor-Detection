This place was much better than Wicked Spoon, and a better value compared to Bacchanal.  The crab legs are meaty, warm, not too salty. The prime rib was actually good!  The prime rib at all of the other Vegas buffets suck. Their meat was well-seasoned, tender, juicy, a very good roast. Loved their ox tail!  Tender, fall-off-the-bone ox tail. Dessert bar was good, but the cheesecake was too dry. Very good crepes. I'm heading back to this place when I roll through Vegas again.
