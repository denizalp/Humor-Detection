My theory on the current fast food crisis: Raise the minimum wage, and the levels of service will improve. \n\nTonight, this particular franchise had no cookies, flippant employees, and bread that was cut improperly, falling apart as I munched through a tuna sub. A knife and fork was almost required, but guess what? They were out of plasticware too! I doubt getting paid $8 an hour provides much incentive to do a better job. \n\nAnd Jared's still a dweeb.
