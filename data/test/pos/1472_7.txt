Good location and a party atmosphere on the casino floor, but  I see that casinos are now charging $20 \"early check-in\" fee and they also add 12% tax to the $20\/night \"resort fee\" ... this is definetly a great deal as I got extra hair with my reservation. Hair on the pillows, hair all over the bathroom floor, and stuck to the shower door, the shower walls, and even a few bonus short and crinkly ones in the shower swirling around in the slow-draining water.
