This was the WORST pho I've ever had!! Horrible broth that had a strange flavor and the meat looked and tasted not fresh. I couldn't even eat it.. So unappetizing! Ordered fried rice for the kids, no flavor and horrible! This place looked borderline as to its cleanliness and honestly if I called it in I'm betting they would be shut down! Will NEVER go back!!
