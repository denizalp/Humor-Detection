You sure it is a library??\n\nThe information area has sofas that resemble those in the lobby of a boutique hotel!\n\nThat high ceiling? The spacious interior space?!\n\nJust chilling here in Aurora Library is a great relaxing experience.\n\nThen this lady talking on the phone so loud wake me up from my dream.....I don't really want to know about her love life really...\n\nWifi access only offers to library card holders.. so out of towners like me are out of luck!
