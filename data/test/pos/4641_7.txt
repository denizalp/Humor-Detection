Food was decent, service was HORRIBLE. As we finished our meal, I put my knee on the booth seat. I'm in flip flops and shorts. The owner came and told me to remove my dirty feet from HIS seat. My feet weren't on the seat. He proceeded to argue with me and told me this was his place and to remove my feet because it was unhealthy. I'm not a dirty person, and to be called out publicly that way was rude and unprofessional. \n\nI will NOT be back.
