Great food, but terrible service. I called in a to go order, and when i went to go pay for it, there was no thank you from Lyn, the cashier, nor a you're welcome after I said thank you. And after I paid, she doesn't hand me the food, she just says \"Oh, your food is right there.\" I can maybe understand if it was busy, but I was the only one there. Someone needs to put a smile on Lyn's face.
