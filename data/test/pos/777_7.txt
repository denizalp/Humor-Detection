This is the best god damn stationary store I've ever been in.\n\nThey have so much great stuff, and the staff are so helpful and friendly.\n\nThey did not judge me when I chose a non recycled note book over one with recycled paper.\n\ni hate recycling. i can't find a place to review that so I will do it here:\nI hate recycling it's a waste of time and it doesn't really help all that much.
