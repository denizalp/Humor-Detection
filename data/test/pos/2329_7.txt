I don't understand why this place has such good reviews? Hubby and I went there to check it out due to the high ratings, BIG disappointment! We decided to get the AYCE to sample the various rolls. The flavors were boring and bland. We've had waay better sushi here jn town. The service was ok BUT I came here to get some good rolls and we definitely will not be coming back. It is not worth the money at all!!!
