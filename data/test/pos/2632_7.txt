Oh my god, there's a lot to love about Senor Taco.\n\nFirst off, they have burritos the size of a newborn. \n\nSecond, they are open basically at the crack of dawn so if you are like me and want to go all out at 6am and order a newborn-sized breakfast burrito you have the liberty to do so. \n\nLove you, Senor Taco, love you so much.
