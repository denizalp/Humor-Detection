Absolutely atrocious wait times. It is EXTREMELY disrespectful to keep your patients waiting just so you can over book and make more money. It devalues the practice, the patient, and any integrity you claim to have. This is my second visit and the office seems to be even more over booked than last time. We waited 2 hours last time and are approaching beyond an hour, so far today. There are still three people ahead of us. Absolutely ridiculous!!!
