One word = GO!\n\nIf you want authentic Italian food, you need to visit Lamanna's! This place is so good! I've tried numerous items, such as the pizza, gelato, pastries, etc., all of them were delicious.\n\nThe service here is pretty fast and most the staff here are friendly and ready to help you out. I would definitely recommend this spot!
