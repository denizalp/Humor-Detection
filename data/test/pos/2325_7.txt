-Friendly service, very attentive, slow to bring bill.\n\n-Food was average, a bit on the extreme salty side.\n\n-Prices were a bit high, but they offer evening dinner specials for $6.99.\n\n-Server talked us into ordering the Wonton soup-Large was $7.95 with skimpy portions (a few wontons, sliced chicken, tough beef, 2-3 shrimp, half cup of cabbage) and lots of bland broth. Not worth the price.\n\n-Restroom clean, but no soap in Women's restroom.\n\n-Decor was very nice.\n\n-Parking is very convenient.\n\n-Next door to a Barber shop.
