After the hot walk from Duquesne Incline upper station to the Mon Incline upper station, Grand Brew was a welcome respite.  We were able to cool off in the cute shop with a nice, strong iced coffee and a Shot in the Dark, husband's newest favorite coffee drink.  \n\nEveryone affiliated with the store was incredibly nice, too; when we walked up the owner was opening up his ice cream shop two doors down, and one of the locals on the patio went and got him for us.  Love the neighborly feel of this place.
