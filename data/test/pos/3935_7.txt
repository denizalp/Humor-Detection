The day before Christmas Eve and every shop you go to is full with at least an hour wait, and this place is totally dead should tell you something.  Eleven bucks for a hair chop should also be a dead giveaway to run far from this place.  No, not me, all I needed was a simple straight get to the point my husband could do this if I had a nice pair of snips haircut.  They couldn't even get that right.  If this place is your only option, just stay hairy.
