Nice place for a healthy meal\n\nTonight, we decided to add a little \"healthy\" to the night of gluttony, so we decided to grab a wuick bite to eat at Ahopoki Bowl. \n\nAhopoki has a \"chipotle\" like feel, meaning you walk along the line and tell them how you would like your bowl made. On this visit I went with the brown rice + tuna house sauce\/spicy + all the toppings. \n\nMy bowl wasn't bad, I was pleasantly surprised.\nAhopoki is a great alternative for a very tasty and healthy \/ lite meal.
