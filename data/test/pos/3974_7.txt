Park your RV here\nThen walk in\nAnd buy some jam\nAnd nuts\nAnd steak sauce\nAnd crackers.\nWalk around to the holiday sounds of Lonestar.\nCountry music, so soothing. \nLike Cheez N' Crackers in your childhood lunchbox.\nBut it's time to sit down now.\nYou're hungry.\nIt's 1 pm and you're already on 4th meal.\nSo order some chicken fried steak.\nAnd hashbrown casserole.\nFried okra, too.\nBut don't forget to get Diet Coke.\nBecause Diet Coke won't make you fat.\nThen pay your bill.\nAnd go back to your RV.\nAnd drive away.\nInto the sunset.\nWith your new Lonestar CD.
