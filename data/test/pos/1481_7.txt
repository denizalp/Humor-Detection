My early morning savior - a large, ice cafe mocha with a straw.  I work in the neighborhood and love taking a little break to walk over to Inside the Bungalow.  Everyone there is friendly and cares about their customers. Funky and relaxing, there are little private areas to sip your beverage and nibble on a little nosh. Stop in and get to know them and their coffee & tea selections.  Ask about their yoga classes. But don't take the last apple danish...that's mine. ;)
