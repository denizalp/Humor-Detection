$7.77 smog in 15 minutes with great customer service when you check in on yelp! \n\nMy only complaint is the man who checked my smog got my rubber elephant key chain a little dirty.  I get it they work on cars all day, hence the dirty hands. But Mr. Elephant should be handled with care and cleanliness. Idk maybe next time I'll put my keys in a zip lock bag.
