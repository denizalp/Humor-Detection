My husband and I ate here on a Friday night. The place was empty. After we got our food. I now know why. Our zucchini appetizer was loaded with grease and over cooked. It was rock hard. My husband ordered prime rib. It was rare and full of fat and gristle. I ordered lobster. They handed me a hammer after I asked for something to crack the shell. A seafood restaurant and nothing to crack open shells. A fellow coworker told me not to eat here. I wish I would have listened. I won't be back.
