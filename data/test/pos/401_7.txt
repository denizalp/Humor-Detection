We just randomly stopped here after passing Panda Express for a locally owned choice. I was a little nervous at first because we don't have awesome luck with asian food places, but these guys are awesome! \n\nSuper good and good prices. They were awesome about accommodating weird requests and our waiter was friendly! We experimented and tried the cold jellyfish as an appetizer- despite an unusual texture it was really good! I've never seen it on a menu you before either! \n\nCheck them out!
