Absolutely terrible! If you want a great cut you will get it here. You will wait even with an appointment at least 30 minutes, today was 45 minutes before I walked out, or in the past just loose your appointment out right. Here professionalism literally doesn't exist.\n\nSo if your a teenager, tight on cash, and lots of free time to wait this is the place for you. If your a busy successful adult who is willing to pay for great service, hair cuts, and prompt appointments go somewhere else. Disrespect is served daily
