Being w\/ Mother Nature is the best!  Dad got us in for free w\/ his Veterans card.  Nice slow drive around the 13 mile scenic loop.  New roads & bridges & more construction as we drove through.  Probably due to the washed out roads from rain waters.  \n\nWe didn't see any donkeys this time on our way out, but next time will head towards Bonnie Springs where I've seen them most of the time.\n\nMom & dad's first time & they loved it.  I can't wait to come back & do an easy hike w\/ them.
