I'm always surprised by how rude the employees are. I purchased something and if not for my own friendliness, the cashier would have only given me my total and nothing else. No \"Hello\" no \"Goodbye\" nothing. \n\nVery over priced. I go when I have no other choice. \n\nAlso the riders on the Broken Spoke cycling team are slow. HAHA Easily left in the dust..
