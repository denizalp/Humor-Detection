Upscale thrift store?  Seems like an oxy moron to me, but whatever.\n\nI purchased 6 items:\n\n* 2 dresses, both still with tags on them\n* 2 pairs of shorts\n* 2 tank\/halter tops, one was BCBG Max Azria\n\nAll for $80.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  I love that you can bring in your gently used clothes and sell or get store credit.  I'm a fan!
