Worst gen franchise. Servers were awkward, the sauces were different or not even there than other gen places. Brisket was cut thicker, not ideal. Even down to changing our grill! They didn't even want to change it till ALL the food was cooked?? Even though it was clearly super black and smoking endlessly while cooking!
