The local company from whom I originally bought the door got so frustrated with the installation that they just walked away from it and never billed me.  I went without a functioning door for ages because I thought it was a lost cause.  It took Jeff 45 minutes and my door works!  It just takes the right guy with the right tools.  I'm so glad he got their money after all that time!
