Because I'm a fool, I decided to buy groceries on Black Friday. Much to my surprise, I didn't have to wait in line at all. The store was still quite busy at 2pm and the Black Friday zombies were still trolling, leaving mass destruction in their wake. The entire store looked as if it had been looted! But I was able to get all my grocery needs and escape without a scratch.
