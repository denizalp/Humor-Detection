Seasons 52 has a secret vegan menu! It's not particularly extensive, but at least they're aware that vegans are, in fact, not just the stuff of legend. They offer choices like ponzu-glazed tofu, cranberry almond tabouli, and farmer's market-esque vegetable penne. Go you, Seasons 52, go you. \n\nOn an unrelated-but-equally-positive note, Michael was the best waiter known to man (honestly, i usually don't even notice restaurant staff), and I'd like to thank him for helping my boyfriend ask me to prom via a shot glass of rocky road cake. High fives all around.
