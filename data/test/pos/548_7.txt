Dick's I love you. \n\nCame here for breakfast on Sunday, you were crowded so your server took me over to Richardson's. I had the omlette (which I've never tried before). It was the best damn omlette I have ever had. Shrimp, peppers and pepper jack cheese. \n\nThanks for ruling the valley with your fine cuisine!
