I'm not quite sure what all the hype is all about.  Sure, they offer fresh and authentic Italian food, but they are also in a ghetto, run-down area and the prices are not competitive for the overall value ($8 for a small sandwich and salad).  The service was surprisingly good, and the bread was superb, but the cons will prevent me from coming back.
