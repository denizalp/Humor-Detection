I have not a single good thing to say about this restaurant. \n\nThe service was terrible, took 15 min to get a water. The nachos were terrible on store bought chips with raw onions and green peppers on them and very little meat. We ordered the turkey Reuben that tasted funky on day old potato pancakes. We also ordered Max's famous Reuben, nothing famous about it. Extremely light on the corn beef. Nothing special at all. Will NEVER go back.
