This was one of the famous places I wanted to try for dessert in Phoenix.  The place is a vegan soft serve place with lots of other baked goods.  The soft serve had many interesting flavors, I got the chai tiramisu, since it sounded delicious and a great combo of flavors.  The flavor itself was really good and the price was pretty reasonable considering the quality.  It was 5 dollars for a small cup, but pretty good.  There is a small area for parking in the back!
