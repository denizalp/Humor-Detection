Went here for the lunch buffet, which was only available for a short duration during summer I believe.\n\nIt was not too expensive however there is not much to choose from, only four types of pizza were provided along with a salad bar. The salad bar was very small and only had one dressing, and the only vegetable was Roman lettuce.\n\nThe pizza tasted alright, albeit it boggles me that they put hot-dog sausages in their crust, which were very dry and tasteless.\n\nTheir ice cream machine didn't work :(
