Can someone clean this place?  my god.  Glass, clothing, trash, and beer cans everywhere.  I can only imagine the night life here.  The pants and jean skirt indicate we have the finest of trailer park patrons having a great night out.  The next morning comes the \"hey where is my skirt\" conversation.  And maybe where is my dignity.  \nI love the rocks, trails etc.  but being next to the highway and the car noise kind of lowers the \"nature\" feel...
