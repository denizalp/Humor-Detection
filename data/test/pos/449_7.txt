This store is a a few minutes drive from my house. I do buy groceries here quite often and like the convenience of it! Also, the new click list seems to be catching on too! \n\nIt's a standard grocery store with a pharmacy, deli, sushi, Starbucks, and bank. However, recently remodeled. \n\nI enjoy the rewards program because it helps save me money.The best part- their gas rewards points & FREE Fridays.\n\nFrys has great deals and really good customer service. Employees and management staff are friendly and helpful.
