This place is probably the most popular one to go to right now. They charged girls $20 and guys $30 unless you have local id, then it would be $20 I think. Here, you can find a younger crowd. There's a good mixture with music. This place is gorgeous. The whole Encore is worth walking around. Very nicely decorated.
