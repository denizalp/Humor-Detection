A great place to see a show or just grab a bite to eat and a drink.  I love their Bean Burrito although they have plenty of other great items that is my go to.  I've seen The Melvins, Hanni El Khatib, Naughty By Nature, and Coolio here.  Every night at Crescent is an adventure and sure to please.  Great staff and local ownership make this a great place any night of the week.  1 block from a light rail stop makes it easy to visit.
