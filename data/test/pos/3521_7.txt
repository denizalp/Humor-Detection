Could be the best Ribs in Canada but I haven't had many good ribs in Canada. I find it awkward when I travel back home to Montreal with American friends and Montrealers will start pushing Bar-B-Barn on the them. From My experience Bar-B-Barn can't compare to even a mediocre U.S. Rib. I'm shocked that there are some positve Yank Yelper reviews.\n\nOne thing that really pisses me off about this place is the small serving of fries and sauce that comes with most meals. What a rip.
