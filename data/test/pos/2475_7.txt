Okay, so they removed the $1800 charge.  NOW, they sent me a bill that says that there are $3600 worth of insurance charges pending and that  I owe them $60.00 personally.\n----I haven't been to Mayo in MONTHS.\n\nThe billing department is SERIOUSLY messed up.\n\nIt's really a shame.\n\nFurther Update:  3-29-2012.  I keep getting bills of totally different amounts.  When I pay the bills, I never seem to get credit for paying them.  This is the billing twilight zone.
