One visit suggests this is a strong addition to Montreal's boulangerie scene. The selection isn't vast, but it includes two pretty serious rye breads -- one 100% rye, the other 67%. I tried the latter and have at least one reason to return. Ace baker Julien Roy, formerly of Le pain dans les voiles, is part of the team. There are a few tables, and they also serve coffee. Bonne chance !
