When you dine here, expect to receive a lot of food - you definitely won't go hungry. They serve standard Americanized Chinese fare, and I find the quality of the food to be a tad above most Chinese restaurants of this kind. Service is friendly and prices are good. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you're in the area (Maryvale), this is a good choice if you're hungry and want a lot of decent quality Chinese food.
