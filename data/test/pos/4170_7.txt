Hotel is a scam! They get you at a low rate and keep tying to sell you an upgrade to get what you paid for. Ding you again with a $25 plus tax \"resort\" fee a day. Took 20 Minute's from hotel lobby to our outdated room overlooking busy parking lot. Front desk does not know what customer service is. Rude untrained staff. Do yourself a favor and book another hotel.
