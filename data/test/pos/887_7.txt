I was trying to remember what the name of this bookstore was...Sunnyslope Books...Trading Hands Bookstore....nope, just plain old Books, yes BOOKS. \n\nSimple name, simple store.  This is one of the best used bookstores I have been to in the valley.  Located in the sunnyslope area BOOKS is a good way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.  \n\nThey have a great assortment of classics, fiction, non-fiction, cookbooks, romance, self-help, but my personal favorite is the travel section -  I could spend hours in this one section alone.\n\nIf a lover of books, at a good price, BOOKS is a must.
