Sephora. You complete me. I'm normally on the app, but if I absolutely need something right then and there, I'll come into the store. The staff is beyond awesome and knowledgeable. I thought I knew makeup, but I was nowhere near their level of knowledge. They pretty much have everything you'll ever need!
