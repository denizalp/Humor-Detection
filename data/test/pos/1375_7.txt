I would like to commend the staff of the 3rd floor cardiology wing for their dedicated service and the sensitive care they have afforded my family during my Father's stay here. Our experience with Sherilyn and the nursing staff has been tremendous, and each member has shown genuine warmth and concern for my Dad. They have been very knowledgeable and always available when needed or otherwise. On behalf my family I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you.
