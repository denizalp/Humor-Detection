Poor guy. Was his 21st birthday, the girls pulled him to the stage. I thought he was gonna get shots or a dance or something. They ended up giving him a huge wedgie! Don't come here for your birthday. Girls were bitches. Flicking you off.\nStanding room only, seriously no stools or chairs. Hanging bras look gross. Overall pretty bad.
