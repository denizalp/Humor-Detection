My family and I transferred here after much searching around the east valley.  We could not be happier.  For a 1st year school, they really have their act together.  I credit the fast start to this school to their leadership.  Dr. Croat (the principal) is very accessible and seems to be very experienced in her position.  The staff, teachers and support team are very helpful and knowledgeable.  Everyone seems to really enjoy being here which makes for a very positive campus environment.  Homework loads are demanding yet reasonable.  Great start.... No complaints.
