Mike their service tech came out to my house today. He seemed very knowledgeable about a\/c systems. We went thru all the options and additional ducting needed. I just about agreed with going forward, until he went off on this political rant. I don't need to hear about all the bad refugee's coming to this country. I don't need to hear about him cleaning all his guns because of these refugee's here in AZ. I don't need to hear bad things about Obama. Very unprofessional. I'll be using another company. They just lost $8300.
