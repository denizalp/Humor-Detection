What a beautiful restaurant. I love the recessed ceiling and art. There is a variety of seating, booths, tables & chairs. I am all about healthy and plant based and they have a variety of yummy foods that allows for all pallets. They have a cute little 2 seat bar and yes they serve alcohol. I have nothing negative to say about this establishment. I will definitely return and recommend.
