This Qdoba is walking distance from where I live and I have avoided this place for a very long time because I love Chipotle and I had a feeling that Qdoba sucked. Qdoba does suck. Everything here is bland the rice, beans, and cheese are bland and the guacamole tasted like lemon paste. I will never eat here again.
