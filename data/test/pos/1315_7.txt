Mile end is so much fun. There are tons of stores and restaurants to discover. Talking walks around the area is my favourite thing to do. This is where I used to hang around and eat with my friends back in high school, it's where I discovered tons of stores with quirky and special products, it's where I spent the majority of my time since moving to Montreal! \n\nThere's also a summer festival hosted here and it's top notch!
