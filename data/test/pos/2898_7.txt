What a lovely little zoo!  My 4.5 year old showed me around on my first visit this weekend.  Lots of cute things to do and see...including booth games, exhibits, and photo ops with the kids.  I really liked the time spent here, and recommend comfortable shoes and a hat to protect you from the summer heat.\n\nOne of the most amazing sights was these 4 absolutely HUGE turkeys.  I am just wondering if they will still be around at the end of November!  Gobble, gobble, gobble!
