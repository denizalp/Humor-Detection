Vegetarians don't go here!!! It is seriously disturbing that the menu features a 'vegetarian section' although it's not actually vegetarian. The employee told me all the beans and rice are made with chicken stock. The tortillas are made with lard. If I didn't ask these questions then I would have been incredibly ill. \n\nRio - you cannot falsely advertise that menu items are vegetarian when they are not. You can make people sick. Please change the verbiage on your menu.
