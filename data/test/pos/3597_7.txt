I've got good news and bad news. \n\nGood news: Ginko is a little bit better than a Conde Naste's 2015 Gold Awarded 3-Star Michelin rated Sushi restaurant with a 1-month waiting list in Tokyo Japan. \n\nBad news? I had to spend $230 dollars on dinner in Tokyo to figure that out. \n\n- Jay Zarkovacki
