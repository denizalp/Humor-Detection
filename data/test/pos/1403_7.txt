XS stands for \"XS-ively long lines\".  Then again it was Good Friday, so it was expected.\n\nI didn't like Tryst, so I didn't have much expectations for this place. \n\nIf you're not a die hard partier, you'll find this place an easy 5 star.\n\nBut when you're a global party junkie like me.  It was a-ok.\n\nI coulda sworn I saw one of the Gotti boys there.  With the puckery lips douchey-pose too!
