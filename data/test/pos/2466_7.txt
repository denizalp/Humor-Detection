Michael's No Frills is one of the most interesting No Frills to browse and shop. Thanks for the unique cut of different meat from the independent meat shop at the back of the Supermarket.\n\nSeriously, you will find well packaged exotic cuts: pig nose, tongue, ears, feet, duck everything and more. I still trying to find a good receipt for pig nose or cow penis!\n\nThe only complaints I have probably there is never enough cashiers and there is always a long line at check out. And all these signage about Express.. just a little too much!
