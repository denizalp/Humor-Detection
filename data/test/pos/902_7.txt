This review is only being written because it exists. \n\nIts a great connection between the mess of Eaton Centre and the Bay, all without putting my coat on, or diving into the dirtyness of Queen Street, being bombarded by bums or the hotdog vendor. \nHowever, going this route you don't get to appreciate the lovely window decorations. \n\nBut the thing needs to be updated. The funny circle dotted floors and the fogged up glass windows is so something of 1980. And god forbid you come here on a hot summer's day - it's a sauna in here!\n\nUpdate please!
