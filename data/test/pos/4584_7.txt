King Putt is the best time in Vegas! The mini golf course is creative, innovative, and a fun time for all ages. Laser tag becomes addictive, you won't want to stop. The staff was very nice and helped with whatever we needed and made delicious food (pizza and homemade ice cream sandwiches!). I can't wait to go back again! I wouldn't go anywhere else for mini golf\/laser tag, shooooottt.
