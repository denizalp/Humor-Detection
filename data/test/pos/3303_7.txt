Placed a $531 order the 11th. Started to worry as no shipping notification. No email nothing. Called and they stated I somehow checked a box that I will be providing my own shipping provider?!?!  WHAT!?!?  Cancelled my order and actually found a better deal elsewhere. So pissed off and they lost a customer. I know part of this is on me but come on send a notification of some sort. Hopefully my refund will be swift
