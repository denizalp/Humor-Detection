Stop #3 one recent morning exploring spots in Henderson was Sweet Ruby's new location and it's still chock full of sweetness. Cookies, candies, krispy treats, cake pops, candied apples-something to satisfy your sweet tooth and make your dentist groan. I exercised a bit of self-control and left with a snickerdoodle for me and a red velvet crinkle cookie for the teen. Check out the new location for your treats, too. Sweet!
