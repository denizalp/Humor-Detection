I don't know about that Scott character.\n\nBut overall I find this store to be well stocked, and the staff kind and courteous.\n\nI greatly appreciate the wide selection of high end dog purses and utlra stylish lawn kitsch. And I especially enjoy the soothing jams of bands like New Edition while I purchase my daily supply of condoms and scrunchies.
