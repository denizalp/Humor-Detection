I overuse the term food boner, but unghhhhhhh, food boner.\n\nI got the mixed BBQ plate; it was real teriyaki steak and teriyaki chicken. I picked up 2 20 oz diet pepsis, and my total was $14. Yum. Cheap AND delicious!\n\nOhana BBQ is down the street. I love Ohana, but Island Flavor was better quality. It's also closer to my house, so I think I might be sad to admit that Ohana might not be getting as much of my business anymore!\n\nDefinitely recommend going here for food. Portions are enormous; 1 dinner is actually 3 dinners.
