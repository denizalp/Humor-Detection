This place is my new favorite kbbq spot! Everything was amazing! We waited about 30 minutes for a table, but it was well worth it. The service was great, Luke took really good care of us and so did the rest of the crew. The pork belly and brisket were the best. Appetizers are included in the AYCE, I recommend the agedashi tofu and the crispy squid legs. And they have spicy tofu soup!!! I will definitely be coming back!
