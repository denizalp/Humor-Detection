I like this grocery store ONLY because it carries fine (French) foods that I can't locate even in Whole Foods.\n\nI'd say their prepared foods, sushi and the like are crap (mayo in sushi is an abomination to me), but their baguettes tend to taste pretty fresh, and they have an excellent range of vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe produce is not as fantastic as the grocery store \"Harvest Wagon\" by Summerhill station, but it's decent, although Whole Foods might be a better bet for this.
