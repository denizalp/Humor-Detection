Where did the movie theater go?  I want a dark auditorium so I can watch the movie.  I don't want to hear people smacking down pizza and talking like they're at home on their couch.  Do we need to turn movie theaters in to restaurants?  I don't think so.  I don't want waitresses walking around and semi dark auditoriums....I'm there to watch a movie, notndine out.  That usually happens before or after the movie, not during it!\n\nNot going back
