I don't come here often enough.  I usually have lunch with a couple of girlfriends so we can catch up about what is going on in our lives.  I love the beet and goat cheese salad.  I usually ask for grilled salmon on top of it and it makes it a great meal.  The salad is very generous, last time I skipped the protein.  It was also great to see the Bonnie is working there, she is so awesome and welcoming.
