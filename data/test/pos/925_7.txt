We came out here to eat lunch since it was such a nice day. We brought some food from 8 Noodle Bar and our waitress didn't mind which was thoughtful of her. I just got their virgin strawberry mojito. It was good, it was just hard to drink, the big clumps of strawberries would block off the straw. They need the mince the strawberries smaller. I also tried some of the quesadilla that my Aunt ordered. It was really rich, heavy and kinda oily. So overall just an ok place.
