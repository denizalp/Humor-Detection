I like the St Denis version of this place ok, and I certainly like the location on Peel and the charming gents who took me there, and the staff was friendly and without fault, and in general, you know, a-ok. But I ordered a salad and it was a pile of soggy blackened mesculn and that.. I frankly can't abide. It was clearly prepped hours before, and tasted tasted like poison, and if I never see box salad mesculn again it'll be too soon. And I guess. That's The End.
