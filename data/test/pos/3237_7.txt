I d heard good things about this place few years back but never had the chance to try it . So being down the road took the opportunity to do so . We ordered the chimichangas  . the food came really fast . The tortilla  was crispy one layer only witch kinda ruined the whole dish . 28 dollars the total ' What a joke . sad to say but its true. ive had better at hilabertos
