Doug is responsible for accumulating my rental properties in Arizona. I will be collecting from these investments for many years to come...\nI find Doug to be a true partner in these investments and is reachable at all times for advice on them. \nHis Red Brick affiliate manages the properties for me and many of my friends and that's huge for me since I live in NY and only get out to Arizona once or twice a year.\nI highly recommend Doug and his associated to get me rolling for my retirement years!!!
