Though there was quite a crowd lining up for their coffee and treats on the morning I visited Big Dog, the staff was able to be friendly and fast and efficient all at once, making for a great experience. It was a bit of a pain to have to hover while we waited for tables to free up, but once we were seated I very much enjoyed my pot of tea and my oatmeal from the custom oatmeal bar. Seriously, the oatmeal bar is completely genius and I'm not sure why more coffee shops don't offer it!
