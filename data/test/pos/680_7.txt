This is a new fashion district where they sell high end clothing, have various restaurants, and of course that huge High Roller ferris wheel. Day tickets were $19.95. Night tickets go up in price is all I will say. I just wanted a pic of the High Roller and had no interest in riding it. Maybe one day.  But not on this day. This is built right next to the Flamingo and is across the street from Cesars Palace (who I think owns the property). Definitely a Vegas spot to visit.
