Holy crap I hate vegas and clubbing.  Put them together and I am in hell.  Fat people don't club.  We just eat club sandwiches.  This place was freaking amazing!  Cover was $50 which is the most I have ever paid to get into a club without getting a steak.  Freakin insane.  All of the asians and their moms from LA pretty much drove 4 hours to meet here. The venue is freaking awesome.  Some fatties paid $100 during labor day weekend.  SuckAZ!  This is probably one of the best clubs I have ever been too.  It was that good.
