Typical dive bar beer selection. One of the few smoking allowed bars in the area. Known for the fish but the pizza dough is made daily by the owner and is pretty good. Great bar if you're looking for a cheap place to get a drink. \n\nThe family dining room in the back has 2 perks, the homemade soups and amazing Sunday morning breakfast. Place hasn't been updated for at least 10 years but neither have the prices. \nThe usual waitress is miserable to be around. Complains about her life to customers a lot. \n\nAll in all decent.
