Unhappy! Went to get juice after yoga and it was a disaster. Person making two of the same juices at once made 1.5 cups worth and never stirred so first person got top half of juice and I got second. When they went to refill mine, machine was \"broken\" so I paid $8 for half a smoothie. Offered to take two dollars off but when they realized they already rang me up, they just stared at me until I left. Terrible customer service this early in the game. Will not being going back if I can help it.
