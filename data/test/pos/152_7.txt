I love neighborhood parks with character. This park fits the bill perfectly. It has tennis courts, grass, open space, dogs, people, dirt, trees and water. What more could you want? (Oh! If you are lucky you'll find some stray tennis balls hiding in the trees!)\nEnjoy this little park. You can't miss it as it is right on Indian School Road.\nBring your dog or pet gerbil here for some outdoor fun, sit for a while and enjoy the ambience.
