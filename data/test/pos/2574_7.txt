Grabbed a quick take out dinner here last weekend. We were in and out in about 15 minutes. I ordered the chicken burrito enchilada style with pico, black beans and cilantro lime rice. The flavors were consistent and the burrito filling. My sister ordered the steak salad. It's her go to and she also enjoyed her food. This is the closest Cafe Rio to my sisters home and we love to grab a bite here when I'm in Vegas.
