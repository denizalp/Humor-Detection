Just a bunch of bros passionate about beer and the local Phoenix area that got together and started a cool brewery downtown. I met up with a few friends here and we had a great time. The atmosphere is awesome and the crowd is super laid back. These guys can make some really good beer and take inspiration from many places on their brewing process. I got the Jomax Oatmeal Stout and it was delicious. I look forward to stopping in again.
