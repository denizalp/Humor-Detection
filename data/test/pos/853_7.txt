I have now been to Ground Control twice including today, the pizza was very good but the customer service has been horrible both times. The initial greeting you receive when you walk in is non-existent, then without a hello we are told to sit where ever we want, considering 95% of the tables had a reserve sign on them they should have just sat us. Then the server, we will not consider him Mr. Personality.
