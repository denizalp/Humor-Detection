I believe this is a stripper bar. My friends and I (two males) did not know that. We thought it was just a bar. So, we walked in. We wondered why we were getting so many stares, then, as I opened the door and spotted a woman swinging around a pole, we understood. All three of us ran to the car. Please don't think they are wimps; it is just they were not expecting dancers and were with me. It was horrifying. No wonder the men were eyeing me in the parking lot.
