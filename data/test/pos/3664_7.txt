Holy hell!!! Food so good you want to close your eyes when you eat it so nothing else distracts you!!! Fabulous, friendly service & reasonably priced!! I am Greek & food is somewhat similar; the lamb falls off the bone! Beautiful rich desserts & BYOB wine & beer, you just pay a small bottle fee!!\n\nHummus is rich & smooth. I will be back again and again!!!
