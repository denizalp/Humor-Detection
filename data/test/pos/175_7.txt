I came to visit because of the high ratings, but left disappointed. The sushi was eh - it lacked any good flavor and really dry. I had the dynamite roll, the langostino roll and the shrimp tempura roll. Honestly, all rolls tasted the same. I also ordered a seaweed salad and that was the best part of my meal. The ambiance and atmosphere I really liked though.
