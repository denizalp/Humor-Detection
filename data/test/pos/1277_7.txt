One word...Nasty. I just recently moved to the university area and I was craving a Philly cheesesteak. I tried this place and I was highly disappointed. Only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because the pasta salad was great. The sandwich however was terrible. Hard bread, barely enough cheese to cover the meat, and the meat was dry and hard. I asked for mayo on the sandwich and I don't even think it was on there. When I got home I added more cheese, and A1 sauce just to make it edible. I won't go back.
