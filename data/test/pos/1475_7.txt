Visited about a dozen times. \n\"If\" you like rude and arrogant staff and paying for procedures that don't work or need to be re-done, then this is the place for you!!  \n\nOh, and BTW, \"if\" you would further like to be dismissed as a client by the spa because you do not like being treated this way, you must go and experience this amazing treatment for yourself - it's so unique and makes you feel very special.  \n\nI will chose 1 of the 40 other awesome Med Spas that are w\/n 10 miles of me :-)
