We had to get a small print job done and decided to check the prices here. Our salesperson did a wonderful job cutting down the price as best as she could considering the size of the order (100 copies), and they had it printed within the hour on nice quality paper.\n\nFriendly, efficient service.\n\nI would definitely return here again for any printing needs.
