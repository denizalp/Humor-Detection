This place is half-decent. I do agree with the other reviews.. The fries are soggy and greasy. The fish isn't bad.. Some days they're amazing, others not so much. If you're around the area and only have $5 bucks in your pocket.. It'll get you the Alaskan strips and chips.. Not for a cheap bite. \n\nAll in all.. It's definitely not the best fish and chips restaurant in Toronto and it's definitely not the worse
