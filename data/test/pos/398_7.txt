The store is very small & limited pottery selection. I wanted a basic soup bowl\/oversized mug...none available! Janet says she pours items every day but pottery is marked made in china? Paints were very dry & crumbled as I painted my layers, which hadn't happen at other pottery places. I hope my piece glazes well...I'll see in a few days. I'm not likely to return.
