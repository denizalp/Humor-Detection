We were there for the first time today. It was awesome. Bouncy World was about 10 minutes away from our home in Green Valley. We were greeted by cool staffs. The place was clean, prive was reasonable & if you're hungry, they have a snack corner\/little cafe there. My 3 year old son enjoyed the bounce houses. And not forgetting My Mum & I. Lol!
