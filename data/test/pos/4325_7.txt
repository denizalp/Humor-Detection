Altered Ego obviously has an altered sense of the word \"APPOINTMENT\". When I arrived five minutes early for my appointment, the receptionist said that Cody had accepted a walk-in just before I got there so \"have a seat or go next door for a coffee.\" Eh? I went next door, had a coffee, then decided I had better things to do then wait for the MAESTRO COIFFURE. \n\nFifty minutes after my original appointment time Cody texted me and said he was ready. For what maestro? Another walk-in?
