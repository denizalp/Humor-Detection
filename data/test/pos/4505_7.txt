This is a perfect place for lazy parents. I am a regular at a lot of different kid places. When my boys wanted to try Bounce World I was excited to bring them. They wanted me to pay full price to play with my kids which I think is steep. I have a 4 year old and essentially just chase after him the whole time. So to pay $12 each is to much. Especially because this place is pretty small. I will take Bounce U any day!!
