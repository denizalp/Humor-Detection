Took my date here, and we really enjoyed the meal. \nHe had curry chicken, and I ordered the chicken masala. Both dishes were delicious and full of flavor and spices. \n\nThere was enough gravy to dip our Naan into it, and in the end, we both were happy for taking the chance of eating at this place. No wonder there's always a line-up. 5 stars for sure. \n\nWill venture back again soon!
