Their special sandwich is simplest sandwich ever and SO good: a roll with bologna, salami, cheese (swiss or cheddar) with mustard on a flat, grilled roll.\n\nI never even loved mustard until I tried it on this sandwich. It really adds so much to the sandwich. \n\nLine moved quick, sandwiches were cheap, AND I was pretty full.\n\nThe sandwich will make you feel nostalgic, and so will the d√©cor. Full of old school CDs and books.
