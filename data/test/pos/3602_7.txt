Eye Candy!!!! Beefcakes walking around serving the beef!!!! This is now the only way I want my beef served. -lol while in Vegas, my friend and I took in a show and stopped by this place to eat. The food was delicious, the service was great! \n\nOnly complaint....My friend ordered the all meat package and couldn't get anyone to come over with anything other than steak.... Steak was what I ordered so I was ok. Deliciousness at its best!The prices were good, even the salad bar and buffet style sides were good. Check them out!
