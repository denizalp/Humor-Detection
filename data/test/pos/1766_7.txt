Popped in for a post-game beer (the Hornets won!) and to wait while the Lynx carried away most of the fans. No food this evening, just two cold ones at the bar. Lots of beer choices including a good few locals such as Olde Mecklenburg Brewery.\n\nBartender was good, seats were comfortable, there was little wait. All good.
