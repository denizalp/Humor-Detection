Website exaggerates the atmosphere and location. The website video makes this sound like it will be a special dining experience and itjust isn't.. \n\nFood was somewhat bland and average. Not a great value ($75 for two) and the owner who was bright and cheery in the website video was anything but... Maybe she was having a bad day.\n\nGo to Scottsdale.\n\nPS The website also gives the impression that the restaurant has a waterfront view of the fountain, but the fountain is actually a few blocks away. :-(
