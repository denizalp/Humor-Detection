We recently employed Five Star Moving for a move in Fresno.  The three Five Star guys took very good care of us.  All of our furniture arrived in perfect condition.  Among other insanely heavy items, the piano was carefully padded and securely lashed within the truck.  It, too, arrived without so much as a scratch on it.  The movers were fast and efficient.  We have used Five Star for two moves and we'll be using them again for another (hopefully final) move next year.\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.
