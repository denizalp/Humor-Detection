I've been going to Pizza M from back when Matt was still baking pizzas one night a week out of Mirabelle's kitchen. I admit the pizza isn't bad. Sadly I cannot continue to support a business that has such egregiously rude employees (see the other reviews below that corroborate my point). I strongly urge you not to give this place your money - downtown Urbana absolutely deserves better.
