I have only been to this place for Sunday brunch \nThe first time I had an amazing lobster egg Benedict \nThat wasss mesmerizing\nI went back this year and they had changed the menu obviously \nI had the foie gras torchon with a figue jam\nYou can never go wrong with that \nSalmon gravlax and proscuitto egg Benedicts \nThe highlight for me was the caramel budino which is like 2 little donuts in a bed of praline cream \n\nCons:The portions are small \nPros: great service and beautiful setting
