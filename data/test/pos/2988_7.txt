I like this place, I have been coming here since the twins were about 18 months old.  I am glad I don't have to climb with them anymore, though.  Not a fan of all the twirling and tumbling around.  Yeah, not looking forward to roller coaster in the future, but I digress.  What I like the most is when we have birthday parties here, since it is just the friends, I can relax and chat with my mom friends while they climb, slide and tumble around.  Parties are short and sweet, just the way I like them.
