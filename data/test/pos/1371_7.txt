3* for average deli style food and negative 5* for the nasty service at the take out counter.  A simple question had to go around in circles of rapidly aggravating communication - my question - do you have a fucking side of coleslaw and if so, how fucking much is it? \n\nOver that, I just about leaped across the counter and strangled the snotty little shit giving me attitude over a simple question that he seemed incapable of either understanding or answering. I don't need the aggravation over borderline mediocre food.
