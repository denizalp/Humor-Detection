i've gotten lunch here a few times and it's pretty much Meh,. yea the bbq is pretty good. most are. there are really good sauces, and there are some that are so vile that i would make any body vomit.\nHoney Bear's sauce is in the middle it's good, but not great. the meats are pretty good. but nothing to write home about, or anything that will win national awards on teh  BBQ meats circuit. if you forced to eat in a 1 mile drive from work, this place will do fine. if your coming from far away...just stay away.
