Went 4th of July weekend.  Yeah it's changed a lot in the past few years NOT for the better. The drinks were fine the beach and facilities were nice but wow the crowd is urban!  The third time being hollered at by a large ghetto group from Chicago we decided to leave.  Didn't feel safe.  Not my scene.  We enjoyed Morrea at Mandalay better.
