It was my first time here, it was such a live spot; full of both grocery and hungry customers. The main floor was basically a flea market, and I say flea market with the utmost respect. People selling meat, diary, wheat, fruit products. It's like having a Price Choppers, or Longos if you're in the Woodbridge area, all in one spot. \nThe downstairs is where the fun begins. Food varying from seafood, chinese, italian, Ukranian food, sushi...the whole nine yards. \nI'll definitely explore more during my breaks. Cheers
