Arrived with a friend at 4 pm. Perfect, not busy seated on patio, greeted by waiter.  Ordered the onion rings as appetizer and they were good. Burgers next. I ordered mine rare, it came medium well. When you have a burger joint, I am the only customer, you charge $10 for a burger and you can't get it right, three stars is my max.
