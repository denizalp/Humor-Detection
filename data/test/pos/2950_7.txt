After dealing with costco this place is like a punishment. Best buy used to be the place to go now its a dinosaur waiting to be executed. No help on the floor,difficult returns and refunds. Unwillingness to compete with costco on not only price but return policy. I felt like i was standing in an electronics morgue.UHHHH...someone please take my money. Just another behemoth past its prime (macys). if this place was a patient in the ICU i would euthanize it.
