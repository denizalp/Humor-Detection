Yea yea yea Tram's is great tra la la but the pho here is better! The broth, noodles, and beef are all tastier. And their other noodle dishes have always been delicious. My first choice for Vietnamese food in Pittsburgh\n\n\nAnd everyone knows the main reason you go to Tram's is to see the  one-armed dude.
