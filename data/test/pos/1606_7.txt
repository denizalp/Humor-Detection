Had an appointment set this morning for 11:30 to look at a listing and got stood up with Zero calls Zero notice. I own an environmental consulting firm rescheduled jobs to be here at this time. \n\nVery unprofessional organization and I work with most property management companies in the valley.  Guess I'll wait a bit more with my kid in the back until someone reaches out to us. \n\nWhen you make an appointment with someone learn to keep it
