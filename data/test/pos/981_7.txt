Good luck finding this place if you search online. \nHole in a wall kinda place. Just like one review, it is a secret kebab club. No menus anywhere. Just come in, order your dead grilled animal (either chicken &\/or beef) with rice combo and work your way on to the cashier. Wait for your cooked animals and enjoy. Food is fresh and it tastes great.
