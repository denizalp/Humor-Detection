Mac's doesn't even sell Mac's make up. False advertising!\n\nReally great bookstore and long live the independent bookstore in general. I'm a big fan. However, considering the prices on some of these books, and the fact that their selection seems large but is often somewhat limited, I think it averages out to 4 stars. Still, a really great part of Cleveland Heights\/Coventry.
