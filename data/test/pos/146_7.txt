I actually haven't had a recent issue with First Service.  These last couple months have just confirmed that they pick and choose violations, in my opinion, or make them up as they go along because the same landscape violation I was cited for in 2014 is apparently no longer a violation as palm stalks are all over my development in addition to all over Summerlin as they also were in 2014 and 2015, and I don't see any gardeners cutting them down.
