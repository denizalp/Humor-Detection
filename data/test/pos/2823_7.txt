Good place. Started with the calamari. Very tasty. My friend had a salad which she liked. Next I had the shrimp pasta. Also very good and the perfect portion. My boyfriend and friend each had chicken dishes which they scarfed down quickly. Both of them said they were delicious. We finished with a cannoli. Very good as well. The house cocktails are good and strong. We enjoyed ourselves. We will definitely return to try the pizza.
