I get my hair cut here every 3 weeks, the service is impeccable, the styling is unparalleled. You need an appointment for an in demand place like this but its worth it. I come here every 3 weeks and although it is not inexpensive, you get what you pay for. They have accommodating hours and amazing talent. I used to get a buzz cut at other places since I have short hair but Sunil does it all by scissors, amazing!
