Carol, who has been \"serving us since 1994\", was not in a happy serving mood today during checkout. I think I interrupted her downtime because she never greeted me and didn't say one word to me during checkout.  Very negative attitude. This is supposed to be a \"happy\" Fry's. Today's experience did not meet those expectations.
