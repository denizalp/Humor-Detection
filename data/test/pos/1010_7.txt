While Harkins is my favorite movie theater chains . I like coming to this theater because they have the Cine-Capri.  Cine-Capri is one of the biggest movie screens in Phoenix.  \n  \nIt is always fun waiting a new movie at Harkins.  Most of the time I come here with my family.   The popcorn here is great and I always being my Harkins cup to get a refill for $1.50.  :)
