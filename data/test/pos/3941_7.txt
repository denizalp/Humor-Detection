Morning coffee? Go to this Starbucks located on Flamingo at Bally's between the North and South Tower. This is not a hotel-operated Starbucks which means you'll pay actual Starbucks prices, not some made-up fantasy ones (I remember paying $6 for a grande filter coffee over at the Linq). \n\nInteresting seating arrangement inside, and there's usually enough people working so that the line moves fast.
