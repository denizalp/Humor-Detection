Worst pilot that ever flew a plane, flew my plane today. Horrible. Sucks at flying. I think it was his first time flying. He showed up late and when he we were landing he had to turn around 2 times cuz he sucks at landing and can't get it right the first time. If you want good quality don't fly with these guys
