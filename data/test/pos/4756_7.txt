I have serious cravings for AYCE sushi at this place all the time. Spicy seafood salad if you love sashimi and the wet dream roll... *drools* i don't think I've ever left this place without feeling so stuffed that I cannot move anymore. Everything is so daymnnnn good! Ive never had any roll that wasn't sooo super yummy! I want to try all the AYCE sushi place there is but since eating here it's just hard to. I swear one day i might just go there alone just to satisfy myself. #fatgirlproblems
