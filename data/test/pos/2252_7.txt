This was my 2nd visit here. The 1st visit was just ok. Nothing spectacular and I didn't care for my food. The 2nd visit was definitely more entertaining and my food tasted better too! We all got single burgers & a few fries. My friend & I had drinks. Her wine came in an IV machine! Super funny. The staff was fun & friendly too. If you're in Vegas w\/friends or family I'd definitely put them on the to do list.
