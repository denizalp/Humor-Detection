This is my hang when I'm looking for a spot that's not too noisy and I want to catch up with some friends.  NoDa beer on tap (as well as some regional bottled beer) and some decent bottles of wine, all at good prices.  \n\nThe best night to come hang out is definitely Tuesday.  Dana is probably one of the coolest bartenders in town and the dj spins some pretty good tunes (though he has a long list of \"no plays\" that include Journey, Creed and a host of other really shitty bands).
