Everything they have is from GFS or Sam's Club but they will claim that it's homemade.\nThe gyro \/corned beef flavors are very limited to the Cajun sauce,Hot Sauce and BBQ. They will over charge on everything and screw you over on the lunch fries special and free side if you don't ask for it.\nJust make sure if you do happen to get something delivered from here that you tip the driver decent because they only give the drivers 1.50$ per delivery ( no hourly wage).
