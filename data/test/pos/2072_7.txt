When we went to pay we wanted to split the check 50\/50... They put EVERYTHING on my card and LOST my boyfriends card somewhere behind the bar!!!! We had to leave our table to go behind the bar to get it back! There was 5+ employees trying to find his credit card!!! Absolutely the worst restaurant I've ever been to!
