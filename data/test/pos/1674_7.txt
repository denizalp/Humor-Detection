I don't know why people like Red Robin. First off, the service was bad. Asking for water, more fries, or to even order was like pulling teeth.\n\nThe food isn't all that great. I got a cobb salad and they forgot some of the ingredients in it when it was presented to me.\n\nSo I guess none of it was good. I'll just stop here.
