It's a grocery store with valet parking in one of Toronto's most expensive neighborhoods. Do I need to write more? Lots of old rich old folks around, buying fancy, overpriced food. \n\nThat said, the coffee is good (just stay away from the $5 little muffin if you can help it). Also, some things, like pop, are cheaper than buying them at other nearby stores. (You'll find the pop cooler right next to the exclusive $200 caviar jars from Russia).
