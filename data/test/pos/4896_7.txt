Worst sushi bar ever.   Small little tiny bowl of seaweed salad for $6.    Hamachi jalapeño was horrendous.  Very thin little slices of yellowtail rolled up and topped with an awful ginger dressing. Not the hamachi jalapeño with traditional ponzu.    As I am writing this my sashimi just showed up and it looks like it has potential to be decent.   Nope.  Looks are deceiving the tuna is cut way to big, is mushy and has no taste.  The salmon has bad texture and tastes like it was previously frozen.    How do places get away with being so bad.
