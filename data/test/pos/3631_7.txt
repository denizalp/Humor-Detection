I LOVE THIS FUCKING PLACE.\n\nSo cheap, so fast and so yummy yum yum!\n\nAll of their prices are obviously there for students, they serve it quickly and it's cheap too! Friendly staff even though you can EASILY TELL English\/French is not their main language.\n\n3.50$ for a poutine man! And they ACTUALLY melt the cheese so I'm not stuck with random bits of cold cheese curds.\n\nRemoved a point because most do not wear hair nets aaaaaaand their arms are kind of hairy. I found a hair twice in my poutine :(.
