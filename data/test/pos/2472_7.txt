Love this place and so love the staff. They are eager to please and take customer service seriously. Wayne and Lona always take good care of us when we go. The shop is very beautiful, clean and can accommodate over 15 pedicures at a time. Would be great for a party. It is my #1 nail salon.  Thanks Wayne for the perfect prom nails for my daughter.
