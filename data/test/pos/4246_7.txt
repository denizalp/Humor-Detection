Waited forever to just have my order taken (15mins). They kept sitting people but others guests but NO ONE WAS TAKING ORDERS! Meanwhile the sushi chefs were just standing by waiting to work watching the room fill up with no orders! Maybe our girl was just slow because the other waitress was on top of it.....\nHORRIBLE SERVICE DON'T BOTHER EATING HERE....
