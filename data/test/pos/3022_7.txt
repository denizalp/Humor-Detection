This is really the only reason I venture to the Mills mall.  The home furnishings, the handbags, the jewelry, the clothes, oh my!  I came here recently in search of a cocktail dress and although I couldn't find anything I liked, they were having a 35% off sale so I scored some Father's Day loot.  I can always find something great here.  One star off for always looking dirty and disheveled - I know you're a Last Call at the Mills but you're still a Neiman Marcus.
