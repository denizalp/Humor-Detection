The food was....okay.  The service was....okay.  What was not okay was showing up with a friend wearing a sleeveless $300 shirt and told he couldn't come in to the hookah lounge because of their \"dress code\" and watching some bimbo walk in with sandals, cut off shorts, a tank top and no bra.\n\nThis is NOT an upscale place - they're in a strip mall - and they should be pleased to greet any guest walking through the door.
