I've always had good food here. Great burritos, cheese crisps, and churros! I wish I had a cheese crisp and a churro right now.\n\nExcellent basic Mexican fast food. Not great for a date, but great to fill you up with yummy any day of the week.\n\nThis is officially my most boring review ever. I am too tired to be witty or interesting, but don't let that keep you from grubbing on this deliciousness.\n\nBuenos noches.....
