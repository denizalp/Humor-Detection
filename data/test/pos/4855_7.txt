I wanted so bad for this to be amazing. It was about 35 minutes before closing and we were taking our stuff to go. Despite this they were still annoyed we were there. The ice cream was beyond old and freezer burned. It wasn't even edible and the boys ended up trashing it. The cupcake had hard frosting that had to be old as well. The cake part of it was fine but the frosting was not. It was very expensive for us to not even want to eat it and we probably will not be back.
