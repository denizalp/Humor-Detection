I think TIM C sent me here to die when he recommended I eat here on my brief stop in Pittsburgh.  I think I got some chest pain eating that sandwich---not the kind from love, the kind from MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.  \n\nDefinitely a heavy sandwich.  Heavy on the fries.  Heavy on the thick WHITE bread (us health nuts like wheat\/whole grain).  I lost the tomato in all the slaw.  Thumbs up for the slaw.  It was not a pretty sandwich and you will definitely not look pretty eating it BUT---worth a try.
