Second time coming here! (First time I was blacked out.. so didn't write a review \/ remember what i ate..) \n\nBut second time, food was amazing (consistent from what i vaguely remember) but the prices are steep! expect to spend at least 20+ a person for good food! I would still give this place four stars just because for the prime location and good quality of food I almost expect it to cost more. \n\nI recommend the egg frittata or the filet mignon sliders.. both are impeccable.
