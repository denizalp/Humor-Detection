A very nice vegetarian and vegan restaurant, although they do include some meat protein options. Great indoor and outdoor seating.  Very modern interior and a nice menu to choose from.  They have a very limited drink menu but does have wine and beer.  The service is a little slow, but maybe because they are new and still trying to figure things out.  I would certainly recommend them and will continue to frequent this place.
