I would rather stab my eye with a dull piece of fortune cookie than to revisit this greasy, smoky chinese restaurant in sin city.  It's a sin to charge $15.00 for pan fried noodles anywhere, especially if the server never returns to fill up your water.\n\nPlus you need a reservation for this nasty hole.\n\nSkip it, you'll thank your intestines.
