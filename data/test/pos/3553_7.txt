I'm really not a big fan of pepperoni pizza, but Bitondo's slices are a winner.  I quite like the tomato sauce.  Nice big slices (practically 2 slices in one) and cheap at a tax-in $2.75.  It's a 5 minute (or less) walk for me and I think I've been 3 times in the past 2 weeks.\n\nDespite the other reviewers' praise, for now I'll pass on the panzerotto.  Have you ever seen a MODEL of a pound of fat?... well, that's pretty much what it reminds me of, anyway ... *shudder*
