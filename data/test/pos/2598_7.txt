What happened to this place?  \n\nThey used to be so good, there were always nice and friendly baristas, the food was very simple, yet still very good.  But went in last time and I like to order the Veggie Hummus sandwich, but they forgot the cucumber and my bread stale and dry.  The sandwich was not worth my 7 bucks at all.  \n\nVery disappointed Fair Trade.
