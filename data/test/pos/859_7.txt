Salad late at night-\nNo greasy slop for bedtime.\nLight and refreshing. \n\nOkay, so my Haiku skills suck, so next time I'll figure out a creative rap that can take those youtube suckas to the cleaners. \n\nIn seriousness, a salad (Pecan Apple Chicken Salad) and a small frosty hits the spot  at 1am. \n\nSometimes grease shouldn't be king of the night, but something a bit lighter and easy on the stomach so I can go to bed.
