The whole wheat dough was delicious. Had the Roma pizza. The Pancetta was salty, the organic brown eggs are a great addition and just the overall taste was a pleasant surprise. Came out much faster than other wood fire places. \nThey also have gelato and sorbet with some rotating flavors. Lots of flavor and smooth. Check this place out it just opened but the word is getting out. \nThey also have pinch cards and an app for free pizza :)
