This place was our last minute hotel. We made reservations at the MGM but stuff happened. Anyway, this place is worth the cheap price. But you get what you pay for. \n\nPros:\n* Hotel has a decent food court and Dicks last Resort is here \n* Hotel location is on the strip\n* Hotel directly connects to Mandalay Bay\n* Hotel has friendly staff\n\nCons:\n* Air conditioner in the room sucks\n* Non smoking room smells like smoke\n* Appliances in hotel room doesn't work\n* Terrible parking structure\n* Kids everywhere\n* Small casino area\n* Packed pools\n\nOverall I enjoyed my stay for the price
