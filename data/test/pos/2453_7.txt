Delicious on every level.  Finally had a chance to come here and it was so worth it for a quick lunch bite.  \n\nLoved everything about it.   As soon I walked in I was greeted by the cashier and the Guy making the dogs (maybe the owner).  Very friendly and eager to answer questions.   He gave me a breakdown of the different Dogs and off I went like a kid in a candy store. \n\nDecided on the Nordic Dog. And wow.  I'm a fan!!!! Get it and thank me later.   \n\nCan't wait to be back.
