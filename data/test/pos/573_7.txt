What an enjoyable ramen bar. I always come just for their crispy shrimp balls but of course, their ramen is good too. \nThe interior is great and since I come in at night, it has dim lighting. They don't close until 3 AM which is even better!\nService is always excellent and our drinks are always filled. \nIt does get busy around midnight so prepare to be on a wait list. I went there recently and the music selections have improved  :-)
