Compete scam. 1k for nonsense and run arounds, and then they NEVER STOP BILLING YOU. Good luck wrestling with that. \nNot to mention where the hell did they get your child name and your address. Someone slid them our info. They are not affiliated with your child's school. They didn't even get the grade right for my son, so they're just guessing the grade based on age, so they have your kids name, date of birth, and address. That's some shady stuff right there.\n\nTake the letter and use it to line a bird cage. That's all its good for.
