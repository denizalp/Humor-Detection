The beer is $4.00 a pint for Blue Moon. The BBQ Chicken was minced (mushy) and just barely warm. The BBQ sauce had more flavor and was cold. The sweet potato fries were almost burnt on the outside and mush on the inside. Flavorless. \nThe Build You Own burger was greasy and they charged for a slice of Swiss cheese. I thought build your own would include one slice of cheese.\n\nI may go back but I will not order the chicken sandwich.
