This review is purely for the company policy enforcement of their operational hours.\n\nWe wanted to go to the Rhumbar for cocktails, which stated they were open until midnight. However, by the time we strolled around to it by 11:30 pm, they had a sign for closed to entry even though there were still patrons in the lounge.\n\nI understand there are slow seasons even in Vegas, however if you post certain hours of operation, you should operate in those stated times.
