I used to hold Target in such high esteem.  This was the family member that could do no wrong unlike it's dirty cousin (you know who I am talking about).  Recently, I have found my shopping experience at Target to less than pleasurable.  This was especially noticed during the check out process.  Many an open lane but not enough staff to go around.  I would think this would be the emphasis....the quicker people pay without having to wait the more likely they are to return.  Three stars based on an average of fond memories.
