Great food! Great prices! Not in the best location but don't let this stop you from trying this place! Ordered the beef pad Thai, veggie egg rolls, Thai iced tea, and deep fried rice with shrimp. Everything was beautifully prepared and the portions were more than enough for two people. The place was empty when we originally showed up at 1130am, but quickly filled up as we neared 12pm.\n\nPros:\nPiping hot food\nSuper tasty\nFriendly and attentive waitress\n\nCon's:\nNADA\n\nTRY THE STCKY RICE WITH MANGO LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. :-)
