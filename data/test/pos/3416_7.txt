Food Express Chinese Restaurant is truly a hidden secret. The food taste really good and the price are well worth it. I found this restaurant by looking it up on Yelp. The ratings where good so I decided to give it a chance. The portions sizes are good and the if you are in the mood for fresh fish they have fish tanks' with live fish swimming around. Just point to the one you want to eat and in a few minutes you get fresh fish.
