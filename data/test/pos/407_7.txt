Not very professional. It wants to be fine dining but the staff lacks training an the menu options are less than impressive. When I walked in there was no one greeting so me and another group stood around for a while not knowing what to do. The host then showed up and after a time of her not knowing why she was at work and why I was there I literally had to say \"I'm here to eat food\" before she clued in to seat me. Nice building. As a business, needs improvement.
