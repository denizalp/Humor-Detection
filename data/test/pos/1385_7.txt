I usually don't write reviews but a place like this calls for one. I recently just moved here from LA and this has got to be the single greatest, and most evil discovery I have made yet! I ordered the Spaghetti Mostaccioli pasta and a side of meatballs and I literally just had a taste-gasm. To make matters even worse, THEY DELIVER! So thank you Rosati's in advance for the 10 pounds I will probably put on in the future. Sincerely, a future Rosati's addicted couch potato.
