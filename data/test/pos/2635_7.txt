I haven't been to Freemont Street in years.  The mister and I decided to have a date night checking out the sights.  I had wanted to check out the local bars and The Griffin was one of them.\n\nThe Griffin was a nice chill lounge bar.  The crowd was laid back.  The decor was nice, very masculine and dimly lit.  It is a good spot to just take a breather from the hustle and bustle of Fremont.
