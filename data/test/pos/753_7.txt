Was in Madison for a show at the Frequency and decided to perform at the open mic here. The audience was lucky because I totally killed. I'm just kidding, but I really did totally kill. I'm joking about how awesome I think I am but the real joke was when I performed here, meaning that I told several awesome jokes that the crowd really enjoyed. A really awesomely attended show and the local performers were really funny. Seriously though, I fucking killed it.
