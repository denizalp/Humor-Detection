Have been going here for years but recently they changed a few menu items and policies:( \nThey no longer offer kids options for food so your forced to purchase a $26 dollar meal for a child.\nThey also charge you extra for substituting  a veg instead of mashed potatoes. They feel mashed potatoes are a garnish for the steak or fish.\nBandera your in the hospitality business!\nI won't be back. What a shame!
