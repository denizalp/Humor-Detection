I've tried their rotisserie chicken dinner, the meatball pizza, and the mushroom pizza, and I have been very impressed by the freshness of ingredients and the quality of the meal. I recently had a baby, so I've only enjoyed their food at home (actually, let's be honest, I've sort of mastered the art of inhaling food in the car while parked in front of a restaurant). However, the vibe inside seems relaxed and it would be fun to have our meal while seated at the restaurant.
