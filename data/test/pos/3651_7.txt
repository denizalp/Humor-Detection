It's hard to get a reservation here but once you do they're very accommodating. I have the blowout and makeup membership so unlimited per month for $200, which is convenient. I go here every night before work, 3 days a week. The blowouts are not the best because my hair isn't as soft as other places but I can't beat the membership. It's a very nice looking salon where you feel special. The two locations in Tivoli and Town Square are convenient depending on what side of town you're on.
