The food here is great.\nLove the veggie burger and salads, the fried chicken is also delicious.\nGood fries, love the recent new addition of fried brussle sprouts.\nPrices are fair considering quality and portion size.\nThe guys loved their beef burgers.\nThe food did take a bit, same for the order process, expect to wait a bit as it does get busy here.\nGreat option for an affordable meal for the family, worth checking out.
