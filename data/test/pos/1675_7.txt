Do you like being served by people who don't speak English?\nDo you like your chili microwaved?\nDo you happen to enjoy parts of your order being left out?\n\nWell if so, this Tim Horton's is for YOU!\n\nSeriously, though - the worst location I have ever been to. Chili is cold, they don't give you the roll, or the butter......OR THE SPOON. And I honestly can't understand anything anyone says there.\n\nAVOID IF YOU CAN!
