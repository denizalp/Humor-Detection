Sometimes after hours of standing on the way home I will get foot massage. Decided to try this place around 2 am because of the $19 half hour sign. Got bumped to hour for $38 with addition of neck, back and shoulder massage. Well worth the money.  Masseuse named Tina worked so hard I almost felt bad about the low price for the service provided. I recommend tipping - Get 10 massages the 11th is free!
