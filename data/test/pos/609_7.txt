Came In here with Dave's family for an early dinner.\n\nThe service was kind of slow even though it was half full at 4pm.\n\nThey serve Large portions for the food and my cobb salad was huge! The burgers that and the sandwiches our party ordered were okay too.\n\nLoud environment with annoying announcer on a blown speaker which makes it hard for you to have a decent conversation with your party. \n\nOverall -this place is okay.
