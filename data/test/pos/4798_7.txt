Well worth $22 for the rock-n-roll history experience of a lifetime. 1000's of guitars and other rock memorabilia. Just don't take any pic's or the \"Photo-Nazi's\" will toss you out like they did me... though luckily at the end of my musical adventure. Expect to spend about 4hrs here to take it all in. Don't miss the great view of lake Eire from the top floor (just don't let anyone see your camera).
