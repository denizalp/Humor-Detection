I'm actually pretty good when it comes to knowledge about vaping and love checking into new stores and seeing the new stuff.  I was very happy my experience to Vapor Max actually.  Not often the staff know more than me and I was real impressed with there products.  Some new technology I have not seen anywhere else.  I'll def stop back next biz trip to see what they have new.  Clean beautiful friendly store gives them 5 star in my book.
