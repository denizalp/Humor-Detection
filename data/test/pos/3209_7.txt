Well to start  I now have a new favorite east Indian buffet. Went here for lunch today with Rand H. and this place was small comfy and with lots of nice decor. As far as the food goes everything I ate was great. The service was real good as well. Not much more to ask for ,  woo hoo!!! as good as it gets. they should change the name to 5 star of India. yumm yumm yumm!!!!!
