Apparently, their only two flavors are \"wallpaper paste\" and \"ghost pepper surprise.\" There's no in-between. My wife seems to like it, but that's because it's cheap, and she's ... we'll go with \"thrifty\". It has all the personality and atmosphere of a Wal-Mart employee break room, and, as my kid will tell you, they don't list everything they have directly on the menu, so, if you don't look closely at the walls, you'll miss the fried ice cream. \n\nYeah. Skip it.
