I have yet tried Bite Me Bakery's Cupcakes but I have to say Bite Me Bakery made  awesome eligible Golf Balls Cake Pops!\n\nThanks Bite Me Bakery for those awesome golf balls that looks so realistic and taste so yummy. So great looking that almost all of us were fooled thinking those were the real thing! \n\nI definitely would be trying out some of their cupcakes! \n\nBut seriously, those white chocolate golf balls has even dimples and sitting on a tee!! I still cannot get over that!
