I always dread when I have to run in and grab a few items at this location. The cashiers are inefficient and are always under staffed (compounding the problem) and the lines are ridiculous as a result. The store also has an icky feel to it - the floors are pretty scumming. I try to avoid this store when ever possible, but some times I have to suck it up and deal with all the nonsense.\n\nI do prefer smaller markets or the Loblaws on Leslie St.
