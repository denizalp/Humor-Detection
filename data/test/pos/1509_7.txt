Updating review - two brunches later, I'm up to 5!\n\nFantastic huevos rancheros. Crunchy and fresh and delicious ingredients. \nBeautifully presented smoked salmon plate - literally looks like a painting. \n\nThe plates next to us - the granola bowl and the veggie burger looked amazing. \n\nFilling, great quality, fair price.\n\nI love that the menu keeps changing, as it keeps me coming back :)
