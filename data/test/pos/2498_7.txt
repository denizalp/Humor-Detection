Ate there for the first time tonight with friends.  We were a relatively large table and the service was amazing.  The owners were wonderful.  The food was great!  The desserts were both beautiful and delicious.\n\nLoved the Pasta Rustica - unique flavor combination that I want to go back again for sometime soon.  We had an assortment of food from the menu and everything was really good.  We had a wonderful experience and definitely plan to go there again if we are in the area.
