First of all, I agreed to an early-morning appointment to accommodate their needs. I believe it should be more about servicing the customer. Then, what should have been a simple faucet replacement that couldn't possibly require more than an hour, took more than 2 hours. It seems to me that the repairman they sent lacked the knowledge needed to do an efficient and timely job.
