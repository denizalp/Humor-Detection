It's nice to have this place in the food court. The menu options look very appetizing. Mom and me had the mini tacos combo with rice and beans. To me the beans needed more seasoning, but, Mom thought they were fine. The rice was bland too. Adding the salsa to the beans made a big difference. The carnitas tacos were good.
