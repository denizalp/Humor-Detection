We had a family brunch at Lucky's Cafe this morning and we were flabbergasted by their utter unwillingness to be flexible.  I would not recommend anyone with kids who do not have sophisticated tastes to eat at Lucky's Cafe, as you will be overpaying for plain waffles and being asked to spend $5.00 on a side of maple syrup.  The manager was unfriendly, unapologetic and had no interest in seeing us return.  If you have deep pockets and do not have any diet restrictions, this is a perfect restaurant for you.
