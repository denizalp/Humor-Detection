Nothing amazing and nothing bad to say. I went on a quiet night and everyone was polite. The menu is pretty small and select, which I prefer because thats typically a sign it's food they specialize in. The food was good, as was the bread and butter. Why the lower score? Because I spent $50 (by myself for Rib eye, potatoes, bottle of beer and tip) and I thought it was a bit too expensive.
