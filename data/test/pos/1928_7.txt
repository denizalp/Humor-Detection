Round 2, switched it up n got the breakfast burrito.  The orders do still take some time to get ur order,  but it is what it is.. \n\nEverything was good,  cooked thoroughly,  but man,  beans in a bfast burrito..  just not into beans at all,  and dont lime places that put them in Everything.. \n\nneed to add requesting no beans,  acacado,  n sour cream even if it doesnt say so on menu.. \n\nthe food was good enough to try one more time in few weeks
