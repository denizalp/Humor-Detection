God this place is so far from downtown!  It is totally worth the drive though.  The Philly Cheese Steak pizza was an amazing concoction that only someone who smokes a ton of weed could ever come up with.  The order was easy and was ready when I got there so no complaints from any point.  Would go back in a heartbeat but damn - build one downtown!
