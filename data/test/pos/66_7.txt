Had the \"Blue Ribbon Burger\" and fries. Burger was absolutely disgusting and DRENCHED in grease. So much grease in fact that the grease pool it created filled my plate and drenched my fries. So with the gross burger and gross burger soaked fries, I WILL NOT be coming back.\n\nLol \"permanently closed\" GOOD!!!
