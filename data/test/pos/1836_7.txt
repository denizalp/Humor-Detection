Do I really have to do a lengthy review of this Mayo Clinic???  This place is totally awesome, very well laid out, very organized, very clean, easy to find one's way around and they have the best doctors and practices in the country!  Their gift shop is most interesting!  You can find lots of gifts that are rare and the price is right!  This facility is in a beautiful area of Scottsdale, almost makes you feel like you're out in the beautiful oasis of Arizona!  I wish that more insurance would cover services at the Mayo Clinic...
