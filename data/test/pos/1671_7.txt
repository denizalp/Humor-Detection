So glad to see them open a second Vegas location! I absolutely love the service here, they are so friendly and eager to please, you are treated exceptionally well.\nTheir menu is extensive, anything you could imagine. I have yet to have a drink I didn't enjoy here, plenty of options for kids and people that don't enjoy coffee.\nGreat addition to the area, highly recommended!
