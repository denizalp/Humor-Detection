They have reallllllly hot miso soup!\n\nI know that because the last time I was here, our waitress poured half of my miso in my lap. With no apology. And no offers to comp the soup that probably has left my ovaries unable to function. \n\nBut hey, she and the other staff are pretty so that's all that matters, right? Nobody cares about service or basic manners anymore, right?
