When I'm in the mood to listen to good 70's and 80's music, I turn the dial to KKLZ.  They play some good stuff on this radio station.  It's definitely on my regular rotation of channels that I surf when I'm in the car running errands or getting from A to B.  Their morning show isn't as good as Foxx & MacKenzie, but is not too bad.\n\nI hope they don't change their format anytime soon.
