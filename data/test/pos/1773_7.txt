Great spot! Glad a colleague recommended Santana, the owner\/Barber. Santana is a very passionate barber who puts his customers first. He's detailed oriented and truly goes above and beyond by going over every single area he's touching up. He cuts all types of hair, too. Do yourself a favor and support this small business. You'll be highly satisfied!
