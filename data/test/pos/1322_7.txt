Holy yum batman! My best friend brought me here because she's recently become vegan and they have an option for her. Thanks for the JINYA :)\nThe food was damn tasty and service was good.\nThis is going to sound crazy but really made my experience was the restroom. I'm one of those weirdos that judges a place based on their restrooms. They had a fancy Japanese toilet! I was a little too nervous to play with the other button options (the bidet wasn't on), but it was freaking cool. But oh yeah--the food is great. Eat there!
