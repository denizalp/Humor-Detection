Great service and great hobby!\n\nDrones Plus is an authorized DJI dealer.  DJI is a great drone product.  \nDefinitely a fun hobby to get take up.  Service here has been excellent every time we stopped in.  Randal and Mike were both helpful and professional.  They were quite knowledgeable of the products.  \n\nThe store is definitely clean.  There aren't too many options on the display tables but I guess you only stop in this store for one thing.  \n\nMy husband is one happy shopper which makes me smile.  Do you want a new hobby?  It's definitely a fun one!
