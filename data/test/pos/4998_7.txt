This place is vedy vedy good. Like..  the kanye of sushi. Well maybe not kanye.. but this place is good. The poke is my favorite out of all the other sushi spots. The Silverstate roll is really good too. And you know what? They refill waters good!!!! Basically kaizen to the other sushi places is like goku vs vegeta.. or gohan vs cell...
