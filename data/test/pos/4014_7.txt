I had the carnita taco with chips and salsa. The taco was an okay size with a good amount of toppings but I really didn't like the texture of the tortilla. It was very grainy and dry. There was also a lack of seasoning. The salsa was nice. It was labeled medium but it tasted more medium. There really wasn't much spice to it at all. The chip are home made and a touch oily and thick. Overall, this place was just okay but I will give it another shot sometime later because they do have some good moments.
