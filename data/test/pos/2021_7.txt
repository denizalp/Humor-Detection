It is too bad that although Canada is a free country, men are still not legally allowed to marry burgers. Because if I could, I would have married the double-pattie bison burger that they serve up at this place. Damn, it is big, sexy, and delish. \n\nI haven't tried other stuff on the menu, but seriously, their burgers are out of this world.
