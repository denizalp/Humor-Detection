Always packed with scumbags.  I usually prefer scumbags but these ones don't bring anything to the table.  Always packed and people park how ever the hell they want.  I feel badly for someone who may actually be handicapped because some heffer is leaving here 6 kids (unbuckled) with the car running in that spot so she can get grape rolling papers and a soda the size of her thigh.  America at its finest.  Maybe with a Zanex and a 40 this might be fun to watch but don't actually try and pump gas here.....ever..
