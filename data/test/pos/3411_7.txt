This was 'the place' back in the days, we used to go there a lot for a beer and some good food.\n\nThey had a nice patio and the food was above average pub food, however the quality started going down for some reason and the place itself looked and felt outdated after a while, as it really needed some renovations.\nhaven't been there in a while, and hoping to see this place back to what it was before!
