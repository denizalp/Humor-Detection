You know how in real estate they say, bathrooms and kitchens sell houses. Well, Planet Hollywood -I wasn't privy to a kitchen but damn, update your bathrooms man. Mentally you know that (hopefully) the cleaning service do bleach or sanitize the bathroom properly, but just the thought of that grime and oowey goowey sticky icky surrounding the fixtures is at least not a health hazard. The room was clean, but if the fixtures in the bathrooms were updated id probably stay here all the time. Til then, thank you for the one night stay - moving to The Cosmopolitan.
