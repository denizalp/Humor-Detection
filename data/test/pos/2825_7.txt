I'm Korean and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The restaurant looked clean and the server was nice but the taste of the korean food was not good at all. We had three main dishes and an appetizer, and none of them were tasty. I couldn't actually finish my meal..... \nPerhaps the Japanese food selection is better (I did not try any).
