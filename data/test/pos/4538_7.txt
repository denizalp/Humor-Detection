This is a pretty cool location nestled near the High Roller and the Link.  They will soon have a new neighbor with In N Out opening soon.  This place can get very busy in the summer, but today it was rather quiet and only one person was working, hence the line moved very slow.  I decided on my favorite, the salted oatmeal cookie. Hands down the best cookie they carry.  Has a great chewiness and a touch of saltiness on top.  I do enjoy the s'mores cupcakes, but decided on sticking with the cookies this time. I'll be back.
