I can't with this bar. So many issues. \n\nHow is a new to the area bar going to charge 92 cents for extra ranch?\n\nWhen you have a happy hour for well drinks and you order a vodka tonic, why are you gonna pour a kettle one vodka and charge 3x the price?\n\nIgnore us for the last 30 minutes so we can't order anything from happy hour. \n\nAlso we gambled $100, please ignore that as well. \n\nWill never come back here. Terrible bar. Especially if they are trying to build a new clientele in the area.
