We came for happy hour and they had some kind of godawful country music band playing.  Besides that, the band members brought along their families, so the place was packed with... wait for it... kids.  Really, no thanks. \n\nSo the only thing I remember - listening to country music and bratty kids knocking into me.  If I want to deal with families at 6pm on a Wednesday, I'll go to Chili's.  God.  (Is there a Chili's in Madison?).
