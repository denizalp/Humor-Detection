If you like thick beef patties, then maybe you'd like this place. I asked for well done for my beef patty, not burn it so that it's bitter and nasty. The chocolate shake tastes like it was made from Hershey's chocolate syrup and low quality shake base (disgusting). I prefer sweet potato fries over sweet potato tots. The tots taste like regular potatoes to me. We got the BBQ pork wings and some of it was good, some were dry. It was also way to barbecue-ee for my taste. The place was way too loud.
