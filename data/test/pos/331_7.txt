My company always uses Beck so I've been using them the past few years for my own personal bookings too. \n\nI can't complain. When I call for a pick up, they are always there at my house within 5 minutes. It's very reasonable. \n\nI've had some kooky cab drivers in Toronto but never via Beck. I'm sure every company has a few nutters but Beck has always been reliable for me.
