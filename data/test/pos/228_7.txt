Get your fat on at Amelie's 24\/7. I went back and forth to the pastry case so many times someone (an employee) had to help me out to my car. I was ashamed at my indulgences, but could not stop myself. The place rocks. Need better coffee, but otherwise its one of the better spots in the city. My advice, throw a furniture dolly in the trunk. You'll need it to wheel your bloated carcass out the front door. In fact, consider having Two Men and a Truck meet you there.
