The food here is beyond bad. I've tried several things on the menu and found all of them to be ridiculously terrible. I'm really confused where these positive reviews come from. I would have to assume its people who've never had English\/Indian food before (which is definitely possible in Glendale Arizona) but this place should be ashamed.\n\nIt's certainly not saved by at service either, no specifics but let's just say their ability to handle a disgruntled customer leaves something to be desired.\n\nJust don't go here.
