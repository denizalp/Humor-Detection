I went to Jonathan's last Saturday for breakfast based on reviews alone.  Wow... was I disappointed... the landscaping looked awful with duck and goose crap \/ trash by the adjoining pond. The restaurant interior is falling apart, the food was bland, and the service on par with Waffle House. How they got a 97 food inspection rating is a miracle or a payoff. And I am in my 50s and I felt young... it's sad to see a place not being taken care of to sueeze every dime it can.
