These oils smell great and the delivery was quick. I'm applying them to my skin and using them for my diffuser. I haven't had any adverse reactions. I put the oils in my bath, wear as perfume and disperse in the air around. Not sure what 100% pure fragrance oils means exactly, but I do like the way they smell.
