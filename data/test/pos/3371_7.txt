My USTA women's 3.0 team played our first National match today at these courts. We played against a team from Kansa City, MO. Even though we lost (it was super close!!!), it was a pleasure playing at these courts and at this facility overall. The courts are very well maintained. The staff is great. The officials were not jerks. And the best yet, is super cold cold water in between sets. Not only all that, the mountain backdrop is spectacular!!\n\nTHIS COURT IS PUBLIC!!!!!!! Only $3.50\/hr per person to play on these spectacular courts.\n\nWe're going to go get them tomorrow.
