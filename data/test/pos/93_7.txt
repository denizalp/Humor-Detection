This store is seriously intriguing. \nAll the flashy decorations have me mesmerized every time I'm in the area.  I love glitter and disco balls and such. \n\nBasically, they had me at Hello. \n\nI like this store. \nYour basic h&m times 100!\n\nThey have 3 stories.  And it's a fun experience just being inside.
