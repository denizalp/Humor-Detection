I was looking forward to checking this place out after reading the reviews on Yelp.  It's decorated in a beach theme and seems like a fun atmosphere.\n\nI sat at the bar and it took a little while to get my menu.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger.\n\nAnd then I waited.  And I waited.  A half hour after I sat down at the bar I still didn't have any food.  I put a couple bucks on the bar for my Sprite and walked out.
