Food still good. Service tonight not so great. Only 5 tables full in the restaurant and our server couldn't manage to ask if I wanted a refill on my beer or water. My wife's soda sat empty. Jason (our waiter) did not seem to care to be attentive. There was a table the manager was talking to and he seemed to want to be more present there. On a busy night I get it. Not tonight. Once again though food was great.
