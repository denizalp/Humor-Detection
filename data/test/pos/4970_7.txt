I like my restaurants small and recluse. With good music playing (The Pixies, duh), autographed photographs of retired skaters hanging on the wall (Tony Alva) and a small but perfect menu: tacos, tacos, and tacos. \n\nI'd eat here every night if my waist band and wallet allowed me. I love their popcorn shrimp, portobello tacos, their veggie burrito (guac for miles) and their crab nachos. This place has something for everyone. Also, their bourbon lemonade is the perfect libation \/ thirst quencher. They also sell pitchers of beer.\n\nDon't be surprised if you bump into Win Butler.
