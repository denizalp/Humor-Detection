Well this is probably the prettiest grocery store in America. Situated in an old bank building and chock full of gourmet fare. You will find deli counters and the salad bar under the rotunda. There is a wine bar on the second floor. The food is delicious and the staff super friendly.  Even if you buy nothing its totally worth visiting here just to see the architecture. Highly recommend.
