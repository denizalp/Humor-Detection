Bring them all - big or small!! This is a great place to introduce your puppy to other 4 legged folks...however, my lady is a bit of a B**ch so she doesn't get along with dogs at all. She just likes people....my mom mostly. ANYWAY, there is a separate area for small dogs and a huge area for big dogs. There's usually someone here and the weekends are the busiest. \n\nTIP: if you're looking to meet someone who looooves dogs, what better place to do it??? \n\nBring a scoop. I don't wanna step in your dog's lunch!
