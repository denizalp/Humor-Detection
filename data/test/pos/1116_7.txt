A-OK for the $2 drinks.  I don't even know how many I had.  Gipsy became my friend and I's drinking fountain, whenever we felt the need for more while across the street at Piranha.  The show started out well with lots of J.Los and Shakiras dancing around.  Then it hit an awkward note when the hostess suddenly wanted everyone to get all depressed, reflecting on death and stuff.  Buzzkill.  That was our cue to gulp down our drinks and head back to Piranha!  Oh, but the bartendress was super nice.  Wait, how much did I tip her?!
