This has to be one of the best farmers market in all of North America. Yep, I've declared it so and you should know that this is coming from a Native Californian so it means a lot. \n\nIn Southern California farmers markets are a plenty and I've visited quite a few. St. Lawrence has everything from a butcher to a baker and probably even a candle stick maker. And if they don't now I'm sure they will in time. Make sure to visit Kozlik's Canadian Mustard in the lower level they have over 35 different types of mustard.
