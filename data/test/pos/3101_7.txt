I'm not ordinarily a pancake person. Actually, I guess I'm not an ORDINARY pancake person. They gotta be special to get my attention (a la Orange Table's jalapeno pecan pancakes). \n\nIt's true what they say about the red velvet pancakes here! DELICIOUS! Not too sweet, even though they're chocolate. (Quick tip: order a kid's portion) \n\nThe breakfast sandwich could easily serve 2, if not 4! \n\nEnjoying a cheese plate at happy hour is a great way to spend an afternoon. \n\nService is spotty. Food and ambiance are not.
