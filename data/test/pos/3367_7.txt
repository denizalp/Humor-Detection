There's BOOZE!!!!!  Yeah I know this may seem a little simple minded but THERE'S BOOZE.!!!!!  \n\nI moved to the area about 7 months ago and since that point I have been stockin' up extra for just in case I run out and can't drive to the store.  Now I only have to worry about public intoxication instead of a D.U.I.\n\nThank you CVS for helping me to become a more functioning alcoholic.\n\nP.S.  The single serve liquor is by the register next to the street entrance.
