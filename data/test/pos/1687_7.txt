Stopped by after many years to see the new redesign and refresh. \n\nWe used to love this place 10-15 years ago as a dive bar filled with character and characters.\n\nI'm not usually that fussy but I really prefer the old dive. The new changes feel inauthentic. The general sleaze has been replaced by fake character. The bright lights (in a bar?) make this an unappealing place to hang out.  \n\nThe beers were fine, the service was good, and the food we tried was fine. So this review is really about the ambience.
