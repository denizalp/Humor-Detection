To be blunt, hemp cream cheese on a sandwich is genius! As a vegetarian, I am always looking for decent sandwich places. Cheba Hut's relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff and GREAT sandwiches keep me returning. Friends and non-vegetarians that I have taken to Cheba Hut enjoy their sandwiches so much so that they return themselves. My personal favorite is the Griefo. If you can, save room for a brownie!
