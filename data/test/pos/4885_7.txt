Good food, decent prices. Short beard, glasses, Bengals fan bartender has a piss poor attitude. Good at his job. About as personable as a Maricopa  county deputy.  Very superior and kind of dickish.\nF-U, dude. You're a representative of the bar. I don't give a damn if your day sucks, your life sucks, or someone shit on your forehead this morning. I'm paying for service and I'm not stiffing you. respect the customer, shithead.
