whoever manages this mall, the property managers. you placed black nets over the grass and mulch area. I just went to Booster Juice and tripped and fell on concrete, I scrapped  my knees from this fall, it may have been much worst. You need to place some signage or just dont put these netsJust like when you have a WET floor , a sign is there to let you know. I will copy this review to the merchant and to the city of calgary.
