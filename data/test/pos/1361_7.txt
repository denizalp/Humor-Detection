Car must be washed and these guys wash cars right? Well they seem more like carnies at the state fair trying to sell you everything under the sun. Back off and wash my damn car! I don't want a windshield repair (does it look cracked?), a carpet cleaning, detail job, oil change or anything else - except maybe gas.
