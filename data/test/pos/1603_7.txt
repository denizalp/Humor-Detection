My battery (purchased from Lexus dealership and under warranty) died, so I had the car jumped and brought it in. They couldn't find anything wrong with the battery or electrical, so I was sent home with the assurance everything was okay. Sure enough, it is dead again now, and this dealership refuses to offer any assistance beyond telling me to buy a better battery. Egad.
