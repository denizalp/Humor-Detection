I bought See's lollipops for years over the internet and finally when I moved to Pittsburgh I actually found a See's store.\nThe store has an excellent variety of all the see's products.\nI bought a couple of lollipops and a few pieces of dark chocolate.\nThe Lollipops are the best anywhere and they have many flavors too choose from.\nI am partial to the chocolate lollipop myself.\nThe staff were very friendly and extremely helpful.\nI love See's and do highly recommend them for your many and gift needs.\nI will definitely be going again.
