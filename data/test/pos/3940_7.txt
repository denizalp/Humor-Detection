a waste of money!!!\nI never had a teeth whitening with LED light before,but believe me it is not worth your time and money. \nthey are not dentist, hygienist of anything similar, but a company trying to sell their product. Over the counter products like Crest or Colgate etc..work better than this. Plus after you do everything for them, (yes everything) they try to sell you a $20.00 whitening  buster to use after several weeks. \nMy teeth and gums were in several pain that night....would not recommend to anyone.,
