BEST BANH MI IN VEGAS\nI compared the banh mi here with Hue Thai Sandwiches and Pho Thanh Huong Restaurant (the one by UNLV).  I liked this sandwich the best of the three.\n\nI ordered the #1 House Special and every bite was fresh tasting.  It measures 9.75\" long on good bread with fresh ingredients and good meat for $3.  \n\nThere was no one in front of me and I waited about 2 minutes for my sandwich but there can be a line during lunch.  \n\nSee full review of all three sandwiches at www.DeepFriedKimchee.com
