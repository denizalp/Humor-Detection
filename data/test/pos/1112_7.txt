This place is overrated in every way, food, service, price and portions. Why are we paying outrageous  prices for a little cheese, meat (if any) chips. I could appreciate it if the food was tasty. But it's  not, it was bland. And I'm being kind. This establishment will stay as long as people continue to support it. The Mcdonalds of Nachos!! Oh & they don't  give you chips & salsa! I will NOT be back. Should be Baby Nacho ijs.
