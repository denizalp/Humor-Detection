It may be labeled in Shadyside but I say it's in East Liberty.\n\nThis is a great store and as the clerk proclaimed the largest in the area.  I was more than a little impressed by the selection. This Wine and Spirits is like the Home Depot of W&S.  The attendants were super helpful and the store unlike many other locations is very well staffed. \nMy boyfriend actually had to pull me away from the store so as not to miss a lunch date.
