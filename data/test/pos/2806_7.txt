Awesome organization with friendly folks. I joined a bunch of Yelpers yesterday at their warehouse on 780 W Lake Mead Pkwy in Henderson (corner 4th street across from Fiesta). They gave us the tools to sort through used children's books and clean them of any markings, dirt, labels, etc. It looks like they could use more help, so if you've been looking for a worthy and fun volunteer opportunity, this is it. Like their web site says, books are magical. Be a kid again as you sort through childhood classics and pass them on to a new generation.
