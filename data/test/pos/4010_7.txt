Located about 1.5 blocks from the Place des Arts Metro stop on de Bleury, this was a convenient location for us when we were in the city to pull some cash out.  The only issue was that the doors do not close all the way when accessing the ATMs, and there was a loud beeping noise that never seemed to shut off.  Currency exchange can be done on the premise during normal operating hours.\n\n+ATM doors do not shut completely
