Danielli is the master in terms of bikini wax, and Courtenay does a fab job also.   It's worth the drive for the fact that they can get you in, out, and hair-free without breakouts, stray weird hairs, and with minimal pain in the space of 20 minutes or less.   Don't bother even looking anyplace else if you want your bikini area handled (pardon the pun) professionally.
