Renting a car is getting really easy these days! \n\nI love this Emerald aisle that shuttles you directly to your car. No waiting in long lines and most importantly you get to pick your own car. Don't forget to do the \"sniff test\" before you drive off. I hate smoky, smelly cars! \n\nJust sign up online to get one of their Emerald cards.
