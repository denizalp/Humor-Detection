Absolutely love this place! The owners are super nice and always greet you when you walk in. They always offer water and make sure your comfortable. The pedicure chairs are very comfortable and relaxing. I've been coming here since they opened and I absolutely love it. I always get the same thing, but they always do an amazing job.
