With a 350 pounds and over eat free and a Massive 12000 calorie burger, this is the stuff of legend.  The Ultimate PIG-OUT Spot, No Joke!  All you can eat French Fry Bar, Burgers cooked with lard, Shakes made with Butter fat (WTH), Holy Crap.  This place is intimidating and almost frightening.  Tip for all first timers, start with a single bypass burger and work your way up.  Everything was Tasty but I should of stayed away from the Milkshake.  A great place for a laugh and a very friendly staff, but a Must Try for all Food Junkies!
