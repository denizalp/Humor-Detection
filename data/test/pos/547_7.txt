Came into this place to try it out.  Sat at the table for 15 minutes and was never even acknowledged by the wait staff.  There were 2 waitresses and 7 occupied tables.  I got up and got us menus and still waited.  The wait staff waited on the table next to us and never said a word.  We got up and walked out after 19 minutes of waiting for a simple hello, that never happened. Will not be going back. Absolutely horrible service.
