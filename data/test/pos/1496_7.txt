I've never received \"bad\" food from chick fil a. Everytime I've ordered something from here the food is A+ but with my drive thru visit yesterday I received the nastiest sandwich ever! I'm so grossed out and the only reason I didn't go back and ask for a replacement was because I had already driven all the way home and opened up the bag then. So unacceptable so I threw it away and just ate the fries. Next time I'll make sure to check my sandwich before I drive home.
