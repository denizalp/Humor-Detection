Came here for HH because we were staying at the hotel and the rooftop bar was closed. HH is 3-6PM, gets you a buck off apps and drinks. We tried a drink (El Presidente?), which was similar to a Moscow Mule and their smoked chicken tortilla soup, which was more of a stew than any tortilla soup I've encountered and somehow came out within three minutes of ordering. Bartender was attentive, patio available with heaters.
