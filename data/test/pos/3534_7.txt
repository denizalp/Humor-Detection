My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place after seeing the generally positive Yelp reviews. Unfortunately we did not have a reservation, so we decided to ask the hostess when was the best time to walk-in. The hostess was extremely rude and unhelpful; completely turned me off. Basically kept repeating \"uh, you NEED a reservation or else you won't get in\". Okay lady, thanks? \n\nWay to make your \"guests\" feel unwelcome. Unacceptable.
