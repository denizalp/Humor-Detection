Sir - \n\nI am a fan of your hefeweizen. I don't know its name, nor do I have any recollection of how much it cost.  But I could care less about the latter issue because it was amazing and worth however many pennies I spent on it.  Please send me a case of it at your earliest convenience. \n\nBest,\nCadence
