The name should be called Cafe No Frills because all of the owner's \"fresh, organic\" ingredients come from the supermarket across the street. \n\nI would also think that a woman who cooks in a kitchen would have the knowledge to wear a hairnet, or at least tie her hair back. I'm lucky I didn't get a surprise in my salad. \n\nAlso be sure to bring a wad of money along because the place is so ridiculously overpriced it should be criminal. I guess rent prices are a bit steep in the area?
