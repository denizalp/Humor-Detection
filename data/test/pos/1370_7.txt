The cashier said they raised the prices. That's good for the owners, I have no complaints there. But when the girl told me the price..WOW!..I was being charged $20 for the one slice of pizza and salad combo. The menus price states $6.95. Granted she said \"they charge something like .15 per topping\" This is sad because this was our favorite place to order from. Time to look else where
