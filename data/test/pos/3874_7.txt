Menu has changed. My favorite item has been scrapped. MINUS STAR! But I tried their protein pancakes recently which I think they are knocking off of US Egg, and they were pretty damn good. Better than I remember their plain pancakes being. I still don't understand why orange juice is $5+ a glass. The coffee is still great but expensive as hell too so I drink my coffee before I go.
