How could I give anything less than a 5 star review for a place that sorts me out almost every morning with a fantastic coffee (and pastry sometimes, but not often, but probably too often) before work? Thank you, Noble.\nFriendly, lovely staff. \n\nThis place is small, so it's coffee to go. Unless it's summer when there are a few little tables set up outside.
