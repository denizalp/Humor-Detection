Cute name and $11 for a salad is a steal in Vegas but my beef here is that if you're looking for something mildly healthy this is pretty much your only option - only thing is, it's a salad place that doesn't have a single salad that comes without meat. Laaame. \n\nYou can build your own starting at $11 but you're still paying a premium for the meat that you aren't getting. All things considered, they can do better. \n\nVery weird to see a salad place that not only isn't vegetarian, but doesn't have a single option sans meat.
