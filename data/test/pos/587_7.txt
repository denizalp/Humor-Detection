Came around 2pm on Thursday and had to sign in and wait about 15 mins for bar seating. Got tonkotsu and the wife got spicy tonkotsu. Added egg and corn for me and egg and green onions for her.\n\nPork was fall apart tender, broth was rich and creamy and the noodles were cooked perfect.\n\nCheap, $6.50 - ~$10 depending on which version  you order.\n\nHot tea comes in a can, lol, but its hot...keep them in an oven or what??? ((:\n\nI highly recommend trying the ramen here.
