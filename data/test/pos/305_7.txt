Love this clothing store for the baby daddy. It's simple, casual, trendy and comfy for him. So glad I came across this store in Vegas' mile of shops.\n\nIt being the holiday season, they have an additional 40% off on sale items! Yaayuuhh!!!\n\nI made a large purchase and signed up for the rewards program and received 25$ woot woot! \n\nI also learned their mother company is Perry Ellis and the rewards can be used at the Perry Ellis store too.\n\nAnywho... great customer service from the cashier... he was very helpful and packaged my items so neat and perfect.
