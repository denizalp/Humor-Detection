This is is a solid truck wash. \n\nI was delivering a brand new fire truck to a local city and I made sure to specify that they did not use scrub brushes on the paint and this location said no problem and did a good job cleaning off road grime, bugs and all w\/o scrubbing on the paint. \n\nA standard wash is $37.50 and there are a ton of other options to choose from depending on what you want cleaned, polished and shined.
