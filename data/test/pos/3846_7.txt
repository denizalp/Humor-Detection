PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE CALORIES!  A great place to visit when you are seeking a tasty burger.  Friendly service...never had a negative experience and the employees are all smiles and full of chit chat.  My personal favorite is the Bacon Avocado Burger. I don't know if the avo is fresh but everything tastes and looks like it is like it is.  I have tried the zucchini and I have had the onion rings, both a rather large and delicious compliment to your meal.
