Personally I am not a fan of what Razzleberriez Yogurt has to offer with their yogurts. I am used to the tart tastes of the soft serve yogurts. Their yogurt flavors are mellow.  I am also not accustomed to this place where you are not allowed to try the flavors on your own. Abruptly, the staff will approach you and ask what do you want to try. Many other yogurt businesses are ran differently. Just something I am not used to. The price is much higher at this place then competitors.
