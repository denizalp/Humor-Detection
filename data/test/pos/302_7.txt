Everything here was so perfectly average. They have a great variety and some creative dishes, but nothing I had here (as you can see in the photos) impressed me. The waiter was nice and attentive however.\n\nI was expecting more from their food and left the place with full stomach but still feeling like something's missing. Will go to somewhere else next time!
