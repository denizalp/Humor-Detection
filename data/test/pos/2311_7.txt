Went in to pick up Baby Shower invites. Biggest Walgreens I've ever seen!  Sharon took pity on my poor computer illiterate brain and helped step by step, while still doing her job as cashier.\n The store was busy, and I can see why. They have very cool gifts and souvenirs.\n Also all the usuals.\n Parking is TINY, but most people are walking so it wasn't a problem.\n I would drive out of my way to use their printer, etc again, just for Sharon.
