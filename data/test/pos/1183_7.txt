There's no customer service now a day, came in for a simple question and this a-hole associate named Charles was just so arrogant and rude, he did not even take time to listen to our problem or concern and demand our phone number even when we were trying to explain what happen, because he didn't listen we ask to talk with another associate and he just got up and leave and say have a nice day, how immature.
