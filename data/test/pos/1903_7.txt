On the plus side, the selection of food here is gigantic. There are a zillion options. The chocolate covered strawberries were also good. \n\nOn the HUGE negative side, there was a piece of paper in my macaroni and cheese. That was a gross find - I stopped eating. My appetite was gone. \n\nFinding random objects in your food is never a good thing. I'm all set with this place. Gross. Gross. Gross.
