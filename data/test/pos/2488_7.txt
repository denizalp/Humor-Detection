Wow the reviews on here are kinda old.  I'm ready to update you on the service at this location.  My husband and I shop here all the time.  We always get greeted by everyone and they are super helpful here.  Restrooms are kept clean, store is always clean, and the food is super fresh.  They always have great clearance items.  Highly recommend for your grocery shopping needs.
