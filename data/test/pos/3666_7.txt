I'm a big fan of the show so it was a must see for me visiting from Australia. There was a couple of items I recognized from the show. I purchased a very overpriced old\nMan silver coin and enjoyed looking at the various items for sale. It wasn't as good as Ricks restorations as it feels more commercialized.
