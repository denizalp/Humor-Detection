August 26, 2013  Based upon the recent write in the paper, we thought we would give B F&D a try. My entr√©e was a pulled pork sandwich and it was uneatable. The top bum was burnt. It was called to the attention of a waiter and they said they would call it to the attention of the cook staff.  That was it. Someone is not paying much attention in the kitchen.  Repeat business, I don't think so.
