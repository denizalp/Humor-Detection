I do love this place.\n\nBUT: come early or else you'll be dealing with the Yuppies and old Yippies like me have no patience!\n\nIf you know where you need to go ... make a list  in advance, puchase, and leave.  Becomes very irritating after 9:00\/9:30 a.m.  \n\nTo quote Peter M:  \"Jeers\"!!!!!!!!
