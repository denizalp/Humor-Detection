I came here at 3:30 am with late night cravings of a Big Mac post-partying. The McDs was empty and quiet for once. It was nice! Mathie, served me-his service was off the chart for a fast food chain -he was very patient. We came to learn the breakfaat isn't served for 24 hrs-only pancakes and egg McMuffins are. They close the cash around 4 am, 4:30 am they start serving breakfast.  I would actually considering bumping up my review by half a star -for after midnight service.
