The former Mayan is gone. \n\nWhat a shame \n\nUsed to be good management. \n\nUsed to be safe, because it is nearby the LV Metro Police Center. \n\nRaised the rent too much. \n\nPainted the outsides, yeah, like who cares?\n\nThe new owner and management team just is in the toilet. \n\nAll the things here which used to be great are now gone.
