Long line @ drive thru on Saturday 10 a.m. Ordered a spinach Florentine bagel with lox. At window, this unpleasant lady tells me they are out of that spinach bagel. So instead of her telling me that when I ordered, she waited until I got to the window! I was angry and told her to cancel the order. \nEnded up going to Yard house @ Town square having great food and friendly service. \nI like Einstein brothers bagels but will never go back to this location.
