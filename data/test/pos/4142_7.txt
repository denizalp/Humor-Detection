This would be me on a daily basis.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x-s2tLbqlOc&feature=youtube_gdata_player\n\nMy two vices are:\n\n1) A dimly lit local where every nook and cranny has been planned to maximize comfort and cool.\n\n                        And\n\n2) Birthday Cake! \n\nThe Avro wonderfully fulfills both of these. Whether lounging in the comfortably worn in chairs or standing at the bar to vociferously defend that Of Montreal album your friend hated, it's perfect! The fact that the wonderful bartender plays said Of Montreal album all the way through to get a rise out of him is just too awesome to ignore. \n\nWell done, Avro!
