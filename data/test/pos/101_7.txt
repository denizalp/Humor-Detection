Located in the Grand Canal Shoppes this is a great place to get a quick bite to eat and still eat luxuriously. Lobster galore, prepared in a multitude of ways. Taco, grilled cheese, lobster on a stick, and lobster roll served cold with mayo or warm with melted butter. I chose the Connecticut which is served warm and melted butter, the lesser of the two evils. I enjoyed the roll and it's a great option if you are in a hurry and have serious shopping to do.
