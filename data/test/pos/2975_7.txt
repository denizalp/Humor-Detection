Went back for the same friends birthday dinner a year later and my opinion stays the same. This time however I am no longer a vegan so I tried the food. I only got appetizers. It was what I expected, nothing special. I don't really fancy this place to be honest. I don't care for the food, service (wasn't bad just didn't leave mark) or the atmosphere.
