Terrible experience.  The service is incredibly slow. We  waited for any item in our order for 45 minutes with a half empty restaurant.  Knowing we were late, we tried to check what items were not being cooked yet in order to cancel them and just eat what was ready.  When the sushi chef found out he cancelled all our order and pretty much kicked us out.   Wouldn't be back even if they paid me to go.
