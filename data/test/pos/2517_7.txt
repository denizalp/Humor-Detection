Anybody who complains about the \"faux western style\" better sit back down.\nAre you kidding me?\nThis little old town is so awesome to walk around. Clean, kitschy, friendly.\n\nAlso, one of the best farmers markets is here.\nAwesome soft serve.\n\nSure. It has tons of \"authentic native\" jewelry stores that make you question what the word authentic really means. Guess what? Don't shop there then? \n\nAll in all, an awesome adventure packed with lots of cool little boutiques and eateries.
