This is one of my absolute favorite taco shops. I wish there was one closer to my house, although it would really effect my waistline. The tacos are huge. I highly recommend getting them fully loaded... Price usually works out to be about $5 with everything, but it's worth it. A\n\nI love the green sauce... I love to smother my taco with it. I've also tried the ceviche, and it was pretty good. I also love the corn quesadilla with carne asada. \n\nI love the ease of the drive thru.
