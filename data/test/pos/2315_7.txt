Very swanky hotel in the middle of downtown. Everyone was very nice, particularly Kevin at the front desk. One downside is that they weren't able to expedite the checkin, as we got into the hotel really early due to an overnight flight, so we got into the room around 2pm after waiting in the lobby from about 11:30 (though, they didn't bother us ). Would stay here again if I'm back in this wonderful cold city.
