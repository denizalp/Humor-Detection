My wife has been super excited about her favorite LA spot in Vegas. Unfortunately it's on the strip at the new Wynn plaza.  Maybe one day they will open a location in Summerlin.  (Hint hint !!!)\n\nService was excellent.  This location is not very busy yet. Not like the LA locations.  \n\nFood was good. A little pricey but it's the strip. And it's way cheaper than flying to LA to get a Urth salad  (my wife's favorite )\n\nOnly negative was the butter (for the bread) was ice cold.  It needs to be at room temperature to appreciate its full flavor
