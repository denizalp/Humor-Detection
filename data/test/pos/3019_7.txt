Although the sushi is above average as far as AYCE in Vegas goes, the service, and especially the manager are absolutely terrible. \n\nAlthough I've still enjoyed this place by sitting at the sushi bar, tonight the manager changed the TV station from a playoff baseball game and then nastily said she \"couldn't change it because people will want to stay longer.\"\n\nWhen we asked if we could please talk to a manager, she said she was the manager and if we didn't like it we could leave.\n\nJust wow. All you can eat sushi with a side of bitch!
