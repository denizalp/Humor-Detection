Firstly, my Japanese name is Xu Wok Gee, so I was very offended by this restaurant's name. \n\nThe only hot pot in this restaurant is the one the chef must have been smoking in the back. The pickled cabbage was too sour, and the vermicelli undercooked. \n\nThe portions were also so big that we had to pack the food as hard as he packed heat. All in all, I, Daniel Wok Gee Xu, do feel like I was Fuked. And I will be coming back for more ;^DDDDDDDDD
