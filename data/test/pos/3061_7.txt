Wonderful learning center for my 2 little ones. They are Christian based, so they pray and center things around Christ and God, which was excellent! The only thing was, when my children attended, the staff was very much into gossip which you  an hear from the 2 gals in the front (Alice and Crissy) and the tuition did not include the lunch for the kids.
