Stayed one night enroute back home to Michigan.  Very basic Fairfield- thin walls, thin towels, complimentary Wifi, parking, microwave, mini-refrigerator, pool, fitness center, hot breakfast.  They honored the military tax exemption and hotel rate.  I would look for another Mariott before staying here again if travel ever brought me back to this area.
