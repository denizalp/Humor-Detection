Moving on up! In case you don't know, Indian lunch buffet is a major food group for me. Currently, the Everest is the pinnacle of options. We discovered they recently changed chefs, and you can tell! New, tastier and spicier dishes, and  my fave saag in town. Some saag carries the spinach flavor a little too heavy, but here it is beautifully spiced. Plus, they have no problem preparing roti for us. Buffet bliss!
