This is in my opinion one of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas.  This place has been here for a really long time.  When you eat here you will see why they've been around so long.  \n\nThey offer great food, ample servings, great prices and great service.  \n\nI came here for lunch and really enjoyed it.  I've been here for dinner too.  \n\nGreat hours and plenty of parking available.
