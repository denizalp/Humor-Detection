They are ALL ABOUT GETTING YOUR MONEY. This \"Christian\" university is a for profit school just like University of Phoenix or Jacksonville University. The quality of education you receive is awful. 5 classes into my BSN degree, I was informed that I would have to take yet another class they \"forgot\" to include on the list needed to graduate. Every year you will have more surprise fees that didn't exist when you originally signed up or the year before. Save your money and get a real education at ASU, U of A, or any other online school.
