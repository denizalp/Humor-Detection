This a totally adorable (very) little breakfast spot, attached to Metro Pizza. The service is fast and friendly. I had the cornbread benedict, called Benecio del Porko. Seriously, so good, but the portion was huuuuge, and I could only eat half (and I have a really hearty appetite first thing in the morning\/afternoon). Highly reccomend, but could be a wait depending on the time of day you go.
