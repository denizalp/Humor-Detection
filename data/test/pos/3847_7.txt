A nice hotel overall, besides the fact that when you (we) check into a smoking room, you get a ashtray preloaded with cigarette butts. the decor is nice, a little out dated but clean. Breakfast is the usual fare, the pool and jacuzzi areas are nice, especially when it's 104 degrees at 10 pm. The staff is very friendly. I found a Bible museum in the lobby, really, a room dedicated to the bible with artifacts to view or buy if you choose.
