In general, waxing is the least pleasant grooming. I'd rather paint my nails, floss, deep condition my hair... anything other than waxing. Still, if you gotta rid yourself of hair, this is the place.\n\nI've used their waxing services on three occasions. Each time, the aestheticians were professional, efficient and friendly. It's the best wax treatment I've received in Phoenix.\nIn the past, I've had to change my appointment and they were quite flexible at reception.\n\nParking is tight. That place is crowded.
