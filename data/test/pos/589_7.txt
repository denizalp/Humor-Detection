To start, the chicken wings are fantastic.\n\nThe pizza is good as well. I prefer either the cheese pizza or the \"Gladiator\" pizza (sausage and pepperoni).\n\nBurgers -- whether it be the cheeseburger or \"Hurricane Fish Sandwich\" -- are excellent.\n\nThe food is simple, but remarkably delightful.\n\nMy only problem with LGO's pizzeria is parking (or rather, lack thereof). This is especially true if you visit at peak-dinnertime hours.\n\nAnd don't be the dude (or chick) that parks in a curbside parking spot -- without the intention of using cURBSIDE SERVICES -- only to spend two hours eATing INSIDE!!!! Use the valet, please.\n\nThank you.
