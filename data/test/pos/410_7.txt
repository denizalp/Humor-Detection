I don't really understand the negative reviews I've read. The service is decent and nice never run into any problems. I will say that my massage this time did not give me as much relief and I don't feel like there is a good standard for their employees. They also suggested an anti aging facial, which is more expensive to me and I'm 25. I really just wanted a cleansing one but they convinced me I needed it. Looking back I don't agree.
