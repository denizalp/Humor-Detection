Yesterday, I was confronted by one of Oakmont Bakery's   \nbrobdingnagian Gourmet Cinnamon rolls. Granular, snowy as a dead man's bones, and richer than the most lurid gossip, the icing that topped the dense, doughy, camel-colored roll was piled on thickly, perhaps to counteract the almost jowl-stinging cinnamon. \n\nI ate it so eagerly, I never thought to microwave it. Man, what radiation would do to such a pastry...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=X-mq-hFQuQ8
