Worst moving helpers ever! They showed up an hour late (I had to call them to confirm after they were 15 minutes late), and then dragged ass. What should've been complete about two hours ago, I am still waiting on them to finish up now. I'm watching them slowly work as I type this...knowing they're going to charge me extra for the time they went over! They are a joke. If I could give zero stars, I would.
