I shop here mainly for apples and berries during the year but in late May into July it's wild salmon season.  This week it is Copper River Silver Salmon.  Fresh fish is delivered Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday so plan your visits accordingly. \n\nI know I will be there next Tuesday for more Copper River Salmon. Don't get in my way or you may get trampled by the man with the blue Ivar's of Seattle \"Keep Clam\" hat.
