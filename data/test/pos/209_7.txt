I am the first person to review this place so you must listen to me. \n\nThis review is for their delivery service. \nBig serving sizes, they don't skimp on ingredients, fast delivery, good quality, but a little bland. They make a nice Cantonese Chow Mein.\n\nIt's not good enough for me to put more thought into this, or make a wordplay joke like 'it was 977th Heaven,' but I would order again.
