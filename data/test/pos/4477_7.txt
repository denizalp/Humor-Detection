The service was great considering the amount of people here. In hindsight, they warned us that it might take a while but service was as usual as a slow day. Something you have to try is the chicken bulgogi  and the red wine pork belly. Those are the must have in the restaurant. Also the service was great by Lisa, Blake, Kristina, Raymond and Samuel
