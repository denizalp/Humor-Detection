I came to pick up some teriyaki chicken before driving back to LA. Food quality and taste here was eh. The teriyaki was smothered in sauce and piled on top of rice. It was a little salty. It seems like they just carelessly put together the food. \n\nGiven its location, its intent is to serve students. Hence, generous portions, cheap prices and whatever tasting food.
