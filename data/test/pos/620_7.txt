If you are looking to dress up and dance then you must try this at least once. It's crowded over priced and plain insane but it's is an experience and if don't like to be smushed, hit on, and deaf afterwards this is not for you but if want to get in for free, Google No Cover Charge Las Vegas. Also they have special guest like Drake and Lil Wayne and practically give you free tickets. BTW they sell shoes in the girls restroom if your feet hurt.
