Hail to the Orange,\nHail to the Blue,\nHail Alma Mater,\nEver so true!\nWe love no other\nSo let our motto be\nVictory, Illinoisssssssssssssss! Varsity!\n\nThe best education you can get for your money if you're an in-state student.  Great student body, great classes, profs, world class research, great athletics (at least B-Ball was when I was there, although football kind always sucked) .   Long live the Chief!
