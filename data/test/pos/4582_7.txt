Im luvin the light texture of the snowflake ice cream. There are a lot of choices & toppings. The Gson & I went basic with the Cookie Dream. He luvd it. We shared a small for $4 n' change. Well enough for the both of us. I like the ambience of the cute lil store. We WILL be back. We walked from our apt. to here. Uhhh ohhh
