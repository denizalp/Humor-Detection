One of the first \"fine dining\" operations that I ever ate at. It helped me understand the true meaning of refined cuisine. However, I think it is important to mention that I ate here many years ago and things may have changed since then. One large setback is the high prices they charge, which may not necessarily make up for the quality of the food.
