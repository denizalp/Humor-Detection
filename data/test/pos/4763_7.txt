Ordered a steak and cheese hoagie. I ate less than half and threw the rest in the garbage. I was the only customer in there in the middle of the afternoon. The meat was just warm and they put cold cheese on the meat and never even melted the cheese which was very dry and tasteless. As I was leaving they never even asked how my food was as i had told them This was my first visit. I will never go back and I pass this place every day
