The rates are on the high side of average but you receive below average service. The facility was clean and kept up with a large array of kennels with individual outside access.\nThe staff is nice enough but don't be surprised when promises are made later to not be kept.\nNeed to pickup your pet afternoon? That will be an extra days charge. This is a business built on profit, not animal care.
