Always fun to drink way to much upstairs and go down and buy stuff I don't even need but that's OK.  Place is decorated great and errything is for sale but to quote Buggin' Out from Do the Right Thing \"How Come Ya' Aint Got No Brothas Up On The Wall?!!\"  Wish they had a better selection of ass-less chaps and siren whistles from the 80s but that's my perversion...not yours...
