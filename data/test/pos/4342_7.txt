Horrible experience here. The drive thru took forever AND messed up my order. They didn't give me the proper condiments that I ordered. And they also don't say hello, goodbye, or thank you. What terrible service. I had to deal with this because it was the closest thing to me and I was in a hurry and terribly hungry. A mistake that I won't make again!
