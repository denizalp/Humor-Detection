Lots of spacious room and seats for passengers coming in & out of McCarran! Plenty of charging spots for those who want to charge their cell phone. \n\nI will leave you with one piece of advice though. Avoid the slot machines in the airport, they are absolutely extra tight. You can now also take Uber\/Lyft to the airport from your hotel, it's almost half the cost of a cab. I have no idea if you can request an ride-sharing service to your hotel from the airport though.
