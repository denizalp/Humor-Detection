I can't believe that there is a funky vintage urban store that sells home furnishings, plates\/cups\/etc and general decor from the 1950s-70's.  I know that after a bit more serious looking I'm going to find some gems for my new pad here in Urbana, having relocated from the West Coast.\n\nThe highlight of today's trip?  Rifling through the music bins and finding a Rick Springfield 1981 \"Working Class Dog\" album.  Hells yes.  Now I can listen to Jessie's Girl on my turntable ironically ALL SUMMER.\n\nDon't judge me.
