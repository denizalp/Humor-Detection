We tried this place because a few people said it exuded nostalgia and was very good. It did exude nostalgia if you grew up going to depressing, run down, badly lit diners. The interior of this place was quite depressing and sometimes when Im happy and I think of this place I get a little depressed. Im giving it two stars because the ice cream sundae was pretty good and the service was quick and nice. Overall I give it a \"Mmm ice cream is worth the depression, I guess!\"
