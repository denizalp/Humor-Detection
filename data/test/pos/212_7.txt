GSC Therapy Services is nothing special at all.\nTherapy is OK at best.\nBilling is another matter.\nThey originally told me it would cost me $ 50 to $ 60 per 1 hr session.\nThey ended up billing me just over $ 75 per session.\nTo top it off, they then send me and my insurance company another bill, for a date of service that was two weeks after I'd finished my treatment. No wonder medical costs keep rising with companies submitting fraudulent claims (some of which probably slip by the insurance companies and patients, and actually get paid).
