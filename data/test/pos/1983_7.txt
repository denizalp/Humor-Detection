Professors here don't seem to care for their student. However I didn't expect much since I graduated from a tier one university. I'm only attending csn due to a pre-req for the roseman pharmacy program. \nI do like how they offer free parking to students.\nThe library needs more computers for their students since I can never find an available one.
