We decided to eat here because of the reviews. $35 for two kofta skewers with one spoonful of congealed hummus on a plate. My daughter had a few cubes of chicken. Basket of pita. Tea pot with two cheap bags of mint tea. Service was less than welcoming and spent more time serving a large group of people who were loud, rude, and obnoxious. Waited forever for the bill. I finally asked for it and was rudely told \"it's at the cash register\" like I was supposed to know that.  Don't waste your time.
