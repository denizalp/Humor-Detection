Yummy in my tummy!! New cute small place. Loved that it wasn't really big. Service was good. They have a happy hour menu and alcohol will be on the menu soon!! Yay! Had several things and everything was delish! The presentation was great. The combo fried rice was so good!! Definitely recommend this place! And definitely during happy hour!!
