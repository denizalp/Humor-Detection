Heaven for those who love SUGAR!\n\nRetro Bakery is the home of the the best cookie ever! \n\nThey've named this cookie the MEGA CHIP.\n\nThis cookie was crispy on the outside but gooey and soft on the inside! There were chunks\/chips of white chocolate, milk chocolate,peanut butter ,and whatever else that made the cookie just the most delightful cookie I've had in a while. \n\n\nI haven't had the chance to try very many things at Retro but I love everything that I have tried. \n\nI will be back.
