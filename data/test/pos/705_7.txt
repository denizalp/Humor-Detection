I love my sisters closet! They have a great selection of clothing, in a variety of sizes.  Pants, coats, shoes, purses and all sorts of nice stuff to choose from.  Plus, the prices are great!\n\nI bought a top here for $12.50, and I love it. Its in great condition, fits nice and it will go great in my wardrobe.  Plus, the sales staff was helpful and friendly.\n\nI plan on frequenting here more often, and really enjoyed the selection of clothes that they had, along with amazing prices.  yippie for my sisters closet!
