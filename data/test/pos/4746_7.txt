This place has a lot of nice guns, but holy smokes are they expensive!  I was shopping for a Glock 19 Gen 4 and visited over a dozen places around town including this place and it was one of the more expensive places.  I don't mind opening up my wallet, but when there are other options available, I won't do it.  They do offer one of the best selections of high quality guns under one roof...most other joints don't have as much inventory as this place.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%
