Okay, I didn't go here during prime time (it was before 8:00 pm) but the club looks great and the bartenders are awesome.  We had a couple of delicious specialty drinks and enjoyed talking to the staff.   \n\nThe fact that they have champagne on tap is pretty cool.  \n\nThe best part is that the delicious cocktails don't break the bank, but maybe I'm just used to NY prices.  In any event, if I wanted to go someplace a little fancy for a night on the town in Pittsburgh, I'd go here.
