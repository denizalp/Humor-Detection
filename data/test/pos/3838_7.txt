Despite what others say about Lai Lai Wok, I actually like this place. The prices are relatively cheap and the food is good. The lady that works the cash register is really nice too. I usually get the salt and pepper squid and fried pork chop over rice. Everything is so flavorful and perfectly seasoned. Did I mention it's cheap? My family loves it too. Always gotta stop by and get some takeout before I head home. Make sure you stop by!
