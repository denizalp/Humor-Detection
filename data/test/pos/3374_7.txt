Honestly, one star is too elevated a rating for this charmless, execrable dump.  My friend and I never got around to it in our undergraduate years, but we decided to give it a go on our \"reunion\" tour thirty years later.  What a mistake.  It only goes to show that PT Barnum was right and euthanasia may have untapped possibilities.  Grimy, foul-smelling, and lacking any d√©cor -- and those are its good points.  A pox upon it.
