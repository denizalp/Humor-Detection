I wish we had gotten there earlier as we had a very late check in and wife and I were only staying one night.\nThe hotel is beautiful and the room was big and fantastic.\nWe were on the 19th floor and had an amazing view of Pittsburgh.\nThe staff were extremely friendly and very helpful.\nI would definitely stay at the Westin again if in the area
