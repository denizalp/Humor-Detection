My wife and I had an awesome experience here. The staff is friendly and were so nice that we got to their chocolate chip cookies when I only asked does it taste good?  Sure enough it does!  I bought 8 - that's how good it was. \n\nInternet here is quite slow compared to Starbucks down the street but they've got something that Starbucks doesn't have, drive-thru. Very convenient when your on the go. \n\nGreat place to chill out with family and friends.
