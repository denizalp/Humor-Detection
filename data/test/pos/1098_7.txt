Love this restaurant. Great food. Big portions. Friendly servers. \n\nThe only cons I can think of:\n\n is the parking is a little difficult. I have only been there early part of the day. I can imagine it could get tricky if it got busy.\n\nI prefer to drink white Zinfandel. But their reisling is pretty good.
