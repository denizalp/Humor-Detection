A local burger joint that's been around for as long as I can remember. Sometimes it's hard to pick out what to eat since there are a billion items on their menu.\n\nThe last time I went, I ordered the sourdough double cheese burger with bacon and avocado.\n\nHow was it? It was as if a sourdough jack made a beautiful baby with a BLT. Grilled sourdough with 2 burger patties, american cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato and generous portions of avocado. One word, amazing.\n\nI've also had the gyro here, which was better than My Big Fat Greek Restaurant IMO.
