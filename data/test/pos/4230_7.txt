WARNING, don't fill out any paperwork.  I have been hounded for sales pitches saying I've won a free prize, I just have to give them a few hundred dollars to hold it.\n\nIt's really sad that you get scammed to \"win\" something  that cost money.  How much money do these guys need to milk out of people.\n\nJust remember Glen Garry Glenn Ross: A.B.C.  Always Be Closing.
