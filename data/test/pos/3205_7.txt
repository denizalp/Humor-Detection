This store is something special.  Everything is laid out well and things are easy to find.  The selection is excellent with a heavy dose of local writers.  I like that there are comfy chairs and great places to sit and read.  The whole store evokes more of a library vibe rather than a bookstore.  The staff is very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.  This is a marvelous addition to Squirrel Hill, and a great alternative to the chain bookstores.  I look forward to going back soon!
