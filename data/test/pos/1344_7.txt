Visited only once, but remember wanting to go back.  Blame it on my ever-growing list of places to try!  That's why I cannot agree whenever people tell me that great food is nowhere to be found here in the valley.  Are you kiddin' me??\n\nTried a couple of sandwiches, and surprise, the veggie one stole the show.  Awesome durian shake.  (Note: you must know and love durian, or you may be in for a surprise!).\n\nTake some baguettes home.  \nCash only.
