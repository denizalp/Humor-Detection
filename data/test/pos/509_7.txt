If you like a $17 vodka martini (that's right, no typo!), doughy and tasteless pizza, and small main course portions of average-tasting pasta, then this is the place for you! Another reviewer was disappointed in the bread, but we were not since we never received any. Isabella's is a very attractive restaurant, but it is kind of like a date with eye candy - a georgeous person but lacking in the brains department.
