Mostly cheap outlet stores and flea market on weekends.  However, they have a few high end stores such as Tommy, Rockport, Mexx and Puma.  Rockport is just a normal outlet, but Mexx has some decent deals. \n\nDesigner Depot also recently opened up and they used to be own by Hudson Bay, but are now owned by International Clothiers and sell the exact same stuff.  Not very good quality, just a re-branding of the same poor quality stuff from International Clothiers (i.e. shirts get the cotton puffy thingy's after 2-3 washes.
