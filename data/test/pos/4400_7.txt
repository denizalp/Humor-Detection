A little out of the way but worth your time! \n\nBy far Top Gear is the BEST automatic carwash and wand wash in the Northern Hills!\n\nGreat prices. Cheapest automatic carwash is $5 and they go up from there. I usually spend $10.\n\nYou can choose from foam brush or touch less wash.  The options seem endless. \n\nThe wand wash area is large and very clean. Again more options than I've ever seen. All the standard wash options plus plus plus. Vacuum. Carpet shampoo. Air freshener spray.
