Horrible horrible service. Truly ruined my Sunday night dinner. Waited for someone to seat us and nothing. Then we asked to be seated and then waited 14 minutes! When I lost my patience and went to a server and had to ask for service! Unbelievable! Meanwhile the 2 servers were taking their time doing in urgent things like cleaning table instead of attending customers. So disgusted. I will contacting the owner and possibly the health dept!!!
