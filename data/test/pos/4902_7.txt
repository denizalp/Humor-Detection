This is still the same magical Thai food they used to do in the food court of Le Faubourg St. Catherine only now they are located in the Gay Village and they finally accept debit cards. I had my usual here, Shrimp Pad Thai medium spicy and there has been no change.  The same Thai auntie and her husband still oversee the cooking and make sure everything is done right.\n\n\nThe only change is that it is now a sit-down Resto which still does take-out.\nAnother reason to come to the village more often!
