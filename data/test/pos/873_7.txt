Honestly, this pace is a key shop. Nothing sexy about it, but I wanted to give these guys some major Yelp props. I came here to get a few keys made for my apartment, mailbox, and pool and I was literally out the door in ten minutes. \n\nNo messing around, just straight to business. Which is fine by me because I don't know about you, but I don't really want spend my spare time hanging in a key shop.
