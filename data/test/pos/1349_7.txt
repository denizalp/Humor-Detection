Went last night based on favorable reviews. Ordered the special Tuna Tartar and got a tuna Salad. Then Specifically said do not bring the Tartar... Guess what brought that as well.. Truly a language barrier the rolls did not tasted right and my Tuna Sashimi was dry and fell apart as I picked it up.
