I can easily say this is one of the best ramen I've had in the States. Choice of Tonkotsu (pork), Shoyu (soy-sauce), Tonkotsu-Shoyu, or Miso based soup... The noodles are near perfect texture, cooked al-dente, and the chashu is delightful -- Tender.\n\nAside from a bowl of Tonkotsu ramen, we had some gyoza and mini-mentaiko-don. Nothing disappointing here. The service is good ol' japanese efficient and friendly. \n\nOnly downside is the size of the spot, but that is also what keeps its' authenticity. \n\nMonta ramen wa chooooo oishiiiiii! , mainichi tabetai!
