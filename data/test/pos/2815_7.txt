This is by far the worst restaurant ever.  Sammy and Amy are so rude.  I ordered the burger and it was undercooked. I tried to send it back to have it cooked a bit more and they told me know.  I will never go back to this place. Everyone, please save your money.  Mcdonalds has much better service and a better burger than these guys.
