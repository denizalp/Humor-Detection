Kama, you ain't no goddess of love. Your buffett is a sloppy, unholy mess. Never again in your shrine will I set foot, no matter how starched your table cloth is or how twinkling your lights are.\n\nChicken rafts bobbing aimlessly in an atlantic ocean of butter chicken curry...sad looking veggies... out of a box desserts that are cloyingly sweet...sinewy tandoori chicken... very, very sad looking chafing dishes... appearances matter, so keep them up.\n\nThe servers are very good tho. Kudos!\n\nKama is a flighty temptress, so be warned!
