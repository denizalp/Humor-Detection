Old school surroundings but this shouldn't deter you from finding what you need.  Each department  is fully stocked with your basic needs in addition to some great specialty items.  I noticed a wide range of locally produced and sourced items in stock.\n\nClean, spacious aisles and displays.  Staff and service reflects their pride in this community market.  Convenient location to major roadways and neighborhoods.
