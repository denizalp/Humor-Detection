My first encounter with Raising Cane's was in Louisiana and when I came back to the West Coast, I was literally on the hunt to find this place but never did I accomplish! That was, until my trip to Las Vegas baby! I love this place, everything is fresh and never frozen! Their sweet tea is tasty! Too bad this place just has to be so far away from me, oh how I miss you so.
