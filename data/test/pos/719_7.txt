This place has the worst lines, rude ass servers and the meat is super low quality. Trying to pass off some chinese gmo plastic rice feed beef as quality???  I obviously can just go to chinatown if i wanted that low quality rude service! \nI would def not spend you hard earned moneys here. \nUnethically run business.  Stay away.
