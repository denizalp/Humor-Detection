3.5...\n\nCool concept!\n\nHuge bar, chill atmosphere. \n\nYou have oversized booths on one side of the room with big screen TVs (for video consoles\/gaming), then you have your large bar in the middle, and lastly on the other side of the bar you have all your old school video games. \n\nIt was dim inside, which made it kinda cool to \"play\" games in the dark.
