Amateurs. They have no clue. Sorry, no clue. \n\nThey have no clue about food, no clue about flavor and no clue about any ambience. I mean, if you see the hodge-podge: sports jerseys, televisions...and it's not a sports bar!\n\nI ordered the scallops. They were baby bay not large. They were virtually tasteless. And tables in a public restaurant in America should have salt and pepper.  They did not however salt alone could not fix these scallops. \n\nI cannot recommend this joint, period.
