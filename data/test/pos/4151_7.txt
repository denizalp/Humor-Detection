Hidden gem!!! When we went, it was 4pm and no one else was eating but that's okay cause we got our food very quickly.\n\nWe ordered the octopus tostada, fish tacos, octopus tacos, the raw shrimp taco, and chicken fingers and fries.  Everything was sooooo delicious that we ended  up ordering some to go! Best tostada I've tasted!! \n\nI can't wait to eat here again when I'm visiting Vegas.
