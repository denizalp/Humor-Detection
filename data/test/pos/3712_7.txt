Friendly service, delicious tacos! Love how they have updated. TT is attracting a diverse clientele: college students, ties after work drinking beer and soda in chilled bottles, retirees, newcomers and regulars congregate under one festive awning. I introduced daughter number 2 to this favorite snack place. This skeptical critic gave TT an AMAZING! I couldn't agree more! Carne asada and al pastor are both fabulous. Try it with the salsa verde, my favorite sauce.
