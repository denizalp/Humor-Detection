Avoid this place at all costs. The food is disappointing. Also, the owner (manager?) regularly blocks the bike lane in front of the shop to unload food items from his car. It's not only illegal, but dangerous to road users. Besides, the car looks very dirty on the inside. I wouldn't want to eat anything that has been transported in there.
