I would give this place 5 stars if they had a dryer. They have a no-touch drive-through car wash that costs $5-8 and it's great and makes the inside of your car smell like shampoo. But, it leaves you soaking wet.\n\nSo bring your towels! \n\nOr if you're feeling extra productive and energetic, you can hand wash your car here too
