Food was amazing. Had a pork belly taco and a bulgogi taco, that woulda been filling enough. Then split the bulgogi tots those were great too, decent portion size. Definitely full after leaving woulda been fine with just the two tacos. \n\nDefinitely want to come back and try other menu items\n\nOnly thing I regret is I forgot to request kimchi (only a fault of my own )  \n\nWill most definitely be coming back.,
