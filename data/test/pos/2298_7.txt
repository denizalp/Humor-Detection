Just an average BBQ place. I was the only customer during lunch and decided to order a combo sandwich. I chose pull porked and sliced brisket. The sandwich was modest and could definitely fit into those skinny jeans. The sandwich tasted good. I had beans as a side and they were just okay for me. I added a soda and the final bill came to $13.20 before TIP. So I'll just leave this place to others with deeper pockets than me.
