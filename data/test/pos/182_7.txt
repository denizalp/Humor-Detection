I've only  couple weeks  but every class I've been to has been uncomfortably crowded. You've got maybe 5 inches before your mat hits the one in front of you and 2 inches between the mat to your left and right. The instructors seem to be fairly knowledgeable, but you can't do every pose correctly because of the lack of space. Having to focus on not colliding with the other Yogis takes away from the experience - something I haven't needed to worry about at other studios. And the new place  be open in 2 more month
