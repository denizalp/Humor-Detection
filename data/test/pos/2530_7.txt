Situated just across from the valet, Vdara dog park is extremely convenient when taking the pup out. The park is clean, with the exception of those losers who don't pick up after their dogs. There's plenty of space for the puppers to run around and burn off some steam. \n\nThe view is great and for the most part, secluded. They supply plenty of doggie poop bags, so please use them if you forgot yours at home or in the room.
