Kiosk. $3 fee but so worth it. \n\nAnd when I can't go to the kiosk, I have never experienced that \"horrible\" staff at this location either. \n\nThis location does tend to be the busiest but with wait times now listed on their website why would you be a dumb ass and go when they are busy? If you do and then complain about it, that would be your fault.
