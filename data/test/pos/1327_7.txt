I love the decor of this place! I also loved that they did not have a SODA machine in there. About time a place realizes that stuff is bad for you. The menu options were great but they did take a long time for the food to come out. I got a juice here and it was probably only 12 oz vs the 16 oz I paid for due to there being ice in it and was still not filled to the top!
