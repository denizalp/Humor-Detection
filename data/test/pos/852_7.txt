Oh you know, my never ending quest to find the best massage places in the city... continues. \n\nWhat I liked: \nIt's close to home, convenient and had availability when I call 20 minutes prior. \n\nWhat was ok: \nThe massage. It wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad. \n\nWhat I did not like: When the door opens, the outside light coming is really bright! \n\nWould I come back: Probably not. There are far more options that are better, and not that far away.
