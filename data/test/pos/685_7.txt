My favorite restaurant. The food is always perfect. Service is great, atmosphere excellent. The orange chicken with the five vegetable fried rice is my favorite meal anywhere! They will email you specials and coupons if you sign up. For dessert, the berries flambe are really good and of course it is fun to watch them set it on fire table side!
