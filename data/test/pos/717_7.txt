Like the location since it's close to my house, but the burrito makers SUCK at wrapping my burritos. Don't they teach you how to roll burritos in training? Geez.\n\nEvery time I go here this one guy behind the counter-- for the sake of Yelp anonymity we'll call him \"Freako Suave\" tries to spit 'game' at me -- ew, I think I just threw up in my mouth a little. Since when do I look like I'd date a guy who works at Chipotle??!
