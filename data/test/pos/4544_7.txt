I'm quickly learning just how overpriced Vegas is. \n\nTypical hotel overpriced X 2= Vegas prices\n\nAnyway, hungry. Want salad. So hungry regular sentences not used and speaking in passive.\n\nGreek salad. Perfect.\n\n$18. At this point don't care.\n\nTake-out was super speedy,\n\nActually the salad was great and the ingredients were super fresh. Two varieties of tomatoes, tons of lettuce, onions, feta, red peppers, great pita chips. Literally my perfect version of greek salad.\n\n$18...not the perfect price
