Nice healthy selection of salads, paninis, wraps and Hawaiian BBQ. You also have the option to build your own salad. I went for the Asian BBQ beef salad and am glad I did! Spring mix, jicama, carrots, orange, breadcrumb and a delicious spicy ponzu vinegerette! The cashier also recommended the C Square which can be served as a salad or sandwich. If you're in the area, they are worth it for lunch!! About $9-15.
