i finally made out to Joe's farm grill for the first time today.  we both have been eating healthy at home for the last couple of weeks and decided to treat ourselves today! we both ordered the farm burger and the sweet potatoes fries and we shared some onion rings...oh my, these bad boys are crazy unhealthy for you but so good.  this place did live up to the hype and the burgers were both tasty and fresh. give it a try if you are in the mood for gourmet fast food.
