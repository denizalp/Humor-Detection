The service here is funny like a sad clown, the cashier ignored me for 2-3 minutes just gossiping to another lady. While I stood there like a neglected tree, I tried flailing my arms like a pelican with no reaction from her. Decided to leave but someone from the back came out and took my order just in time. Still angry I drowned my frustrations in their delicious jerk pork w\/ coco bread. Tasty Food over Poor service wins this time ! I will be back.
