I didn't actually think it was going to be $3... But it was! My morning coffee costs more, and I don't leave starbuck's with perfectly arched eyebrows like I did leaving this salon. The salon is clean and the staff was friendly and nice. I will definitely return for my biweekly eyebrow threading, even if it does take me 30mins to drive here. So worth it, and way better than the \"perfect threading\" salon that is closer to me.
