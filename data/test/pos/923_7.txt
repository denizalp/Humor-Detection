Nope nope nope. This place is so cramped I don't understand how people come here to study. Ordering a coffee will make you claustrophobic since you're going to either have to wait out the door or squished to the wall. Id you can deal with that then the two stars are because they make yummy coffee. If you can't then don't bother. Walk a few blocks and you'll either end up at a Starbucks or another one of MTL's cafes, without having to awkwardly brush bodies with people or hugging your backpack so you don't knock someone out.
