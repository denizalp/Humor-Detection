I don't know what is wrong with that Bonnie L who wrote a rhyming review just to be funny but it was stupid.\nThis place is a hidden gem it is real fresh and I imagine this is like getting a home cooked meal in China.  The lamb skewers were Soooooo good.  Dry wontons were amazing and the dumplings were great!! You cannot beat the bang for the buck here and everyone is super nice !!! Highly recommend you try this place out!
