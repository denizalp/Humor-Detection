This may have been the lamest massage I have ever had and I get them regularly. Being from out of town, this spot happen to be convenient. First, I called for the appointment and they asked if I wanted deep tissue- I did.  So they gave me a choice of therapists. The guy I got either DID NOT do deep tissue OR Massage Envy doesn't know what deep tissue is. Either way, lousy experience. A rub down with no deep pressure on the paraspinous muscles. He kept asking if the pressure was ok?  There was no pressure!
