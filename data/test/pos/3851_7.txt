Central is now serving their Cold Brew Coffee on tap. That's right, boys and girls. Get your coffee over ice, in a pint glass or to go, straight from the draught built into the bar.\n\nAlso, the updated menu board is gorgeous. Can't wait to see it when it's finished.  \n\nAnd there was much rejoicing throughout the land.
