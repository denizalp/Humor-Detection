HORRIBLY AWFUL!!!  1 Punk Girl and 1 dirty cook was there at 1 pm for lunch on a Friday. I walked in, waited a minute then sat myself. Girl was behind the counter with her feet up texting. She acknowledged me. I had to get up after that and get my own menu. Lazy girl. Placed my order at the counter to speed things up. She seemed inconvenienced by me. She put the order in. I heard the cook in the back making my order. He kept sneezing. Freaked me out.
