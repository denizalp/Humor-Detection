I was excited to check out their happy hour (offered every day from 5-7) because I'm obsessed with oysters and ordered 18 oysters for $1 each. I also ordered calamari and beer. Sadly the oysters were average - small and extra salty (I think the salt is served on fell onto the oysters). I also found the calamari over-seasoned and chewy. Their patio was quaint with a decent amount of seating and the service was good. I saw many people order the dips, so I'll try one of those next time and skip the oysters and calamari.
