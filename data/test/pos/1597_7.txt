A friend recommended me this place, and I've been coming here ever since. The club itself is great, the times that i have gone is never jam packed, sure its crowded but not as crowded as some of the other clubs in Vegas that you hardly have any elbow room. The ambiance is great, dark but clear enough to see the people surrounding you ;)
