Chipotle but Poke! I love the concept of Ahipoki Bowl. Pick a base (white rice, brown rice, salad, etc), seafood (Ahi, spicy tuna, scallops, etc), add some sides (avocado, cucumber salad, crab salad, etc) and a sauce (I always got the spicy house). \nFor $9, you receive 2 scoops of seafood in a bowl filled with healthy goodness. \nTo counteract the healthiness, ice cream filled macaroons are offered for dessert. Get the coffee flavored one. You're welcome.\nIf poke is your thing, give Ahipoki bowl a try!
