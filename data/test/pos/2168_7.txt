Given the experience that we had last night, I am not surprised that toronto agrees this club is awful.  My friend had booked a booth which would have been 3 bottles.  We show up with 3 extra people (you know how last minute some people are) which leads to the bouncers saying maybe the extra people will get in after a half hour.. Or commit to TWO extra bottles.  Meanwhile, its -30 outside and there is no lineup.  These assholes simply do not care about your business.
