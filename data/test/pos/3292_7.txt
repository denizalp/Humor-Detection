Enjoy coming to this library.  It's a private library working with funds donated and numerous volunteers.   Since my daughter lives in the area we were able to get a few cultural passes allowing you to go free to many different places.  They occasionally offer classes on the weekends for people to attend at no cost. They have a book store that have items for sale at very reasonable prices.  Even credit cards are accepted.  When in Cave Creek area stop in.
