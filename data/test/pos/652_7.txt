This catering company went above and beyond any normal standards. Not only was the food extremely yummy, they were courteous, well-priced and even mopped the floor after the event! I would recommend this catering company to ANYONE and EVERYONE! Try the veggies and the delicious coleslaw, also the incredibly unique sandwiches--ALL ARE FABULOUS! Half the price of most caterers!
