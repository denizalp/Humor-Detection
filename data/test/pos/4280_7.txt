The following review is from our 8 year old boy:\n\nI really like d and b. The only thing I didn't like was that you might loose who you are with. I got lost while playing a game. I like the arcade and bowling, they are so much fun. Mozzarella sticks are our favorite dish. Birthdays there are awsome.
