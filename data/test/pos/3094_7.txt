Can't comment on the shopping aspect here because I didn't do any of that. However, I had a lot of clothes I wanted to sell so I took them here. My friend told me that I probably wouldn't even get $10 because these places are so picky which was pretty discouraging.\n\nWRONG YOU WERE MY FRIEND!\n\nI made out with $145 bucks. CHA-CHING!!!!!!! \n\nYou might as well just try taking your stuff here. The worst they can say is no and then you can just donate them which is probably better karma anyway.
