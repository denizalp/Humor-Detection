Waste of time.\n\nSmall, overpriced, lame.  There are more Chumlee mugs than legit pawn shop items.  I'd rather go to an antique shop.\n\nAlso, NOT open 24 hours a day as advertised.  Showed up at around 7:50 and was told they closed in 10 minutes.  Really?  The sign says we never close and you are telling me that I only have 10 minutes until closing time?  Ridic.\n\nI am a fan of the show but would not go back to this shop again.
