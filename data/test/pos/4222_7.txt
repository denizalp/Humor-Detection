Even though I was with a bunch of Asians, because we were chatting in English, we got the Western treatment!!\n\nThey didn't give us the lai tong (comp soup), weren't the friendliest and the service took forever.\n\nWe switched it up and only talked to the staff in english, but then would talk to each other in Chinese.\n\nFood itself was acceptable, but ain't going back.
