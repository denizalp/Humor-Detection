Eggcited about their Buttermilk Pancakes!!\n\nThe only thing I remember was their pancakes! They're butterlicous good!! The buttermilk pancakes are so rich in flavor, the whole thing's practically butter, but its just so darn goooooood! \n\nEggs and bacon were standard -- tastes like you can make 'em @ home.\n\nGreat Customer service!
