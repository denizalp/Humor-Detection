GREAT HAPPY HOUR SPOT!!\n\nI really love the atmosphere at this ahso. The layout is nice and open compared to other locations. \n\nThe happy hour menu is the main reason I visit this place so often. They have a great selection for both food and drinks. \n\nThe staff here is always super friendly and seem like they enjoy being there. \n\nI really wish they didn't close so early during the week, sometimes i have to race here from work to get in before they close.
