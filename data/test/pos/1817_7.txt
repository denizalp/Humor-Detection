I used to enjoy coming here, but today after I ate a couple pieces of my chicken from my dark meat chicken pho,and I told the waitress the soup was very salty, can I cxl it if it's possible, and she said\"your ordered it and you already eat it, can't cxl it\" really?????? She didn't even offer me and see if I want to exchange something else, what kind of service is that? Sometimes a good reputation and service is more important than the money !!!
