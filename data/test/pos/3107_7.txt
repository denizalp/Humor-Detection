This particular Unique is probably one of the best. It might be because Lake Countians are afraid of thrifting -- so that leaves more of a selection for me. \n\nI love how the clothing is divided by color. It's pretty helpful when you just want black, black, or black. \n\nI just wish I could find more vintage items here. \n\nMondays are half off on certain items. It's always very crowded on those days but if you're patient, it might be worth dealing with the crowd.
