Top notch?  I think not.\n\nMy husband sustained an injury at a local hotel.  We called Henness and Haight and described the situation.  A 57 year old man falls at the hotel pool and breaks his hip.  He's now at a local hospital recovering from surgery.  HENNESS AND HAIGHT DECLINED REPRESENTING.  Adding insult to injury, I just saw the partners' commercial on television.  While seemingly compassionate on television, my experience says otherwise.
