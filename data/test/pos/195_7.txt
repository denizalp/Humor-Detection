First time visiting this Chinese food.place in the area close to my bf's place.  It's a typical Chinese take out and delivery with no actual place for sitting.   The food was ordered and received in decent timing.  Got it home to see that everything appeared fresh, but nothing really from the ordinary made it stand out. Not exactly interested or dying to visit again.
