I love Baskin Robbins!  However, I live in Pahrump and the closest store is 41 miles away. Can you imagine my EXTREME disappointment when I got home to enjoy my \"hand-packed quart\" which looked to be only 3\/4 full?!?!? Thanks for ruining my night Jared.  Hopefully my tip in the College Fund jar will help you learn how much a quart is.
