Dined here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was okay.  Ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza that lacked flavor, a side Caesar salad that required more dressing and was quite expensive for the small size it was.  Best part of my lunch was the croutons, that tasted homemade.  We also order a side of mac and cheese with jalapenos and that was rather tasty.\nService was good and manager was pleasant when I requested more dressing. Not sure I will seek them out again.
