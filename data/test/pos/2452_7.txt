I think I got lucky because I had barely any wait time. My check in time was 3:30p, I arrived about 5-10 minutes late. I was done with checkout by 3:52pm\nCalled back to the next person. By 3:58. \nI agree there are an excessive amount of steps.\nHowever, I was sitting in my car by 4:15pm\nNot too shabby
