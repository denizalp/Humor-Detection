If you know me...its all about the appetizer menu....and once again We Kicked Ass!!  4:30 and it was a full on Appy Fest!\n\nKILLER Calamari.....chunky guaco goodness from heaven.....and mediocre queso.   Super Rita's and an all round FABULOUS time!\n\nThe queso is made with an obvious b√©chamel base then the cheese is added....our queso was very grainy hinting at too much flour in the base.  That is the only flaw in this otherwise sublime experience.  Go Go Go!
