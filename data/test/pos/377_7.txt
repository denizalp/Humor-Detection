Bad, bad and more bad. Dirty,  unkept. A\/C broke it i was 87 in my apt at 10 o' clock at night, took them weeks to handle the situation. They could seem to care less. I fixed things there  ( cabinets,  frige, sink ) and they still didnt return my dep. apt was left spotless and shampooed. They lost packages from the mail. There are roaches everywhere, who knows what other bugs. All in all just bad! I want to leave 0 stars!!!
