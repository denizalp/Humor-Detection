The reason why im giving this place 5 stars because its the only one left in Las Vegas. We need to keep candy shops like this alive because they are no where to be found anymore. If theres another candy shop that has even close what Sweet Factory provides please let me know because i truly doubt it. They used to be at every mall now just this last one standing.
