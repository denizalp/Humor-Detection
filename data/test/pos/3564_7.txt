YAY Trader's! That's what we local Hawaiians say whenever we visit. Just sad there is no store that is closer than 2,582 miles away (Orange County California) or 2,751 miles away (Summerlin, Nevada).\n\nYou can always spot a local Hawaiian by the stuff they have in their carts, which usually consists of Wasabi Almonds, Cranberry Drizzle Dunkers (my favorite), Thai Chili Almonds and Cashews, Cookie Butter and their dried fruits. The prices are spot-on and the service is super friendly and top-notch!\n\nOur next planned trek will be to a Trader's 3,340 miles away...stay tuned! :-)
