Pages is the real deal. An old school bookstore. No homeware here or yoga accessories or anything else but books and magazines and other products with words in them.\n\nThey have a lot of books and magazines you can't find anywhere else and they also have listings and posters for word poetry and for book signings and stuff. So if you like books, this place is way better than those other chain spots.
