Great furniture store that takes the stress out of furniture shopping. Prices, service and selection that is everything you want and none of the over-selling you don't want. \n\nFamily-owned by the nicest husband and wife team you'll meet. Their some works there now, too. \n\nFrom competitive-priced furniture that you will see at any other shop, to custom, hand-made furniture, this is the place. Their mattress selection is incredible and very high quality. I'm extremely satisfied with my total experience at Ideal. Thanks, Jerry and Christina!
