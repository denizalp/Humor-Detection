Chandeliers and men in tuxedos, do not equal 'good food'. \nThe dishes tasted like the most basic catered wedding food. I imagine the cook only knows of two seasonings, salt and pepper; both were used sparingly. The dessert tray resembled cakes from a diner display case, not the expensively priced sugar prizes they were purported to be. Good place for grandparents or anyone who considers mini gerkins on toothpicks to be the height of sophistication.
