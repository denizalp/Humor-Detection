Mathew and Terry were great. Terry was polite, enthusiastic, and attentive. Mathew was bussing, but he took care of us when our server went on break and the next server to cover was stuck in traffic. If anyone's been to any of the other AYCE Korean BBQ places, you'll know that the service is far better. People enjoy working here. It's very well ventilated, and the quality of the meats are pretty good. I've been here a couple of times, and I know my friends, family, and I will be back again.
