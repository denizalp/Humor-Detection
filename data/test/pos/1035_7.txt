Watch out for this place! If you find a price online, don't expect them to honor it. Read the fine print as \"bait and switch\" is apparently the way they do business. If it sounds too good to be true, it is. Especially beware of an unprofessional sales manager with anger issues. I will never return to this dealership. They wasted 2 hours of my day.
