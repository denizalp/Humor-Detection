This place is a warning sign right from the get go. The place just downright stinks, one is hit with this wallop of foul smells which makes me wonder how do they get away with health code checks. \nThe prices are even higher than your mainstream grocery stores. Heck I am not sure why one would shop here when one can a fresh live lobster (even steamed or boiled for free ) at the same or lower prices. I could stand five minute and had to walk away. \nStay away folks.
