Located inside of the Four Seasons hotel, Verandah is an elegant hide-away from the noisy and crowded Mandalay Bay.  \n\nI came here with a few business friends for lunch...took the recommendation from the waiter and had the Seafood Insalate.  \n\nLobster, crab, jumble shrimp, sliced boiled egg, tomatoes, greens.  \nHealthy, refreshing, Abundant.  \nI loved it except the price --$26.   \nFood in Vegas is insanely expensive these days.  For that price we get two entries in LA.  \n\nWait staff is professional and friendly.\nInterior is stylish and beautiful.\n\nI will probably come back to try their signature items.
