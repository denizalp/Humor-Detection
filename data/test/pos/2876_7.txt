Everyone talks about the San Diego zoo but the Phoenix zoo gives them a run for their money.  The dinosaur exhibit was awesome!  I don't know how long it will be here but the man made dinosaur exhibit moved and looked like the real thing.  If you are in the area, it is worth checking out.  I have been to at least a dozen zoos and this was by far the best.
