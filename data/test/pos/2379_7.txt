Wow! For an airport meal, this can't be beat.\n\nLine moves pretty fast. \nI hate salads, but I got the quinoa vegetable salad, and it was really great to eat. Satisfying, flavorful, fresh, and didn't hold me down. Served with a great piece of bread, which is the secret to keeping anyone normal happy.\n\nAirport prices as expected, but surprisingly not too terrible; a filling salad was $10, and God knows what else I could have spent $10 in that airport instead.
