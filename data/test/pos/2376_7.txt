It has been years since I last stopped here. Whole bunch of new menu items. Some new paint in places. Just happened to be in the area wondering where to grab a bite to eat. I had a corned beef Reuben and it was OK. Service was decent and friendly. Every few years I get a craving for a beef and cheddar or two and stop at whatever one I am near.
