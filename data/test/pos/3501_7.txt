This place is conveniently located on the first floor. Best part is that it opens 24hr! My waitress is great, she kept on checking on me making sure I am satisfied with my meal. I order a strawberry lemonade and an omelette. The bill comes to be $20, what a steal! The strawberry lemonade is too sweet for my taste, but it's still good after diluting it with some water. The omelette is also worth to try if you're an omelette fan and enjoy goat cheese.
