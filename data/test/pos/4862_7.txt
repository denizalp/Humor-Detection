During my trip to Charlotte, NC, my family and I had an opportunity to dine at George's Brasserie. It is now one of my favorite French restaurants and I am sad that it's all the way in the East Coast!\n\nLoved their elegant yet cozy\/homie atmosphere that was accompanied by friendly service that made me feel very welcome. The food was just phenomenal! Each dish had its own unique flavor which kept me wanting more even after I was full.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!
