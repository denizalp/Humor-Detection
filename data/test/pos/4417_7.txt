As a guy it's a little unnerving getting a \"Brozillian\". I got my first one on 9\/10\/12 with Amy. (I may have been the first guy at The Birthday suit) It was a birthday present from my wife. I must say it wasn't as bad as I thought. Amy was super professional and made me feel relaxed... Well as relaxed as I could possibly be in this situation. Lol. Great conversations kept my mind too busy to think about what was going on. I'll be going back for another.
