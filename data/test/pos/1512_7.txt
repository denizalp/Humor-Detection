One of most strategically located hotels on the strip. Almost everything is at a walkable distance from this hotel which works in favour of the hotel.\n\nOur room was nice,spacious with a really nice theme. The front desk staff was helpful and attentive. Well there is Miracle Mile which consist of all the major brands selling the merchandise. One can spend almost a full day on the miracle mile. They have couple of good bars and restaurants inside. They also night clubs Koi and Chateau inside which are really club spots.
