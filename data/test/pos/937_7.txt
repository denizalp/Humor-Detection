Awful food and Amy and her husband were very rude to me and my family. I tried a salad and the lettuce was brown and slimy. My wife had the chicken dish and it was dry and rubbery. When I complained the husband told me I could take my business elsewhere. He then proceeded to cuss me out when I demanded a refund. Won't be back again.
