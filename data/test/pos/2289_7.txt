Food wasn't even hot...one of the worst buffets I've been to.  The only thing I liked about this buffet was the chocolate fountain where you can make your own chocolate dipped strawberries.  Besides that, the food was eh and below average.  If you have a choice, please do yourself a favor and try a different buffet.  \n\nThe only good thing is that there's really no wait and you get a nice view of the beautiful flamingos outside.
