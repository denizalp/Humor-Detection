Drove from the faaar north east valley to this market to pick up some ingredients to make eggrolls for my hubby.  Left with five bags full of goodies!\n\nThe market is somewhat large, clean, and has a great selection of asian food items.  I bought a bunch of filipino food that I've not had in way too long.  The price point was good and the employees were very friendly and helpful.\n\nIt was a LONG drive for me, but I'll definitely go back.
