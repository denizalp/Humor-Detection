Not very many stars here...not too sure why, I've never had a bad experience with any carry out items.  I've been coming here on & off for several years and have always had pretty decent food.  This being said, I almost always only get hot & sour soup without chicken OR plain lo mein w\/ water chestnuts.  Kind of hard to mess that up. \n\nI have never dined in.  The lady behind the counter has been there every day for years.  She's always really nice and starts a conversation.  The food is ready quickly.  Prices are decent as well.
