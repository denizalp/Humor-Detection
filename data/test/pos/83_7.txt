Authentic tummy Taiwanese desserts. \nMy favorites here are the tofu pudding, shaved ice and taro ball ice. \nThe herbal Kelly is a little too bitter for me but good too. \n\nI love all of their toppings especially the mini taro balls. \n\nThis place is great if you're not a fan of overly sweet desserts.\nEverything  is very refreshing,, especially in this Vegas heat I They have hot desserts as well so I'll visit when it's cool outside too.
