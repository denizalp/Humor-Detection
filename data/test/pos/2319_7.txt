Rented a home in summerlin, they wont fix anything. The home was broken into several times they dont care. total con artist slum lords. RUN AWAY! Dont do it!! I held in there for two years, it was honestly the worst experience of my adult life.\n\nTotal Las Vegas Con- There really are far better out there. I have found an amazing Property Management company. Dont do it, seriously.
