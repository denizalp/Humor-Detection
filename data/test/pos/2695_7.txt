Good food for $11.99 lunch buffet.\nNot a great in quality but good for a quick afternoon lunch with more variety.Being vegetarian we had plenty of options.Definitely place needs some change in menu day by day as I was there 2 times in 5 days menu had Same desert and Host needs to work on brining NAAN little faster then picking up plates.
