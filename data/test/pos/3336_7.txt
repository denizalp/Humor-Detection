What more can be said?  I'm at Red Rock Canyon once or twice a week to hike and\/or volunteer.  The Canyon is stunning.  It is so wonderful to have such a beautiful place so close to this city.\n\nThe hiking trails are varied for different abilities.  The views are superb, and it is so peaceful to get out, hike, and enjoy nature.\n\nThis is a gem of a place!
