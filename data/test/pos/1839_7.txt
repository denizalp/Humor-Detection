Came for happy hr.  The place looks way cooler than the douchy 806.  I used to live upstarirs and literally went to 806 one time because a friend was down there drinking.  Wine bars make me wana vomit...add techno and Im gonna stab someone.  But Barrios tacos were good and the maragritas Joe whipped up were dope too!  Didnt try any of the side or nachos but will for sure next time and get back to ya folks!
