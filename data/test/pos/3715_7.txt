I like Tim Walter so much, I almost wish my car would break down so I would have an excuse to see him. \n\nHe is super honest, explains everything, gets the cheapest appropriate parts he can, and isn't the least bit condescending. Picture the kindest surgeon you can; Tim Walter is the same, just for cars instead. \n\nAlso, the man has a great memory. He *still* makes fun of me for that Coke can I had strapped to my muffler 7 years ago.
