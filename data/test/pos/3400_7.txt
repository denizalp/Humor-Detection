Dining in at a fast food restaurant is not something I enjoy, but it I will do it from time to time when taking the food to go just won't do. This location is pretty busy and on the few occasions I have dined here, it gets loud and a little hard to hear your own thoughts, much less the conversation form your dining companion. \n\nThe food is that of any other El Pollo Loco and they keep the place relatively clean with a well stocked salsa bar.
