Amazing prices for an authentic, sit down casual restaurant that provides comp homemade chips and salsa. Portions are huge, too. I ordered 3 enchiladas with rice and beans. I wanted red and green sauce on my enchiladas so they made the top half red and the bottom half green. The sauces are homemade and authentic. My girl ordered green salsa chilaquiles with eggs over easy and they were great. The rice and beans were pretty good as was the service.
