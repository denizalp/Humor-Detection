Whole Foods has not let me down yet!  I continue to shop here for:\n\n- Best doggone fresh salmon for Vietnamese Claypot fish (caramelized)\n- Best beef roast meats for Vietnamese Beef Stew \n- Pork Shoulder for braised pork and eggs\n- Best almond croissant and various dessert bites in the deli area\n- Best fresh breadz\n- When available, lamb chops and steaks for summer grillin' and chillin'\n\nAlso, I have never had any issues with parking or bad customer service so I recommend Whole Foods Wexford anytime!
