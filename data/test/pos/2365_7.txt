This place is unbelievably sketchy. Even just walking past it is terrifying, and everyone knew that before there was that huge drug raid a couple months ago.\n\nI'm not going to blame the proximity to CAMH (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health) but it seems like the Comfort Zone operates solely to undo all the work that CAMH has done.\n\nNot only should you not go inside, but you should walk on the other side of the street on your way home late at night. I'm shuddering just thinking about it.
