Free limo ride here but of course you have to pay to get in (close to $30 for females).  My friends came here for a bach.  It was quick since there was another event going on immediately after.  The activities were similar to Chippendale's but it's cheaper and a little \"sleazier\" because of the environment of course.  Main difference here is you can buy lap dances and the whole \"ticket\" isn't as expensive.  You also get to go from watching male to female dancers.  Too bad the latter didn't happen.  It was an interesting night.
