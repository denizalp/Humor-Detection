This location gets 5 Stars for all their 'RETRO' equipment! Equipment I haven't seen in a years!\nIts a nice gym, not very crowded if you like to workout in the afternoon.\nFound lots of different machines to have fun on. There are 3 different workout rooms with a variety of machines, cardio and yes the rock climbing wall(I will attempt that one of these days).\n\nGreat workout and I will be back for sure!
