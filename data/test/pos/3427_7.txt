I would like to take the chef of KoMex home with me. Not because I met him and found him extremely attractive, but because I would like to wake up to the food everyday.\n\nFor starters, they serve these amazing, fresh, melt-in-your-mouth chips. Which are accompanied by salsa and guacamole. \n \nCalamari tacos are seriously unbelievable. Definitely worth leaving your boyfriend for. I'm kidding. No I'm not. \n\nShrimp Fried Rice...If I didn't have an employer that made me sign a contract stating I'd maintain my weight and live a healthy lifestyle...I'd eat it everyday. Totally worth getting fat for.
