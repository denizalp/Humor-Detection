Definitely not what I consider relaxing!  They upsell you once you get in there and ended up convincing me to do the full body massage...what a mistake as they only know one level of massage and it was dreadfully painful.  I had to ask them several times to lessen the pressure, but their English is not very good, so it didn't seem to matter.  I couldn't wait for my service to be over and visit my normal spa at Montelucia...not sure what I was thinking coming here!
