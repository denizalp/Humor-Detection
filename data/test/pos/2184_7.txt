Went on a late night and sat at the bar. Had a margarita it was good  Shared with a friend a carne asada quesadilla, guacamole, and black bean dip... It was all very delicious that  fresh, organic yummy hipster tasting food.... One little thing that was insulting not only to my faith but culture. The holy trinity candles, are they using them as accessories! Not nice. Not going there again. R.E.S.P.E.C.T find out what it meant to me....
