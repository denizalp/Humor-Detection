Most expensive high priced pawn shop in the area. Not a good selection. The pawn shop across the street is cheaper and better. \n\nDVDs and blue rays cost $3-$10. WTF?? They even try to sell VHS for $2. Who the hell has a HVS???\nGuns are over $400\nJewelry is high priced. \nBroken knives are over $40 \nElectronics cost is what I could get brand new. \n\nThis place needs to get with the times. All pawn shops even in Scottsdale sell DVDs for $1 and blue ray for $3.
