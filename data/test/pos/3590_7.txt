Early morning farmer's market or late night bite after the bar, Cracked sandwiches are great anytime of the day!  All the sandwiches are super tasty, but my favorites are the Goy Vey and the Vegasm with spicy chipotle. \n\nThe regular tots are great, but I would pass on the sweet potato tots. \n\nEvery time I see the Cracked Truck, I can't help but crack a smile.
