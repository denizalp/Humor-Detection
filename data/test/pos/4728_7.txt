A locals dive of a casino, Fiesta Henderson is not for the faint of heart!  Granted, I've got a long history with Las Vegas and in particular the locals side of it!  I have a love for the Station Casinos as I try avoiding the strip unless I have \"first timers\" with me!  That being said, Fiesta may be the worst conditioned Stations Casino!  It's in desperate need of overhauling!  Certainly not the place I'd send anyone to play the slots if they didn't understand what they're getting into!
