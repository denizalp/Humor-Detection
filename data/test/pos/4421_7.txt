My next car after my next car because it's going to take that long to get one.\n\nI would work for this company in a second due to it's incredible products, vision, and future.\n\nI've seen so many Model S' on the road in CA, and AZ it warms the cockles of my heart.\n\nBravo, test drive this wonder on four wheels and get in line! I've got my plate frame and polo, do you?
