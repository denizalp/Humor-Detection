Nowhere can you find outlets to charge phones or tablets!!  What's up with that?  This place is 15 years behind in making improvements that passengers need and want. I found one \"charging station\" that made it look like they were doing us a favor by providing a dozen outlets in one very small area. It's still fun to come here, but abandon hope ye who are low on battery life.
