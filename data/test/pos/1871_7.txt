Chill bar with a fantastic view. \n\nGhost bar is the epitomy of Vegas nightlife. Expensive drinks, skin tight dresses, perfume skunk trails, axe body spray, posers, faux hawks, duck face, bling, bedazzled vaginas, you name it they got it.\n\nThis is definitely a must-see when you're \"clubbing\" in Vegas.
