I love this park! It's huge and beautiful! Lots of grass and a wonderful walking path. They have different size dog areas and lots of covered benches. Easy parking and restrooms. Plenty of play areas for the children and they are pretty good about keeping the grass green. It's large enough to enjoy a nice bike ride as well. Perfect place for children's park parties and plenty of room for sports.
