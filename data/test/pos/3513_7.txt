They carry really cute UW Badger gear and that is the main reason I shop here.\n\nIt seems like at the end of each season they have their biggest, semi-annual sales. I chuckle because is it the biggest sale of the year if it occurs periodically? \n\nAnyways, I think they are a great bargain if you happen to catch their sales. Bras for $15, sports bras for $10, UW Badger hoodies for $20, plus if you spend enough you get a freebie!
