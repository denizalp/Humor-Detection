Jackpot! I found so many great gifts at this store. They have a stylish selection of hair accessories, wallets, bags, mugs, plates, gadgets, kids-ware, books, gift paper, pillows and hats, among other items.\n\nLocated along State Street - the main shopping strip of downtown Madison, near the University of Wisconsin.
