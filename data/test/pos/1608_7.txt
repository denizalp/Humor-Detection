I wasn't impressed with the food here. When I walk into a sushi restaurant that is also selling Chinese food and crawfish, I have to question the quality of their food. The sashimi was okay...one of the salmon pieces I ate had a bone in it. The rolls were extremely disappointing, both in quality and presentation. So lackluster in flavor and sloppy in presentation. Their appetizers were probably better than the entrees. I also thought service was a bit slow, considering the restaurant didn't seem that busy when we were there. I would not want to come back.
