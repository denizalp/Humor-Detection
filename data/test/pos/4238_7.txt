Thank goodness for the Monorail system. It allowed me to travel up and down the Las Vegas Strip and save money on cab fare, which in turn I used at the craps tables. Too bad I lost that money as well :-(\n\nUPDATE: I paid $9 for the unlimited one day pass but I just checked the website and it seems there was a monthly special for that fare. Regular price is $15. So prices may fluctuate depending on when you go. Check the website for any changes in prices. All-in-all great deal regardless.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.lvmonorail.com\/
