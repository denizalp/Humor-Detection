Worst Worst Worst! Cheap- Certainly YES! I went there for the brazilian wax, first it was a dirty room but for a price, I wasn't expecting something fancy so that's ok, but she waxed it like that after few days, I had so many in grown hairs and I had black spots all over- may be the room has infections or something- Ladies, don't just write the reviews because its cheap- be gentle to yourselves and go somewhere better- I am certainly not going there again-even for free!
