I've only been here for Brunch...but, wow, it's pretty awesome! Anything you could possibly want for Breakfast can be found here. It's about $40 for the Brunch buffet for two. \n Fresh OJ, Sausages, tons of Fruit\/Fruit Salads, Croissants, Bagels, Bacon, Eggs made to order.\n\n My only regret is that I didn't take my Wife here when she was pregnant because we really would have gotten our money's worth.
