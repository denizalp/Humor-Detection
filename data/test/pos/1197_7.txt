Do not use this company.  We called to have our A\/C repaired and Flores said they would have to replace the compressor, WITHOUT LOOKING at the A\/C.  \nCalled another company, they sent someone out with an hour and replaced a compressor motor condensor.  20 minutes and fixed. \n\nFLORES is looking to RIP YOU OFF!!!
