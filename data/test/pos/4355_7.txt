I've had Udder Delights several times now and I'm happy to report that it truly is an utter delight to enjoy this sweet treat! Udder Delights is produced from Superstition Farm so it's no surprise that the ice cream is as creamy and fresh as it is. If only every ice cream was created from a freshly milked cow! I've had several of their flavors but my favorite is sweet potato. Yes, I know it sounds strange right? But it's actually quite tasty! It's creamy and tastes a little bit more like pumpkin than potato. Try it!
