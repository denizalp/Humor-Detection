Cool little cut between the Linq and Flamingo. It's home to several restaurants and quick service places such as In & Out, Sprinkles, and a frozen drink station. You know, to keep it classy.  \n\nEasy access to both hotels and super convenient when you want a quick bite. They have plans for a huge candy shop & wouldn't mind coming back to check out the new changes. Though, I'd like to see some more original dining selections that aren't centered around the current hype & celebrity endorsements.
