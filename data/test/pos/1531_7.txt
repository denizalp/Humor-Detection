Got a break for a long time and thought to start with this review. \nWhat moved me selecting this mall to review was it's photos that i had uploaded long back made me cherish that clean and so neat mall. I can say this is the best of all malls when compared with fancy interiors,sofas that are placed to sit inside the mall,spacious,. This is no lesser than other malls when compared with the businesses it has.\nNever seen this place crowded. When i feel like relaxing and passing some time shopping, I used to prefer this place.
