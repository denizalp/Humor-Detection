(1) Made an appointment for a contact lens exam, but was not told there is a $75 contact fitting fee (which my insurance does not cover). Of course, I didn't need to be \"fitted\" for contacts; I have worn them for more than a decade.\n\n(2) Dr. was fast to the point of abrupt. \n\n(3) \"No guns\" sign on the front door. While I am sure that keeps the criminals away, I do not patronize businesses that impose irrational limitations on their law-abiding customer's constitutional rights. \n\nI won't be returning.\n\nUpdate: they also screwed up my prescription.
