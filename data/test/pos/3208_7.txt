Way too much hype for this place! And expensive too! I ordered a latte and five macarons.....it costed me $13! The latte I could've gotten better at Starbucks and the macarons had that old refrigerator smell :( I was really disappointed. Everything looked great, but everything tasted below average. Save yourself the money and disappointment
