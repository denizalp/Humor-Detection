Their pho tastes weird...\nTheir waitress suggested some kind of soup with curry and coconut milk in it, and my friend got to try it. It was way too oily and salty to finish the whole bowl.\nFurthermore, you do not get much choice from their small menu, and although the place is called \"Saigon VIP\", it doesn't even have a theme or style on its own as it is a combination of Vietnamese, Thai, Malaysian and Singaporean cooking.\n\nDO NOT GO.
