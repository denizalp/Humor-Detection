I was really disappointed in Uber last night.  I have been a long time loyalist, but on New Years Eve they were 3.5x their normal price.  On the night we need them most they take advantage and charge ridiculous prices.  They should have planned better and had more drivers available as it seems that was the excuse.  I thought I had finally found a cab company I could rely on but I called Discount Cab right away and was VERY pleased with their pricing.  I think if we're loyal to Uber, Uber owes us more loyal pricing.
