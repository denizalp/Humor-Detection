Just had the owner Douglas McColl come to an estimate which they claim to do free estimates, he was so arrogant and rude after he gave the estimate he says he is not a plumber and asks what I expect to pay? I told him what our landscaper said which was half the cost, he laughs and tells me why Am I wasting his time and leaves and starts yelling you asshole from across the street to his car, I told him not to be rude and that's what a estimate is...
