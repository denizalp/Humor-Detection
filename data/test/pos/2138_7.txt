You should have some type of back up payment form for when the iPod swiped does not work. I have plenty of money just now on both my debit and credit card account and was unable to purchase any if the products I wanted. This shop had officially lost a customer, I suggest going to simply posh. Better prices and MUCH friendlier with all the same clothes. The owner even buys specialty clothing items from Cali to sell exclusively in her store. Screw PLRG, go to Simply Posh on Glendale and 12th st!!!
