Yiu's Chinese Cuisine is another new Hong Kong Style cafe just opens up in this plaza. \n\nMore choices for me to dine in as a lone diner especially they offers all day special that includes a drink at $4.95! \n\nA lot of choices should able to make every one happy.\n\nBeef Ball & Fish Ball Soup Noodle ($5.50) was quite standard but the Milk Tea was meh. Tea was not served hot enough and tasted like it been sitting around for awhile. \n\nService though is really friendly and polite.\n\nThe elevator background music is really annoying... scream.....
