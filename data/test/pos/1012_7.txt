The girlfriend needed some blank CD's so I could burn some music for her, so here we came to waste an hour. \n\nThere's a Subway inside! AIIIIEEE!!! They're everywhere! What ever happened to the old-fashioned snack bars?\n\nI think this used to be an Ames, and this Wal-Mart is equally as lame and depressingly banal like all other Wal-Marts. This ain't no \"supercenter\" though. \n\nI bought not a thing.\n\nWatch the documentary \"Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price\" sometime and pray for those who have to work here as well as those who can't afford to shop elsewhere.
