I absolutely love love love lee's sandwiches. Best part? This location is open 24\/7!!!! I tend to get their ice mocha but with extra ice (delicious). They also have other coffee and boba drinks. They've got a menu full of different types of sandwiches and food but I really enjoy getting the small stuff up front like the pork buns or little pastries. They're a lot faster to grab and go and actually very tasty! My favoriteeeeee is the 3 beignets for $1. You can't beat that for a little dessert \/ snack!
