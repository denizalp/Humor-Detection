The food is awesome and the staff are great.I have been going there for years and there is usually a nice crowd there. I was there last Saturday night and there was an obnoxious drunk woman named Tracy harassing the customers and swearing at the staff. Thankfully she was asked to leave and we all got back to enjoying our night.
