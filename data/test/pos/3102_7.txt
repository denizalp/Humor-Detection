A Safe Haven salesperson just came to my door (I just moved into my new house) This so-called security specialist ignored all the security stickers and signs that were already in place from the company I decided to monitor my house, but this genius also parked in the middle of my driveway with a female passenger waiting for him in his front seat, completely blocking my exit.  What company do you know whose employees just drive up onto your driveway?  Very unprofessional and scared me quite a bit.  Ironic that I almost called the cops on a security salesman.
