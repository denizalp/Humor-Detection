Small ramen restaurant but can definitely hit the spot. Be sure to account for the wait but if you want to sit at the bar you might get lucky. Would recommend going during off peak hours so you can get seated quick. The ramen isn't as salty as others but it is still pretty tasty. I didn't leave this place thirsty like I normally do for other ramen places.
