Answered within minutes very late at night with a quote. Was able to get an appointment booked for the same weekend. Showed up on time, moved quickly and overall I'm happy with the move. Hopefully we aren't moving for awhile but next time we do I would definitely feel comfortable using Dignity Moving. Also no hidden fees, I budgeted extra money just in case I got charged for silly things but NOPE! No surprises and that was a great way to end the move. Thanks again guys!
