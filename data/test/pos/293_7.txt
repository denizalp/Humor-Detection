Every time I've come here I have no clue where to look. I know my way around an auto store like I know my way around a vagina. So a big shout out to the helpful and friendly staff here. Most recently, Ricardo, came out outside in the 158 degree heat to put freon in our car. The bf Rickie observed outside while I, nestled in my leather bucket seat, felt the car grow cooler and cooler while listening to The Pussycat Dolls. I know. Ironic isn't it?
