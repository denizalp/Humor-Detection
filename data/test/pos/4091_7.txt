They've shoehorned pretty much a fully functional grocery store in a small, elegant and (if you look up) spectacular space. I'm here often for lunch, as I love the poke bar and other offerings. The beer and wine selection is great for after work too. Yeah, your Wheaties might cost 50 cents more, but that's life in the city. If enough people can afford it downtown, we should celebrate it rather than bitching about it.
