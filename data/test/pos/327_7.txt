I had pro diesel look at a truck I was thinking about buying as I live 500 miles away and was only going on pics. They found two minor things wrong but over all said it was a good truck.\nSo on their recommendation I flew out to buy the truck. Upon seeing the truck and inspecting it myself, it was a hunk of junk so I flew back home and was out the cost of a round trip flight and their inspection fee. I would never use them to inspect a truck again.
