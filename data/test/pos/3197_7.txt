Be careful if you are vegetarian and order from here.  The last two times they didn't follow my order and I got a chicken burrito instead of a veggie one.\nVery disappointing.  If you order the normal stuff and are flexible about what they actually give you then the staff is pretty nice and it's not that bad. It was a guilty thing for me anyway so I'm going to go elsewhere.
