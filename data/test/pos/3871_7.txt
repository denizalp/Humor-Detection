Let's face it.  Dumpy places sometimes make great food.  The place is an old beat up dinner that looks like it a good place for the next Walking Dead episode.  However, the breakfast was wonderful.  The pancake was moist and delicious. Eggs were cooked to perfection.  My friend ordered the pastrami hash and he raved about.  We will go back.  Hopefully before the apocalypse.
