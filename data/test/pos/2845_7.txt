Very slow system and ended up waiting over 30mins to get 6 photos printed. Understood that it was due to their network system, but the manager did not want to take any responsibility of the situation, and did not apologies for any inconvenience it had caused us. Only after explaining to her that regardless of the network or not, the situation took way too long, and only after that, she gave us a $.70 discount. But still no apology.
