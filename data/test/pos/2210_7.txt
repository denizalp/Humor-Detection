When I worked in Yorkville, I used to come here to get my glucose on.  Cookies, cakes, pies chocolate they have all the uneccessary food groups covered.  If you are a fan of mousse...look no further than their outta-this-world Mango Coconut Mousse... it's light as a cloud yet whip-creamy and oh-so decadent.  Their Ginger Ice cream is dreamy too!  Also the people who own\/work at Dessert Lady are super nice and always cheerful so it makes this place that much sweeter to visit!
