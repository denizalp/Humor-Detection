This place seemed like a typical diner but beware, it was not.\n\nThe cups were dirty (old lipstick) and my side of peaches came with a moldy piece the waitress, Pam, tried to convince me was a 'mushroom'.\n\nAfter a disgusting experience, at no point did the manager come over or the waitress apologize.\n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone and if I could rate below one star, I would.
