Sourdough crusted pizza??? Yes that's the difference maker here. It works so well cause it's extra crunch on the outer crush and chewy on the inside. I got the pizza of half gladiator and half margarhita. It was a pizza that our whole table enjoyed. They've also got a store on the side that sells baked goods and gelato. Delicious as well!\n\nRecommendation: gladiator pizza! And mint gelato
