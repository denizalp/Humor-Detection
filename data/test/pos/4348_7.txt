Not totally sure about the hype for this place...\n\nIt is basically take-out only.  They have single slices that are huge, and very expensive.  The quality is fine, but nothing exceptional.  \n\nBe careful though, the pizza is very hot.  I burned the roof of my mouth and had to deal with that for a few days following.
