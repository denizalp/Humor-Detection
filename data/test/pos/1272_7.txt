Seriously - more than one entrance would be nice.....y'know, like one that didn't require me parking in the middle of the parking lot and then walking around 10+ stores and restaurants in the 100+ degree sun simply to get to the entrance.\n\nThat said, overall a very nice theater once you get inside, and with an IMAX to boot I'm sure I'll be back regardless of how assinine the process of getting inside is.
