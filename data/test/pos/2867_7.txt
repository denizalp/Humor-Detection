Wow, Everything tasty and Fresh. Wings, baked clams, mussels, Steak sandwiches, pretty damn good w\/Fresh bread. Great service. All of us happy, pleased and satisfied. IF YOUR NICE, You'll  ATTRACT the same friendly engaging staff, as we did!  Will be back with my crew, good wholesome food. Parking is another story, very small lot. Don't be lazy, park elsewhere and walk, everyone could use more exercise, A challenge for potheads.lol
