This Starbucks is a drive-thru only with patio seating. Located on a corner with easy access to drive in and out the cute mini little Starbucks still offers all the great fixings Starbucks has to offer. A friend and I got the opportunity to dine here yesterday sitting out side sipping on our favorite Starbucks drink. The staff was friendly and our service was fast.
