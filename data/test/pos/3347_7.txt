I'm not sure why it takes 20 mins to get water. Water that I had to bring to the table myself. 1 glass of water. \nThe server\/cashier refused to give me the glass bottle for some reason. \n\nI understand this is a no service restaurant but that doesn't mean it should be negative service??? The cashier made this the worst dining experience.
