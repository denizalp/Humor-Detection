It's brand new so it doesn't smell fishy yet.   It will soon just like all other Asian markets.\n\nLooks like they will have another place to eat inside but it's still under construction from what I can tell.\n\nThey have Durian, I really want to try one because they are supposed to be so gross and stink to high heaven.\n\nBanana blossoms?  How would I cook those things.\n\nFood is divided into \"Regions\" so if you want Japanese noodles you go to one isle, Korean noodles in another isle etc.  It's a bit confusing but fun to look at all the different stuff.
