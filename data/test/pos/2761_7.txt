Ordered a half sized quinoa salad to go. I realized after I picked it up that I was charged for a full one. $14.50 for a salad that contains mostly aragula, that's outrageous !!! If my salad would have been full of the dried tomatoes, quinoa, feta cheese and pine nuts that would have \" all right \" but greens greens greens, NO !\nGuys, check carefully your to-go orders or you might get screwed too....
