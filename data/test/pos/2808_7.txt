Really nice zoo with a layout that proves quite conducive to getting close to the animals but I must say the nickel and diming is a bit off-putting; $3 to look at Stingrays, $5 to pet a giraffe, $6 for a wheelchair, etc - it is a wonder they don't charge you to park.  Good collection and a nice layout, but not necessarily a 'top tier' zoo despite the $20 admission price.
