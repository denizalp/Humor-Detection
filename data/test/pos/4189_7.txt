I mainly come to Sprouts for wine and brie.  They sell president brie they cut in wedges from a larger round.  The flavor is so much better than the smaller rounds or wedges that you can buy prepackaged.  The staff is friendly.  I've noticed they have a nice selection of organic meats but they're pricey.  The produce is fresh but a little cheaper elsewhere so I don't buy large quantities here.  Nah, when I come into Sprouts it's for a bottle of cab, a wedge of herb brie and a piece of fruit... dinner is served.
