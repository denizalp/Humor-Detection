As a CWRU ug and then a grad student over the years I witnessed the change around our campus. With many new places opening I have to say that this place does not live up to the expectations. I do like the 'fresh' interior, but food is far from acceptable. Honestly, you would be better off getting your 'Asian fix' at chopstick and then grabbing a drink somewhere else. Bac please don't stalk me on facebook.
