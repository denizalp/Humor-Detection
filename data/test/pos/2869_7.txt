The VOODOO lounge has the best view of the strip! It's a must see... this is coming from someone that has been to the top of the top on the strip! (ghost bar at the palms, penthouse at the top of cosmopolitan, stratosphere, mix 64 bar at Mandalay bay, the effie tower...etc). Go to the 50th floor of the Rio and check out the view! And order the oversized Witch Doctor dry ice cocktail...
