Delicious home cooked meals right here with a generous amount of food! This is my second time here and it is amazing. \n\nService is great, food is great and the restaurant is clean! Menus are on what looks like a newspaper and there are bears all over the place (hence the name black bear diner) definitely will be back again soon!
