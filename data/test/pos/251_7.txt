I love this location of Total Wine! First of all, these is seriously something for everyone here... They have an extensive collection of Wines, Tequila, Rum, Bourbon, Whisky, Scotch, Beer, Mixers, snacks... You name it they have it!\nThe staff is always super friendly and might I add beyond knowledgeable about the products they are selling and have always steered me in a great direction no matter what my price point is. Plus they have a huge selection of mini bottles which I always sneak onto my flights!
