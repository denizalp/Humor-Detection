Best Pie ever! I usually do not like pies. They are either too sweet or simply taste like sugar. Not this place! When I sworn it was a waste of time to drive 40 minutes from my house just for pies, I ended up cleaning half of it all by myself. The coconut cream pie I've got was simply delicious. The crust is so soft it literally falls off. Love it love it love it.
