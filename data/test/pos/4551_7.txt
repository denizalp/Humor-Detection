Holy moly, I can't even start to describe the things you can find here. Jennifer P was right, it's like going on a treasure hunt because you don't know what's hiding in the next box over.\n\nIt's a big place with tons of open and unopened boxes. It takes some time to go through all the aisles to see what they have. Not a good place if you are in a rush or have something specific in mind.
