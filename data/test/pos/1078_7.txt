Went in to buy two pairs of sneakers today. Walked out within five minutes even though I saw some shoes I was interested in because the music was explicit and offensive. I should be able to shop in a shoe store with my wife and daughter without lyrics like \"f*ck*ng a b*tch\" and other crude words playing loudly overhead.
