This is my favorite Mexican\/Honduran food in all of Charlotte. Everything is spot on, more authentic, and taste better than other place I have had so far.  The lunch specials are cheap as all heck and you get a lot for what you spend regardless.  The only thing that might throw some people off is that not all the staff speaks English.  So people who come with me usually just either point at something or ask me to request it.  Definitely check this place out!
