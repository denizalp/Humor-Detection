Don't go here, This place is a total crook shop. They will bait and switch you like a fish at a trout farm. The car prices are all inflated very heavily with garbage add ons like window tint for five hundred bucks, which should cost no more than two hundred. Also they add their \"desert paint protection\" for another thousand bucks. Last but not least if you run across the dude who is a finance worker with the tat on his arm run for the hills.
