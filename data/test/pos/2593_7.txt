Ordered Beef brocolli the single mans food.  When I ordered my food the LHK representative told me that I couldn't get my food till I ordered $15 worth of food for delivery.  I then ordered the chicken teriyaki on a stick which come to 18.++.  My food comes and it's not enough.  Pay such high price for little food.  Sorry, have no pictures available but will on the next round.  I'll give them another chance and if they don't do better then i'm not going back.
