Not my favorite strip club.  Just because I didn't feel the girls were really into the dancing.  Just more about collecting their dollar bills.  For us women out in the audience, we want to see some moves girls.  You are living art,  people paid to see you perform.  Also dancers, you are supposed to give us ladies ideas on our private performances at home.\n\nThe shuttle was a nice service to have.  I was super impressed with hot large the place was.  Two stories!!!  Felt like it was a Chuck-E-Cheese from the outside, an adults playground on the inside.
