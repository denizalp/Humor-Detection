Perfect lazy summer evening ice cream shop.  Love the old fashioned soda jerk counter (as a former junior member of the Nat'l Assoc of Soda Jerks, I'm obviously an expert! :P ) and classic ice cream sodas, although I remain a total sucker for the vanilla malt.\n\nI have no experience with the bait shop, but they appear to have 5-7 worm varieties to choose from, so... there's that!
