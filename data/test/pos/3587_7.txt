My garbage disposal had died and began to leak. I called Gary after reading his reviews and within the hour he had arrived, installed and got my sink up and running again. \n\nVery professional and proficient. Best of all, he's very reasonable on his pricing. Thank you again Gary and I will certainly be using you in the future!
