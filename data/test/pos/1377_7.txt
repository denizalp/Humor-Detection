I love this place!  If you want to buzz in and shoot a few rounds of ammo and get in and out rapidly or stay a while this is the spot!\n\nIt's always busy but never too crowed to get in.  They have expert and helpful staff.  It always feels safe as they keep a close eye on people who don't know what they are doing or if you look crazy:)\n\nTry it out...I enjoy it so much I became a member...it's the only way to go!
