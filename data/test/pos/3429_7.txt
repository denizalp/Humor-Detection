I love how people refer to this as a \"health food\" restaurant. It's just a good restaurant that doesn't serve lots of garbage fried everything greasy suburban American crap. Lot's of veggie and vegan options and very consistent. Yes, it is a bit over-rated but come on this is Cleveland and we're lucky to even have this. If this is too much of a hippy joint for you I'm sure you can punch \"Applebee's\" into to your GPS and be on your way.
