Cute little salon. I wanted to love this salon - the staff are very kind and it's close to home. Unfortunately the shellac manicure I paid $40 for (I usually pay $20) started to chip less than a week after getting it done. I went back to get the nails that chipped fixed which cost me additional $3 each. The fixed nails chipped the next day. Bummer.\nI may go back for a regular manicure because of their amazing colour selection. Just no more shellac.
