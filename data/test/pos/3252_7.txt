Most McDonald's have been remodeled or given a face-lift to become more modern-looking. This was one of them. They had an indoor playground which should be much better for the kids during the hot days of summer. I ordered my food using the mobile app which was very convenient. They also have kiosks if you want to go that route instead of ordering it with the cashier.
