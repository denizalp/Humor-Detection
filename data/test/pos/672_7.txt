STEPH JUDGEMENT: Typical sports bar, with nice bar service.\n\nWe had some time to kill before a movie and decided to get a beer here. It's pretty large, and the decor made it feel more like an arcade than a bar, but they do indeed have alcohol and many screens displaying sports. It was early afternoon so it was pretty empty--looked like they were just starting to get set up. Our bartender was a friendly dude and they had free WiFi, so I'd have to say I'm a fan!
