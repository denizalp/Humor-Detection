Mediocre at best. Wings were dry and tasteless, brisket was full of fat, pulled pork was ok but with a strange after taste and the ribs were nothing more than ok. The coleslaw was good. \nService was un attentive when we were the only ones in the restaurant. \nWe won't be back :( \n(Unfortunate because we really like BBQ)
