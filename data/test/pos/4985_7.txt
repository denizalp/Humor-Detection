Today is Friday, April 3, 2015. I'm currently still inside the store. When I walked in Security greeted me and I was distracted and said hello and walked by. The security guard just said \"wow no eye contact...\" Uhm? Apparently greeting customers with sarcasm is part of this stores customer service policy\n\nHe just came up to me and asked me how I got my calves to be as big as they are. Uhm? I ran out of the store with my husband.
