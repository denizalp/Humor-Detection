I was super excited to check this place out thanks to their creative list of burgers with crazy toppings. Our service was fine and food quality was fine, but it was mostly just that - fine. The burgers and toppings were average. The fries were average. I'd say the most fun I had was with their sauces! The sweet potato tots tasted great with all three that I tried (pesto mayo, teriyaki and chipotle ranch). \n\nAgain, definitely not a bad place at all. It was laid back and is probably a great place to meet friends
