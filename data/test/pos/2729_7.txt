This is a family owned business. Seemed like mostly bothers and sisters work at this location. The service is fast and most of the time there is someone available for a quick mani or pedi. The prices are reasonable. Mani $12 and pedi $20 plus $5 for french. The service is friendly and quick. The bad part is that their chairs do not have massages options . Overall a good place to come for a quick nail service.
