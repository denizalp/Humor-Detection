There are many things to love about Brio Coastal Bar and Kitchen--this restaurant serves up made-from-scratch dishes for breakfast, lunch, and Sunday traditional brunch, with $5 happy hour wine, cocktails and bar bites. \nMy personal Brio Coastal favorites: \n- All infusions specially the pineapple vodka, and the spicy mango tequila. \n- Whipped ricotta toast, or avocado toast for brunch.\n- Grilled salmon with couscous.\n- Their two weekdays happy hour (3:30-6:30pm) and (9pm to close). Try crispy shrimp napoli and quesadilla.\n\nGreat  laid back spot.\nFour solid Yelps.
