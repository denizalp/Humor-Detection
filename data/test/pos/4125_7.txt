I really love this place! Staff is very friendly and fast. Store is kinda small but cute! Those selections of donuts are amazing. I immediately wanted to buy all kinds but maybe next time, haha. Price is really good and the taste!!! It's extremely delicious and I almost fell off the chair how much I was into the donut. Today I bought 2 Bavarian Cremes, 1 caramel Cheesecake, 1 Banana cream pie and 2 Hazulnut Mocha. Will definitely come back soon!
