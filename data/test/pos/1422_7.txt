10pm- they have to buzz you in like its a bad neighborhood or something. I needed to pee and needed an ATM. They couldn't find it in their hearts to let me pee. La Quinta next door was so much more welcoming and way nicer inside.\n\nAny woman who won't let another woman pee, when they are having an emergency, is not even a human being.
