THIS PLACE WAS COMPLETE SHIT. I went in for a wax and the lady did take off all the hair on my upper lip. And also, she tried to pluck but had such a bad MOOD AND TONE. Also FUCK THE MANAGER IN THIS SALON. He was no help and also said he couldn't give me his owners contact information so I can get a refund and also raised his voice at me. This place is not about customers satisfaction. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
