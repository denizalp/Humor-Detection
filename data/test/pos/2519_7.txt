This is a closer BOA to my home. However, I hate it.\n\nThere is only ONE atm, and it isn't even a drive thru. There are three small parking spaces, while you wait in your car until another customer is done, if you get out of your car, it's such an uncomfortable closeness that you feel like you're either going to get robbed, or slapped for being so close to someone.
