Me and my gf went on there for her bday and waited for 3 hours. Right when we were about to get seated, someone poured alcohol on one of the grills and they all shut down. They ended up closing the restaurant early and we never got seated. The only thing they offered was 15% off at a DIFFERENT restaurant. Worst customer service ever honestly. Won't ever go there or Seoul Food Meat Co. and try them out just because of this experience.
