I just called different local vets to ask about pricing and the front office of Glendale Animal Hospital had no answers for me other than, Bring your dog in so we can see..., other vets I called have given me prices for these same services why would it be so hard for them to unless they know their prices are outrageous or something and just want me to show up first and then charge me an arm and a leg later, no thanks!
