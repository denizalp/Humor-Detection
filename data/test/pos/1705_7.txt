Well may I first add I'm not one to bitch and mone but there is a girl that works here looks like mid to late 20's. Rudest person I have ever tried to interact with. Anytime she is working and I come in. She blatantly does not say hi back ignores any of my how's it going ANYTHING. she pissed me off so bad I now drive a mile and a half the other direction just to avoid her rank ass attitude.
