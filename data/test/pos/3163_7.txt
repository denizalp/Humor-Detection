Oh my..this place was sooo unimpressive.\n1. 3 egg omelette seemed to be missing at least two of those eggs. The feta spinach and veggie with cheese versions led right to the bathroom.\n2. Sourdough toast hard and cold\n3. Famous Jam - no flavor\n4. 2 for 1 coupon was lifesaver to take some sting off $10 entrees.\n5. Do not get those stringy, nasty potatoes - who the hell thinks these are any good?\n\n    Coffee was kept refilled and service was great and outside seating is a good touch, but nothing can overcome a miserable performance from Chef Boyardeee.
