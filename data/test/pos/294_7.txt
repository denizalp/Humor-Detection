I had a mean chicken shawarma sandwich with the works here. It was so tasty and juicy that I got shawarma goop all over my face and hands, but I just didn't give a damn. I then proceeded to mow down garlic roasted potatoes with extra garlic sauce cause I'm street like that. Very good stuff. I will definitely be coming here more often for my shawarma fixes. And that garlic sauce, I gotta ask them if they can hook an iv up and shoot it straight into my blood.
