If heaven exists, it would be this place.  Macarons + bubble tea + ice cream + exotic asian flavors = amazing. I only wish the service was a bit faster (if there is another customer in front of you, it will take 5-10min to get your ice cream). And I would love it if the punch card didn't require $10 purchases each time (so i wouldn't feel bad going there alone!)
