Surprisingly very good food in a casual but almost upscale atmosphere. The food was plated nicely and brought out super hot (temperature), which I really appreciate.  I'm giving it 5 stars because the extra service I got. I forgot my credit card and called from the airport on the way back home to CA. They agreed to put it in the mail for me the next morning, which saves me the hassle of requesting a new corporate credit card. Thank you!
