The Bun Bo Hue here is pretty good.  A lot of ingredients.  The soup taste full of flavor.  The pork hock was not soft though.  Tendon was super soft.  There was no pork blood.  They said that the market isn't even selling pork blood right now.  Not sure why there is a shortage. They gave more meat to compensate for the pork blood shortage.\n\nHappy Bun Boing!!
