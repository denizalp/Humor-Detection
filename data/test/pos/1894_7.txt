If you're looking for an honest mechanic with unparalleled service and professionalism, then Tait and the Hon-Man crew is the obvious choice. But if you're looking for a decent Turkish bath house nearby to relax in while you're car is getting serviced, then you're shit out of luck in this neighborhood. Fortunately, Tait has a very comfortable waiting room with Wi-Fi, DirecTV & free snacks - but no steam room...yet.
