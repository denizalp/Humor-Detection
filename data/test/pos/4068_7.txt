I couldn't believe my eyes witnessing the long line of customers being milled through their doors. For a sub\/hoagie with such bland and tastelessness being commercialized on as \"Gourmet Sandwiches that's mother approved\" ...GIVE ME A FRIGGIN BREAK. As a foodie, I want flavor NOT cafeteria lunch line food. The people giving this 'stuff' 4 and 5 stars are the ones buying into these franchises... yelpers steer clear, do your research for original and unique before you're separated from your money.
