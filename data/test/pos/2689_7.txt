I went here last week.  The staff was extremely friendly, including Dr. Harlan himself.  The only drawback was I waited in the little examination room for over half an hour.  My appointment was scheduled for 8.20 and I didn't get seen until nearly 9.00.\n\nIt's always funny when you're at a clinic or something and hear someone screaming in pain.  A guy down the hall was having some stitches taken out and was cussing up a storm.  :)  He walked out before me, so they must've taken good care of him.  :)
