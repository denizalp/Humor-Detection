Wow, I can completely collaborate the other reviews, except the one that says they actually had a good experience with this company once.  I am sure there would be more poor reviews, but in order to file a claim they request that you not post a poor review.  My wife signed the paperwork, but I did not.  Trust me, this company is quite the piece of work.
