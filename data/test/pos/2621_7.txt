Interesting decor.  Check out the pictures others have posted.\nThis place is BYOB, which is nice.  We did lunch take out so not need for the BYOB.\nService was very friendly and asked if we wanted some water while we waited since we did not call ahead.  It did not take to long.  The Pad Grapow with pork was very good.  Three spice levels and medium is pretty spicy.  A crispy roll came with.
