I ordered the Sharma sandwhich on a baguette.  It was actually pretty good. I have had quite a few of these from other places and this was definitely tasty. The reason for the 3 star rating is the fact that the order was 11.95 on the menu. I only ordered the sandwhich and when I went to pay he charged me 15 dollars even. Ummmm....how do you figure that? Let's see today's price is 15...lol..whatever...just kinda shady
