I did not eat here but did get a quick drink before my flight home.\n\nLet's put it this way....pickings are slim in this terminal for food and drink. Most of it is fast food that is pretty bad.\n\nBelgian Beer Cafe offers a nice ambiance with great selections of beer. I tried a Hefeweizen and it was great.\n\nPrices were reasonable and service was prompt.\n\nI would come back if I was at this airport.
