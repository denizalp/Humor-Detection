The deliveryman was so nice I had to pinch myself and make sure I hadn't accidentally wandered into some black & white, Hitchcock inspired, Pleasantville, Twilight Zone situation. I was like, did I just step back into 1952 where everyone had to function within the confines of extreme politeness? \n\nNope. The Kim's people are just that awesome. I'm pretty sure I've never been this impressed with the delivery of anything. Guess I found my go-to place for noodles and egg rolls.
