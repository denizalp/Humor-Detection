This place is DT Scottsdale's finest garbage. Went here after a concert because it was the one place without a line before and after the concert. Now I know why. We spent $300 in about 90 minutes having shots and tacos and got nothing but dirty looks from our \"server.\"  Sorry to inconvenience you, Ricky's, sheesh. Also the tacos were clearly unfresh. The tortillas were stale around the edges and my guess is the pack had been out all night drying in the kitchen. Skip this place and wait in line somewhere.
