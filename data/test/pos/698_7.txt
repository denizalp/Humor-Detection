I'm a fan because the instruments are top-notch and a few employees delivered the service I needed, but only after I proactively asked for help.\n\nIf you need a great instrument and already know what you want, this is a great spot.\n\nThe blank and disinterested stares from a few employees was laughable - dare I say \"dead weigh\"!  The service, in general, sucks unless you're a known musician.
