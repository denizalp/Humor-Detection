Purchased tickets for the La Reve show for the performance that was the same night. The seats were premium seats and the savings was about 20% per ticket.\nThis location is less busy than the outdoor strip location and located in the mall. Once paying for the seats I received a voucher where I still needed to will call the actual tickets.  \n\nOverall the process was painless and the seat locatiion and show was solid. I would use this service & location again in the future.
