The only reason I come to dunkin is for the coolattas. They are like a blend between a frapuccino and an iced coffee. They have different flavors such as mocha and caramel, and seasonal flavors like eggnog and pumpkin. You could get these flavors in any of their drinks, but I just love the coolattas. They are smooth, icy, and creamy. I also like the chocolate cake munchkins. They are little donut holes and they are perfect for eating on the go since you can  just pop the whole thing in your mouth, so there's no mess.
