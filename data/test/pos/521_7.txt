This is essentially a motel on a huge piece of property.  Carpet in the bathroom area, no fitted sheets on the bed, heat\/ac wall units.  The walk from the lobby to the room requires a ride in a cart.  Left my iPhone charger in the room and of course it couldn't be located.  Below average service throughout.  The bar staff inside JD's bar are not attentive and the food is pretty bad.  If you're paying more than $100 per night, look elsewhere.  Staff was kind enough to locate my phone charger and has sent it to me!  Thank you.
