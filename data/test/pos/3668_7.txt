It's an urban mall folks. It's a 5 minute walk from my home. I go there to get the stuff I need and I get out as quickly as possible.\n\n@ Vanessa G. - \"its unclean, dirty and dangerous reputation. However, Dufferin Mall is still located in a sketchy part of Toronto and still invites some sketchy clientele\"?????? \n\nYou actually think that Dufferin and Bloor is a sketchy part of town? I don't even know what to say to you except go back to North Toronto or surburbia or whatever uber-clean high-end neighbourhood you came from.
