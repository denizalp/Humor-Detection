You'd think Guy Fieri designed this menu. Crazy combination like peanut butter on a burger and deep fried Mac and cheese to replace burger buns.  Tons of poutine choice including one with blue cheese (yum). The size of my burger was huge and I couldn't finish it. Sweet potato fries were delicious and they brought a yummy spicy dipping sauce. They marinate their pickles in Kool Aid and the fresh coleslaw is also good. I'll be coming back to try the variety of creative dishes on the menu.
