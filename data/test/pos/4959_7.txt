This place is just alright.  I always get the feeling that I am at a used car lot with them trying to sell me on invisalign, teeth whitening or electric toothbrushes.  I will say the hygienist I saw was pretty good which is why I didn't give this place one star.  She has a technique where the shots do not hurt too bad.  I usually have a problem with them billing my insurance as well.  I also have never been to a dentist that wants to see you every three months and I don't have any diseases\/problems.
