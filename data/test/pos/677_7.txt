Jennifer and Safak were great!! Jennifer picked us up at our hotel and was great about getting us prepared for the day. Safak was patient and a excellent guide. We spent two fun hours riding around the dry lake bed, with some breaks for water and some snacks. On the way back Jennifer offered to take us to the Hoover Dam, which was very nice gesture and all of my guys thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nWill definitely be doing that again!!
