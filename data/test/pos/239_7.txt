You won't believe me but I invented the Orange Custard Chocolate Chip back in, like, 1982.  I'm not fucking joking.  They had a comment box, and I wrote (yeah, I fucking wrote it, 'cause I was precocious af) that they should have a Halloween ice cream that was orange with chocolate chips.\n\nShame that it tastes like ass to me.\n\nBut you don't have to take my word for it.\n\nInstead, try any one of the myriad flavors at this Madison institution that's existed longer than I have.  Which is a very long time indeed.
