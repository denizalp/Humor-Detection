Unless you want security to manhandle your fiancé don't go here.  I don't care if Tiesto or Calvin Harris is playing here it is a joke. Security should protect their guests, not make it more difficult and\/or hurt them.  My fiancé had a bruise on her arm and soar for a few days.  Way to have a 300lb security guard push a shove\/grab a 120lb woman in heals, hope your ego is soaring.  And btw we hadn't had a drink yet.
