We had a great experience with Five Star Moving. The movers who arrived were courteous,  hard working, and attentive. Some of our furniture was scratched and superficially damaged, but some of that is to be expected. Though originally booked for just two hours, the men agreed to stay a half hour extra to the truck loaded. Overall, it was a good value for our money, and I would recommend them to others.
