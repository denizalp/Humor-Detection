Even though I'm not a plumber, having short legs on a 6'2\" frame can pose a challenge. I hoped that finding their Long Tail T-shirts would solve any plumber profile that I may present. It did, but had unexpected side effects. If you're wearing one of those long tail t-shirts, & decide to untuck it, it's necessary to loosen any waist buttons or belts. The problem is that the t-shirt is (as advertised) long, & will wedgie anything in it's path. I guess that's part of the cost of not presenting the wrong public image.
