Bravo, Vegas!!  You NAILED IT.  This is the mix of good food, fun atmosphere, interesting\/upscale but accessible menu items at reasonable price points.  Cocktails that slip down your throat like lies slip out. \n\nBAM! Go there, fool, don't hit the buffet again, take yourself to somewhere worth the time and effort to put on that nice shirt, and look at your date, her dress says she's ready for this, not the 1.99 shrimp cocktail at the casino.\n\nSit at the bar if it's full, the staff is always fun and you're closer to the booze!
