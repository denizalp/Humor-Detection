I stopped by just to try a taco before investing in an entire meal. Oh my pastor heaven! This is absolutely some of the best al pastor on earth! It's crispy, the way I like it, not  full of gristle like some places. The cut pineapple and touch of guacamole in incredible! This will be my new go- to place since Serrano's closed.
