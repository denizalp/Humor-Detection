I've been going to Gerald for awhile now. He's always professional, hysterical & hands down the best stylist I've had in YEARS. I'd recommend him to anyone. He's always willing to go the extra mile & takes pride in his work. Really can't say enough kind things about this stylist. Just the best. The shop is new & gorgeous. The rest of the staff I've met have been great. I look forward to getting my brows done my next appointment.
