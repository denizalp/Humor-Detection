A trendy little eat spot located in the busy area of Henderson.  There is something for everyone on the menu.  Seems it is always busy and your looking a 10 -15 minute wait during the busy times of the days.  It's convenient.  The foods not bad but for some reason I feel guilty (like I am eating at Denny's) when I dine here.  I should be out exploring or supporting local business.
