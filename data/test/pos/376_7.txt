Just over $10 and I got a beef taco, 3 rolled tacos-loaded, a quesadilla, and a bottle of water. Bonus points for the grease-laden quesadilla. This was a fantastic gut bomb that would have been perfect as a hangover cure. They never disappoint, unless you are my buddy..... They seemed to have forgotten his order entirely. That's ok-didn't hurt my rating one bit.
