Secret pizza is a fantastic concept for the 3am crowd, that's for sure. The creators of this place actually knew what they were doing and truly are catering to the environment around them. Gotta love marketing principles in real life action. Nevertheless, the slice here at this little hidden gem are actually pretty good and are very reasonably priced for the location. Highly recommended. \n\nPros-\nService \nLocation\nPizza \nTaste \nPrice \nProximity to Marquee \n\nCons-\nTough to find\nCrowded
