To quote Pulp Fiction here...\"buddy holly isnt much of a waiter\"  The food despite the best effort of our server, was good, as well as the atmosphere, drinks and price.  However, when telling your customer, that sometimes the pesto chicken pasta makes him immediately nausious, I have to wonder how much business they lose because of him.  It wasn't all too busy and we seemed to have to wait on everything.  Overall my experience was good, but have to 2-star this place because of the \"entertaining service\" that we recieved.
