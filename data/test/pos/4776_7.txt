I patron PTamales at least once a week (sometimes more, don't judge) & have never seen Patty... not sure if she's real.\n\nThe green pork tamale is my favorite! It's insanely spicy, just the way I like it.\n\nEverytime I walk in...I am greeted with a big smile & hello. Friendly family...GREAT service.
