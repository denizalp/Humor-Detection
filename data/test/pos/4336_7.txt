Picture the food pyramid in your head. The original one size fits all version that they used to teach kids. Now imagine someone with the culinary audacity combine all of those elements into one meal and you would get one of the Primanti Brother's famous sandwiches.\r\n\r\nHeaping mounds of meat layered with fresh cut french fries, tomatoes, and topped off with cole slaw all on delicious freshly baked bread.  A definite must when you are in Pittsburgh
