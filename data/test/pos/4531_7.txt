Over-priced vinyl sold by a grumpy old man.\n\nSure, the selection is fantastic!\n... if you don't mind shelling out coin and being harassed.\n\nI made the mistake of asking if he had any extra crates for sale. He told me $10 each (which, let's be honest, is ridiculous). I said, \"Oh, no, that's okay,\" and I never heard the end of it. \nHis son(?) seemed nice though!
