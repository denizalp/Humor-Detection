Was in a car accident and had a concussion. The worst part was that my leg started to go numb and I was really worried about what it could have meant in terms of an injury. I had a pretty significant back surgery serval months before this and I just wanted to make sure I was OK. We waited for 2 hours in the ER and maybe 5 people were called back. We packed up and headed to Mercy Gilbert. The administration here needs to evaluate their ER... Stat.
