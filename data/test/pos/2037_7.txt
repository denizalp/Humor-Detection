You will not see this location of Nathan's Famous from the street.  They are located inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\n\nWe visited the Las Vegas Convention Center 3 days in a row to watch my nephew's basketball tournament.  During that time, Nathan's was the only place open inside there.  Suffice it to say that they were very busy those 3 days.\n\nTheir hot dogs, french fries, and lemonade are okay.  Prices are a bit steep, but that is to expected inside the Convention center.\n\nOverall, not a bad place to eat when you are here.
