Had a cracked (more than a few) screen w\/ some LCD damage on my iPhone 6*.  Came to Doc's shop and got it fixed w\/i 30 minutes.  \n\nThey were friendly, professional, and upfront about prices, which were very reasonable.  Was even offered discounts for a tempered glass screen protector as well as a case that's good for up to a week, even though I didn't plan on getting anything at that time.\n\nHighly recommend for all of your phone & computer repair needs.\n\n____________________\n\n*Burn in Hell, sly NYC traffic warden
