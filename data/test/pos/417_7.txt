I have a lot of love for the craft cocktails, atmosphere, and regular employees of The Laundry Room!  You can read my previous reviews for more detailed insights. The last couple of times here have been very solid.  Dan is doing a good job behind the bar and Kara is delightful. Management and I have not always seen eye-to-eye, but I felt I needed to update my rating after my last visit.
