Delightful women at the front desk. Awesome Elvis. Very sweet minister. Fake gazebo and bridge. And a picture of Bon Jovi. What is there not to love? Well, admittedly, I don't love having to pay so dang much for photos, and I don't love that my friends couldn't take pictures as well, but 3 days in Vegas inured me to being ripped off. The rest of the experience was sufficiently awesome that I can live with the extra charges.
