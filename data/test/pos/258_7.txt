I have never hated a Denny s so much in my life. And stupid me, I've given this place three chances to impress me because it's conveniently located. Every time I have been not satisfied. The employees don't care about you or their job, the food takes forever and is not perfectly made and I feel like the overall time being in that damn place is never less than an hour and a half. I'm sorry we have places to be when were in Vegas, I like to be in control of my time, not you.
