Club Fetch rocks, plain and simple. It is clean and full of doggy fun. I take my pup 2-3 days a week to burn-off excess energy while I'm at work. He comes home tired and happy.  They post daily Instagram and Facebook photos so that you can see your pooch interacting with his furry friends. The staff is friendly and they are all great with the dogs. This is the best doggie-daycare I've seen in Charlotte.
