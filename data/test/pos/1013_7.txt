I'm having an affair with Dilworth coffee. My wife asks where I'm going...I usually say \"Dilworth Coffee\". It's quiet, small and not too loud. Great background music going on, and oh yeah, the coffee is really tasty. Small little gifts; about 40 different coffee's to buy in the bean stage. A quiet afternoon, a coffee and my laptop or iPhone makes Dilworth coffee a 2nd home.
