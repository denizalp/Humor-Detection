Once the Pub always the Pub.  Still a great place to get harassed by undesirables.  Although I did give it one star MORE than the Pub because they did upgrade the paint and architectural conditions inside.  Although getting better SLOWLY the service seems to be staffed by castoffs from other downtown places that didn't have the speed to make it at their old joints.  I guess it just comes down to you can't polish a turd.
