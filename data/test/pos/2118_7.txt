I was really looking forward to this place. After living in France for five years, I was missing french food. \nThis empty restaurant's manager began by accusing my brother (36 years old) of giving him a fake I.D.  He kicked us out before we could order on the grounds that we were some kids trying to sneak a glass of wine in a dying french restaurant. I really wanted to support this restaurant, but when you are treated like garbage, what can you do? Vraiment, c'est triste. J'esp√®re quelqu'un va faire quelque chose rapidement. C'est ridicule.
