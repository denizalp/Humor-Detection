Other than being super small, this space is awesome.  Incredible view, good design, AMAZING outdoor area.  And the window on the floor, which isn't a good idea for people scared of heights, is awesome if you don't mind standing 55 stories high on plexi-glass.  \nAlso, the employees are really nice.  Cynthia, a cocktail waitress here, is the shit.
