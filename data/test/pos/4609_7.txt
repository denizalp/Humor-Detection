I really enjoyed the meal! So much food. Started with sweet n sour soup, then fried shrimp dumpling, shrimp dumpling in pasta thingy, crab ball with a claw sticking out, chinese broccoli, sticky rice in lotus leaf. Loved that tasted like comfort food, so yum. fried spring roll, a pork thing I didnt like. Had fatty bits in it. Mango pudding for dessert which was pretty much like jello, which is hilariously fun to wobble. Good atmosphere. Good food. Really enjoyed it.
