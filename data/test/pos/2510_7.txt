Drove all the way from Henderson to see this place on a Thursday and a sign out up front said SOLD OUT. What? I'll never make that drive again just to see this place. Super huge let down, why would it sell out? On a Thursday at 2pm? Odd.... their website plainly lists the hours as 0930-11PM. Careful going there and having it closed when it's not suppose to be.
