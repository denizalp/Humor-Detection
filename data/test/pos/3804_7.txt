I ordered delivery from this place and met the most nicest delivery man.  I'm jumping the shark by saying this but hands down the best sushi I have tasted in Toronto.  The ingredients are fresh and filled with a generous amount of avocados, and fish.  In addition, the rolls are Huge (the size of Oreos) and comes with complimentary spicy mayo *bonus :)*  \n\nVery delicious sushi and I will definitely order again, the only thing I hope to see from them is to add combination roll deals.
