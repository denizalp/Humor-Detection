This place is expensive and pretentious. I don't know if it was the sight of seeing old suits with young gold diggers or thirsty cougars. Anyway, this place is not for me, I'll just save a bajillion dollars and make my old fashions at home... mine are better anyway ;)\n\nI paid in cash and the waiter never came back with my change... guess he assumed I'm a generous tipper!
