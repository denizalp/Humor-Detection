This is more of a 3.5\/5.\n\nCame here for lunch today and I got the OG chicken plate. My god the chicken was juicy. It was also perfectly crispy and fried without being too oily. \n\nI also ordered a side of coleslaw. Meh is the only word to describe it.\n\nOverall, the chicken was quite good but I'm docking 1.5 stars for the subpar coleslaw and slow service.
