New place in town! Definitely a \"WooHoo!\" \n\nLoved the casual ambience; loved what they had done with this \"old\" building; loved the tacos; and especially loved the margarita!  Service was outstanding. A must on anyone's list who loves seeking out the new places around our valley. Gallo Blanco absolutely should be on your list of local eateries.\nwww.galloblancocafe.com
