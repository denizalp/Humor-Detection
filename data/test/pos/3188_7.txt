Super easy to use and the drivers are always helpful. \n\nUsed them recently when my car battery died and the driver even offered to jump my car!\n\nWould never use a cab if Lyft is available. They are less expensive and the drivers are more honest than any cabbie I have met- had the driver miss a turn once and they stopped the meter so I wouldn't be charged for the lap around the block....
