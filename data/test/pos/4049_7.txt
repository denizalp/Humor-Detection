The owners need to go to local burrito places and see what you get for the same price. A teaspoon of guacamole, 4 strips of lettuce, another teaspoon of fried beans? Come on. \n\nGood service and the burrito was just OK but I won't be back, no reason to go here and waste my money (no, the free potato stick isn't enough) when I can get twice as much, way better quality and taste for the same price.
