Tiny and unfriendly.  But that hurricane 151 frozen drink was potent!  \n\nThere is though an open bar time I *think* Monday-Thurs from 9-11for $30 or something like that.  I'm sure it's all wells and Bud Lights, but the line for it was insane!\n\nBut if you like a tiny, dingy bar with bras hanging from the rafters (how long have those been up there anyways?!) then this is the place for you in Vegas!
