What a pretentious scene!! \n\nBut drinks are decently priced at $6 or $7 for a mixed drink. One bar inside and one bar outside.\n\nThey have round beds on their patio that no one seems to sit\/lay on...I wonder why. There is a semi-good view of downtown Tempe and the patio is awesome on a warm Arizona night.
