This salon was found in a plaza, in a part of town where plazas are remnants of urban development from the 80s. After I had an invigourating scalp massage by Anita,  I had my hair cut (no pun intended) by Caroline, a Senior Stylist whom had cut my hair quite well except that she left a side of my hair imperfect which is blasphemy, especially to my detail-oriented self. Nice people, not that perfect..
