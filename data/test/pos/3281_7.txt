Been going there for years and will continue to do so.  The fig pizza is amazing, the salads are the best in the city, and the baked goods.... .to die for.    Gordon Ramsey is an idiot and he should be sued, so many clowns have jumped on the bandwagon.  But Amy & Sammy are polite and attentive to their guests and the food is awesome and moderately priced.
