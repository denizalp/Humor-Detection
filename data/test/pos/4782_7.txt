this place sucks . girls passed me up even though i had 200$ cash in ones. I made it rain to dr dre though. all was good, got pretty drunk. made friends with the guys there like myself that also lacked the necessary attention. advice to girls is shake more skin and be more outgoing. Its okay to be a cool stripper and not stuck up
