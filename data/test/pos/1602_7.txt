Such an amazing site. I got chills once I walked up to the building for the first time. \n\nSeeing it all lit up just leaves you in ahh. \n\nThere are a lot of benches to sit on in front to hang out or just people watch. \n\nI sat and ate dinner here but could not stop looking at how pretty it was. \n\nI wish I went inside but sitting outside was worth my long drive here.
