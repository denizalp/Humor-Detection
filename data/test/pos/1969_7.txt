I came here with a bunch of Yelpers on a Friday night and was SO impressed with the beer, food, service, everything! I ordered the Hatch Chile Gatos and honestly, couldn't get enough! It was SO tasty...and different! For food, my boyfriend and I split the pretzel and cheese (I can never resist this!) and I got the Caesar Salad w\/buffalo chicken. It was SO yum! We will absolutely be back soon. It's wide open space makes it a GREAT place for large groups. Birthday party anyone? Thank you for being so awesome, Fate team!
