Disgustingly good cupcakes.\n\nEven if I am on a diet, I can't resist eating one when someone brings them into the office.  Yes, they are pricey, but I feel that it is the ridiculously overpriced items like these that just make you feel special when someone gives you one.  I can honestly say I have never bought one myself but I do occasionally stop by for a free one when they do their \"secret word\" thing on Facebook.
