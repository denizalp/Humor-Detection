Incredibly disrespectful sign holder, who on multiple occasions is happily dancing with a sign that reads \"guns\" and pointing his hand in the air pretending to shoot. This is inappropriate considering the recent events in our local community and nation. I called to complain and they hung up on me. Shame on you!
