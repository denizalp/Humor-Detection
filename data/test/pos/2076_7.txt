Very impressed with the food quality and portions with my only complaint being having not tried this place sooner.  Definitely casual and inexpensive a place to stop for a quick bite. I order the Red Shredded beef burrito enchilada style which means smothered in green chili sauce and cheese, which is excellent and i wont mind you stealing my standard order for yourself.
