The pizza here was ok greasy typical pizza. The place looked so beat down I liked it. It was probably 2003 or so and I received a phone call from my Mama back home in Lakewood. She told me she heard on the news that a delivery man at Guido's was selling dope and delivering pizzas. The place automatically gained respect from me. The Jo Jo's are good too!
