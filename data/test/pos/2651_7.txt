This place use to be one of the best sushi restaurants around... Not the case now since the ownership change. The food portions have been cut down, no air conditioning  and the new owner has more rules then the government. The only reason I'm giving this place one star is because of the delightful sushi chef Sung and the new female sushi chef.
