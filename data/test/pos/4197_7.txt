Went here for a manicure before the wedding because my soon-to-be-wife said I should.*\n\nI had never had a manicure before, and this seemed like a fine place to get a manicure. I guess. I really have nothing to compare it to.\n\nBut they did do a parafin wax at the end, so that was kind of nice. And the bridal party seemed to think their pedicures were fine.\n\nSo this seems like a solid three star place.\n\n* - I was practicing the whole order-taking thing. I think I did pretty well.
