WARNING as stated by many other reviewers.... Clutch your wallets and purse!.iPhone stolen out of thin air in this over-crowded smoke filled waste of your time. Shady people in stairwell trying to sell drugs! Unsafe environment. Security said it was common and was unwilling to do anything. Said cameras were for things like \"if people fall\". Never again...go elsewhere and leave your valuables at home. Las vegas has an \"iPhone trafficking ring\" BEWARE! NEVER AGAIN
