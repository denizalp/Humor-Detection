This club is just BEAUTIFUL.  Every room and level is perfectly done.  Even though first weekend was a little hectic, EVERY CLUB in Vegas didn't have a smooth road opening.  I believe Hakksan did a great job opening.  \n\nFavorite room is the Ling Ling Lounge!\n\nJust read one of the reviews for Hakksan.. Who the heck asks for tap water at a bar inside a club in Vegas?!
