I admit it... I'm a chef wannabe, and Sur La Table makes me wannabe a Chef even more!  \n\nI went into this place recently and was blown away by all of the cooking supplies, cool gadgets and accessories.  I'm sure I could find plenty of kitchen tools that *I need* if I cooked more than I do, but seeing that I eat out the majority of my meals at this point in my life, I can't justify shopping here for myself.  \n\nI will, however, continue to shop here when looking for gifts for my capable culinary comrades.
