Holy Land has transitioned nicely into its own pace post-Jack's, and it's nice to see it working out.  The sandwiches themselves are cheap and filling, and oh god falafel is pretty amazing here.  I like to sit in the one booth that is under a tent-like canopy and feel extra special.  Particularly if they're playing the usual fare of Arab-language music videos.  After a ridiculous day, sitting under a semi-tent and watching muic videos whilst eating falafel might be one of the best non-alcoholic mood lifters ever.
