Well, I just found my favorite brewery. Get the imperial red. That's all I have to say. The appetizers go very well with the beer and I love that there are so many other has that are close by in downtown Phoenix so you can just bar hop! We got the poutine fries. Bro a huge fan of gravy but these were delicious and compliments the beer well.\n\nThey have a wide variety of selection to choose from. I have to come back for the homemade pop tarts everyone raves about.
