Fantastic view of the strip from the Mandarin Oriental. \n\nExpensive drinks. It's a fancy place.\n\nMy co-workers stopped by for a little bit after dinner. We split a $65 bottle of wine and snacked on some bar nuts. I really loved the ambiance since it was loungey and not too busy. It's a really great place for a romantic date and our bartender was really nice too.
