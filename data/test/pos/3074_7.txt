I have been to a Roadhouse before, in Texas. This one served me a sirloin steak that was to fatty. I was chewing for what felt like 10 minutes before the steak was broke down enough to eat. It spoil the mood and meal.\n\nThe location is surrounded by steakhouses.\n\nThe atmosphere was pretty festive. The servers began to dance for a little girls birthday party.\n\nThe service was good.\n\nThe price was pretty standard but I would want to come during their happy hour.
