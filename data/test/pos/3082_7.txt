I really enjoyed my experience at diamond nails. I was having a really bad week and decided to treat myself to a mani pedi. The staff were polite and did good work. The manager of the salon was very kind and memorized everyone's name. He made sure to check in with the guests  and remembering names was a nice touch.\n\nI will be back!
