Yummy! Ordered the Vegan Carrot pancakes. \nArrived in front of me were 3 large, thick, fluffy, perfectly moist and heavenly pancakes sprinkled with crunchy coconut, pecans, grated carrots and agave. I could barely eat 1 pancake the serving was so huge. My partner got the chicken & waffles which came with gravy and fries. I loved the crispy crunchy coating on the fried chicken! Very tasty. The Green vegetable juice also pleased me. \n\nThe place is modern, simple but cheery atmosphere. Reasonable pricing. Good service. Wholesome and fresh food.
