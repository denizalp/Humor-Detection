We were looking for something different to do tonight and boy did we find it! What a fantastic time!! We got there early so were able to meet the staff & right off started to have a blast! TJ was so helpful and very entertaining! We were able to change up colors and be creative while still following good instruction!\n\nI appreciate that you bring your own food and drink and not stuck paying for overpriced stuff.\n\nCan't wait to go again!
