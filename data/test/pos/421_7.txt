I hate to say it because I really wanted to like this place but The Black Sheep could definitely step it up a notch.  To many the menu is unique and exotic but the flavors are just not quite there.  Tried the claypot salmon, egg rolls and octopus.  All were ok, but not amazing.  In the same day, I tried this place and also Sparrow and I gota say...Sparrow was a lot more satisfying with flavors that meshed well and just you can taste the freshness of their ingredients.
