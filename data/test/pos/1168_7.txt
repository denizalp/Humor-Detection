A wide vairety of movies with lots of showtimes, nice plus!! This theater is fairly new so the sound is crisp and the screens are beautiful, all surrounded in a contemporary design. Theater was clean and tidy, the seats were comfy and roomy, and the temperature was just right.\n\nNote: you get what you pay for, $10.75 a ticket mid-week night just FYI.
