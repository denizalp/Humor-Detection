We're in Pittsburgh, so we came here based on Mark Bittman's NYTimes article--\"the BEST pizza.\" It wasn't. It was good, but not the best and there wasn't much of it. \n\nBittman's article is such an example of NYTimes 'journalism'--'We're so smart and hip that we go to places no one goes to.' You know what? There's a reason no one's going.
