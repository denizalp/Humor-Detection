Went in for lunch the other day.   Nice place. Service was very good.  The food tasted great.  But i guess the lunch menu the portions are smaller.  For the price. Its not worth eating there at lunch.  I ate all my food and walked out hungry.  As good as food was  i cant see going back for those prices. Our bill was 50 dollars for 2 lunch meals and 2 iced teas.
