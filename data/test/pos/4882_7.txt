I needed three pairs of slacks hemmed within a short time frame and they were completed on time and with expert lengths and hems.  I was a walk-in customer.  One of the pairs additionally required a waist fitting, which was completed perfectly. This lady knows her craft.  I will return here for all of my future alterations.  Plus, the pricing for these services is reasonable.  Only checks and cash are accepted for payment, which helps keep the pricing right.
