I'm not a coffee drinker at all but considering I had to stay up for most of the day, I decided to buy an Espresso at SB. This SB is located at the Charlotte airport and even at 6:00am, it was packed. SB just doesn't do it for me, I feel the Espressos are not that strong or flavorful but then again that's how I feel about coffee in general. Despite the long line, it flowed well and I was able to get on the plane on time.
