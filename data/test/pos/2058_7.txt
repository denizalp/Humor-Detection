We got a last minute room here one night because we knew we would be wine tasting at a local tasting room.  The location of this hotel is great; within walking distance of many bars, restaurants, etc.  The establishment itself isn't really anything to write home about but it will give you a place to lay your head if you need it.  There's not a whole lot left to say -- just an average stay at an average hotel\/motel.
