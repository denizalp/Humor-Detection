The takeout lady seemed to think we were ruining her life by ordering the 9.99 takeout chicken deal. She was very rude and it didn't seem like Someone was assigned to take out on a permanent basis and a waiter had to come off table service every time someone wanted delivery. \n\nWhen we got home the chicken was underwhelming and the fries soggy and pitiful. Least it came with dipping sauce. \n\nI haven't eaten Swiss chalet in years and this just makes me remember why.
