Many nail technicians available so usually not a wait but can get very busy on weekends and after work hours.  They have the large massage chairs for pedicures and many tables for manicures.  They do shellac, gel and acrylics too.  Friendly service and price is decent.  \n\nI had a shellac manicure done and it was done quickly and beautifully.  Serviced by Tracy.  She was very friendly and nice.
