I'm a big fan of tenderized sashimi, so when I tried the toro, I assumed the MGM had a fish masseur in the kitchen, because it was sooo incredible and very good.\nWe just ordered oysters, some nigiri, and more oysters.  I ordered the lycheetini also called house special cocktail, was so good.\n I was completely surprised to see that their sake wine list was a full on binder with section dividers separating the various regions in Japan.  This binder was the equivalent to my comprehensive notebook from undergrad.
