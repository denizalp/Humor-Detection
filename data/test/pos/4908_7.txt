I really like the atmosphere of Mezzo. I came here for an early dinner last night and since it was warm, the large windows were open. I ordered fried zucchini and an arugula salad; both of which were pretty good. The chefs have a strict policy of no substitutions so I was told that I could not order my salad and add chicken for a protein. I still enjoyed my experience.
