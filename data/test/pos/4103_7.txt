I have been an Acura customer at this dealer for 8 years and I can tell you that the service department here is exceptional. Vince is the only person I deal with an wouldn't trade him and the service I get for anything. \n\nHe goes out of his way to make every experience a great one and is amazing. \n\nIf your vehicle needs service, speak with Vince!
