Absolutely the worst barber shop I have ever been, I can't believe the board hasn't shut them down. The guy was rude, and every time I asked him to do something he would just yell were busy here no time for that. He just chopped Radom hair, my hair looks absolutely horrible and not me mention his dirty mouth when you told him you wanted shorter hair. Suleyman is the worst barber I have ever seen and this is the worst barber shop ever.
