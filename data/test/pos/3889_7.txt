GORGEOUS park. One of my favorite parks, if not my favorite. Such an easy park to stroll through as it is spread along the water. Unlike other parks, there are no cliffs to hike up and it probably holds the most outdoor sculptures. Just wish it was closer to my place downtown. FYI, no dogs allowed. Having traveled all the way there, I was lucky to have a carrier bag for my little furry friend to carry him around unnoticed. - The end.
