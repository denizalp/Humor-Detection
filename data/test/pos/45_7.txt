Shwarma Paradise\n\nOmar is just an Outstanding cook and partner in this delightful joint.\n\nIt pains me to read some of the latest reviews especially those from Buckeye AZ that fancy themselves as \"experts\" of Middle Eastern cuisine....\n\nThis place rocks....it is ALL-Great food.\n\nIf you are a neurotic debutante masquerading around town as Anthony Bourdain then please spare us your narcissistic Groupon fueled diatribes and just eat else where...preferably in Gaza!!!\n\nTake your time and come enjoy a slow paced extraordinarily rewarding meal.
