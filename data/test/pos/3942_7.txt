First off Half of the menu isn't available \n\n\nThe Mexican cashier was really annoying asking where my parents were from, where was I staying at, where was I from, when I asked him to call a cab for me, he told me that he could take me to my hotel, I got really annoyed and walked out. \n\n\nThird the food was below average, the fried plantains were the only good thing out of the three things I ordered.
