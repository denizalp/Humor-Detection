So after the Kookie got her new ride\nWe decided to look at some parts\nWere ready to buy, asked \"Shawn\" if they had a \"Locking Gas Door for a Yukon\" \nhe checked the computer an said \"NOPE\" so we said ok, looked around an on the North wall, what do our eyes find....The Correct Locking Gas Door.\n\nHe needs to go back to fast food or the trailer he left unoccupied.
