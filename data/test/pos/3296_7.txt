Awesome overpriced $6 a slice NY style pizzas with thin perfectly crisp crust. Located inside The Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor next to STK. Total hidden gem. No seating available though, just countertops to stand around and stuff drunk face. It's such a 'Secret' The Cosmopolitan Hotel's website doesn't even list it under their dining options. Just ask the concierge for directions if lost. Super friendly flirty service from the charming pizza boys.
