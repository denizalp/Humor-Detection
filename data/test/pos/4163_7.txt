This place is probably the worst casino I have been in while in Vegas as far as esthetics go. It's incredibly smoky and just has kinda a trashy feel. BUT we continue to go here to gamble on the tables because I am not an avid\/experienced gambler and they have the cheapest tables on this half of the strip. \n\nThe cocktail waitress kinda ignore you if you are on the machines but if you are at a table one will come by about every 30 mins
