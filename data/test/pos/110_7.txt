Two Words.\n\nRainbow Pop.\n\nThis flavor has changed my life.\n\nIt's technically not frozen yogurt in the traditional sense of the word. It's more of a shaved ice or a sorbet type texture and flavor. Its a cotton candy light blue color and it's so refreshing and light! Topped off with some popping boba (which I'm sad at their lack of selection of) and maybe some gummy bears.\n\nHeaven in a yogurt cup!
