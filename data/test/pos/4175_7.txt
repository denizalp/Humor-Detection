Not good for large groups. They asked us to do family style and we denied yet they brought it out that way anyway. They will only charge max 3 credit cards but the website says otherwise. When the food came out we had to ask what was what...and even tell our waiter to stop cocking an attitude because he was straight out rude when we asked.\n\nWe're from Chicago and our pittsburgh friends wanted to take us to the best pittsburgh bbq joint. We were disappointed that this was it.
