3.5. Pretty over it.\n\nDistinctive Dining deal is now $59, and you don't get to choose your own side any longer. Instead you get a mediocre mash that I was not compelled to eat.\n\nFilet is still excellent and seasoned very well.\nCrab cake is bomb.\nSalmon was served with a really heavy, rich sauce that was just too much. \n\nFor some reason V&A's just doesn't deliver on sides and sauces.\n\nIf you dine here and self-park, make sure to bring your ticket stub into the restaurant to get it validated.
