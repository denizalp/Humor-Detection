Few things are better than an arepa - let alone an arepa bar.  As mentioned in other reviews, arepas are made from 100% corn, but they are nothing like a tortilla. In Colombia, they are served plain or with toppings and in Venezuela they are stuffed - but the arepa is generally the same. \n\nArepas Grill offers the Venezuelan style. The cafe is simple, no frills - just great, fresh food served by nice people. I highly recommend trying the juices with water too. Note, don't go in a rush, expect food to take 15 minutes to prepare.
