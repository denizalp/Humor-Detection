First time ever coming here. We were late due to my work schedule only to find it was cake time. My 2 year old cried to play so noticing no one was on the playground I asked the worker if I could pay for her to play. He was incredibly rude to me saying no I should have been on time to the party and that my working was not his problem. How can you be in the business of kids then be so callous?! HORRIBLE customer service!!
