Still the best cheap cheerful asian food in Carrefour Laval. You don't need to read what I am trying to describe by words. Just view the over 40 photos. Dammm it's so salty good! Get your rear end there and don't even think about going to Manchu Wok. Shanghai 360 is miles above and beyond better. \n\nA word of warning. The braised eggplant is no longer available. \n\nEnjoy!
