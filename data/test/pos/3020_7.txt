Inspired by the ROTD and craving their Hot Links Sandwich, I went there for lunch today with a friend who lives nearby.\n\nToday I ordered a Hot Links Sandwich, Fries, and split an order of Buffalo Wings.  Yeah, it was a belly-full alright!\n\nThe Hot Links again were very solid....loaded with Cheese, Onions, and Hot Sauce.  The Buffalo Wings were good and huge!  French Fries good as well.\n\nThe restaurant was busier this time around, so it looks like word is getting around....good, because I'd like to see them around for a while.\n\nWill I return?  You bet your Hot Links I will!
