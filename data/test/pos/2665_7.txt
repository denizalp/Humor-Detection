Vena's make a nice roti, but I did not find as earth shatteringly, toe curlingly wondrous as other reviewers on Yelp.    My primary argument against Vena's is their insistence on so blatantly scaling back on the more expensive ingredients in the fillings in order to preserve a low-ish price point.  \n\nStill, if you are in the neighbourhood it is worth a stop. But I wouldn't stray far off course to get there considering there are so many better options in the GTA.
