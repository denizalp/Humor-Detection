This really doesn't deserve a long drawn out review so here goes....\n\nBouncer let us in past the line which is rude for everyone else and started my experience off on a sour note but it get progressively worst....Music was off, bar was sticky icky and the drinks were over priced and watered down. Douchebags everywhere and cougars on the prowl which was actually pretty entertaining. \n\nAfter 15 minutes, I hightailed it out of there and went back to the casino bar. Save your time and money.
