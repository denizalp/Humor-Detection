Meh. The service was fine, our waitress was friendly. The location of this place kinda sucks, and even though the fish did taste fresh, the selection of rolls is small, not very innovative, and everything I had was underwhelming based on their 4-star rating. \n\nIf you want awesome sushi in the valley, best place to go is still Stingray.
