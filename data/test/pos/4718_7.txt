I liked this place. I picked up the stuff they had on the front page of the grand opening ad (coupons) It was all stuff we use or will be using. \n\nI spent 35 and saved 15.. \n\nThe place is huge, seems to stock a crap load of everything. Prices seem good. Staff was helpful, bagging myself was not a problem.
