Growing up on an island, I was so stoked to try out this place based on the reviews! \n\nIsland flavor is a friendly casual environment that has a  lot of diverse to it. Their chicken wings is yummy! The proportions of the food is very large but growing an appetite ever since I moved out to Vegas, I can finish the whole meal that was served :) I also loved their fried rice with eggs on top and sausages. A true Hawaiian plate.
