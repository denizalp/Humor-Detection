The food here is amazeballs and the staff is always kind. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because they try to charge you extra for take out boxes, and they don't have that listed on the menu and don't mention it to you before you order the large size bowl. WHO DOES THAT?  rude. I already paid $12 for a plate. Next time I'm just going to grab my food by the handful, shove some in my pocket and walk out trailing wheat noodles behind me #nofoodleftbehind
