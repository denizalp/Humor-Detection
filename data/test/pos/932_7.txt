Mixed Bag, not exactly a bad dealership, but definitely not the best choice either.\n\nI bought one car here and came away unimpressed; they definitely try to jack up the price, and come up with a lot of 'dealership added options'. I only bought the car because I wanted a certain model, in a specific color, otherwise I would have walked.\n\nIf you're looking for a Volkswagen, there are better options.
