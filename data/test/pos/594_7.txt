Unknown Brewing just stepped up their game - big time - with their new renovation. They've added on a beautiful rooftop patio and bar and enlarged their bar downstairs.  They also now offer prosecco (on tap!) and other wine options - in addition, of course, to their delicious beer.  \n\nDrop in, enjoy a drink and take in the view - you won't be disappointed!
