The 1000 or so reviews are definitely on point.  Best memory of my mom's eyes lighting up when she bit into the eggplant sandwich we shared. It's just such a lovely, casual, unassuming kind of caf√©. And that's what I love about it. The items that touch your tongue will instantly compliment the reviews you've read. Don't hesitate if you're ever near the area!
