Pretty decent gym, definitely a little funny with their rules but I guess it makes it more comfortable for some. The tvs are a bit too high for the bike area but I guess your not really there to watch tv. \n\nNo pool no courts for basketball or racket ball. Not a vip member so not sure what goes on in that secret area.. I will update you once I have more intel.
