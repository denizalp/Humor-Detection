I'm just here for the kool-aid! The food is pretty standard, but I'm boring because all I order is the calamari and mozzarella sticks every time because that's my fav. \n\nThe kool-aid is great it tastes like heaven and diabetes. They have different flavors, but my fav is red!!! I like strawberry kiwi too... try it out, very affordable spot.
