I've been searching for a decent Tonkatsu place in Las Vegas and nothing seems to stand up to my unreasonably high standards. Being part Japanese and given that I go back to Japan once or twice a year, I'm a snob when it comes to Sushi and Tonkatsu (among other things).\nNow that being out of the way, this place actually does the job for me. Quite good. Food comes out quickly, service is friendly, and I feel my insatiable hunger for Tonkatsu eased after coming here.
