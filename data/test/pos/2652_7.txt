Kind of an ordinary bar. Except there are chicks dancing on stages and the bars. $5 cover for guys, not bad for Vegas. I got in free (schweet). $9 for a Jack on the Rocks (well, it's Vegas.) Also, they spray you with water from time to time which is really weird. I was drunk and kept forgetting, and was like wtf! Did someone spill a drink on me?! Oh wait no, I'm just being watered. Like a daisy on the lawn.
