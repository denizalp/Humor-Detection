First of all. Don't speak to me with an attitude. If you hate your job. GO FIND ANOTHER ONE! The bartenders are are meh at best. And for Mulligan's policy not using derogatory words in their bar is straight bs. It's a BAR for Christ sakes. Give a kit kat or snickers because that would've made me have a better time. My first & ONLY time being a patron here. Overall experience WACK!!!
