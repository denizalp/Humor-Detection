Every once in a while, when I'm feeling particularly flush, I battle the evil that is the WF parking lot. I tell myself it will totally be worth it in order to class it up with some high quality goodies.  \n\nThe fish and meat selection are out of the park when it comes to freshness.  However, I've purchased flowers twice and each time they were dead by day three.  Both times I allowed the molten flowers to remain on the counter an extra day to serve as a reminder why I'm not WF material.
