I have so much love for my classic Wisco hangout.\n\nWhen I describe Wisco bars to San Francisco people,Bacon night at Wando's sums it up wonderfully:\n1. Free Bacon (hundreds of pounds of deep friend deliciousness)\n2. Dollar Beers \n\n...now if only we could get them to hand out free cubes of cheese!
