Here we have the other tie for the best cappuccino in Montreal (in my opinon).  I can't believe Mr. Handlbar mustache can turn out a cappuccino as fast as he does and still make it as good as he does.  And I think I'm a pretty hard sell!\n\nThe 3 visits made to Olimpico were always a 2 cuppa trip and worth the wait in the speedy line.\n\nMr. Mustachio must be come un ballerino because he makes that 30lb tamp look like someone checking their watch for the time.\n\nBravo, Bravo, Olimpico!!
