Came here for Sunday St Patrick's day, the place as I can recall has always been a comfy, homey time of joint.  The old sofas, and wooden tables and chairs makes you feel at home.  Though the noise level was quite loud, the atmosphere was exciting.....everyone wearing green, management giving away various Guinness hats and gifts.  The food was great, I out of all days, decided to have a glass of wine, but also ordered the Major Milliken All in one combo....the portion for its price was worth it.  Ive been to this place before, it never disappoints.
