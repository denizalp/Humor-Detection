Wow. Stupid good. Amazing burger\/sliders and buffalo sammy. Truffle fries and ask for garlic aioli and dont miss the garlic chili wings... each one as big as your arm.  Come here now. Only negative is... hmmm no real negatives. Improvements: serve wedge on bigger plate. Blue cheese with wings instead of ran\nch. Pretty good when that is the worst I had. To top it off... nothing left to go, that good. Deliver to my house. We WILL be back. Brian rocks too!
