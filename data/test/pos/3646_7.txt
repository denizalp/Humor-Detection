This place has good deals and auctions are reasonable.  However, there hours of operation are very limited and if you need to pickup you need to be careful to pickup items.  Staff are equivocal in terms of pleasantries.  If you're looking to sell items through consignment you will get hosed.  Very step fees and their listing staff may describe your items poorly resulting in lower bids on your items.  Overall OK, but not great.
