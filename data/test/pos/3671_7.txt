Pricey yummy upscale diner food type stuff here but what you can also get is a watermelon smoothie.  \n\nA watermelon smoothie that tastes like a real watermelon. \n\nLike seriously, surprisingly like a real watermelon.\n\nLike I was with someone who was in Vegas two years ago and had one and insisted on bringing me here to have one. \n\nWatermelon.\n\nNo artificial flavoring, just watermelon.\n\nWater\n\nMelon\n\nWah\n\nTer\n\nMel\n\nOn\n\nW.
