Everyone that i talked to there were so rude it was a BAD experience .Don't go there inless you wana deal with stuck up people that will even look at you in a bad way they didn't even try to be nice . 80 dollars and up .Thats just crazy for a hair cut and then they dont see anyone unless you make an appointment .Today was my only day off and these people couldn't even  do me the curtesy of cutting my hair even though i saw people standing around not doing anything. BAD PLACE RUDE PEOPLE!
