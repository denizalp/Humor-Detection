Definitely a MUST everytime I hit up Vegas. Sometimes I go twice a weekend back to back... it's just THAT good. Been going since it opened up and it has yet to disappoint me. Music COULD be a little better, but I'm not complaining :) It's going to be hard to open up a new club that'll top XS! Everything about it is beautiful! From the venue, to the staff, crowd... I LOVVVE XS!!!!!!!
