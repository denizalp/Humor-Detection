Very best in nail salons is Diamond Nails. They are always pleasant and professional, quite even when Dan is sharing a joke so one can hear themselves think without hearing everyone else banter in another language, have children screaming about or blaring tv or radio. They play movies with subtitles so you can watch or not watch, offer a beverage (water or wine) and I have always been happy with mani, pedi or both.
