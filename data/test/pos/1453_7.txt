I come to this casino maybe two or three times a year. It's a Station casino so it is set up like all the other Station casinos in town. The one thing I don't like about this casino is the cigerette smell. Ugh! I don't gamble near people who are smoking but I still leave the casino smelling like an ashtray. I think I might just be overly sensitive to the smell.\n\nOn my last visit here, I noticed that the slot machines were very loose... or I was just having really good luck which I hope continues.
