I don't frequent Walmart often and apparently some of them are decent (I love the one at Surfside Beach on SC-544).  Unfortunately, this ain't one of them.   If you gotta go then read some other reviews.  I'm courageous and adventurous but here I'm on high alert.  Of course, I feel the same at both their Independence Blvd and N Tryon locations, too.  The Wilkinson Blvd location is the worst IMO.
