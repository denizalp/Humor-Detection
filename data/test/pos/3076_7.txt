Just finished choking down my questionable Barburrito, so I thought I would leave a little review in case I don't make it to tomorrow. \n\nWhat an interesting type of chicken they use. Vegan friendly, too! It's one part foam, one part water, two parts PVA glue. \n\nThe kibble Barburrito uses for beef was an interesting choice as well. I usually prefer Fancy Feast when i'm going to eat cat food. But that's okay. \n\nIn terms of low quality...this place truly reigns supreme. It looks the same coming out as it does going in. \n\nGood luck everyone! :)
