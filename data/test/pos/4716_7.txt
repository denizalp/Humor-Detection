Great service. Cozy seating. The chef comes out to go over any allergies.  When the server asked about allergies my friend mentioned seafood (obviously not in the breakfast items we ordered). It was nice that the chef came out to assure us anyway!  Ordered monkey bread. All the ingredients were enticing.  For sure filling enough for one person as an entree. I left behind a quarter of it as the sweetness was overwhelming.  Still so delicious and I crave it!
