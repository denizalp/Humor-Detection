One star...for effort. If you want Indian food made by white people and songs licking Jesus' feet (and food that tastes the same) then this is the place for you. If you aren't a fan of hardcore missionary colonialism then just go to Saffron Patch in Merriman Valley. I guess Bombay could be nice for a church retreat.
