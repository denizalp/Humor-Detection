Bartender Jake greets me with \"What do YOU want?\" and tells other bartender infront of me \"Whats-his-face wants a pizza.\". I'm kicking myself for tipping him $4 for a $3 beer and $4 for $11 pizza thinking he just had a bad day but after four meetings and four abrasive experiences he should have a job not interacting with humans let alone customers.
