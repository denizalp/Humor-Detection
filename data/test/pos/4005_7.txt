Mike (Cabrera) and Don were amazing when I purchased my brand new HR-V! Mike was very patient, listens and makes it happen! He was very personable and reasonable and made it easy to make the deal. My Husband and I will be bringing our Honda to him when they purchase their next cars. \n\nTim in Service is fantastic! Overall, this has been the best I've been treated at any dealership! I'm very happy with my Honda and all of the Advisors and Sales Team that I've worked with.
