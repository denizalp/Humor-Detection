Mesa Grill never disappoints. I recommend the blue corn pancake, the chile rubbed pork tenderloin, and the lamb chops. The margaritas are potent and they have a good wine list.\n\nAs with any celebrity chef restaurant, you won't see anyone you know in the kitchen, but the staff here consistently gives good service and good food. We end up booking a dinner here every year and we always leave happy. \n\nAnd since you will always get lost in Caesar's Palace, the tip to finding this restaurant is to look for the sports book. It's adjacent to that.
