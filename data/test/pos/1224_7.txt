Bayview Village, Just like Janna has stated, you've really grown on me. I come here at least once a week or more.\n\nThroughout the week, its usually a quiet place. Which it makes it  nice to walk throughout the mall without having a bunch of people flying at you in different directions. It only seems to be a hangout for the seniors. \n\nI come here for my two new found addiction, David's Tea and Papyrus along with Chapters, Loblaws, LCBO, and Pusateri's.
