The worst show I ever saw in my life. I left. They dance like ... Let me put it to you this way. I was seeing some street guys in Manhattan the week before that would put them to shame.\nI don't know what planet these guys were from but not African Americans or Americans. They looked like phonies with masks. \nA piece of advise. Do the show for free and maybe some sucker will give you a tip. Doubt it. \nGo spend your money somewhere else like the Michael Jackson show. Worth every penny.
