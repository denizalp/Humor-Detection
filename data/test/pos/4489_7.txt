So its an airport like any other but there is a couple of smoking areas for those interested - even though I'm a vaper these days.  There are plenty of eateries in here and what makes it unique is the slots, but then it is Vegas. There is also a cool T shirt\/ Lounge wear store in most terminals where you can pick up a sexy little number for the wifey to wear while you in vegas or heading home, always a fun stop over when I hit McCarran.
