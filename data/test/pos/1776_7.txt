Dear Panda Management,\n\nPlease have your employees check the correct order before giving it to the customer.  Several orders got mixed up and we ended up receiving the food of the guy behind us. How hard is it to follow the line? And why does beef and broccoli only come with three pieces of beef?\n\nThanks for reminding me never to eat Panda again.
