We just done eating a steak here, which was good, I've told them that I'm not eating dairy and asked to not add butter to my steak and order as a side the asparagus which I ask specifically without dairy which means no butter and no cheese.  The asparagus came with cheese on top.  They apologized, after letting me know that in the order it came with dairy alergy and still was served with cheese and of course the manager said: someone could have been die... I'm sorry...\n\nBe aware. We are not going to eat here again!
