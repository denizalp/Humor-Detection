DO NOT GO HERE! NOT A GOOD BIZ!!! I'm not sure if this is the safest place in charlotte or legal from a haz mat perspective.  It was a scary experience with people smoking, yelling & throwing batteries around.  The floor in the \"office\" was covered in oil and what looked like battery acid.  They Claimed I have a new battery even though it severely discharged the entire cell in just 6 months.  They didnt have any warranty on it.  This place is scamming people good money.  Stay away.  Far away.
