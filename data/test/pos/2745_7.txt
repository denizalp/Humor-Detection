After years of going to different random nail salons I finally found the one I want to stay at! I've been here quite a few times now and always book my appt with Holly. She is amazing, very knowledgeable and can do pretty much everything! The front desk girls are always super nice and I always feel welcome there. They were also just renovated recently and this place is BEAUTIFUL, super modern and fun. Brand new pedi chairs, counters and everything. I come here every 2-3 weeks or so now. Definitely ask for Holly if you come here :)
