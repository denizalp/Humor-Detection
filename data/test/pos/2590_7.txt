I got married at the PAM cafe this weekend (ceremony on the patio, reception inside the cafe) and it was great. There were some communication issues in the planning stages but the event itself went off without a hitch. The dinner was delicious, the cupcakes rocked, the staff was great! \n\nYAY Arcadia Farms! \n\nIf you're thinking of having your wedding here and want to know more details about the event, feel free to message me. My brain is too fried at the moment to include it all in the review.
