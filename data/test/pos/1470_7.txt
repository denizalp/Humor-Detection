Haven't had a chance to try out the new lunch menu yet, but their desserts are spectacular. I came in to judge for myself and had the best slice of chocolate cake I've ever had. Brought several family members in since who can't get enough. Amy and Samy are very kind. When we came last week for my birthday, Samy brought my cake out with a candle and sang happy birthday to me. \n\nCome give their desserts a try for sure, you won't be disappointed!
