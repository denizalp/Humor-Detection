Ordered with a group from work. Most thought it was disgusting. I ordered Chicken Fried Rice because I'm always wary of unfamiliar Chinese food and thought, hey! how hard is Chicken Fried Rice to screw up? Well apparently it's not hard! There were only bean sprouts, greasy rice, and dark meat\/fatty\/gristly chicken. HORRIBLE. Never again. If I were starving I wouldn't eat it. Oh, and my fortune cookie said \"oops! wrong cookie.\" More like, oops! wrong restaurant.
