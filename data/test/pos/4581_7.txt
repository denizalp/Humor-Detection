I stopped in here today when I was running an errand at Town and Country, didn't realize it had opened.  I am not a fan.  I got the Primetime burger and it was awful.  A burger some truffle fries and a soda, and my bill before tip was 23.50!  That's more expensive than Zinnburger, but the food is much worse.  Service was friendly, but I won't be going back.  You are much better off driving caddy corner to Armadillo Grill where the food and service is great or down the street to Zinnburger.
