I couldn't see myself giving this location anything lower than five stars. It's a Barnes and Noble. Again, you come here knowing what they are what they have. Their customer service is excellent and they even have a coffee shop. I wouldn't really want to come there and do my work, but I could find it suitable for a meeting between two people. This isn't an Amelies where you'll see college students feverishly working on their term papers.
