Earlier this week, a friend recommended the Antwerp--a glorious Waffallonia waffle crowned with your choice of ice cream (get the speculoos) and chocolate sauce. I have since been here twice. I have ordered the Antwerp twice. Every bite is divine. Divine. TELL ME HOW YOU DO IT, WAFFLE-MAKING DOOHICKEY, because every Belgian waffle  you've birthed is equally perfect, with a crispy, carmelized sugar exterior and warm, doughy innards. And, while not at all necessary, the speculoos ice cream adds a rare and wonderful Biscoff-flavored goodness.  \n\nSeating is terrible. I don't care.
