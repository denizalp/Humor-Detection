The exterior of Lillian H. Smith Library is quite impressive! And those 2 dragon statues guarding the front door.. and more security guard inside to make sure we behave.\n\nThe collections here are impressive.. especially for Chinese language books... have a lot recent best sellers and 7 days loan newer material.\n\nLillian H Smith is different from other Toronto Public Library branches because it has special Children's collections that other branches doesn't have...\n\nWith free Wifi everyone are happy... especially me!
