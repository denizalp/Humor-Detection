Every so often someone tells me I've gotta try such-and-sucha-place because they have Halifax donairs. I've always been disappointed, until today. Jessy, you beautiful bastard, you've done it. You've finally made every East coasters' dreams come true. Some other's have tried, but you've kept it 100. From price point, to flavours, to weird menu extras that make my heart sing.\n\nToday I ordered a donair, a donair pizza, garlic fingers with donair sauce and a poutine with feta cheese. I'm about 4 lbs heavier, and I'm genuinely thrilled about it.
