I used to be a fan of this place.... UNTIL I found a freaking BAND-AID IN MY SOUP.\n\nI told the cook about it and he just apologized and threw the soup out. They didn't even bother giving me and my friend a refund until I complained about how I didn't eat. And the guy only ended up giving me one refund when there were two people eating out of the soup -____-
