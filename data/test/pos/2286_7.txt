***I WILL NEVER TAKE MY CHILD HERE AGAIN***\n\nI just left this office and had the worst experience with Dr. Paula J Silides, the owner.  Without consent she forcefully held down my child for a strep culture and it took me asking twice and a few continuing attempts to get her to stop.  She was very aggressive, visibly angry and attempted to berate my child and us about her inability to do her job.  I will be keeping my child away from her and this place.
