So.....I'd say more like 2.5, as I'd give it a second try, but there were some issues. First off, though, my fiancee enjoyed the lobster bisque, and I agree.....it was good.\n\nNow, onto my lobster grilled cheese sandwich. Ample amount of lobster, which is always a plus. Usually.\nIt was just kinda.....bland. It was just there. Couldn't taste the cheese, and the lobster\/crab was woefully underseasoned. The fries weren't cooked the best, and contrary to the sandwich, was oversalted.  Overall, not a good first impression.\n\nGenerous enough with portion and freshness, but seasoning\/flavor could use some retooling.
