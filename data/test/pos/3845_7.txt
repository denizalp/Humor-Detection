The pho is part decent but all the other dishes is really good. I ordered the crabmeat egg drop glass noodle! It was delicious! I love their service and whenever I come I'm never disappointed. The deep fried chicken wings with potatoes is good. I wouldn't recommend the pho if you're a pho lover but the curries and lemon grass chicken is worth it! It's a perfect relax and quiet environment.
