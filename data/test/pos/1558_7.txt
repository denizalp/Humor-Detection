Put this place in a strip mall and it becomes a slightly better looking cousin then Macaroni Grill.  The food isn't exceptionally memorable. Don't worry though, what sets this place apart is its atmosphere and location.  Spend some time on the patio and casually watch the pink skies light up Camelback at sunset while your kids frolic on the golf course.  You will be hard to pressed to find anywhere else in the Valley that affords you that kind of experience.
