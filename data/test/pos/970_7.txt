Worst service ever! The two girls working completely ignored us and continued cleaning as my boyfriend and I were waiting to order. Amanda who presented herself as manager was nothing but rude and argued with me when I asked to speak to someone above her. Completely disappointed! Food display was sticky and both the girls Amanda and Haley had no emotion I for sure will never come back.
