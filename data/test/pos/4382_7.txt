Been purchasing appliances here for 10 years, or so.  Never a bad experience.  This time purchased a washing machine.  Branden got us want we wanted, and it was delivered the following day as promised.  Prices very comparable to other stores, and they offer price match if you do find something for a better price elsewhere.  never shopped for a TV here, but if you need a major appliance, this place is great!
