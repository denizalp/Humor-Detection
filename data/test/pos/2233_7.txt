Went to Nathans Famous at Ballys casino at 11:25am, but the lady says they're not ready until another 15 mins.  What the???  Who ever heard of a fast food joint not ready for customers around lunch time??\nTerrible service right from the get go, so I didnt even eat there, so no review regarding the food.  : (
