Good hotel. Cheap. Weird bathroom. Shower only. No door on shower. No shelves to put anything on. Very minimalist bathroom.\n\nComplimentary ear plugs (semi loud biker bar across the street). Also complimentary water. No fridge or microwave.\n\nClose enough to Fremont Street to casually walk there but far enough from it to avoid most of the noise and loud activity that typically goes on. Best of both worlds.
