Very crowded place.  After we finished dinner, people were coming in and the host asked me to \"get out of the way.\"  They were not very polite after you paid your bill.\n\nFood has smaller portion, way overpriced for its ambiance and quality.\n\nIt is a place that is \"trying to look French.\" \n\nIt is more of a country restaurant with mommy's home cooking; portion could be increased. \n\nWill never go back there again.
