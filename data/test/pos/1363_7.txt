We ordered 2 large pizzas for delivery. \nNeither one of the pizzas were cut through. \nThey put way too much cheese on the pizzas. \nAll of the cheese slid off of both of the pizzas. \n\nIt's amateur hour over there. They don't know how to make a pizza. \nThey don't know how to cut a pizza and they don't know how to deliver a pizza. Other than that, they are ok. NOT!!!\n\nI highly recommend, for you to NOT use this place!!!
