I drove by this place a bunch of times going to Tempe Marketplace and from the outside it looked like a cool place that was worth a try. I went with a work group and we got crab cakes and calamari as an appetizer that were decent. I ordered the trout, which was just okay, it was quite plain tasting, not much flavor. I can't really say too much good about this place, its nothing special, it acts like a step up from Red Lobster, but its really not. At least Red Lobster has great smoothies and cheddary biscuits.
