Hungry ? Want something to eat , like maybe fish?  Well this place has fish. \nThis is the kind of place to go when you want food but not really caring how good it COULD be .  Service was great and very prompt. The host  , bartender, and wait staff seemed very into their jobs.  But the fish itself was not memorable.    A bit pricey , but offered many kinds of fish which seemed to be flown in?   I wouldn't go back unless a group of people were meeting there and it was what everybody else wanted. Enough said.
