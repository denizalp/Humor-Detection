My wife and I ate here last night. My dinner was quite good. I had the chicken stuffed with feta and spinach topped with a pesto sauce. Service was ok.. Not great but not terrible. Giving a one star review however because my wife became very ill when we got home and she puked her guts out for a few hours. So yeah.. If you guys can make sure the gyro meat is cooked all the way that would be great.
