Julia S and I were on a top secret mission today for a certain someone's birthday that will remain unmentioned. We stopped in Delicias Colombianas to grap a quick coffee, I simply could not resist the happy, little meat pie empanadas.  What a great little stop, you can grab a quick coffee & pastry or a full blown breakfast of champions. Two coffees and one empanda for $3.50 makes me contenta!
