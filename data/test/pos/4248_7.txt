I enjoyed it for the first few dumplings. But the pan fried ones are VERY salty. If you know someone with high blood pressure, and you want them dead, this is the place for you.\n\nOverall, it was ok. At least it was pretty cheap. But not tasty enough to compensate for the unhealthiness.\n\nDespite it being late, service was quick and friendly.
