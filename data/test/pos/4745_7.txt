Descent food but nothing over the top as some yelpers tend to write.\nWhat makes me give a 4 stars review is because it is one of the rare restaurant I've been in the USA that serves rabbit. Also they have a pretty extensive wine list and selection, that being said I wish they would offer more wine by the glass options.
