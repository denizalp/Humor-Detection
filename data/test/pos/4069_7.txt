First time trying out this place on a Saturday morning, this place is very slow, sitting down during the rush hours for almost 2 hours, only two customers including us.  The food was pretty normal, we used to go out alot for Japanese food, this place wasnt outstanding at all. service was so so.  prices was kinda cheap for Japanese food, but portion are kinda small too.\n\nOverall, nothing special about this place, I might come back, but it wont be often.
