A friendly staff whom don't speak english...Casino dealers here can't count right, and\/or are low quality break in dealers...This casino should be called \"The Cannery Nursing Home\" especially at the buffet where the food there is blah and the old timers are laying some nasty colon farts (stinky)...Movie theaters are ok, so is parking (except where the tractor trailers are taking up 10 spots to park sideways)...
