I ordered the BBQ Beef and to be quite honest, it was okay. Once I added hot sauce and soy sauce to the rice everything came together nicely. The side of Mac was really good. Yes, I would come here again. \n\nToday was the warmest Spring day of the season and it truly was a gorgeous day. Most places were packed due to being Saturday. 808 was no exception and that's why I would gladly return. It a nice restaurant in a busy shopping center.
