I've been here a couple times since it opened in this neighbourhood. The taste is fair, not spectacular but it does the job. The low rating is mainly for its lack of cleanliness and poor service. \n\nThe folks working there act like they despise being there every moment and there's flies all the time. In fact, I was able to make friends with two different flies on my last visit, I named them Mojo and Jojo (see photos)
