Worth the hike!\n\nLike the name says, this salon IS on level three  After being buzzed in, I was faced with three flights of stairs. I made it to the top amused and slightly out of breath. Alison is great.  She is friendly, honest and does a great job. This was my first time but definitely not my last. \nBut next time I'll wear running shoes lol!!\n\nFuggedaboutit!!
