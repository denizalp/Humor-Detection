Baristas super friendly (as you can see from one of my pics haha) & adorable. \n\nWhenever I decide to be adventurous with trying something new; they are super accommodating if it isn't quite 'my cup of tea' & change it  but that rarely happens. Always willing to make it right & tasty with a smile or friendly chit chat.\n\nWide selection\/variety of snacks, treats & meals. Well worn furnishings but clean & stocked. \n\nThanks for waking me up; even when it's in the afternoon haha.
