Love the great energy here, and a feeling of Europe.  Beautiful pastries and sandwiches.  Oh, and the coffee, fantastic.  Seriously, this has the just the right amount of distraction, perfect for writing the great American novel.  It has lots of outlets for plugging into, and a dozen outdoor tables.\n\nThis beats a trip to that Bean place, or the Bucks...anyday.\n\nHey Peeps - and they also have afgato (espresso with a scoop of ice cream, vanilla or chocolate).  Love, even more so.\n\nPS.  I'm pretty certain it's supposed to be spelled, \"Affogato\", but perhaps in Portuguese it's different?  http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Affogato
