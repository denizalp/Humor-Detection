We're Still Open Until 2016. This sign at the corner of Bathurst and Bloor made me feel things. \n\nYes, I've spent hours trying to find things here, yes they have some ridiculous things, no I wouldn't trust their grocery section as isn't their whole thing everything is from the 70s. \n\nHowever, this is Toronto's history. This is a happy place. This is where you can fall in love with things you never knew you always wanted,gawk at Mirvish theatre posters from Yesteryear and still get dental floss on the cheap. \n\nEnjoy Ed before he takes his final bow.
