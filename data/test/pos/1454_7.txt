Let me start off by saying we HAD been eating at fausto's for the past 2 years, until new years eve 2011, both my husband and i got the WORST food poisoning from here that you can imagine, shooting out both ends for 8 hours straight, twice an hour.  As much as we enjoyed fausto's (went there sometimes three times a week) we will never be returning, obviously they have some cleanliness issues, oh and i had a vegetarian meal and my husband had the #5, so obviously it was a wide spread issue not just one item.
