The wall mural of a beach transports you into a Thai beach wonderland. The illuminated tropical fish picture is also magnificently beautiful.\n\n The pad thai is the worst pad thai I've ever had and yet I order it every time I go. It's so bad it's delicious.  The crispy chicken rolls are heavenly. Everything is hella cheap and prepared so quickly. \n\nOne time I saw the cast from MTV Showtown in Ginger and I was like \"Lol ur show got cancelled\"
