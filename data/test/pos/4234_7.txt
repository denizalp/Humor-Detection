I'm an indie film junkie and what used to be a nice, convenient location is now a complete clusterf*ck!  WHY WHY WHY did you relocate to the mall????  A free standing theatre is far more accessible.  Parking is a disaster and your ticket prices have skyrocketed.  Please move the indie films to a different Harkins location.  I will NEVER return!!!
