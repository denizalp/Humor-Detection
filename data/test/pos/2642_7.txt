If you are in the mood for dodging Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and overdressed girls teetering on 5 inch stiletto heels, you too can enjoy homemade ice cream in Yorkville.\n\nThe ice cream was soft and creamy.\nThey ran out of cheesecake flavored ice cream which saddened me.\nI felt really rushed which I don't like but the place was packed.\nOverall, it's a fun place to grab a scoop.
