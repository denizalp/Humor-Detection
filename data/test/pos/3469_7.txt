I love Las Vegas and everyone thinks all there is, is casinos and clubs. That's true but there is so much more! \nI drove out the city to enjoy red rock, mount charleston, Zion national park, Hoover dam, etc.\n\nRed rock was great but not recommendable in the summer. Definitely bring tons of water with you.\nMount Charleston I liked better than red rock.\n\nDownload the free AllTrails app to find out about trails (that's for everywhere FYI)
