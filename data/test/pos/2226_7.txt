SMART is initially very professional and technologically advanced, or so it seems.  Once you're in your home and try to have any maintenance completed, they completely fall short!  In hindsight, I wish I had gotten a better management company.  There are certainly worse, but definitely many more that are a lot better.\n\nForget it if you need service to your home.  Also, communication is lacking.  I'd go elsewhere, if you can at all help it.
