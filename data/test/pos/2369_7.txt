* Update - I gave it another chance.  Service is still a bit slow near the end of your meal but overall,  it was much, much better.  Keep making sure that Tuna stays fresh and I may keep coming back. \n\n(Previous post, now updated ) - Like one poster said,  unfortunately this restaurant has suffered in the last couple of years.
