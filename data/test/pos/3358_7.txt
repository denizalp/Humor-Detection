Is there an option for \"0 Stars!!\" The name alone is a joke, really? Ninja City? This place is overly priced, you can get a REAL Bahn Mi in Chinatown for $3.........the staff doesn't even look like they're happy to be there. The food is sloppy and nothing on the menu is really asian flavored. Disappointed in how you represent Vietnamese food in Cleveland
