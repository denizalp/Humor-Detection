This location of Crema Coffee is one of those that I almost walked by without even it exist. \n\nSuch a small storefront. Great to come on a nice day because sipping coffee at one of those tables on Bloor Street watching the world buzzing by is an experience in itself. \n\nCappuccino? How was it? I don't remember much, all I remembered were the cars, the smoke, the annoying guitar player that would not leave me alone!\n\nFree WIFI just log in at FRESH's open network!
