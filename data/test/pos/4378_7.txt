TEMPE, AZ: Came in today for some Culinary Dropout fare and was impressed!  The room is busy, the waitstaff was knowledgeable, the food was good.  They have a game area in the back and bring in live music as well.\n\nWe tried the Pretzels (4 stars), like big, salty, bready, soft doughnut holes.  The dipping cheese fondue was excellent.\n\nAlso enjoyed the charcuterie plate (4.5 stars); had the prosciutto, goat cheese, and fig bar.  It was delicious as well.  Great place, excited to return and try more!
