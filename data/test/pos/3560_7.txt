Awesome place near old town to grab breakfast - even on the weekends they are FAST - get bacon in your mouth in less than five minutes... 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, and toast will set you back about $7... \n\n...or you could choose someplace super trendy and wait an hour in line with the other hungover idiots.
