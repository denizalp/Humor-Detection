Embarrassed for this new establishment...we were..and are all hoping to be a big success.  Tonight there was not enough help, inattentive bartenders, slow iPads, no one tending the wine selections and the list goes on.  Best part is the serene courtyard that will manifest itself many times over. Good luck.
