Love that I don't have to travel to Lake Geneva for a Kilwin's treat. \n\nLive their Kilwin tracks and Mackinac Island fudge. They are generous with their ice cream scoops. I usually get the one scoop of half and half,  on a sugar cone in a dish. Trust me, you get a lot more for your money this way!\n\nTry their dipped Rice Krispy treats!
