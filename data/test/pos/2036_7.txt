It's been saidÂ that anyone who says money cannot buy happiness has clearly never spent their money on dessert and wine. My advice is to dress to the nines, and take your date to Dilworth Tasting Room. If you want to please your date, get the assorted cookies & candies ($6), and add the perfect complimentary wine flight for extra $9 per person, and share a great time!\n\nFor sophistication and class, go now. Thank me later.\n\nFour Yelps.
