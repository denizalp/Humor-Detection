What a disappointment. It's just your standard smarmy pawn shop. It's small and not anything like what is portrayed on the TV show! I wouldn't waste my time in Vegas to go there! Sad to stand in line to go in there. It's an hour of my life that I'll never get back. Most of the store is selling Rick's book and Tshirts for Chumley and tourist trinkets. The highlight seems to be taking your picture with a cut-out of Rick, Hoss and Chumley. Too sad.
