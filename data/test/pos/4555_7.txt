Terrible service. Nasty owners who basically were very rude from the beginning.  Never greeted me and proceeded to yell at me when I inadvertently thought something was a sample. They kicked me out of the store after I stood up for myself from the bad treatment.  I am reporting to the better business Bureau and bringing to newsroom at one the local stations. Disgusting treatment.
