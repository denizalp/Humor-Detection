For the longest time I couldn't decide if I like Jinya more than Monta, but yeah-- I personally think it's better because there are more options.  I know some say Monta has the best broth which I personally think Jinya and Monta are pretty close in that category, but my tie breaker is the fresh garlic and theeeeeee best takoyaki at Jinya.  Not only that the service is great every time I visit too! But going back to the food, the noodles are perfectly cooked. The loaded takoyakis are a mountain of flavor--Probably the best I've had in Vegas.
