Drove the long drive out here to realize that RH furniture is actually not very high quality and doesn't look nearly as nice when it's not in their fancy regular stores with the nice lighting. Most the stuff at outlet was really beat up and way too expensive for damaged furniture. When the furniture is damaged you can see the poor quality of the wood. Glad I've never spent money with this company.
