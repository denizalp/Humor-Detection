Nice place with many interesting animals.  The aquarium in particular has some unusual species.  It seems easier at this zoo to get close and personal with the animals.  There are some feedings you can take part in.  The zoo is frequently getting new additions.\n\nIt is a bit expensive for single day tickets as well as memberships.  Many things in the park, such as the skyride, and train ride cost extra.
