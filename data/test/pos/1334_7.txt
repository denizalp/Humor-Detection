We had a great experience with California Pools. They are  definitely the best Pool builder in town. They are very professional and told us that the job would take 8 weeks but they finished after 6. Danny was our contact person he was very helpful and easy to work with. If we had any issue of problem he would help us directly even if it was during the weekend or late. \nIf you want quality build your pool with California Pools. \/Yasemin & Badou
