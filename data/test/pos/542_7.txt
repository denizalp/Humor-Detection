Just another Chinese Buffet, with all the same standard items as most.  The reason for 4 stars?  I loved the fried shrimp they had for lunch, the excellent egg foo yung and what seemed like homemade chocolate chip cookies on the dessert bar.  The ceviche on the salad bar was fresh and very tasty, I could have made a meal out of that alone!\n\nBetter than 3 stars, maybe not quite a 4, but to offset the other bad reviews I'm bumping them up one star ;)
