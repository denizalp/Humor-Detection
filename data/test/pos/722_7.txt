Weather it's Ned's or Steve's you can't go wrong ordering a Krazy Sub.  I've been coming to Ned's at this location for nearly 15 years, usually a couple times a week when I was in High School.  It's nice to know years later when I'm back in the neighborhood I can still enjoy those same flavors, it still taste great.  I think it has to do with that homemade bread, it's the perfect consistency and really makes the sandwich complete.  Lunch special is $7.50 which includes a 12\" sub, chips and a drink.
