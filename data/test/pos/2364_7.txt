I switched to this hospital after receiving horrible service from MD Anderson in Gilbert. I absolutely LOVE my new physician Dr. Northfelt. Wait times are always minimal here even when I am late for an appointment. I travel over an hour to get to the Scottsdale facility every month for my medical treatments (cancer) and it is totally worth it. I feel that my opinion matters in regards to my medical issues and the staff is always friendly, never pushy. Bottom line, I am very happy with this hospital.
