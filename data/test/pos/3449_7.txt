On 10\/6 I discovered two packages of Oscar Meyer Selects hot dogs in the luncheon case that had expired more than a MONTH previously.  The expiration date on both was 9\/4, and one of the packages was visibly turning green.  I turned them in to a clerk who at least had the sense to look embarrassed and immediately called the meat department.\nThe only thing saving this store from a 1-star review was the bottles of Smirnoff on sale for $7.49.
