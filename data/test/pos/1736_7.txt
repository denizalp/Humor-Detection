Thank God I moved out of the area because if I had to pass this every damn day I would be obese. RTS provides a comfortable place to order up whatever the heart desires.  It prepared quickly and I have not yet had an issue where I found something any less the satisfactory. Extremely affordable it fair reminds me of my So Cal days chowing down in parking lot after a night out.  I recommend if it's breakfast time to try one of their breakfast burritos......hearty and delicious.
