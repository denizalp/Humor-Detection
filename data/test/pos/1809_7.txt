Zero stars please!!!!\n\nSimply put the restaurant is a perfect place for racist and sexist men!!! If you are a person of color or a female, think twice before going to this restaurant. If you happen to have both traits... good luck!\nWe felt extremely unwelcome the moment we set foot in the restaurant, rudely treated by the waiter and later accused of lying!!!!! \nThe food was alright but not good enough for the price. However, what was unbearable was the attitude the manager and waiters had towards us their customers. \nWould I ever go there again? Hell No!!!
