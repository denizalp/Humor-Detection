Staff is great. Everyone knows what to do and when to do it. \n\nI had the corned beef on a hoagie roll toasted with Swiss and 1000 dressing. The meat was shaved like a porn star and had good flavor. The roll was fresh and tasty but not toasted enough. The Swiss was plentiful and not melted at all. \n\nOverall the sandwich was a 3.85. \n\nNothing screams 5 stars yet.
