I've shopped here for years and the selection has, over time, remained pretty good.\n\n I buy stuff here for $17 that isn't available new in Phoenix and that I would have to pay $90 for online. \n\nUsually, that makes it worth dealing with the legions of 20' something indie whoreskanks who frequent the place. \n\nI would say about 2\/3rd's of the staff are friendly and helpful and the other 3rd suffer from \"I think I have a cooler job than I do\" syndrome. \n\nOverall, not a bad place.
