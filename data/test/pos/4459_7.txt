pork, beef or veggies\nsimultaneously wet\nand crunchy chip joy\n\nFor a fantastic sandwich in the O.C., this is as good as it can get.  Nothing processed here.  All of the meat products are oven roasted in house, the bread is delicious and perfect for soaking up the au jus.  I have had the turkey, and most recently the beef philly.  There is a vegetarian sandwich as well. Personally, I can't eat one sandwich in a single sitting, therefore, I get to enjoy it twice.  \nI like that.  \nA lot.\n\nCarry on...
