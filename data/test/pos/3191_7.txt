Ill never forget the day I went into the bathroom and saw 3 cockroaches.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I love masa! The sushi is absolutely amazing... The salad and soup... Great!\n\nThey told me they put pineapple in the dressing! You can actually buy it in bottles.\n\nPlus the dessert at the end is really cute.\n\nHowever none of this really matters...\nIt's not easy to eat after a near death experience with cockroaches.
