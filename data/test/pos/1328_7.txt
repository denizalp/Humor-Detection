Saturday night, around 12:00am-ish. A friend of mine is starving. The place is open but their kitchen is closed. \n\nBooooo on you, BnB. You should really change that. People need food when they're drinking and some of us would like more options in the DTW than just Frank n Tony's. Respectable adults don't go in there late night for food. We would come to BnB, though! \n\nSigh.
