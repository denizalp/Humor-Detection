I really like this place.  There's something comforting about Cafe 100% and reminds me of some of the HK cafes that we have back in Vancouver.\n\nGreat decor, open space and fast service and not surprisingly, it is also owned by the same people who operate Calgary Court, Sun's BBQ, Forbidden City etc.\n\nMy friend ordered the Smoked Salmon and Oyster Rice Pizza.  We first had this during YYC Pizza Week (thank you Dale E. for the gift card) and it was unique, but pretty tasty. \n\nGreat addition to the food scene here in Calgary.
