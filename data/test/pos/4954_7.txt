WAY TOO LOUD.... I SAID... WAY TO LOUD. Plus the sammiches are not what they used to be. Sure they cleaned up the restaurant, looks less divey but the food is what took a dive. I remember having a sammich there and wanting to stuff my face with 3 more... Now it's mostly condiments and less target-hitting. When I want a sausage sammich, I want the sausage pipping hot and preferably juicy instead of slightly warm and drier than a desert. Ain't what it used to be.
