Stopped in here and did a complete weekly shop. I found just about everything here that was on the shopping list and all of it in great shape. I think Food Lion is definitely less expensive than the competition and I can see returning here for next week's shop, too.\n\nGrocery aisles well stocked. Produce section clean and in good condition. Deli items already sliced and ready to go. Meat bunkers tidy and I found a good deal on pork chops.
