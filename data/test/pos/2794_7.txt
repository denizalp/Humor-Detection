It's been a long time since I've been here, but Emerald altered my wedding dress...twice.  She was lovely and really professional and accommodating.  She did a wonderful job, and also does regular alterations.  She hemmed some pants for my hubby.\n\nShe really helped me when I was in a pinch, I would come back.
