NO WIFI???? A new restaurant??? Seriously?!\n\nPoor\/slow service. Bartender\/server cares more about taking take-out orders than serving people trying to order in the bar.\n\nVery small bar.\n\nShelf highlighting wine and bottled beers that's above the bar is no lit up at all - super dark. Can't see it.
