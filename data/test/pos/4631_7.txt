Arnold Schwarzenegger sized chickens make for pumped up wings!  Monster wings that were done very well.\n\nA relaxed non pretentious spot, that's kinda a no super frills sports bar but in a good way.  There's no mega tv wall or super goal light sirens or fireworks or \"restaurant stadium\".  It's a room, lots of tvs, and smaller tvs on each banquette.   Normal human beings for servers.   Done.\n\nNot sure why you'd go anywhere else for wings if you're nearby.
