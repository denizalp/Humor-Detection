when other establishments (which will remain nameless) closed early, my charlotte tour-guides turned to Cabo for dinner.\n\nThe 4 of us all got different selections, and everything was pretty damn good. the tacos were well portioned, and the price was right.\n\ni even had a bowl of black-bean soup and didn't poop myself on the way home, so it was a win-win situation all around!
