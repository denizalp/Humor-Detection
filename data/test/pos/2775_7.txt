Think back to the old sitcom called Alice where a struggling single mom is raising her son with an overbearing cook named Mel...got that picture - good keep it since this place looks and feels like Mel's Diner. The burgers are frozen and quite bland...my expectation of a diner was good homemade food, not packaged and slapped on a grill.\n\nNice staff...
