There are three things I only buy from Tokyo Discount: car air freshener, snacks and origami paper.\n\nThey have everything. Seriously. But everything (or majority) is obviously not in English. So I usually ask the workers what it is. I have no shame of doing that. Ha.\n\nOther than that. Good place to get your Asian fix on for a decent price.
