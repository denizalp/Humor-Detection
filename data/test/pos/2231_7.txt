in all honesty, this place isn't as horrible as people make it out to be. i had to try it after seeing Gordon Ramsey rip it to shreds, and I feel like compared to Ramsey's eatery in Vegas, this place is on par, dollar for dollar. Whether the owners are quality people is moot, sure, but the food is passable, even good. i'd say don't knock it til you try it. ramsey is in the television ratings business, first and foremost. Don't forget that.
