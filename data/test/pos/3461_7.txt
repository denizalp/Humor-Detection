This is a bit dated because I went back in August, around 8pm, after a long workday and I was starving.  I'm not sure what to even write here that hasn't already been said in previous reviews. I ordered Carne Asada tacos, and they were unflavorful, with minimal carne asada and not worth the $8.95.\n\nI will say that happy hour looks decent for cheap drinks. You could get pretty buzzed here on $1 margaritas from 3-6pm.
