$300 for a table?  For only the two of us?  No, thanks.  Especially since I'm not a \"club\" person and would only be there to catch the burlesque show.  I hear the show is brief (2 dancers do 2 songs each), so we will brave the sweaty jam-packed crowd.  I will update when we actually experience the magic of the Forty Deuce.  \n\nTo the coordinator's credit, she offered me a spot on the guest list when I balked at the bottle service pricing.  Thanks, Nikki!
