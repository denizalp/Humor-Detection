Please fire whoever your dispatch is on Tuesday mornings. Cee U Next Tuesday that one. \n\nAlso, don't tell people the dispatch is 15 minutes away 3 times. You're just going to make people more angry. Has I known the dispatch was going to take 2 1\/2 hours, I could have taken a nap. Gone to the gym. Knit a quilt. Who knows. \n\nNext time I need emergency towing from my insurance company, I'll beg them to use anyone but you. Kisses.
