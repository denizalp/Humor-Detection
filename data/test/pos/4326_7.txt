Having relatives with a time share at the Grand Hiltons, you're bound to end up having a meal at a Paradise Cafe.\nThis one being at the Convention Center Hilton, they remind me of a tropical style Coco's. \nGot myself a breakfast plate that came with toast, two eggs, hash browns and bacon. Filling and decent, although the eggs were pretty over cooked. \nGot overcharged on my bill, so double check it!!!
