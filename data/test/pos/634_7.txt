Excellent service, friendly staff and fantastic pricing. Very accommodating. On a busy Friday afternoon they worked us in for two pedicures. Nice selection of colors for enamel and very bright and clean environment. My technician was Blossom, and she did a stellar job. The massage chairs are so relaxing and the services come with a glass of wine! The prices make it easy to go more often. Will definitely return with more friends!
