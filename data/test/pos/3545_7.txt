New new new Taco Bell on South Tryon a little past the intersection with Steele Creek. It's a stand-alone store with the usual new features inside including soda fountain and \"modern\" menu. Folks seemed nice enough and my 7-layer burrito was wrapped as it should be. The sauce and napkin area was stocked and clean. No complaints, this TB is A-OK.
