Well... The driver just knocked on my door and stood outside till I answered at 11:30 pm on a Sunday night. They scared the shit out of my roommate (I thought it was funny). \n\nThat basically sums up their customer service. Meat portions inconsistent, almost no veggies unless it's carrots in which they are happy to spread the wealth then. Typically two pieces of broccoli. \n\nI know Nevada is dead last in education again. So I shouldn't be surprised they can't measure 3 ounces.
