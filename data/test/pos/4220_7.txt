This is a joke to pay that much for pastries that are not even baked here. \n\nAnd fresh ?\nMy \"tress√© au chocolat\" clearly wasn't freshly baked. \n\nHad a Almond chocolate bread and Almond croissant with that. I just dipped them in my coffee to get a bit of flavour. It was too moist and boring. \n\nAnd I paid 8$ something for this. \n\nThanks but no thanks.
