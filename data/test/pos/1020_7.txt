London Goods - Bought my buddy Johnny Walker Blue, for his birthday, the heavyweight championship belt of beef jerky from here! Was the size of a tire tread. Truly off the chain. All for $6.99! Of course, at his birthday gathering, the cured pelt of over sized meat was a resounding hit! Neanderthal all the way. Way to go London Drugs!
