Takeout food options in the area are not hard to come by, and with plenty of options, it's nice to know that these options are actually good as well.\n\nI have been a couple of times and the food is solid. The lumpia has been great and the pork is tasty as well. The menu doesn't have too much variety but the what they do offer is delicious.
