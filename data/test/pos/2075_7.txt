If you time it perfectly, you might catch them open. :) The food was very good, but the service made me nervous the first few times I went (before the tv incident) because the server (owner) seemed very impatient. I always like to ask them what their favorite dish is, and he just blurted out \"Just tell me what you like!\" The last time I went (after the show), he seemed to try to be nicer. Again, the food is good
