Used to love this place but they're ridiculous now! A shake is $5+$3 extra for blueberry even tho blueberries are cheap as 70 cents a pint right now! Then if you see the pic of the grilled cheese that isn't grilled (what a joke) for $10 - also no kids menu after 10pm?! Overpriced & not very good quality \/ This place went WAY down - nvr again
