Went here w\/family last year (b4 \"Nightmares\"). Food was intolerable. Dessert was decent enough. Didn't leave tip, because family members informed me about owners taking the tips.  So, to clarify to person from Santa Clara (me=born & raised in CA),\nin CA IT IS ILLEGAL TO TAKE STAFF TIPS-BUT NOT IN AZ (of course). The hourly wage in a lot of \"red\" states is very low. Barely above Federal minimum. Unlike CA.
