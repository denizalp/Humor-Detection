First appt with Olga for microdermabrasion (1 of 3) bought with a Groupon ~ seems good she recommended a mast cuz my skin is dehydrated, so bought that as I do get told this by EVERY esthetician I have ever seen.\n    She seems very knowledgeable has a pleasant manor does talk quiet fast tho. Her english is good so there's no miscommunication. \n    Back in 28 days for 2nd treatment, only 4 stars as I want to see what the final verdict will be~
