This may be the coolest market place Arizona has ever seen. This Whole Foods is truly a market. Inside this store is contained an organic grocer, a deli, BBQ food restaurant, wine & beer bar, cheese shoppe, Asian\/sushi bar &, WAIT FOR IT........The best\/largest Craft BEER selection I have ever seen outside of Tops Liquor Store. Why not 5 Stars? It's a bit pricey!!! Worth it beyond a doubt when I can afford it!
