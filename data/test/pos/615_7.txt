Always a line.  Employees go from \"I could give a damn\" to Postal Robo-Cop dude who is over the top by-the-book.  The passport lady is never on time so don't even bother.  Try to go on off-peak times to avoid all old people who wait 20 minutes to mail one envelope and the Lakewood buttrockers sending bootleg Artic Monkeys shirts the sold on Ebay....
