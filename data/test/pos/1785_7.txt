I'm a falafel fiend, so finding out that a new Mediterranean joint has popped up on State made me do a happy dance. Okay, I had a happy one-person rave. \n\nI stopped by on a rainy Monday night and grabbed the falafel plate for a slick $5. The service was a tad slow, but I think they're still working out the kinks since they just opened supah recently. The falafel was just how it should be: crispy golden goodness on the outside, flavorful and soft on the inside. I'll be back!
