Compared to the more extensive shoe selections neighbouring these parts, Specchio is but a mere shoebox in size. That said, they have an excellent eye. Everything here is worth its weight in gold (nearly). It's the only other store in Canada that I know to carry these wonderfully strapped and multi-coloured Dries Van Noten shoes. Oh... I kind of feel like crying a bit.
