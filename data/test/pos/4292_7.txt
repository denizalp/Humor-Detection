As of today, best falafel joint in Montreal. Mind you, I admit to not having tried every falafel places in town, but I have tried many. Growing up with an Egyptian mother, I have a decent background on how they should taste. Average size place to sit and eat and the staff is very friendly and efficient. You can't really ask for more when it comes to a place that serves a quick meal, particularly for lunch. The place offers a few different flavors or falafels and tahini dressing\/sauce.
