Great service, and more importantly, great work!\n\nL&G did an amazing job removing the hail dents from the hood of our car, using PDR (paintless dent removal).  You'd never guess that the hood had ever been damaged.  They're artists!\n\nAnd the people (in particular Kevin Bagot) are great.  Courteous and professional.
