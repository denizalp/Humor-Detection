I posted a photo last month of a sharp, plastic shard I found in my sundae. I had swallowed a second piece just moments before, not realizing something was wrong until my throat was in pain. No one from Burger Rush has attempted to contact me and explain what the heck sharp plastic was doing in their food. I have not eaten there since and will be sure to continue to let people know about this horrifying and painful experience. Never again, burger rush. I miss Wendy's. I never had my throat cut by plastic shards in my frosty.
