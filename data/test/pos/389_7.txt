A great place to do family style. They serve huge portions. We had calamari, rigatoni, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parm. My favorite were the calamari and chicken parm. The meatballs were delicious as well. The rigatoni was nothing special. Overall good service and the only complaint I had was the menu may be on the walls but the text is too small. And the prices aren't listed as well.
