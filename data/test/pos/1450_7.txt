NOT FOR KIDS. Food is amazing and yummy. But they neglected to tell us they put hot chiles in the beans. We ordered bean burritos for my 5 and 6 year olds. The poor kiddos were screaming!  My little boy was in so much pain, he soiled his pants, and his lips swelled firey red. It was a bad end to a great day. \n\nGreat food, spicy, and not for children.
