Excellent quality meat served with wide variety. The meats had very little fat on them so you could tell the meat was prepared well. The various meats were excellent like the pork belly garlic, the premium pork belly, and would highly recommend the red wine pork belly. Ozzy was our server and was on point. They were courteous and was excellent in service and would love to have him again.
