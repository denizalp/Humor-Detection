A recent trip with my husband to Yasu  last Saturday night began with being ignored, followed by more ignoring, and ended with being ignored as we left. I was not even wearing my cloak of invisibility.\n\nWe waited at the hostess stand for five minutes before being greeted (even though the hostess made several trips to the podium without any acknowledgement) and were then directed to the bar where we sat another five minutes without being greeted or offered a beverage. We did however, stare at the bartender while he ate something and ignored us.\n\nWe went to Roka Akor.
