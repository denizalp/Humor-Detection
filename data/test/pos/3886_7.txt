I really wanted to like this place! Being from NYC I have had this type of food many many times and was never disappointed.  I live and work nearby so I was excited to try this place as soon as it opened. I ordered a side of falafel and a combo platter.  The falafel was crispy but so bland and dry.  The combo platter was ok but nothing to write home to NY about. The staff was very nice and I assume that the restaurant will do well since they are close to ASU and open late.
