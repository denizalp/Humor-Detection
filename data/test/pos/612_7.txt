Raysco cleaned the carpet and tile in my house 2 days before open house. They made a large 10 inch hole \/break on the floor tile, left without saying anything, and deny they broke it. House was completely empty\/vacant except for the realtor who discovered it immediately after Raysco left! Don't trust these guys!
