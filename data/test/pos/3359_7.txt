Ahhh Sambalatte where do I begin...\n\nThis place is great if you enjoy a cliche vegas place trying too hard to be something it is not, trendy\/local\/hip... Its completely kitsch\n\nTheir subpar coffee is prepared by uneducated (coffee-wise) and rude employees their latte art is cool but it adds to the already long wait to get some coffee. \n #gag
