I've never stayed at the Rio but I've gambled in the casino many times and each time I'm here I wonder why?\n\nThis place is pretty rundown and the fact that I have to leave the strip to get here makes me question myself even more. \n\nThere are plenty of other cleaner casinos. Don't go here. I wouldn't go back here again until I know it has gotten a makeover and an exhaust put in because it reeks of smoke.
