brought my girls here to celebrate a bachelorette--sooo much fun. the instructor was fabulous--she did a great job of teaching us burlesque and pole moves :) it's a great way to let loose, laugh and celebrate womanhood and getting your sexy on!\n\ntips: if you check in with facebook you can purchase boas for $5 without having to buy the whole package! bring cameras, you can take as many pics as you want (this can be a good or BAD thing, if you know what I mean).
