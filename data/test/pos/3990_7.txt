In A Nutshell:\n\n-I barely write a review about a grocery store, but Lee Lee is impressive.\n-This location is in Peoria, they also have locations in Chandler and Tucson.\n-Lee Lee has EVERYTHING you need to make ANY Asian cuisine at home.\n-The produce is dirt cheap, the meat fresh and the aisles fully stocked.\n-They even have a Eastern European aisle, which the Hungarian sausage tasted very good.\n\nOverall, Lee Lee is a plus if you visit Peoria or consider moving to the area.  They got it all!
