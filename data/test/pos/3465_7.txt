The most satisfying soul food, cooked and served by some of the most gracious, warmest people around these parts.  \n\nThis is the nostalgic 'back home' that we all secretly long to go to, even if it's just a dinky little soul food restaurant tucked into a strip mall in Ahwatukee.\n\nFried chicken, catfish, BBQ, buttered corn, collard greens, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, corn bread, candied sweet potatoes, Kool-Aid, lemonaid...all this deliciousness awaits you here.
