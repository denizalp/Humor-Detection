I'm not sure why people keep telling me this place is the best. I guess we came on a weekday so the variety isn't as good as the weekend. The service was good and the food quality was definitely better than other Vegas buffets but I wasn't really sure if it was a 5-star worthy. I liked the dessert selection but I didn't love it. I liked the different stations they had but nothing I ate really stood out.\n\nMaybe I'll come back next time on a weekend?
