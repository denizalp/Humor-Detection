I love this store, they have all the birds one could ask for- the baby cockatiels are so adorable and precious- the staff is very careful and loving with all animals.\n\nlove the manager debbie- she is so helpful and kind. I already bought two baby cockatiels, got a third yesterday and plan on doing more business.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
