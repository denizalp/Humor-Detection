Wanted to check this place out to see if the crazy was really crazy, got there at 6:30, hours say they are open till 9, but guess they weren't in the mood to stay open, cuz the owner said they were closing when we walked in...I guess the food really does suck cuz every restaurant around them was super busy...sad...
