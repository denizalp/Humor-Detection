Can I get some sandwich with my salt please??   Sorry, but the sodium content of my sandwich probably shot my blood pressure through the roof.   But thanks for making the sandwich super meaty and using a soft hero bread vessel to store it on (no sarcasm even though it felt like it).  I just finished eating my 6 inch sandwich and my belly is satisfied.  So those keeping score at home, that's 1 for a filling tender meat sandwich but also 1 for hypertension.  Will I be back....   eh.   I'd say like 75% not.
