If you've had Sbarro pizza in your mall food court, then you will be familiar with the pizza here at Sbarro in the airport. It's high crust, low sauce, reasonable toppings. And it's not cheap at around $5 for a plain cheese slice.\n\nThe pizza has the advantage of being ready to go almost immediately and it is completely portable. Which is great for an airport.\n\nThey have fountain and bottled drinks to go as well.
