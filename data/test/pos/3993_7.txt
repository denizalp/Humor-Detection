Picked up a friend at the airport.  The signs were confusing and downright contradictory in some cases, and we got routed to the international terminal instead of the domestic one.  Im sure my experience on the inside of the airport will be better next time, but they need to fix the signs so Im not driving around like a idiot.  Also, Im an idiot.
