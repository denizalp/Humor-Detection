We were sorely disappointed with our meal at Rustler's Rooste, especially considering we had a less than delightful experience the last time we were here.  The food is not freshly prepared. The bread was hard as a rock!  The kids hamburgers were hard as a rock!  For the price you'd think the food would at least be decent.  Nope.  The quality has really gone down and as a result we won't be back any time soon.
