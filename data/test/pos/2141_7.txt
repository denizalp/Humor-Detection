Everything about this place makes my skin crawl. That seems weird given it's such a pretty restaurant... That just goes to show how people and food effect everything. I would rather eat at a nasty sticky Waffle House! Seriously.. I have never been around such horrible people in my entire life. The food is just awful and you better not complain about it. Makes my heart hurt so much and I feel such pitty for those who feel ugliness is necessary.. Sad... Sad... STAY AWAY! Not worth putting yourself through that kind of experience..
