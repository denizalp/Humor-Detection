Authentic soul food with a dude that will sell you bootleg DVDs out front. \n\nI got a shoulder sandwich, served on white bread and it was on point. Collard greens, probably very little nutritional value but great flavor. \n\nI didn't buy any DVDs but available titles include Fast & Furious 7, 50 Shades of Gray, and Avengers.
