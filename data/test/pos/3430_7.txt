The very best Indian lunch buffet in town!!  I literally enjoy every hot dish they offer and I'm glad they're still doing brisk business.  Stand outs for me include the korma, saag paneer, chicken tandoori and the chana masala.  How do people operate after stuffing their faces here for lunch?  I only go on my days off since I'm in a coma for at least a couple of hours after.
