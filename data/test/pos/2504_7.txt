Don't go here. They charge you $$$ for ...what? We went here to get engine check. Whatever they did to fix the engine, it probably shouldn't cost over $500. Then, they change the oil and tire and charge $700. Then end price that we had to pay was $2000. I don't even know what the $800 charge was used for. If you brought some kind of deal that gives you discount with the benz dealership, DON'T TELL them till after they give you the bill or else they will jack up the price for nonsense I don't even know.
