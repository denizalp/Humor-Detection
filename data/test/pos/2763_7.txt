CLEARLY any of the good reviews for this restaurant are written by the crazy owners. I honestly ate here before seeing Kitchen Nightmares and then after seeing it, it made complete sense.  It was awful, seriously the worst food I've eaten and it took forever and we were kind of in a hurry. Any other normal restaurant could have served us in sufficient time and we would have had time to spare. After seeing Kitchen Nightmares,I can visualize Amy sitting at get computer for hours and days writing BS good reviews.
