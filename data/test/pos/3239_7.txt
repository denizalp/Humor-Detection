Yay!  Came here this evening for a Yelp Event.  Super fun.  Met some great ladies, and got a super cute mani\/pedi.  I learned a couple of things - shellac is a special type of polish and OPI makes some so you can get your fave colours if you want.\n\nIt's super clean, and they have nice decor, feels modern and for $35 for a mani\/pedi - it's pretty good value.  I'm off to a good start b\/c I'm currently chip-free, but will update later this week, my usually mani's last 10 days...so here's hoping!
