Such a cute little cafe!\n\nThe patio is dog friendly with lots of shade. I like how the tables aren't close together so you can relax and enjoy your food. \n\nI ordered the breakfast sandwich. Sadly my bagel was burned. Why would you ever serve someone burned food??? That's a chef that just doesn't care.
