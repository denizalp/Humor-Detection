Nice location near my hotel. Was able to sit outside because the weather was beautiful, so that was nice. The food selection was smaller than I had hoped, so I was forced to order something I normally don't get. The drinks were brought out rather quickly, but they just weren't very strong. Probably would give this place another chance, especially with nice weather.
