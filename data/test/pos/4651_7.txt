It's just your average pub, albeit with an above average beer selection. \n\nThe interior is cozy and warm. There are some sports on, but with no sound. There's plenty of seating, and it's great for large groups. The waitstaff are nice, and the kitchen is quick. \n\nThe waffle fries are *amazing* but the fried fish, pizza, and probably other items are just OK. I would never, ever go out of my way to come here for anything but pints with my friends. But if you're dragged in, it's not the end of the world.
