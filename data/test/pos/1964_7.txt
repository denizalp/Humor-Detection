Its not a big deal, its just fifty cents to check in.. but when we showed her my phone. She said we had to print it out. Whattt? Really? Smh. Anyways. Then I ask for extra hot sauce and lemon. She points at the bag and said \" in there\". Literally fighting me. It was just bad. Anddddd she forgot napkins.\n\nEdit*\nCame home and my enchiladas was cold. The cheese wasn't even melted.  :( ugh. im so mad.
