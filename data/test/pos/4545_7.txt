It's a chain, but a damn friendly one, filled with soup and delicious sandwiches, topped off by hot coffee and free wi-fi.  Great spot.\n\nHowever, just a word of warning.  If you're there to take a breather and collect yourself, avoid move-in week.  Stressed soccer moms with their soon to be inebriated freshmen children do not help keep one's sanity in the newly packed environment.\n\nThat said, great job, Panera for giving us grad students free wifi and great food.  Excellent.
