Gotta love a place that has 2 happy hours... even if their happy hour menu is a bit limited.  I bet this would be a great place to drink. Unfortunately, I was pregnant when I discovered it and now, I have a newborn so I'm still not drinking. haha\n\nThat said, the sushi and udon are pretty tasty and I love that they're open late-night.  Everyone that I've taken has liked it and I think it would be a good date night spot, as well.  \n\nSee ya there!
