MAMA freaking MIA, where the hell are Mario and Luigi? Seriously, this place is wonderful. Came here for the #OrdertheYelp and the Pizz-eh was fabulous. Essentially a Great Canadian Pizza with EXTRA BACON (yes bacon), and this thai-ish sauce that was the perfect combination for this pizza. Had a lot of Mushrooms, but other than that, the crust was not crunchy (that's good) and the dough was fresh. Staff was incredibly friendly and always checked-up on us throughout the meal.\n\nOverall a quality pizza place in Vaughan, probbly the best one.
