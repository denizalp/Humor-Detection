What to try?!?\n\nTheir strawberry Japanese short cake. \n\nThis cake comes with the right softness and sweetness. When made fresh, the fresh cream tastes light and airy. \n\nIf you don't like sweet cakes, you'll find this cake not that bad because it is not that sweet and doesn't have a lot of different flavors going on. The shortcake comes with three layers of shortcake intertwined with fresh cream and strawberries. \n\nLast tip!?\n\nIf you happen to want more, try out their homemade yogurts or the meringue cakes because they make everything daily and it tastes just as good.
