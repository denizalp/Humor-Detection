I absolutely LOVE this place for brunch in Leslieville. It's so incredibly tasty it almost warrants writing this post in all uppercase. I usually get the baked French Toast, which is made on day old bread that's fruity, cinnamon-y bread that's soaked with flavour.\n\nNOTE: they do not take debit or credit. It's cash only. And the nearest reputable bank machine is quite far away so make sure you bring cash with you!!
