I used to really like the Vig, and I still do, to an extent. The problem is that it's devolved into a Scottsdale douche bar, aka sausagefest now. Maybe it's always been this way and I just picked up on it the last time. \n\nI really dig the patio and they have William Reed spin there on Saturdays. It works for 2.5 stars, rounded down for dudes. \n\nThey should rename it to \"The Twig\" and be done with it.
