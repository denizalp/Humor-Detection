Avoid this dealership at all costs!  Their salesman are patronizing, condescending, and untrustworthy.  I was told how quickly they would run out of a particular car and they only got \"ten per year\".  They said I could buy a new car and then pay $1,000 to have it reupholstered.  I called the Manager to complain and left three messages but he never returned any of my calls.  I had to call VW North America to get his attention.
