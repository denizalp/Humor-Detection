Long ago, Salvation Army used to be the place to go when you thought of \"thrift stores\". Sadly, this place is WAY overpriced for being a thrift store. I have chatted with other random people who thought the same thing about this one - way too expensive!  :(\n\nI don't know who is pricing this stuff, but they are out of their mind, probably watching too much \"Storage\/Auction Wars\" or \"Pawn Stars\" thinking that everything is worth a ton of money.\n\nGoodwill is just up the street on Grand and has better prices.
