I'm one picky ass snobby eater.  So, it warms me when I proclaim the following:  This place, along with Shalimar in San Francisco are the two best Indo-Pak Restaurants in the USA.  Dont waste your time with the plethora of mediocre Indian restaurants found all over the country.  \nSpartans! Ready your dinner and eat hearty... For tonight, we dine in heaven!
