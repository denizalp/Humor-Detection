Dead squirrel museum.  Yeah, it needs another five star review.\n\nPart of the charm of our experience was having only the address to guide us and seeing rooms and rooms full of absurdity light up before us.  Reading the other two reviews is a bit of a spoiler, like Brad Pitt and Edward Norton being the same person.\n\nBut, I mean, even if you know that going in, it's still five stars, right?
