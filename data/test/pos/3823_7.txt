Except for the Albanian sausage, was very unimpressed by the brunch here.\n\nAlbanian sausage and eggs: pretty good, based on the sausage and eggs\nEggs Florentine: over cooked eggs, broken hollandaise, not super pleasant\nBlack cherry crepe: overly crisp and too sweet, both in terms of the preserved cherries and the cream inside\nTurkish coffee: mostly grounds, but came with a piece of Turkish delight\n\nAmbiance and service were also mediocre at best. Unfortunately, not with the visit.
