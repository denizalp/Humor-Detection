Chinese Traditional Bun is literally a dirty little secret. It's filthy. It's small. It's hidden in a basement in Chinatown. \n\nThey pull their own dan dan noodles and have an extraordinarily long menu of soups, noodles, dumplings and buns. The staff doesn't speak much English, so if you have questions about one of their dishes and don't rock Cantonese, you're screwed. Write your number on the piece of printer paper and hope like hell. \n\nPEPPER TAKES PAUSE: It's really dirty in here. My kitchen has a better chance of getting a passing health code grade.
