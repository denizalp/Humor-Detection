Take your pick: \n(Sunday evening, party of 7)\n-The absentee, surly waiter\n-The water dripping from the A\/C ducts into our heads\n-The overly greasy pizza\n-The ravioli literally sitting in oil\n-The half-hearted oil & vinegar dipping mixture on the table\n-The high prices\n-The Slow service, despite being one of only five parties dining\n-The loud music that desperately screamed 'we're a cool restaurant...we promise!'
