I'm a regular foodie of Japanese food.  Definitely have had my experience with a wide variety of Japanese cuisine from Fast food to fine dining.  This restaurant has mediocre food and service.  Small variety of fish selections and skimped on fish quality  (low grade and ultra thin slices ) and service.  The service is not friendly enough nor thoughtful or helpful enough to feel like a neighborhood place.
