OMG SO MUCH FUN!  AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN!  Staff were super nice, rules were clearly posted. They need a more efficient manner of checking in for your zipline as the wait in line took forever!  Played the slots while we waited to be called.  Once we made it to the top, everything went pretty fast.  Stellar experience!
