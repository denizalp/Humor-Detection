Beautifully decorated and upscale looking.  I have been here twice, the first time it was quite busy, close to when it first opened.  Second time not busy at all.  First time it was okay.  Second time because there wasn't much customers, the food sat out for awhile so it wasn't very appetizing. \nI liked the fresh raw oysters, scallops and snails.
