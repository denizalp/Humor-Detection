If you are staying at Mandalay Bay, this is a great coffee spot. It's expensive, as is everything at Mandalay, but not more than Starbucks. It's located right outside the elevators which is awesome and the line moves fast. Beans are organic and drip coffee is really good. It is $4 a pop for a 20 oz plus tax. Sugar in the raw and half and half to top it off.
