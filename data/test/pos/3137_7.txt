Jesus, why do I like this place now I don't want to! Kidding aside, I can't seem to stay away from this place and it's confusing. The taco meet is bland, and kind of a mixed bag on how much meat you get when you order tacos. However, I'm at this place like every other Taco Tuesday for carryout. It's the only quick alternative to Taco Bell. I can't stay away. Whatever you've done... well done?
