Great place for a charbroiled hot dog. They do not grill it until you order it. Staff was very friendly. They actually talked to you and even gave you a smile. Their milkshakes are sooooo good. I was in love. The hot dog was tasty too. You can get a full meal at Ted's. I enjoy the vintage pictures on the wall along with the 50's\/60's music. Fun place to eat and remember the times. \n\nVery clean restaurant plus there is always a line which means the food is good.
