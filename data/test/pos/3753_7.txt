When we arrived at Nevada's Finest Properties, we were relieved to see they had a roofed carport, as we had two box springs on top of our car, and it was raining. \n\nUnfortunately, upon getting out of the car, my partner was berated for almost (we had cleared it by several inches) hitting the top of the carport by a woman later identified as the owner.\n\nWith the stress of moving, the last thing I want to deal with is a senselessly rude, aggressive realtor.
