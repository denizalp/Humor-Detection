Its not just a show...its a life changing experience.  You walk out feeling positively alive!  Well, that and its great getting together with a bunch of random screaming women and treating the dancers like meat.  Liberating?  Sure...uh ok, I'll use that as my story.  I did it for the feminist inside of me.\n\nI agree its a little cheesy with the themed outfits and songs that they lip-sync to, but its a small price to pay for some good old fashion non-PC entertainment.  I think the 1\/3rd of a tux also brings some class and respect.  :P
