Hola\n\nI was here while traveling in Vegas and loved this place. The place was clean and what is important to me the servers were smiling and were very attentive. The salad I had taken was very delicious (I don`t remember its name :)). People around me were happy and were enjoying their evening, that was so nice. \nWill take friends next time.
