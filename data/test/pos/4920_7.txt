It's a movie theater. It's clean. No complaints except for stale popcorn.\nBut I guess I'm spoiled by Roadhouse Movie Grill. I'm not fond of paying for a drink and popcorn when I can get a full meal at the dine in movie theater for the same price. \n\nIts really not about the movie theater I guess but comparing better places with better food, with better prices. If I am not able to get tickets from Roadhouse and just HAVE to see it that day, then this place will do.
