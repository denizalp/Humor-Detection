Horrible experience with this company......website gives you insufficient information and for a package to reach from Mississauga to Toronto takes them an entire week. Customer service is useless and says because it is a residential delivery it is that long !!! Really !!! It is probably Walmart's fault too for hiring an unreliable company for their deliveries. Still waiting for my package :-(
