Stairs.\n\nS\n   t\n    a\n       i\n         r\n           s\n              .\n\nGoodness, metal flights of stairs with heels are not the business. That, combined with the lack of a place to sit, killed my feet for the night. The crowd is young, I would say that the general audience is in the 20s-early 30s range. I like the hip-hop room.\n\nPlace is le crowded, but for good reason. Views on the balcony and outside are beautiful.
