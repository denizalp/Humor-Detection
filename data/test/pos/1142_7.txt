Maybe I always go on a good day? The couple times I went here this past month had me in and out in less than 30mins. I was like wow! I had myself ready for like a 2-3 hour wait, so I was pretty surprised, it was way less than what I expected. \n\nI admit, some of the staff are snob and rude, I was lucky enough to had dealt with the friendly ones when I was there.
