Picked up 15 cupcakes to go. They were amazing! They close at 7pm and I dropped in at 6pm they still had a great selection of cupcakes.  \n\nWhen we finally at the 2 hours later they were delicious! They were moist and so tasty! I had butterscotch which was sooooo good! I also sampled bites other strawberry\/vanilla, peanut butter chocolate, pumpkin seasonal special, everything was phenomenal. The girls in the front were really friendly and they have a loyalty program.   If your in Northwest LV check this place out delicious cupcakes;)
