***************************** 997 *******************************\n\n          I'm not a fan of this place on WED night, supposedly a happening night. Good DJs, good sound system, good service, 3K on a WED night for our cabana, ouch! \n\n         The crowd wasn't no where near Marquee, XS, or Hakkasan, sad! \n\n         Don't even try to get in the pool, unless you want to get something else! You heard me!
