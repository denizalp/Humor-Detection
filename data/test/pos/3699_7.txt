Great place! Fresh coffee! Well staffed; makes a huge difference! We were seated immediately upon arriving; 8:30am shift. Loved the decor and the little store they have; you can shop while you wait to be seated. \n\nThe food was nothing special, but I love their normal size portions. Prices are affordable. Would come back.
