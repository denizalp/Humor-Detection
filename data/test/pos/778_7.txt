I see a lot of mixed reviews here on Yelp. This Westin Hotel must have renovated recently because I didn't have any bad experiences here. \n\nMy hotel room was beautiful and spacious. The view from the 15th floor was gorgeous too. The bathroom shower was fantastic. It was like showering in a waterfall. I would definitely stay at this Westin again.\n\nI thought the location of this hotel was also great. It was walking distance to many eateries and we even walked to the PNC baseball field from our hotel.
