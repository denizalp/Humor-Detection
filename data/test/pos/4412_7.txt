Sadly, Cheryl moved to the Queen East location. \n\nBut that's okay because I found THE ONE - Charlotte. Charlotte is amazing, the perfect person for a curly headed girl. She listened to what I wanted and delivered way more than I expected. No matter how I do my hair now it looks great. My curls are bouncy and free, I have a bit of a faux bangs in the front.\n\nI hate making small talk with stylists but Charlotte is a nerd's dream.\n\nIf I write anymore this review will become a love prose.
