This appointment, my first, was just to meet with a nurse in preparation (can't even bear to write that word!) for a dreaded colonoscopy.  The front desk was friendly, as was the nurse.  I find it a bit weird that I won't meet the doctor until the actual procedure, but that's the way they do it here.\n\nThe vibe was okay, and I didn't have to wait that long, so I'm giving it 4 stars.  I'll update after the follow-up that will take place after the procedure.
