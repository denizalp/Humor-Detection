You're a coin-op car wash and your bill changer is out of order?  Seriously? SERIOUSLY?!!!\n\nI have no basis of comparison within Toronto but this place is 4 minutes for $3.00 so good or bad deal, I'm not sure.  This is mostly a rip-off to me as I had to spend a minimum of $3 instead of the $1 I wanted to spend just to rinse my car off.  \n\nThis wash place just has the basic options: rinse, soap, wax, etc.  There's no spot-free rinse, tire shine, engine wash, or anything like that.\n\nBoo-urns!
