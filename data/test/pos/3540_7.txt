I come here about once a month since it's opening. This is by far the best experience I've had yet. I had Ozzy as a server and he was amazing. He was triple seated and still got our refills and orders in a timely manner. If he was swamped he didn't show it because his demeanor and attitude made it seem like we were the only table he had. This experience wouldn't of been this great if we had another server
