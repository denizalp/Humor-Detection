Review on the run...\n\nWow talk about blah.  Crappy service, crappy food.. But it was cheap.  Me and my extended family went out here on a weekend, and everything was just bland, greasy and meh.  It took forever for them to take our order, then forever again for the food to get there.\n\nForever and ever, and never to part, forever and ever we two.. (Consider yourself Rick Roll'd)\n\nConclusion: Eat Here ? Heck no.
