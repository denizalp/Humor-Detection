The gym itself is pretty nice. But the staff are a bunch of pompous assholes and most of the people that go to the gym make you lose your faith in humanity. The woman that go to the gym are the superficial Barbie dolls that you will find putting on make up in the bathrooms before they go and stripper walk on the treadmills and the guys are buffed up, used WAY too many steroids type meat heads. Good facility, horrible environment.
