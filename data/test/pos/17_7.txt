This is the place to be at 2am when you've had enough of marquee nightclub and have been hit with the midnight drunchies. The wait is usually out the door but once you've bitten into dat slice its all gravy baby. Portions are relatively large for the price you pay for a slice [$6]. Flavors fluctuate but there is usually a good variety to choose from whenever you're there and they're constantly throwing a fresh batch in the oven even if it is the dead of night.
