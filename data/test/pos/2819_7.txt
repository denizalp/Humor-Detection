In short, this tiny downtown sub shop serves affordable breakfast and big hero sandwiches. No vegan options though, but they have vegetarian breakfast items.\nI've only eaten here in the morning and usually order the garden platter which came with potatoes and coffee for under $6.\nI wish they'd serve tofu scrambles, but they are not that kind of restaurant.\nThe place is clean and breakfast items are inexpensive and decent. I can't really comment about the other items though. \nOverall rating + 3.5
