This is my go to place for brunch in Cleveland Heights! You can not go wrong with anything on the menu. \n\nMy favorite item has got to be the Irish Benedict. It has corned beef and just makes the traditional Eggs Benedict 100 times more delicious :) They also have some amazing pancakes! I love the cinnamon and blue berry pancakes! \n\nThe service here is absolutely wonderful as well. They're very, very attentive. \n\nIf you're in the area and looking for somewhere cheap and delicious, try this out!
