First time here and we enjoyed it.   The interior is simple and plain (3\/5) and not as decorated as other chinese restaurants, but I don't come in to eat the decor.  The service was fine and she topped us off constantly (5\/5).  We ordered the pepper steak and sa cha shrimp.   The food came piping hot and fresh.   Both dishes tasted very good (5\/5)  Wife said the egg roll was the best she's had in awhile.   The crab rangoon was good and on par with others I've had.  I recommend this place and would come again.
