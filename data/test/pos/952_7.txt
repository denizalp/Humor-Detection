This is a fun new addition to the Strip. Really enjoyed walking around here and checking out the many restaurants and shops. The giant ferris wheel is here, a Sprinkles cupcake ATM is here, and random other things. Things are new and clean here. Just the right size as well, not too overwhelming with stuff. \n\nEnded up here a few times and getting things to eat in the shops. Lots of people here at all times. Great for people watching and photo snapping.
