Purchased a working gun. Fired it once, jammed. Took it back. At first, they wanted to charge full price for a repair!!! Sales person assured us it worked. We asked three times. Sales guy- \"yes, it works....\" \n\nMaybe we just didn't hear.\n\nWatch out!!! Buyer beware! Don't listen to sales people. Read the sign.\n\nUsed guns sold as is. May or may not fire a complete round.
