Not impressed at all, the lady was nice but she did not do a good job at all, I didn't want to be mean, but when I  got home the back of my head\/hair line was so slanted it was scary  half was tapered the other wasn't  my side burns were geometry slopes  , BUT if you want to watch sports center it's the right place to go  just don't get your hair cut if your black straight up
