So full disclosure: I work for a large bookstore chain (there's basically the one in Canada, so you-know-who.) Despite this, I still love love love Pages. I find the hard-to-find books and magazines I love so easily here-- they've a better selection than my corporate overlords. Just don't tell my boss.
