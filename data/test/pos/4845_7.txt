Amazingly delicious espresso on my first day, yummy Cold Brew on my second day, a house blend hot coffee on my third visit. And the vegan baked goods are astounding. I'm so happy about this beautiful place filled with wonderful staff and always a happy vibe from customers. The decorations make my lil goth heart soar.
