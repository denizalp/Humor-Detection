I wish I could of experience this board game cafe as many others have. I purchase the VIP pass to book the VIP room a week in advance for my birthday. To show up and be told it was booked since 12 and unlimited hours was sort of disheartening and that they were regulars. I understand they want to keep their clientele made sense. It was an honest mistake I believe, but to be honest as well it kind of sucked. They were however kind enough to refund my pass.
