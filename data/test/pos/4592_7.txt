I just walked out of the office of PA Marlina Robinson. I've never done that in all of my years dealing with healthcare providers. The front office was rude and when I tried to discuss that with Marlina, she became  incredibly defensive and patronizing. This was, quite frankly, the worst experience I've had with a primary care provider.
