One of the best margaritas in town!  But be careful they creep up on you!  This place still has a lot of the same charm as Dos Gringos, but I enjoyed checking out the remodel.  This is still a great day drinking spot with fun casual environment.  The food is pretty good and prices are low.  Our fajitas were solid and quesadilla looked pretty darn good too.  Safe to say, I'm a fan!
