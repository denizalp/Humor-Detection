I had really high hopes for this particular place. \n\nEven though they are known for their sandwiches, I ordered the uber tuber salad with pulled turkey for $13. The pulled turkey was actually cut up deli meat turkey (false advertising). I ordered dressing on the side- which they obliged with, but even the small amount I used made my salad extremely salty. The potatoes were diced and scant.\n\nNeedless to say, I was disappointed after hearing all the hype and pretty irritated I paid $13 for it.
