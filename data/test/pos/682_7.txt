Such good food and such a nice cook and cashier (depending on who you get), it's too bad that it's smack dab in the middle of one of the most ghetto cities in all of Arizona. El Mirage is responsible for housing some of the dirtiest crudest people I've ever had the displeasure of coming across. On a side note, $7 for an egg, potato and cheese burrito?!!!! That is just ridiculous!
