Located inside the Greenland Supermarket. In the food court to be exact.\n\nDecided to get the brisket pho,\nCame in a medium size bowl.\nPortion of meat, noodle and broth was good.\nTaste was alright, but the meat was way overcoooked. Wasn't bad but didn't impress me either.\n\nCouldn't help but put in mind how not so clean the kitchen looked. The cleanliness was definitely questionable.\n\nI honestly don't know if I'd eat here again, only because of better choices around the area.
