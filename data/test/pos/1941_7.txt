Why am I getting a response today 7\/23\/14, when I visited and  commented on this store 10\/2012.\nI still stand by my review, I got way better pricing at a jeweler on Camelback Road (not  \"spending my money on gas\")  \nIf I remember correctly E.D. said he needed to train his employee better about pricing since the amount I received elsewhere was so much better!!\nBeware of this place!!
