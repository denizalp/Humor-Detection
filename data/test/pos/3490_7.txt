Get Well was the perfect happy hour dive bar which provided an excellent selection of craft beer, mixed drinks, and free arcade games. \n\nThe bar is dimly lit which was a welcome escape from all of the summer walking we had been doing. Large bar area with nice staff and cozy couches around the video games. We were here earlier in the day so there weren't a ton of people, which is was great. \n\nWorth stopping by for a beer and a game. I hear their pizza is excellent as well!
