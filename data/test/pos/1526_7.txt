Aside from being expensive and messy, I don't know why everyone's all up in arms about going to rehab. \n\nI quite like the buzz of a metric shit ton of day drunkards together at a really hip pool club. This expansive pool party has all the essentials: overpriced watermelon drinks, a dance floor, swim-up gambling, and hundreds of bad tattoos that I'm guessing most people got in the early 2000s. \n\nIf the worst thing that happens in Vegas is that you end up in Rehab, then I'd say you've succeeded.
