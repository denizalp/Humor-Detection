We stayed with my wife in Las Vegas in Ballys Hotel. We ordered a couple of Swedish massage in massage 2Go. Girls arrived at the appointed time and brought 2 massage table. They fit easily in our room. they had a great relaxing music! I was so relaxed during the massage, which fell asleep twice! massage was wonderful, better than I have ever received! She knew exactly what places for a massage, where my tired muscles. My wife was satisfied! this price of $ 200 for two, very less for mobile massage! Thank you for the excellent work!
