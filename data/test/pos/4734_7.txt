I sometimes stop by here to look at the kitties, they have been available for adoption and of course pick up much-needed supplies for my cat Javier aka the creep.\n\nI usually don't require any kind of special help because I know exactly what I'm looking for and the only thing I require any help with is hoisting a large bag of cat food into my shopping cart. The cashiers are friendly and answer questions in a efficient manner.
