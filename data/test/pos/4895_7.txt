I will have to say Michael Symon has done it again! Mabel's is a Amazing mix of Cleveland favorites. It's located on east 4. The restaurant has a rustic look . Once inside you will see it's a bi level restaurant with tons of seating. The food here was awesome! I ended up getting (this is Cleveland) in it you get pork spare ribs and very snappy kielbasa's cooked in spicy cabbage. That was bomb the jw potatoes were also yummy. This is an great place to hit up if you want a true taste of Cleveland.
