The gigantic pink building.  We stopped in this place for some ice cream one afternoon.  Its old school and has stools at the counter. Like an old fashioned soda fountain.   I got a walnut fudge sundae and my buddy got a banana split.  My sundae was pretty good.  Just the right amount of ice cream and toppings.  Everyone we encountered was nice and friendly.  A tad steep.  $15 bucks for ice cream but it was good enough.
