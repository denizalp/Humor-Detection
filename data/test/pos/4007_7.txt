I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich at 8:00 through Grubhub... It finally got to my apartment by 10, the burger was messy and the bread was falling apart. After struggling to eat it I was about two thirds done, I looked down at my sandwich and I was DISGUSTED to see the chicken was bright pink and no where near fully cooked. \n\nAfter waiting long for a sloppy sandwich that wasn't even fully cooked I will never order from here again.
