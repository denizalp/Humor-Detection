It's a little hard to know what to make of Old Town Scottsdale; it seems like an odd mash of things. On one hand you have a sparse area of old shops hawking kitschy baubles with a few tired horse carriages. Immediately next door is a sprawling ultra-new arts and entertainment area which apparently carries a dress code of oversized sunglasses, designer purses and botox. And yet, on the other side is a more tranquil area with the city hall, arts museum and a nice central greenspace.\n\nAn odd mix to ponder, but perhaps something for everyone?
