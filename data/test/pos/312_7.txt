I Love Latina! It's such a cute grocery store. They have lots of good pre-made meals, speciality  treats, homemade pasta,and home made sauces and soups.\n\nThey are also very eco friendly. They encourage you to reuse their paper bags and to bring back the sauce\/soup containers.\n\nTheir spaghetti bolognese sauce is the best I've ever had.
