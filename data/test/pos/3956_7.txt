I called for an estimate and man who answered was extremely rude CONTINOUSLY asking me if they would have a parking spot for their van when I had already told him there is parking on the street. No driveway. He then had the audacity to say \"is there a problem mam' .. \"You know what we don't service your area\" when the first question he asked me is what area I live in and when I answered he said perfect. UNBELIEVABLE! What a JERK!
