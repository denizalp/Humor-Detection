Wish I could give them 0 stars. I came here about 5 times at least.. every single time something just has to go wrong, service, rudeness, gas grill not working (twice), neglect, ignoring, dry rice paper and now they charge each person in a party of 5 a fee for getting a booth. Some good things are a few servers that work there though.  The quality of the Gen here is extremely low compared to the ones in SoCal. Man I'm disappointed.
