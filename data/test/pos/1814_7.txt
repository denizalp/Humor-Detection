The food was pretty good - the salsa was SUUUUUUUUUPER HOT and deelish!!!  \n\nThe service?  Blegh...made us feel as if we were putting her out by asking for more iced tea, soda, whatevs.  No warmth, friendliness, nothin'!  Girlfriend made me miss out on some flan because we feared we would never see her again or would have to wait 15-20 minutes for her to get it...and you don't make me miss out on flan +serious face+.\n\nWould go back again, but will not go at the same time...
