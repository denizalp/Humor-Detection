The staff were friendly and helpful, but these sandwiches cannot be eaten on the road. I ordered several vegetarian options and found the sandwiches impossible to eat on the go. I'm sure they're fine at a table, but behind the wheel they're a sloppy disaster. The pasta salad is nice as are the deviled eggs. Overall, 3 stars dine-in. 2 as take away.
