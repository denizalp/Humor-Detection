I love walking in to browse inside Williams-Sonoma. Tons of beautiful coffee makers, ceramic cookware, cutlery, gorgeous cookbooks...all things kitchen and gadgets.  Most impressive for foodies is a array of gourmet shortcuts and goodies.  Pasta sauce, jellies, cookie and pancake batters, candy, gifts, salts, spices, cookie-cutters, platters, etc.  Perfect place to go and find that wedding present that you need to get!
