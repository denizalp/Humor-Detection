Location really is the top benefit to this station being my close to exclusive fill up joint.  It's on the corner of Roosevelt and 7th Street with good access from either street.\n\nThey charge like $.10 more if you use debit or credit, which doesn't seem to motivate me to keep more cash on me.\n\nAll in all, this Shell is convenient, clean, and safe.
