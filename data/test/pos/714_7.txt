Very clean and spacious place in the midst of china town. Very helpful, speedy staff that makes fresh baked goods, smooth, tasty smoothies n iced coffee, delicious vietnamese, american, euro style sandwiches, dry packaged goods and more. We pre-ordered our sandwiches during lunchtime to beat the rush, easy ordering, fast, accurate pickup and yummy sandwiches & goodies. FYI: Cash only and if you forget, Lee has an atm there for you.
