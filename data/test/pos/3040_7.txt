Oh BDubs. I love their wings, I hate their service.  Last time we were there it wasn't busy, so you would think there wouldn't be an issue with not getting what we wanted.  The first thing we asked to play the trivia game (which you need boxes for)... and never got them. She took our orders, but never asked anything was and was generally just not there.  It was really frustrating to see her flirting with the guy at their stand (with trivia boxes right there) rather than serve us instead.
