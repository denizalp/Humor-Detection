I just called this police department because they have a pastor in town, Steven Anderson, who is advocating the execution of all gays very publicly and yet he has still not been arrested for engaging in hate speech.  The person who answered the phone admitted he has been engaging in this hate speech for a long time, yet this police department does nothing!!!!  http:\/\/churchandstate.org.uk\/2017\/11\/conservative-christian-pastor-calls-for-executing-all-gay-people-by-christmas-day\/\n\nThis pastor is a Nazi, not a conservative and he should be in jail.
