It's hard to beat $7.50 matinee movie tickets, but with the cut in price comes the cut in care. Before AMC took over this theater was Rave Motion and I sort of miss it. I can't remember the last time I came here and there wasn't something on the seats, or the floor, or the seat upholstery wasn't breaking. Unless I'm already in the area I definitely won't go out of the way to come here anymore. \n\nManagement, can the theater get some TLC please?
