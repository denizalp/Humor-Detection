I know it's panda and there's tons of them here, but seriously open 24 hours and it's near other eateries? Fantastic. It's constantly good food (notice I didn't say \"chinese\" food) that fills you when you're there. The reason for 3 stars is because:\n\n- Service was ok, you can tell the people behind the counter hate their jobs. \n- The Chow Mein was really cold..... thank buddha for white rice. \n- And they didn't have chopsticks, or they didn't understand me.....\n\nAnyhoo, midnight munchies; 2 blocks; 7 bucks; full tummy.\n\nEnjoy the strip.
