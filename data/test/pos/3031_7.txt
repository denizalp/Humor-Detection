Best shwarma I've ever had.   I've been to a few places around town on a top 10 list and this place blows them all away.\n\nIf you think Ghazale is good then Liberty Shwarma (formely King Shwarma) rocks them.\n\nI look forward to doing Shwarma Saturdays with my fiance .. we're both addicted.  Nice staff too. \n\nThey've changed to a deal a day menu instead of the 2 for $8, but it still rocks!
