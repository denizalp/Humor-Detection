I don't even know how to describe this place.  It's kind of like sensory overload and anywhere I sit, I feel like I always have to watch my back.  This is not the place to go for a relaxing cocktail.  This is the place to go when you have a very limited taste in music, you're desperate to be seen and you don't really want to interact with the people that you're with.
