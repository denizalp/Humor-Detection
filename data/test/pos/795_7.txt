Located in the Arts District in Downtown Las Vegas. This joint is extremely groovy. Vintage chachkies are all around, and for sale. Great drink and food specials, all combined with a terrific staff. So get off the strip, unless you like being treated like a second class citizen in your own town, come down to the Arts District and immerse yourself in the grooviness.  Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!
