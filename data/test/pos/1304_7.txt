Owner was very rude.  He really did not care how his customers felt.  We ordered soup and pasta, both where very salty. The soup was so salty that we could not eat it.   When we told the owner, he tasted it and then said it was not salty! Not only he didn't apologize but insisted that it was fine!!! Very odd place. We're never going back.
