Came in to Wicked Spoon for lunch and it was around $40 per head. There were crab legs, prime rib, a small sushi section and a bunch of other food placed in small metal plates which I thought was pretty cute and original. I didn't like it too much because of the fact that most of the food seemed to be left out and dried up because the buffet wasn't too busy. It was good, but for that amount of money I think I should have marched my butt over to Ceasars Bacchanal instead.
