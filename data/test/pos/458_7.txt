THIS PLACE ROCKS!  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING that I have had has been TOP SHELF.  The rock shrimp appetizer, truffle edamame, and salmon taco are MUSTS.  The bento boxes are also a great deal, with certified beef, salad, tempura, and a steamed egg for $11!  The chef is extremely accommodating, accepting subs for Miso soup instead of salad.  Again, I highly recommend this place and will be going back many many more times!!
