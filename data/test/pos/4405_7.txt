I've now been to this place 7 times.  The food gets 5 stars!  The decor gets 5 stars.  My problem?  You have music playing and the TV playing at the same time...It's a racket!  Pick one or the other.  My other problem with the TV, it's always on Fox News....REALLY?  In an Asian restaurant?  Isn't like like Chickens following Colonel Sanders?  Turn that divisive crap off and put something pleasant on for a dining experience.
