Never order from here. I ordered room service and after almost 2 hours for the food to come; the wings, pizza, and fries were cold AF. $7 too much for the amount of wings they gave us. The pizza was cold, and the crust tasted like a brick. The fries looked suspicious, but it tasted alright. \n\nOverall, I was VERY disappointed with the quality considering that the total was $40...like bruhh
