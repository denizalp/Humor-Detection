Quite surprised that a huge suite does not have an IPOD DOCK! Cheap hotels have then!\nthe RADIO \/CD player they provided is quite antiquated and beat up and goes out of station. \n\nLove the Charleston Heston wardrobe from movies. \n\nBath tub has amazing view and size. \n\nSofa is missing buttons.
