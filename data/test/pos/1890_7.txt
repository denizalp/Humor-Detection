This place is the nearest falafel and shawarma joint to my house. Needles to say, I've been here many times. It is by no means my favourite in the city, but the price is right and it's decent. The staff is very nice and they are generous with the usual toppings and follow sauce directions very closely. Yep, yep. I'm an annoying shawarma orderer. So what?
