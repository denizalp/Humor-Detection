I felt I had to update my post for polished. It has been almost two years since my first visit and I still see Tee every two weeks. She is very friendly and professional, not to mention crazy talented. I genuinely enjoy visiting Polished every time and the quality is top notch. \n\nIf you had a bad experience in the past, I recommend giving them another try.
