Don't need to repeat the 1,000+ reviews that gush over how nice the venue is. It cost $100MM to build, I'd hope it could at least pull off a 4-star Yelp average. It's a high bar, but the combined forces of Wynn, Drai, and the Waits brothers should be able to pull it off.\n\nNow the only problem, half the time I go here, it's like KSA night at my school all over again. If you know what that means, you know what I mean.
