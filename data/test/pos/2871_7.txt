Even worse! I thought that was not even possible!!!! Had glow plugs changed due to a  recall then a month later check engine light comes on for what? You guessed it a cylinder 2 glow plug fault!!! Larry Miller says \"it is actually the distributer harness it will be 400 dollars\" I say I will do it myself!  Fast forward 3monthes and I bring it to a reputable shop in Phoenix to change timing belt and they fix the check engine light for free!!! Thats right not 400  but FREE!!! Larry Miller is the worst of the worst!!!
