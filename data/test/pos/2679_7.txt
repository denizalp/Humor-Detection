Incredibly odd layout to this place.  I needed a few minutes and a rosetta stone to figure out why there needs to be segregated dining.  Still a mystery.  \nThe food is pretty good.  I echo the overall sentiment about the authenticity.  But they've done a decent job of melding the Upper East Side with the Southwest. One thing they should have left on Manhattan is that NYC attitude.  Because customer service matters in the rest of the world.
