Love this place. They bring out about 12 little appetizer plates with various spiced veggies. The tea is good and the food is phenomenal. I got the spicy seafood-tofu stew this time and my husband gets the sizzling pork platter each time. Very fulfilling and such a great meal for the price. This place is also BYOB, which is great.  The parking lot and building looks a bit shady, but the inside building is actually not bad, with various small Studios and food places.
