I ordered pizza from here because they said that they used typo \"00\" flour to make their pizza dough....... obviously they are lying. The crust tastes like any other fast-food delivery pizza...Nova or GIGI. We also tried a  gluten free pizza, pretty much the worst gluten free pizza I have ever had, seriously, it had the texture of soggy stale toasted potato(???).\nThe ingredients are cheap and the results are  nothing like they've described. DON\"T waste your time or money here if you enjoy easting pizza.
