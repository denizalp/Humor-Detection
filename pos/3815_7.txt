i loved this place, being a native arizonan, piggly's at the fair was the best, i love being able to have it year round now.  they are new to the restaurant ownership experience, so i will have to say please be patient as everyone will learn what works and what they will change.  Turkey legs and wings were incredible.  :)  cant wait to go back again.. for some giant fried frog legs ..!!
