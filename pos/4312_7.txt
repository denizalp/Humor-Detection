The entire experience was terrible - extremely crowded dining area, non-existent service & blah food. I'm very glad we didn't pay full price!! We paid $140 for 4 of us after using a $10 off per person discount coupon & it still wasn't worth the price. I would never recommend this buffet & I will never return.
