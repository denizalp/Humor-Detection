I really want to like this place. But I'm on the fence. It's actually cool but, I'm not sure how cool. First off, it's not cheap. And it's not that big. We covered the whole thing in just over an hour.\n   That said, admission was on par with the Tampa and Baltimore aquariums. But the size and attractions were not. \n    C'mon CLE! Make me proud again!!
