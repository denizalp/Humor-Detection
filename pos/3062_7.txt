We had our very old pool resurfaced by CDC last spring. They were very professional, stayed on schedule with the project even though it was their busy season, and were competitively priced. The foreman on our job had some great suggestions that we were very happy with. It's now absolutely beautiful and we are so happy with the design suggestions they made. I recommend this company, and I liked that they are local and only do remodels.
