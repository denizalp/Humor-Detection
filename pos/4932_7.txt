No, no no.  Guess I am just high maintenance!  More of A Mission kinda girl.  Watered down marg without enough ice, hot and sweaty, loud place.  Reminded me of Hooters - servers with over sized boobs bigger than there heads. Def not a place for foodies!\n\nI guess it is more of a college hang out.  Not for me.  Food was a mess, even a set of large breast can't make up for that!
