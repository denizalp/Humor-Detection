Do not use this company. This was by far the worst I have been treated by a company. My sister and best friend booked a limo for my stagette and the limo company was 2 hours late picking us up. The driver was apologetic but came with an empty tank of gas. Further when they were supposed to pick us up they ended up not showing. We asked for a refund and so far they have said no, we are now having this company investigated and put a hold on the Visa charge.
