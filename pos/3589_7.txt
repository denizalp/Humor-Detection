Tim Arnold has created, collected, repaired and is the steward of Pinball history! This is a full on participatory collection. You can play with history in a way like no other museum on the planet (speculation by me as I have not and never will be to all other places on the planet). This very plain building with a very plain sign give you a FREE look at all of history and the ability to pop in a few quarters and recall the glory days of pinball. Enjoy, I do!
