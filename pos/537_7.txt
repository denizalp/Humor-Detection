Truthfully the food is five star. But two things made the experience very uncomfortable. The hard wood slat  benches are unbearable. At least put a cushion on it. After a one hour drive to get to the restaurant, sitting two more hours for meal should be pleasant, not painful. Definitely the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever used at a restaurant. Secondly, as others have mentioned, get some air conditioning! That hanging wall unit just isn't enough for summer heat and humidity.\n\nOn a brighter note, the onion soup is the best I have ever had.
