They charge for EVERYTHING. Even coming out to check out the a\/c is a service charge. They have a nice truck with decals etal, but I guess that comes out of overcharging customers. The technician did not even have the correct spare parts, I had to provide it. Then why charge me so much!!!\nWhen I gave honest feedback (they called), they didnt sound too interested in correcting.\nWOULD NOT RECOMMEND! Wait... STAY AWAY!
