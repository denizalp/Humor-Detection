I am stunned that anyone would find this place palatable! It is one of the worst resturants I've eaten at. What makes sushi good is the texture, taste, cut and freshness of fish. This place does not deliver on any of those things! On my first and last try, I got sick instantly. Took me 6 months after my horrible experience to be able to eat sushi again.
