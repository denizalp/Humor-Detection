Daughter insisted on about 8\" cut off last week. Both Stephanie, stylist, and I told her we thought it was too much at once, and she'd regret it. She does. So, we're back.\nStephanie, to her credit, told Daughter, albeit nicely, flat out, Your mother told you so. I told you, and you wouldn't q I love Stephanie, at this point. She can do no wrong, at this point...including shaving said Daughter bald.\nStephanie fixes it (was asymmetrical before), I tip her, thank her, and we leave, Daughter  happy. I make a mental note to put Stephanie in my will.
