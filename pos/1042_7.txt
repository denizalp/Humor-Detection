I had the Farmer's Market: basically a benedict with spinach, tomato and avocado.  Delicious.  Hollandaise was good, ingredients were fresh, and coffee was pretty good.  My only complaint is the home fries.  They were those frozen type you can get that are too salty and dry out fast.  Fresh potatoes would be so much better.  Other than that, a hit.
