Want to visit Vegas, but do not want to stay on the Strip.  Silverton Casino might be what you're looking for.  Been a while since we spent the night at their hotel.  The room we stayed at was comfy and relaxing.  If the price was right, we would stay here again.\n\nAlthough it is not walking distance to all the action, you are just a short drive away.  If all you want is to gamble and eat.  There are plenty of restaurants and tons of gaming options.\n\nCheck em out for yourself.
