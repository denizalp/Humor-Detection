Good food, good bar and good location. The thing I hate about this place is when you check in to be seated for dinner they tell you when they need the table back. Literally the time they are going to kick you out. It's insulting, it rushes you and overpowers the food with stress. Probably not doing dinner here again since this has happened 4 or 5 times now.
