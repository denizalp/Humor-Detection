Pretty interesting place for lunch. Ambience was very nice and the different smells from the kitchen were quite flavorful. I accompanied a friend from Canada, who raved about the great Ethiopian food in Toronto, so we met up at Cottage Cafe to sample their food. Im not sure what I was eating as I let him order, but I did like the lentils and the beef! Couldnt tell ya what I ate, but it was good! And the fried coffee afterwards was worth the experience!!\nYes I will go back and eat there again, anyone game to go with me??????????
