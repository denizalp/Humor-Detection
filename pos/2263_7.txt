I would go here above any other fast food taco shop in my area.  I simply don't understand why people would subject themselves to Taco Bell over this place.  The chicken burrito is ridiculously huge, cheap and all you need for lunch.  I guess you could take some of the bags of hot sauce from TB over here if you wanted to be all extreme about it :P  I also like the carne asada burrito.  Huge. Ghetto.  Cheap.  Filling.
