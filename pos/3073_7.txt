This is a pretty cool bowling alley. They have 1$ beers, and after midnight, graveyard bowling is only 1$ per person per game! Even during regular hours, it's not too expensive. I think it's only like 3 bucks? Pretty great deal!  \n\nOne weird thing though is that you have to be over 18 to enter after a certain hour - I guess w\/o a chaperone? Bc we got carded going in at 11:30pm but there tons of little kids still running around...
