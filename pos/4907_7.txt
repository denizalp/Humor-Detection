You've found my flaw--I sometimes shop at the Walmart. This Walmart is \"better\" in every way compared with its sister store in Steelyard; for example, other shoppers have never shopped from my cart here. Yet, I still leave feeling like humanity is doomed. I overheard what appeared to be eighth graders talking about how one of them just weaned her son off a Toy Story obsession. I know it's my fault for going in...no one's perfect.
