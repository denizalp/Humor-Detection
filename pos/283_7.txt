While I'm not Jewish, I really enjoy coming to this wonderful kosher bakery. Everything they make, is delicious. \n\nTheres always a line up, so I use the time in line to scope out what I want to order. \n\nSpecialities include chocolate babka's, Rugelach's in several flavours including chocolate, raspberry and cinnamon (my personal favourite). They come in mini and regular sizes. \n\nIn addition to the above, they make a wide selection of sweets including cookies. \n\nHope you enjoy as much as I did!
