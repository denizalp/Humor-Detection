Eat It OR Beat It?\n**EAT IT!!**\n\nBellagio buffet is amazing! They've got all kinds of food and the best part about it is the quality of the food. Ya, you can pay $20 somewhere else and get the same array of foods but who knows how long its been sitting there. At the end of the day, when I can't make it to the Bellagio, the Wynn buffet and Paris buffet are other great alternatives!\n\nCONCLUSION:\nEAT IT! and be a fatty! eat eat eat!
