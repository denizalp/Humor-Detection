This place seems lost in that rare space a few levels below rock bottom.\n\nMakes Dufferin mall look like the Mall of America by comparision.  \n\nLCBO is reasonable enough and the price chopper is reasonable enough as well.  Everything else is god awful at best.    Words cannot express how overdue this place is for an upgrade.
