Stopped into Saks Off 5th in order to search for some bargains, and find out is they truly are an outlet store.   They are at Las Vegas Premium Outlets North.\n\nStore was well organized enough.  Service was fine also.  Nice mixture of lower and higher priced items.  Unfortunately, we did not find bargains on this particular trip.\n\nWill try our luck on future ocassions.
