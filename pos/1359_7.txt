The little duck peddling on the bike outside their store freaks me out. \n\nLucky for them, the gelato\/ice cream is good! They were voted best gelato\/ice cream by the Toronto Star (for whatever that's worth).\n\nThey have a great patio. They're open late and every time I walk by they seem to be busy (no matter what time of day). They have some unique flavours like cake mix...YUM and for $4.50 you get to try three different flavours. Delicious.
