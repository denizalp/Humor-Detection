Great little resturant nestled in the corner of an unassuming office complex!\n\nThe food here is Korean fusion brunch! How awesome is that?\n\nWe got the Bibimbap and the Korean short rib benny. Wow both was packed with flavor and that savory spicy taste that I can't get enough of.\n\nThe only draw back was the portions was on the slightly smaller side. Next time I will have to order two things, but of course I'm a big eater.\n\nI will definitely be back to give them another go soon.
