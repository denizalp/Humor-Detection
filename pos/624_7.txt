Overpriced with little filling.\n\nWe order two crepes. One with Nutella and one with caramel. It's as if they only had one spoon of caramel left and didn't want to use it. The Nutella was spread so thin you could hardly taste it. \n\nWe paid $30 for two crepes and two bottles of water. \n\nYou can find better crepes for less money.
