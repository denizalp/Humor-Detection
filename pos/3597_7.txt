I don't mind paying for good food and service. This restaurant lacks both. Our server Milton ducked. He never refilled our drinks which cost $5 for sodas and tea. HR had the personality of a stump. The food sucks and we were pretty surprise since it has Donald's name in the restaurant who is known for quality. You better off going to the food courts T fashion mall.
