Whole biz is a bunch of headshot scammers! They look legit because they rent out their space and some staff to productions coming into town to cast a shoot. That's when they have the most interviews for new clients, so they look busy and legit. They have been robbing Valley people for years! NEVER PAY TO GET WORK! DATABASE BS! YOU CAN FIND MORE PAYING GIGS ON CRAIGSLIST EVEN! PARENTS, DON'T BE FOOLED!
