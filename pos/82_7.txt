This place is filled with diabetic coma inducing pies! \nName it and they have it \nI usually have the apple crumble or cheesecake pie\nI like it but I find their pies are really sweet maybe too sweet\nSometimes I enjoy their salad too, I don't know if it's more because it makes me feel better about myself or because they are fresh and tasty. \nAlways busy ! Sometimes u can expect a short lineup \nIt's a bit overpriced but the portion are so big that it makes up for it. \nService is always good in my experience
