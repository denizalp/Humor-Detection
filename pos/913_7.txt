This place is 2 and a half stars, but I rounded up to 3 stars. First of all I have never had a martini served room temp in a room temp glass. I had to return it because I don't think the bar tender even knows what to do.\nSecond time around another bar tender made it and she did a great job with it. The food is average. They have few bowling lanes and horse shoe outside for entertainment. \nI guess a place to hangout that is better than sitting in a hotel room.
