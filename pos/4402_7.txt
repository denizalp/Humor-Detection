Was on my way to a friend's house and stopped for a quick bite to eat.  Ordered:\n\nVolcano Burrito - $2.99\n7 Layer Burrito - $2.09\nDouble Decker Taco Supreme - $1.89\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/4UmjnX46qbhV6-D5W89IOQ?select=SmsWfXhrU4AJl6D4nJu6bw\n\nThey were fast, accurate, and the food was decent.  It's a Taco Bell, what would you expect?\n\nReturn Factor - 15%
