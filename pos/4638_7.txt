180 octane with an extra shot on a yard stick.\n\nYup, that's what I was sipping on at 11am while I wait for my friends to wake up.\nThe bartender here is awesome, I wish I can remember here name.\nShe kept me company and stuff lol\n\nStrong drinks, friendly service, and definitely one of the cheaper options for yard drinks!\n\nThis is one is located on Miracle Mile shops
