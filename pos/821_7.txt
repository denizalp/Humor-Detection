Honestly, if there was a ZERO stars option, I would punch that in right now....  It's 30 degrees summer heat and their AC is practically off, asked multiple times to turn up the AC and they just ignore me.  For almost 40 bucks a person I think I deserve some AC and a comfortable environment to eat in.  Last time I'm coming here if is hot out!!!\n\nSTAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS PLACE IF IS HOT OUT, THEY ARE TOO CHEAP TO TURN ON AC!!!!
