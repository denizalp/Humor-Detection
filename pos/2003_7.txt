I'm writing this as I sink into a diabetic coma from eating a cream puff the size of a bus.  Absolutely perfect, just as every other delicious treat I have tried from Great Scott's has been.  The cupcakes are excellent (the red velvet w\/ cream cheese frosting especially) and worth a trip from whatever part of town you are in.  I've been to the famed Magnolia Bakery in NYC, and they don't hold a candle to this place.
