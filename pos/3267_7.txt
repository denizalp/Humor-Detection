Facebook posted one of their posts on my feed about puppies available. So I asked them in the tread if they were adoptables from a shelter or puppy mill. The location in East Liberty hosts dogs from local shelters. They blocked and banned me from their site instead of just answering the question. Very rude. I would suggest going to the East Liberty location or your local shelter. Sorry Monroeville location but your rudeness has put me off.
