Just love the deco and the vibes of The Painted Lady!\n\nIt has a feel of a saloon, love the rich velvet colours and the comfy loungers with nice soft cushions that I can just sink into............\n\nEven on a Tuesday night, the place was hopping with action and beautiful people which were all classy and friendly. Services was great and polite and the music was good!\n\nI definitely would be back for a night cap next time when I am in the area! Just make sure I don't roll down the stairs when I go to washroom! :)
