Would be 4 stars if you didn't BURN MY BAGELS every time you toast them. Get a new toaster, please! We've been eating at The Bagel Cafe for 2 years now and have never had a non-burnt bagel served to us with our Matzo-ball soup. Love that you have Onion bagels, hate that all of the onion bits are burnt to carcinogen level 5 every time. I'm talking black as night. A tragedy. PLEASE invest in a new toaster, or turn it way down even though it might slow down your turn and burn... (pun intended)\n\nGreat Matzo-ball soup, though!
