I absolutely love their sushi, however, when my husband, My 5 month old and I went here a few weeks ago for dinner we were rushed out because of our noisy child. We spend a lot of money on sushi and tips and they brought us our bill BEFORE our last roll even came out. So rude.\nH3 roll is my favorite. Oh my God roll is my hubbys favorite. Recommended. \nSake here is also wonderful.\nBeware, I believe they use a lot of preservatives so the rolls will make you very thirsty and possible heartburn but still very tasty.
