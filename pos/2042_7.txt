The funniest dinner of the whole trip. The servers give you shit, and you give it right back. You'll have fun if you're good at dishing it up- but you gotta make sure you can take it since they're quick. I can be good with the insults, so I ended up getting my face smothered by the man-boobs of my 200+ lb server during his lap dance. I was laughing so much I cried- good times. He also gave me a hat that said \"Don't worry, the taste is better than the smell!\" That's some funny sheit!
