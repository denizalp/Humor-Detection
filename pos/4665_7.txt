I was craving chow mein and Yaos reviews were great. \nExcellent attentive and friendly staff to all their patrons. \n\nThe crab rangoons and sweet and sour sauce was the best I've ever had,  it was so incredibly yummy.  \n\nThe beef chow mein was good, I probably won't order it again as I didn't care for the meat. The quality of it was poor and tasted funny.  The noodles were great though.  \n\nI will definitely be back and will try something different. Prices were so very reasonable.
