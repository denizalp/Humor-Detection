The Service: Servers were attentive. Constantly refilling the drinks and cleaning away the dirty plates.  \n\nThe Food: The food quality..... POOR! The dinner & brunch buffets are $33 including tax. They do have many varieties of food choice; however, the quality is like Hometown buffet. Quantity... but no quality!\n\nMany of the dishes are not flavorful, very bland. The meat section... very dry and overcooked. Seafood section.... not really fresh. \n\nDefinitely won't try here again.
