\"Why is everything I touch sticky?\"\n\nThat pretty much sums things up for Saddle Ranch. We sat at the bar for a quick drink before heading in to Jobbing.com Arena. We were robbed, sweated a bit in the lack of air condition, and got sticky in the process. \n\nAlso, what's the deal with the plastic cups that are supposed to look like glass? They just look scratched up and dingey. Nasty.\n\nFor $25 all we got was 1 beer, 1 mixed drink and 2 sad shots. Waste of money. Go  to the Yard House for better beer and atmosphere.
