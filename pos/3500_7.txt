Was told wait time was 35 minutes. Waited over an hour- still no table. When asking the hostess the response was \"it should have been 35 minutes I don't know what happened.\" This restaurant is unable to adequately manage their tables and customers. Nothing was done to apologize for the misleading wait time.\n\nThe food is good, but not good enough to make up for the poor service and mismanagement. Would highly recommend taking your business elsewhere.\n\nUp to an hour and 15 minutes... leaving now as this is going no where.
