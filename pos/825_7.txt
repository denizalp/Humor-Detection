I'm a big fan of this large microbrewery (pardon the oxymoron). \n\nThe pub part is huge, with big wooden booths and massive menus. I can't speak to their food treats, but the burgers and fries passing our table looked and smelled delicious. Naturally, their beers are flowing and rotating regularly, but they also have old time-y sodas for folks on the wagon. Beyond this, their bottle shop of growlers is open at weird times and on holidays. \n\nThank you, Indie Ale House, you saved Canada Day.
