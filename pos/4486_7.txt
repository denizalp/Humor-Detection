Played black jack.  I put $20 near betting spots, Double Deck, for dealer to change. He dealt right past my money.  I put the money down while he shuffling.\nLeft that table and went to a BJ shoe game.  Deal never smiled or said a word.  Would never play BJ here again.  Got the feeling my business was not, in the least, appreciated.\nWanted to play poker, but it doesn't open till 6pm
