Okay - there's something about this store that makes me squee with glee.   I think it's the toys.  It has to be the toys.\n\nYou can't go wrong with cute panda plushes, or even plush toys that are toast, eggs, bacon, etc.\n\nSQUEE!\n\nLots of other cool things such as clothes, accessories etc for women.  Awesome little books there as well!
