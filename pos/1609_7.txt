This is located pretty good in the center of Flakewood.  Its pretty well organized and has a lot of good stuff.  Its right next to the Lizard...drunk shopping is way more fun!  Only thing that doesnt do it for me is it takes FOREVER to cash out and its kinda expensive!  No way on gods green earth will i pay 3.00 for a head of lettuce and 2.00 for a green pepper.  Westside market is half that price.
