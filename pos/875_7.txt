i would have rated this dealer a 5 start, when we initially purchased our SMART Car through them it was a very good experience, great SMART sales people...but they have Basically dumped all the customers that purchased their SMART cars from them...no longer supporting the brand or the customers that purchased them. any Smart customer that lives in the north or west of Phoenix now have to drive all the way to Chandler to get an oil change.\nshows they really aren't customer service orientated.
