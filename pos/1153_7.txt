I like this location, if you are in the convention center and want more of a formal meal versus the food court, this is your spot.\n\nI had the pepercorn steak salad, and one of their speciality lemondae combinations.  The salad was a little heavy with dressing, but had plenty of steak.  The atmosphere is relaxed and the food is above average.  I like their spin on food, nice presentation also.\n\nIf you like chips, they have great chips which come with 3 salsa variations.
