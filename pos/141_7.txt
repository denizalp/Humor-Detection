The decor is neat, but there is really nothing special about the food. Fish is over-fried and too salty. The seashore appetizer platter is simply a plate of 10 pieces of cooked shrimps and fish balls directly from the supermarket, with one sauce that is also available from the supermarket. For $10, at least they can consider adding a few house-special sauces?\n\nAnd last but not least, the rice is hard and half-cooked. It is not even a proper Thai jasmine rice!
