$25!?\nFor a Buffet dinner?!\nGeez times really have changed in town over the years. (Been coming for over 35 yrs.)\n\nI made up for it and scarfed on all King Crab Legs, Shrimps, and Pork Ribs. The Dessert options were quite good!!! As they should be. Wish I scurried away with a couple for this morning.\n\nService people were on it. Clearing your spot for the next heaping plate to conquer.\n\nGo again? Sure.\nIf you have a massive hangover after a night of it. Don't stare at the carpeting here. It could induce \"the spins\". And that just wouldn't be good.
