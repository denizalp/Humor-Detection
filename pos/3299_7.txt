Sobeys is one of those places with great potential that never seems to get realized.  They were doing well and made a good effort at about the time they got Jamie Kennedy to be spokes person.  The organics increased and the stores were clean. Not any more. I've been in better looking barns. The organic stuff they have is very inconsistent and makes for frustrating shopping. I wont bother going back to this location or any other location.  Jamie Kennedy, take my advice... run and don't look back
