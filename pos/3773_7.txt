I have been a member for the last six moths. I took advantage of the housing market and purchased my first home. Wow that not easy. Anyway working with the service staff has given piece of mind. I know that my selections will be able to make my house a home. Then when our economy really starts rolling I will take advantage of the bigger projects that I can really see becoming a reality. thank you DirectBuy. and thank you Tina and Erin.
