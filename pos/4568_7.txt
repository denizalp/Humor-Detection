This place has no online menu and when I called to ask they said please refer to the photos on yelp. I found the menu on yelp and wrote down my order (teriyaki chicken kitchen entree) and was told they have stopped serving that plate 2 years ago. I asked if they had any grab and go sushi and guess what? THEY WERE OUT (called after 8PM before 9 PM). \n\nI'll take my business elsewhere.
