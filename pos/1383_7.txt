My boyfriend and I walked in to have dinner, and requested to be sat at the sushi bar. The host pointed to where we could seat ourselves but then quickly shouted that she needed to take our Starbucks because she couldn't allow any outside drinks. We looked around puzzled because there was a dirty table beside us with an empty Starbucks cup. She refused to let us drink our coffees so we unfortunately left. Terrible customer service. She should have offered to pour our coffees into one of their own cups.
