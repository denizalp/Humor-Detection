Came here during a slow period and had the pulled pork BBQ sandwich ($15). It was just \"ok\". I felt the meat was a little overcooked and dry, while the sauce was nothing special. The service was fine, although they only had a greeter on the street side of the restaurant and when I entered in from the casino side, I had to wander around a little before someone offered to seat me. With so many other eating options on the Strip, I probably wouldn't return.
