So I finally wore the Prive shoe (nude) and boy was it uncomfortable. Truly wearing it for like 5 minutes or so it totally numbed my feet then it started to hurt.\n\nI decided to give it another chance (can't waste) and it felt a little bit better. However, I don't recommend wearing it for hours. I don't know how the celebrities does it, guess there's a price to looking good.\n\nBoy for a shoe that cost almost $900, not so worth it especially when your feet is blistering!!!\n\nUniqueness: 5 stars\nSexy: 5 stars\nComfort: 1 star\n\nI choose comfort any day!
