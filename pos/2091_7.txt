Review Update:\n\nTaco y Taco is back to its greatness. The al pastor tacos are no longer dripping in fat disgusting grease. \n\nI come here almost weekly and it's not on purpose either. I always get one carne asada taco and one al pastor. Boyfriend gets two al pastor tacos. And then we share chips and salsa. \n\nTheir elotes are as amazing as people describe them to be.
