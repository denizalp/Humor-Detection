GREAT place ... great food.\n\nThat atmosphere is sooooo nice ... coffee's great and free wi-fi!\n\nSeems like the owner and his wife are always there and they want you to enjoy your experience. \n\nThe outdoor patio is facing 7th Street so regretfully it's like sit along side a freeway.  Also they only have 7 parking spots in their very small lot.  But still a really nice addition to downtown.
