This show is a little more expensive then the Nathan burton show but I did enjoy . They told me it was a kid friendly show but certain moments had me rethinking that. If you're looking for great laughs this is a great show . I'm a huge fan of comedy magic . We got our tickets for 26$ each in Vegas but there is many deals floating around so search for deals around . \n\nMac King is a great magician he actually deserves some tips or donations at the end of each show .
