Great atmosphere! Great alcohol selection! Yet we came for food! \n\nWe ordered 2 IPA's and the bartender did not j ow what they were. \n\nThe waitress told us they are a family style restaurant, the portions are big, so we can share. \n\nThe meals came and it was not the case... The biscuit chicken dish was tiny and the half chicken was good size for 1 person. \n\nThe biscuits were rubbery, no good! \n\nFarm salad was good!\n\nGood fries!\n\nChicken liver was nice, yet the shit they put on top made it nasty!
