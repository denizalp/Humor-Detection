I know this place is busy as heck all the time, but really , stopped in there Friday night and the service was great but the dining room was disgusting as hell.. trash on floor . Every open table top had either trash or sofa that was spilled and not cleaned up. The fountain area was even worst.. Sosa spilled all over. Straw wrappers in the trays soaked. I ended up eating outside which believe it or not was a lot cleaner then the inside
