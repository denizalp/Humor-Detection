Meh. I got referred here by the Humane Society for a low cost neuter. After they got done adding some stuff on, it wasn't that low cost. Then they overcharged me but to their credit, they caught it and fixed it.\n\nI just didn't like the guy though.\n\nBut my dog is neutered and now we don't have to go back.
