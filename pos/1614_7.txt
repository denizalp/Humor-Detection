I love eclectic little places and this is just that. It used to be a coffee house for the freaks, like I was, called the Willow House back in late 90's but now it's an artsy bistro. They have salads, sandwiches and tea\/coffee. It's got great ambiance with local art for sale along with food.  Since it is a converted house you can eat in different rooms or outside if the weather is nice. If your in the area I would definitely recommend stopping in for a visit.
