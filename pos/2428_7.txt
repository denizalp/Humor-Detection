Took 3 hours to get my highlights touched up and was then told that it was too late to start on my cut and I would have to come back another day.\nI told them I would rather forgo the blowdry if they could give me a quick cut, no layers or anything time consuming. They said no so I left with wet hair and no cut.  \n\nMy highlight touch up may have only cost $37 but now I still have to find somewhere to get my haircut and I wasted my entire afternoon. I will never go back!
