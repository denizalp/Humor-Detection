F this place.  Seriously...  Well, maybe not. The staff is really really cool and the chicks in the nurses outfits are hot.  But, seriously... wtf?!?!?!?\n\nI felt so sick after eating at this pit.  I really don't ever want to go back. And really... shame on me. I knew that it would happen.  It is the only solution to a burger and fries cooked in Lard.  \n\nI won't go back, but I will tell anyone that is over 350 pounds they will feed you for free in this place. Seriously..\n\nWTF?!?!?!
