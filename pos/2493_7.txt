Right, a pawn shop.. Well, to be honest it has to be the best place to buy power tools. Ya, no joke, power tools. I saw bikes, computer parts, handbags, sunglasses, jewelry, electronics, bread makers, and power tools.\nNot the best location, difficult small parking lot, but the staff is polite, and the prices are right! One cordless drill and a battery $24.99! Sweet, geterdone...
