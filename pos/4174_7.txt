Middle of the road... I liked it better as Bar74.\n\nNot as much of a douche club as Axis Radius or MYST... But not as cool as PCL, Suede, American Junkie, or Six (RIP)... \n\nFeels kinda like a strip club without the strippers... \n\nLadies will enjoy the bartenders, bouncers, music, and dance floor -- Guys (who aren't celebs) should go somewhere else, or just chill on their outdoor patio drinking $12 Vodka and RedBulls... \n\nRemember, Drift is always right next door.
