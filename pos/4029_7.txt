STAY AWAY!!!!!!! Horrible service. The old man cussed in front of my 5 year old after I had my husband's watch in the store to have a link removed and when I picked it up the pin was gone and the watch would not work. I was told it would be 30 minutes and still not ready after an hour. Will never go near the store again.
