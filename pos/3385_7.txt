It appears the Chinese Buffets are the next Gelato or Starbucks \n\nI think I am over them. Sorry Rand... \n\nThis is just like the last 4 new buffets I have been to. I swear it is like Groundhog day. \n\nEverything was good nothing was great. Service was better here but really?? How hard is it to refill drinks and pick up empty plates. \n\nI will go again i am sure.
