I don't know if I am too young or too old when I was browsing around Anthropologie. \n\nMaybe I am really out of it! But gee I don't really find anything that I want to try on remotely... and I did not even look at their prices. Personally I find that the clothings looks much better on their website in the photos than when I actually see the real thing! \n\nThe housewares sections are interesting as they have nice things for the kitchen maybe some of my friends would have like some of those for house warming gift.
