First of all I didn't see any chameleons here, so im calling bullshit off the bat. Besides the filthy lies that I was sold, this place is pretty cool. Some interesting stuff no doubt. \n\nThe owners kind of lingered around watching us like hawks. That made me a little uncomfortable, though in all fairness I did consider stuffing a coffee table into my shorts.\nI would recommend it, if you need some interesting stuff to decorate your domicile.\n\nStill pissed my girlfriend didn't let me buy the wooden sculpture of the engorged naked murderer guy holding a decapitated head.
