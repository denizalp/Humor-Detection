I visited the Art Hole Noda for the recent PBR event. It was a fun little evening event with art, food trucks, and spray paint. \n\nThe thing that stuck out the most was the community that it fosters. There were so many different types of people that came out to enjoy the event, and it really seemed like a big family.
