if there was a fool-proof way to keep all the god foresaken yuppies out of this place i might go there every night.  since that doesnt seem to be an option i stick to wednesday\/thursday nights.  if you are a drunk like me and the slapasses i associate with then you will enjoy drinking there during the day on saturdays as well.  decent bar food, cheap whisk, ping pong, epic patio = good enough for me.\n\np.s. i drive a tahoe and wear polos
