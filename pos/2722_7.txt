It took 15 minutes to be seated and after an additional 15 minutes of sitting at the table, I wasn't even acknowledged by a server, so I walked out.\n\nThere were only 4 other people seated in the restaurant so I couldn't understand the delays.\n\nIt's obvious they don't need my money so I took it elsewhere.
