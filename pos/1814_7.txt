Ordered delivery to a hotel nearby. Estimated delivery time was 45-60 minutes, and I got a phone call from the delivery guy outside at 45 minutes on the dot. Great timing! Pizza was good, meatballs were GREAT.\n\nWe noted in the special instructions \"send forks and love\". After handing over the goods, the delivery guy then said \"uh.. they told me to give you this\" and produced a drawing of a heart. Made us laugh, and bumped up the experience to a perfect 5 stars. Thanks Pizza Heaven!
