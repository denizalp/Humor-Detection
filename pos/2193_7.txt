I love this theatre. They have 25 screens. they show multiple screens with movies that are popular so there are always seats available. I am a loyalty member. what this means is I own a cup and a tee shirt that I bought there. This gives me a free medium popcorn and a $1.50 drink + 1 free refill every time I go to a movie. The theater rooms are cleaned between each showing. The sound and picture are as good as it gets.
