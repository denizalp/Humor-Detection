If you want to be quoted 1 price and billed another over and over again then these are your guys. They run their company like a Nigerian prince who needs you to cash his million dollar check. Nothing they say is true and they blatantly steal from their customers. I guess they figure if only 1\/2 complain about being lied to and ripped off they will still come out ahead. This is a company with 0 moral compass. DO NOT USE THEIR SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!
