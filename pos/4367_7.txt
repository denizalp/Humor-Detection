-Service has improved a lot since my last visit.\n\n-Greeted and thanked by Hostess.\n\n-Pizza is still outstanding (order the Italian Stallion, it's the best!)\n\n-Pizzas came out pretty quickly.\n\n-Some tables are too close, do I need to be touching elbows with the stranger at the next table?\n\n-Parking was convenient.
