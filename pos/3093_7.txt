Funniest show in Vegas. Got these tickets from a charity event and was not so sure about a day show until I read the reviews on here. Boy were they right.\n\nI laughed so hard my stomach hurt and I was crying. Everyone that was with me was doing the same. his guy is hilarious!!\n\nI still have more tickets and can't wait to go back. I loved when he was messing with the kid in the audience about his watch. So funny! \n\nThis show is a must see. It is also very kid friendly.
