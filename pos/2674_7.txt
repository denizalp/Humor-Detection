been a STEELERS fan since the day i was born!!!! i love that we're the champs but, honestly we arent playing like champs lately! Whats up with that?!!!! can Cowher bench Ben until he truly is recovered from all his tramatic experiences this year? Batch did us well.... im also not  happy with all the interceptions.......WHY?!!! Ben's a good egg, but just rest up....we still have a few more weeks! we can save him for the ship! i know we'll make Playoffs! ill always keep my Steelers pride!!!!
