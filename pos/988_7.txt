Strolled in here a little before six in the morning.  Everything was up and running smoothly.  The lady behind the counter was so dang nice, it was a nice preamble to sugary doughnut I was about to devour.  I had already purchased a coffee from another location that will not be named.  A doughnut from D & D is same same just about everywhere you go.  A solid experience.
