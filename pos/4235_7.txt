I hate this company!  I have no interest in their products, have no idea where they got my email!  But I really despise companies that are so removed from their clientele they change their email addresses constantly so, no matter how many times you \"block\" them, they keep sending you spam you neither, want, nor need!!.  These aggressive and underhanded marketing strategies no longer work in this day and age people!!  Do some real research and find your target market!
