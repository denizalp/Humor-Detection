You can't go wrong with Mickey's. Well, for the most part. \n\nWhen it's 2 in the morning, you're hungry and you don't care what your food tastes like--Mickey's is your place. \n\nCheap beer. \n\nCheap food.\n\nAnd a mother effing cheapskate owner who needs to stop charging a cover for no good effing reason.  Your place is not a nightclub, buddy.  It's an average effing bar where people go to hang with friends and buy booze.
