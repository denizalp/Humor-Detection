We needed some finer liquor for a punch Kay wanted to make for our housewarming party this past weekend. After nearly driving back to my old neighborhood of Brookline where I knew there was a liquor store (damn GPS didn't help!), we chanced upon this forgotten-by-me W&S store in a Dormont shopping plaza and found just what we needed. \n\nThe service was efficient, and the selection is pretty strong, but I'm a teetotaler, so what do I know?
