While some of the music can occasionally be a little a little off-putting, I absolutely love how beautifully the fountains dance. The way the water moves paired with the lights - spectacular! It manages to do what Vegas is all about: be \"over-the-top\" ... without being absolutely gaudy. This was obviously a very elegantly planned attraction. \n\nIt's almost routine that my trips to Vegas consist of a dinner at Olives with patio seating for the perfect view over dinner.
