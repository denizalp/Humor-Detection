We had a really nice time there New Years. But someone in the club stole the belt off my coat. I had my coat on and done up when I got there and coat was on stool next to me. But no belt when I left nor in lost and found. I don't know if clientele or others stole it. But you don't want to get drunk in this place. You need to be aware at all times. \n\nToo bad as we would have made it a regular spot as we are new in the neighbourhood.
