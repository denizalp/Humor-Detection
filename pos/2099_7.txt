They have some nice shoes - Stuart Weitzman, Sam Edelman, Toms etc. \nToo bad that every time I've been in there, the staff completely ignores me. Oh wait! One time, a guy who was working there was a snotty jerk to me. \n2 stars for the selection. Zero stars for service. 1 star average, then. Right?
