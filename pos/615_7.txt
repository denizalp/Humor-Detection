Located in the heart of the original part of Summerlin, this Starbucks is one of my favorite locations.  Here's why:\n\n- They have a large outdoor seating area.  With plenty of outdoor seats, this location is great to hang out during the Spring & Fall seasons when the weather is awesome in Vegas.\n\n- FREE WiFi.  I know it's FREE at all Starbucks, but it's worth mentioning it anyway.\n\n- Good service.  The employees here are always friendly and get my order right every time.\n\nOverall, I always have a good experience here.\n\nWill I return?  You bet.
