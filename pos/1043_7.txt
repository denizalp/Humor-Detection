Galleria Mall's a bit on the grubby side. Unlike Dufferin Mall farther south, it hasn't had a makeover and looks pretty dated (early 1970s would be my best guess). The halls feel a bit claustrophobic, even with few people around, thanks to the low vaulted ceilings.\n\nDon't expect anything high-end at this mid-sized mall; the main stores are Zellers and Price Chopper (not that I'm not a fan of them). There are some bargain\/kitschy knick-knack stores here too, so if you're in the market for, say, a big plastic crucified Jesus, you can get it here.
