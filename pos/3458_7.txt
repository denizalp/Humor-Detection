Vera is the greatest hair stylist! I have been getting my hair done by here for the last few years! From the east to the west coast she is def the best! I get a full color\/highlights\/and blowout everytime and she makes my brown hair look natural blonde everytime! Her cuts are amazing and always make me feel great! She is the best stylist I have ever had and will continue to get my hair done by her! I'm so happy she moved here to Vegas so I don't have to fly to dc every other month lol!
