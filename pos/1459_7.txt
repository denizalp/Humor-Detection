Makers & Finders newest location is the perfect spot to grab a warm beverage whether you're in line for Santa photos or enjoying Downtown Summerlin's nightly Christmas parade. I love the Mexican spice latte, but I'll try to switch it up with the coconut turmeric soon.\n\nCoffee may be the star, but the Latin-influenced food menu is creative and unique. I'm not usually a fan of Caesar salad, but I crave M&F's version made with kale.
