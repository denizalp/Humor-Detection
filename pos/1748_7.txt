After attempting to purhase a double dozen at Krispy Kreme and they advised  me no glazed due to the machine was broken I headed directly over to this location.\n\nWinchell's donut's are bigger and have more density which I feel tops KK. Anyway, I ended up coming in two mornings back to back for the Winchell's dozen. \n\nMy clients were happy!
