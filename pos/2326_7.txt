I remember when I was in university roughly 12 years ago Basha was considered \"The Essentials\" of middle eastern food in Montreal. Wow, it went down.\nWent back this summer (I visit Montreal often) and decided to have it again... not bad but something was truly missing. Boustan and Al Taib are miles away from this place. Least flavoured meat I had tasted and bland potatoes. It will do the trick if you are hungry, but go a few blocks away and have a nice Boustan. Much better choice
