I see Lori here, who is a NP. She is amazing. She always listens to what I have to say. She does my Pap smears. Pap smears in them self are pretty awkward, but Lori doesn't make it awkward at all. She's very talkative, bubbly, and eccentric. If you have had a bad gyno experience or have never been I highly recommend Lori. She tells you everything that she's doing. Lori is the best!!!
