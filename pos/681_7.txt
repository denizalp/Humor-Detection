These guys have become my go-to moneychangers for foreign exchange purchases.  Easy to get to and park near, open Saturdays, four-figure transactions over the counter no problem, and minimal dicking around once you've got an account open.  Payment by cash, Interac, or combination thereof.  They seem to make a point of keeping larger denomination notes on hand, so your wad won't necessarily have to choke your horse.   And the best part:  far, far better rates than my banks offer me, buying and selling back both.  Every time.\n\nEasy-peasy no-brainer.
