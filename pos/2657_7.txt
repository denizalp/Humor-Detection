Oh my shaky knees.\n\nRaspberry rugalah that's not too fruity and melts in your mouth.\nPignoli (that's pine nut cookies) with rich almond flavor and chewy in the middle.\nCream puffs bigger than your fist.\nAnd like the other review said, lots more!\n\nYou'd think you died and went to bakery heaven.  I'm really picky when it comes to cookies, but I can't stay away from these.  I bought a naughty box for myself yesterday.  \n\nMine, all mine!
