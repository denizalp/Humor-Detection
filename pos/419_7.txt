Folks have raved about the fries, but I felt like chips. Homemade, hot out of the fryer! Wow! How cool is that. I had a special hoagie with turkey, pepperoni, banana peppers, lettuce, tomato and a spicy siracha mayo. The hoagie roll was fresh and delicious as was the entire sandwich. \n\nI also had a hard time finding the place. Follow the signs to Building 4, which is above Quest Diagnostics. The Post Office is right next door in the same building.
