Real low key place. Good location when everything else on College gets too busy. I didn't think much about their food or drink menu. \n\nWould give it 3 stars, but the facts they judged my Quebec drivers license and medicare ID's as somewhat invalid appalled me. Canadian citizens should not be required to walk around with their passports when they have valid pieces of identification.
