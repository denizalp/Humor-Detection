I really thought I'd hate it based off of my preconceived notions that it sucked. It was hard to decide what to order because I thought I would hate it all, but once it was my turn, I blurted out \"market wrap\" nervously. No added protein. $9, expensive. Oh god what was I thinking? On the way home, wrap in my hand (not warm--I thought it'd be warm), I kept berating myself. This will suck, I'm an idiot...\n\nBut when I bit into it-it was great! So many flavours, crisp, and ... Fresh.  Good portion size. I didn't fail!
