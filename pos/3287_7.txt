You don't go here for the food or the slightly over priced alcohol, but for the experience. As mentioned by others, the way the drinks are brought to you (especially all the bowls) is amazing. The drinks are pretty strong and I got drunk within 5 sips of my bowl. I also had the tiki puka puka which has always been my favourite tiki bar drink. You can wear your hawaii shirt or dress here and totally feel in sync with the place. 4 stars instead of 5 because it needs more food options :)
