I honestly was shocked that I really enjoyed this place! Came here for my cousins bachelorette party and was like WOW the moment I walked in. The dance floor was a decent sized, I loved the outdoor area. \n\nWish I had gone here for the day club! The music was really really good that night. It reminded me of XS but it doesn't get overly packed (like Hakkasan where you can't move). You can still dance here! There is enough space too! I like it.
