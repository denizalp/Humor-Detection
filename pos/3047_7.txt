Our HOA choose Epic Association Management over several other companies and knew we made the right choice the day we signed the papers.  The owner is professional, efficient, personable, knowledgeable and just terrific to work with.  She follows through with what she promises, usually the same day, if not the next.  Our community has never looked better and  our residents have also commented on her willingness to help them.  Best decision our board ever made.
