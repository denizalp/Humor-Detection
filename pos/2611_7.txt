Walmart? More like SMALL-Mart\n\nHowever despite how small the Walmart is, I got everything I needed, and it is small, but then again before you complain look at everything else in the area, it is also small. You can't expect them to shoehorn a full size store in a lot this small, even Walmart haven't figured out how to break the laws of physics yet. \n\nI got everything I needed at this store and I think the staff here was very nice. Parking was alright for the time I went and I did have a pleasant shopping experience here.
