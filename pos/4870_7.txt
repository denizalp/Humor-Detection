I kept seeing people post pictures on Facebook of the pretty macarons Coquette Patisserie sells so I finally decided to check this place out and I was very happy with what I found. My friends and I like to sample the different flavors and are always excited to meet up and try something new out. \n\nThis place is newer and is still working out the logistics of how many macarons to make, but it is coming along and the staff is always friendly. \n\nSide note: last week I noticed there is a good looking manager working in the evenings.
