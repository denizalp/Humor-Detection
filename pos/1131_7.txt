What's not to love about this place!!? Polite workers, phenomenal pizza with unlimited toppings, and a cool atmosphere. If the weather is good you can grab your pizza and sit in the park. \n\nAll pizzas are individually sized for someone extra hungry or enough for 2 if you aren't gonna be a fatty. Everything has 1 price and the toppings include everything from falafel to prosciutto to meatballs. \n\nGive this place a shot!
