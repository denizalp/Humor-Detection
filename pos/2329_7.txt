The old, historic street of Glendale has better eats than you might think.\n\nI've been here twice, and both times was treated to some of the highest quality ingredients I've had on this side of town. Only complaint is that the darn pizza falls apart while you're eating. But who cares when it's so good, you're licking your plate? If you're every passing through, you won't regret stopping here. Not the best value out there, but it's worth a shot!
