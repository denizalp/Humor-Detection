Its cheap and you can feel it throughout the whole experience. The staff are friendly but everything else is less than comfortable. Have TSA Pre? Can't use it with Allegiant. Want leg room? Nope. How about an arm rest that's been wiped down in the last 24 hours? Probably not. Tickets are cheap though, so you get what you pay for. At least flying out of Stockton is convenient. Flying back from LAS is not as convenient especially since I can't use my TSA Precheck. Three stars for the price and the 50% of the staff that is nice.
