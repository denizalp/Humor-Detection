Not only are the buttermilk biscuits straight candy, but I'm still dreaming about the fried chicken.  O.M.G. both things were pure deliciousness.  In addition to the darling ambience and cute lounge area, the service was completely spot on.  The bartenders were fun and just good ol' happy to be there.  Thank you Yardbird for expanding my palette and making it worth it--I'm a fan.
