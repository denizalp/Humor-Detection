The owners are my closet friends, when they wanted to open up a pizzeria, \"\nI was like yay!! That's awesome!!\" \nI knew it was gonna be real good due to the fact that they had their own Italian restaurant in Chicago.  I'm from Chicago, born and raised. And nothing taste better than a Chicago pizza!!   They're pizzas are exactly like Chicago Style Pizza.  Delicious!!!!!   You won't be disappointed!!    They Rock!!!!!!!!!    So, come on down and get authentic Chicago pizza. I dare YOU!!
