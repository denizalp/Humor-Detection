The food here is GOOD.\nThe service here is BAD.\n\nWe haven't been to this hidden gem a few times, and all though the food taste great.... their customer service makes me cringe. One time we had came in for dim sum, and the lady kept missing us. They didn't refill water and we felt completely ignored. It was hard to get anyone's attention. We kept having to raise our hands and ask one employee something and they said they would grab the right person and it was a vicious cycle.
