OMG, what a disappointment! \nHoney Salt tries so hard to be cool and innovative but they fail miserably.\n\nMenu - full of those pathetic dishes that feature a zillion ingredients and loose focus (and flavor)\nService - seriously amateurish and annoying\nWine list - generic and uninspiring\nAtmosphere and decor - I guess this is their idea of cool but the husband and I agreed that this place could be anywhere in a past-its-prime area of Brooklyn and would blend in perfectly. Again, totally boring.\n\nHoney Salt should be called Vanilla. That would be more appropriate.
