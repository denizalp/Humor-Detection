Too bad you can't give a no star review. Take all the local alcoholics and gather them up in one place, well this place is it. It's loud, obnoxious and an eye sore for the community. I ordered a simple hamburger and fries here and I actually returned it because the fries were soggy and the burger smelled funny. It's best you walk on the other side of the street when you come near this place because of all the smokers blocking the sidewalk.
