A much needed East Valley alternative to the Monterrey Jack soaked Mexican options that dominate the area.  They do an excellent job of making Mexico City street staples such as Tortas, Chicharron,  and Tacos Al Pastor fresh and upscale.  You can eat like a real 'chilango' without having to worry about being kidnapped or being run over by a Bocho cab.\nI hope that the area appreciates this place and that it continues to thrive and grow. And, yes, they do a Taco Tuesday, so that's your excuse to try this place.
