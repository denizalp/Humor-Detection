SHOW\nThe show is really fun and if you are going with a group of rowdy screaming women, even better. The dancing is ... eh..but that's kind of the fun of it. \n\nHOTNESS\nSuper !!!!! We all had our favorites. \n\nPULLING YOU UP ON STAGE\nNot sure if they target certain people beforehand, but some of the brides got some extra treatment. They may have the most support from their crowd, so that might help get the guys' attention. Bachelorettes, put your brides within easy access of the fellows [along the walking paths and up front] for more attention.
