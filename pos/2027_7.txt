This is your average C-Train platform. Nothing special. They have ticket machines, (as they all do) and a few benches where you can pass out after you've missed the last train and you're totally shitfaced. There's a Mickey-D's nearby, so if you wake up to a bum pissing on your face, you can mosey on in to clean up. While you're there, order yourself some salty-ass fries; you've fuckin' earned it, champ!
