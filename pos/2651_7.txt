This place is reminiscent of the 60s and so is the food. My toast actually tasted like it was made in the 60s and free dried until 2010. Everything tasted like it was made in a microwave and the food came out WAY too quickly for me to believe it was made from scratch. \n\nThe only plus: The waitstaff were fast and courteous.
