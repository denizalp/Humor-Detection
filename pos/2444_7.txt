They picked our things up in LA on the 25th of September and we still haven't received it (Oct 13th). We were told it would only take 2 weeks MAX for delivery. We have called, and no one has returned our call(s). I don't want to waist too much time on this review because they aren't worth you looking any further. \n\nThe Delivery is only half the battle. They are a problem from the point of pick-up.\n\nSTAY CLEAR of this company!!!!!!!\n\nThis company also goes by - WESTCOAST MOVERS
