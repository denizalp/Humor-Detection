look, listen and hear me! This airline is a a great deal. Low fares, gets you and your luggage there and saves you money. I just want to get there and got on with things. Learn to pick up what you need and the airport and sit down and don't expect the biltmore type service in flight. Learn to deal with it and pocket the difference! the right attitude makes this a wonderful deal!
