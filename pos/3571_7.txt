Cool space in a typically soulless AZ strip mall. The food is excellent as are the espresso drinks.(Besides Giant Coffee in Phoenix, this is my favorite coffee shop). The Pesto Chicken and Lemon Crepe are top-notch flavor-wise and the presentation is always impeccable. I laughed at one of the reviews that called the presentation \"pretentious\". How dare you make your food look like an art form! Anyways, the wait time can be a little excessive but it's worth it.
