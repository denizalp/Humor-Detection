A authentic place with a small salsa bar. This place is very close to those in the LA and SD areas.  \nA must is the carne asada  burrito, torta's, or for sharing, asada fries or nachos! Breakfast is pretty good here too, plenty of chorizo dishes! \nThe Chicken is ok, with the Carnita's being the better choice. \nThe salsa rojo and verde is not too bad, plenty of flavor and heat!\nThe cooks are pretty cool, order in spanish! \nVery easy on the wallet and it's open late!
