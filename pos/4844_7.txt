Hands down, Dr. Bracken is THE. BEST. VET. EVER.  He cares for all of our little critters.  When we are being stupid emotional humans and just have to have our critter in for a look-see, Dr. Bracken is up for it.  \n\nHe is clearly compassionate and cares about every animal he sees.  His staff is helpful, accommodating and show just as much compassion.  I trust my animals to Arcadia Animal Clinic, you should too.
