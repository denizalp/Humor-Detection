I went to opening night and JLo was awesome!  Ne-yo, Ja-rule and Pit Bull also made guest appearances.  I loved every minute of the show and it was definitely worth the money.  I would recommend it for any JLo fan - she does not disappoint and her derriere is on point.  She's an incredible dancer, singer and performer.
