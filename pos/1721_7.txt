Large shopping plaza with tons of shopping and restaurants right across the river. There's also a nice hotel right next door as well. \nTexas de Brazil was the restaurant my group ended up going to but there were options for everyone as far as cuisines. There was also a casino although I didn't see it. \nGreat area for a pit stop if you are traveling thru the area.
