Used car places get a bad reputation for a good reason.  They can have great personalities and the best responses, but they are hard to trust.  You always have the needling feeling that they could do a little better with prices (if they wanted to.)\n\nThis place is no different.  Packed showroom. It was Saturday.  Our sales person was professional, energetic, accommodating and friendly.  \n\nIn the end, for us it's coming down to cost and car.  If those items don't line up there is simply no deal.
