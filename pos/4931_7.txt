Stopped in here after shopping to grab some food to go home with. My first glance at the menu found me searching for something interesting, which I didn't find. Eventually ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger thing and strawberry milkshake.\n\nThis was one of the worst burgers I've ever had. Virtually flavorless. The strawberry shake had fresh strawberries mixed in, but the ice cream was more like ice milk. Not creamy, also lacked any flavor.\n\nWon't be eating here again when there are better options. Its overpriced, and not that good.
