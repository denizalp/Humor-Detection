So this place is really good. \n\nGyro, stuffed with meat, tender yummy meat, plenty of sauce, soft warm pita. Onion and tomato \n\nFrys, hot, fresh, seasoned and plenty of them. \n\nService, as expected... Excellent. I love when people ask how it is. \n\nLocation, next to NOT IN a gas station on the south east side of the road.
