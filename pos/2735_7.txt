Picture this! Me in the role of Maria, from THE SOUND OF MUSIC, running around the store singing \"These are a few of my favorite things\" ;D \n\nOkay, OKAY! I'll bring it down a notch :) But I do love everything about this place. I love their clothes, I love their layout\/organization & I love their sales. The staff is really nice too, even when you ask them about 'other stores' in the area... doesn't seem right, but they are all about the customer, which can never be wrong! right? lol
