Perfect location right by the ASU campus on the street where all of the bars and clubs are located. They are open until 3 AM and is the perfect food after a night out of drinking with the fellas! \nOur hotel was right around the corner from here so it was in the absolute perfect location for us. \nThe customer service is pretty awesome and they all understand that pretty much everyone that comes in late night is going to be drunk or buzzed and they are very friendly and easy going.\nLove earl's! It's awesome!!!
