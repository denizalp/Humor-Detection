I have had this insurance since I moved to Cleveland (yay for shopping locally) and have had great service. The representatives are friendly when you call, answer your questions even if you aren't buying insurance that day, and are not pushy salespeople. \n\nI like being able to update my policy over the internet, see how much changes will cost before I enact them, and they have several different payment options available.\n\nRecently got into a minor car accident and was able to take my car to Progressive's garage to get it fixed. In and out and on my way.
