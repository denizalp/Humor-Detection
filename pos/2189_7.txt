May not have tried the food, but the phone service is less than OK.  Tried to make a reservation 3 weeks in advance and the request was, \"I'd rather you make sure you can make it then make the reservation and then cancel.  I mean, are you just trying to book it as a safeguard?\" \n\nWould have loved to experience the 5 star reviews since I'm flying in from NY, but uhm, no thanks.  And people say New Yorkers are rude.
