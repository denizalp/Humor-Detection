A friend told me about this place. They have tons of candy, themed supplies, pi√±atas, balloons in all shapes and sizes. \n\nI almost got lost here looking at all the party stuff they sell. I really think that this store is super neat for parents who are too busy to make preparations for a birthday party. They also have a large selection for graduation celebrations and adult parties.
