Demolished their XXX Challenge after a full day of eating... lol But, despite it being a challenge, the burger was delicious! Not much else to say about that because there wasn't really any special things that any other burger joint doesn't already do, but they are open 24hrs!!!! Huge Plus!!!! Definitely will return to conquer another XXX (just because I can)... Btw, they employ a lot of Polynesians, Much Mahalos for that! Feels good to see my own peeps around, and working!!!
