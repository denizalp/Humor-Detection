Sometimes I read reviews for an establishment that make me sad for Madison. The reviews on this site for this \"institution\" spring to mind. Like all other Food Fight restaurants, this place is devoid of anything that would make it interesting or enjoyable. The decor looks like it was purchased out of Good Time Fifties Oldies Diner Catalog and the food ranges from passable to embarrassing. \n\nSkip the soul-less chain and go to any family-owned business in the area instead. Stalzy's comes to mind.
