Maybe their catering is ok, but their retail frozen pre-prepared foods are terrible. Worse than the wildly inconsistent and incorrect directions is the end product. Especially given the price! I have no problem paying more for quality prepared foods. I've tried this place twice and it's a huge disappointment. Won't be a third time. Between Absolutely Fine Foods, Bruno's and the French place across the street (Ma Maison?) I have no need to overpay for something so meh.
