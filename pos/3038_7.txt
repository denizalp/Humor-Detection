The thought of having to cook my own meal was a very interesting motion. So my first time at Korean Grill House I was excited to try something new.\n\nI really like the selection of meat there is quite a variety to chose from, plus there are vegetables you can pick as well, I love veggies!! Especially with grilled or BBQ meat. The atmosphere of the place is a nice on great for groups of friends or family as it is quite fun to sit there and grill your meat selection. I recommend this place. \n\n#30daysofyelp
