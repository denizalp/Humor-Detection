Yelp suggested Pho 90 in the area, and we weren't disappointed! Quaint place with hot and cold pho, rice plates, appetizers and selection of iced coffee and fruit drinks. \n\nOur server was \"Caiden\". Amazing how Caiden wore many hats - from being our host, server, handling our to-go box, check and not to mention, the great hospitality. My Mom is fairly picky with her pho, and she enjoyed and loved the place. Fresh ingredients and wonderful service! We'll definitely return to try other items on the menu.
