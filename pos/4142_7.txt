I haven't ate here - but wanted to ask a question. I popped in to check out the menu since I was really excited to find a restaurant with the word \"Taipei\" in the name. However, none of the dishes looked Taiwanese. The menu is typical Americanized Chinese food. Maybe there is a secret menu?\n\nCan anyone who is familiar with Taiwanese food and not just standard Americanized Chinese food comment?\n\nthanks!
