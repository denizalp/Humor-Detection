Enjoying the end of a week by NOT cooking. We decided on pizza.\n\nStaff was friendly. Store was clean. Pizza was hot and delicious. Summerlin Dominos is a safe bet when ordering  pizza and I would definitely recommend.\n\nOnly 4 stars because this location can skimp on the cheese and that's just not cool.
