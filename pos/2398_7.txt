Just like its name nothing is special about this place. It's in a casino so its overpriced and low quality. There is no wow factor and the buffet is not the world's largest. I would stick to off the strip for Indian. A  fast food indian gourmet with live entertainment and modern deco would have worked better. No signature dishes and the bar is small and hidden and nothing special. I would have made it into bhangara bar with fusion tapas.
