I enjoy coming in here and having a Beer or two or three with friends.  Sometimes I bring my family along....but that's only for food.  One of my favorite dishes here is the Kobe Burger.  It's a must try if you're a fan of Burgers.\n\nOverall, it's a good time but it's not a place we come to very often.\n\nWill I return?  I'm sure I will.
