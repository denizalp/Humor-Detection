My family has been coming here for near 10 years and it is a sentimental tradition. Food is always consistently good not great. Service is always nice and pleasant. \n\nTheir bean dip is super delish to start with. They also have great salsa!\n\nLunch specials are very nicely priced.\n\nGreat chile verde, carnitas, and salmon tacos.\n\nThey even have great vegetarian options: sweet potato enchaladas, veggie tamales, etc.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood check it out
