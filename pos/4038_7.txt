We have a two years old daughter and we have been taking her with us to many many restaurants in town cuz we enjoy eating out. We always bring her own food since she has special diet need. No restaurant ever told us anything about bring our baby's own food except this one. \n\nWe were told bring own food is not allowed even for baby, needless to say, we were upset and that would be our last time visiting there.\n\nThis restaurant is the most kid unfriendly restaurant.
