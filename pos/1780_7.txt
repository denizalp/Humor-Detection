It is what it is. A McDonald's. The service was pretty fast surprisingly but the homeless people... or not very well cleaned people were everywhere. It's probably the neighborhood, but I have definitely went into better McDonald's.\n\nI ordered an ice cream on a cone and the worker just got me one in like 30 seconds.
