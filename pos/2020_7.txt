Usually when a place first opens it hits or misses.  This place hit!  Didn't even know this place existed until our friends insisted we leave our happy hour to do their happy hour.  We were not disappointed in the food, value or service.  All were great.  Great list of food and drink happy hour items.  Great school vibe with cleaver decor including the style of the menus.   They had jenga and beer pong on their big outside patio. Fun to play or even watch.  We will be back and recommend this spot to others!
