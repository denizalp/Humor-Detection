The theatre has been consistently dirty.   Also for some reason, there is always someone that comes into the room during a movie and walks and stands in ever corner for a few seconds.   It's really weird and distracting during a movie.    The first time it happened I though there might have been something wrong, but every time I've gone now it has happened.
