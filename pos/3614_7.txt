I recently went back to Dr.Blacker for the removal of my bottom permanent retainer (after roughly 3 years of having it) and to have a removable retainer made for me. It was as great as when I went years ago for my braces. The team there is always so kind and truly care about their patients. This location specifically is beautiful as well. I love the modern and very high-tech atmosphere of the office while overlooking a little lake while getting procedures done. I always recommend Dr.Blacker to others inquiring about orthodontic needs.
