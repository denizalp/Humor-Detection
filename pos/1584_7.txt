Firstly, I just visited Hungary recently so I had a certain expectation for the food and rhapsody exceeded my expectation in terms of taste and variety. The goulash was served in a cute bowl hung by a wooden contraption giving a classic feel. The chef special was a simple mix of chicken and potatoe but the pickles with the sauce really makes it flavourful. Remember to use the coupon bc the apricot crepe we got was delicious. Definitely a place to go if you miss Budapest!
