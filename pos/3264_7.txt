What an absolute joke. When I realized the company I had booked with was another shuttle bus ride away, I walked in to EZ where I had seen the rate on Kayak. He told me the walk up rate would be ~30% higher and that if I booked online (at the quoted rate) I would have to wait \"two to three hours.\"  When I asked him if he saw why someone might find that objectionable he immediately got an attitude. Here's a better idea: go fuck yourselves; I'd rather walk.
