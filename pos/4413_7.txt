Of course no one likes to go to the dental office, especially when you know you need an extraction. That's exactly how my mom felt, very nervous and anxious. But as soon as we came in Dr Daccache he put everyone at ease, especially my mom. He extracted the tooth and did a bone graft so quick and efficiently. He cares about his patients and he does a superb job. I highly recommend him if you need any wisdom teeth extracted or implants placed !!
