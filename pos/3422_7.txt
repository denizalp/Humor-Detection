Hands down the best department store.\n\nThey are the epitome of true customer service. I always have a pleasant experience whenever I shop there, even if I don't purchase anything.\n\nAlan, who helps me out in my section (The Rail), is just fantastic. Knows exactly what I likes and will call me whenever new stuff comes in.\n\nAnd their sales are ALWAYS fabulous.
