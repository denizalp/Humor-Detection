I opted for the $25 spa pedi. She literally rubbed the rocks once down my legs, put on an orange lotion that burned my skin and rushed the nail painting to the point it streaked. The salon only had one other patron so I I'm not sure what the hurry was....? Sorry, I can't recommend nor will I be back.
