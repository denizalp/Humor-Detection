This is my new favourite chinese dessert place! I came here based on yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. We got a table for 4 pretty quickly for a Sat night judging from the previous yelp reviews. I had the steamed milk with papaya, and also had bites of my boyfriend's green tea shaved ice (super delish) and my friend's deep friend milk. Everything was very yummy and well priced.\n\nI'm looking forward to coming back and trying the other things on the menu!
