This location of Earl of Sandwich is kind of an embarrassment to the original one in Planet Hollywood, which I rated 4 stars. It has a smaller menu selection, longer wait times (even with a smaller line?), is more expensive, and the sandwiches just don't taste as good at all. \n\nDo yourself a favor, and walk to to the one in Planet Hollywood.
