Love me some green belt action!  There's not much to say that hasn't been said already, except for this (and listen carefully):\n\nDo not expect a fun ride a day or so after a storm.  Right around the Indian School underpass it floods a lot, and fish tend to die right near the concrete, so it is super SMELLLLLLLLLLY.  Not the best when you're working out and taking deep breaths!\n\nOtherwise remarkably clean and well kept.  Thanks City of Scottsdale!
