Went on a recent trip to Vegas. Found the place  in the pouring rain.  Was excited to see the place. Walked into a small, unexciting retail \"store\"  that was just an area of the warehouse that has been fenced off with chain link. Its has 20 or so fish and a few tanks\/accessories along with some dusty apparel. \n\nOverall,  I was disappointed,  but still a fan of the show.
