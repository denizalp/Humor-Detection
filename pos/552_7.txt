Wolfgang doesn't disappoint. Another plus is they close really late basically the only place in MGM that is open past 2 am. Really great for those late vegas nights and late munchies. \n\nStayed at the MGM for a conference so kind of didn't want to go far. This place is good. We had a lunch event here and the food was decent. For the late night I came back to have spaghetti and meatballs which was good. The meatballs are so huge! Definitely worth it.
