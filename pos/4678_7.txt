Very friendly professional and courteous staff.  They make good rifles, and while they have had a bad name in the past for horrendous service, the new management seems to be trying real hard to turn that around. They offer gun-smithing services in addition to selling their own products which are reasonably priced and well built. I purchased my very first AR from them and still call them with the most asinine questions which they take the time to explain and answer. Excellent all the way.
