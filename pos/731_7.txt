Didn't even bother getting fry bread, because mobile chimis are the food of the future. Perfectly deep fried, with great chicken, and really tasty beans. $7 for a level of quality I only see in Tex-Mex restaurants. IDK what kind of beans they use, but they're awesome too, as is their salsa. I also love the use of mixed greens instead of lettuce. The combination of above average Mexican food and fry bread in one stop makes Emerson a food truck you shouldn't overlook.
