Amazing happy hour! The miso eggplant forever changed me! It was delicious!! The beef rolls were also great!! I didn't like the tomato roll, but surprisingly the Hubby really did, so it must be a matter of taste :) We got stuffed for under $40 on the strip for dinner, and thoroughly enjoyed our meal!! Big time score!!
