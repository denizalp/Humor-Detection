They were very fast and friendly. But I can't get past how awful their food was. Their food was over cooked and had no flavor. The rice was dry and some of it was even crunchy, the chicken had two different colors (some was a dull white & other pieces looked like beef). Their egg rolls were disgusting. Definitely will not be ordering from them again.
