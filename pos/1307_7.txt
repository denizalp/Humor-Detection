Seriously, if you're a vegan or vegetarian, might as well look elsewhere.  Virtually everything on the menu here had parents at one time and\/or has been through the deep fryer!  Burgers, cheese stix, onion rings, fried chicken, yum!\n\nO but they are so known for their homemade soups and chili.  I came here with some coworkers and I ordered me a side salad (that's healthy, right?) and a bowl of chili.  The chili was savory good on a winter's day.
