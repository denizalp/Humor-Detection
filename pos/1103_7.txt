LOOOOVEEE IT! The girls and I were really there for the guys not really for a show. If all they did was stand there with the shirts off, it would have still been fine. We got seats really close but then again, the entire place was small so no matter where you seat, you can see those rippling abs of theirs. It was very entertaining.
