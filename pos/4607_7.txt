I have gone to Boulevard Salon twice now and both times I had Vera as my stylist. She is really nice and really makes sure that everything that you want done with your hair is what you envisioned and more. She worked with me to nail the perfect color combination for my hair. I look forward to my next hair appointment and I definitely would recommend Vera for anyone's hair beautifying needs.
