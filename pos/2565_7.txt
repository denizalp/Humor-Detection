the employees here are complete assholes. i ordered my usual blueberry muffin and grande green tea latte and i always ask for them to be on separate bills because who doesn't want an extra star or two and this punk of a girl says no, we're busy. there's a line. like i get it but pretty much ALL every other Starbucks is busy and legit it takes like less than a minute so it's like ?! rude attitude
