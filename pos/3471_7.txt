This place is a dump! The girls are long past their prime and some never has a prime. I mean you actually want to give some of the girls  $$ to keep their tops ON.\n\nSo when you drive by and see the sign at the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn, KEEP DRIVING- do not stop unless you really, really want to waste your time and money.
