*Insert unoriginal get back to the kitchen joke*\n\nGreat place for groups. Wonderful decor. I ordered the Crispy chicken (picture below) Not what I expected. I thought it's breaded, fried boneless chicken. It was pretty tasty so I'm not complaining. My friend ordered spicy beef and said that he loved it.\n\nThey had a huge bowl of pork bone soup for $3.99. Sounds like a sweet deal but trust me its not worth it as it tastes like meh. Order a decent soup from their soup menu or don't order soup at all
