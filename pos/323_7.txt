Jamocha shakes, yeah! Our family was hungry and looking for something fast but a little different. We turned into this Arby's off Peoria. I knew we were going to get Jamocha shakes, but we also picked up 2 crispy chicken clubs. The bacon was lovely and the chicken was crispy and flavored acceptably. My son enjoyed his chicken cordon bleu very much. Of course, we devoured our deliciously seasoned fries. Although the bill was pricier than other fast food joints, we enjoyed our meal. Jamoch shakes are still 5 stars!
