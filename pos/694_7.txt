Overly expensive ice cream.\n\nThis place is a bit hard to find because there's a large MUNCHIES sign but nothing significant that says Melt.\n\nThey didn't allow me to get a mini scoop in the waffle cone because 'the cone is too big for the scoop.' So what? What if I like a lot of waffle?\n\nWe got the Cookie Monster and the Mint flavors, both of which tasted watered down.\n\nMelt is an appropriate name for this establishment because that's exactly what I allowed my ice cream to do after the first bite.
