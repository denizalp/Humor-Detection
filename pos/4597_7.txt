Bottiglia has a southern chic vibe, once inside you would never guess you were in a casino in Las Vegas because it didn't feel over the top like most Vegas restaurants. I appreciated that they had a live musician singing and playing guitar throughout dinner, and service was prompt and friendly. \n\nThe best part of dinner was the complimentary basket of bread. Fresh and delicious, loved the crispy Parmesan cracker. The rest of the food was mediocre: caesar salad, gnocchi, and eggplant. \n\nI would order the eggplant again but skip on the rest. Perhaps we ordered the wrong thing...
