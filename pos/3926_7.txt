The fries were too salty and the chicken can use more salt. Service however was really great. They kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and offered to get refills for us.  \n\nI love the fact that the chicken thighs were deboned. The texture of the batter on chicken was also great. It just needs more seasoning or simply salt.\n\nThe highlight for me was the Boylan soda fountain. I love cane sugar soda. You can try all the flavors and get refills. What's not to like?
