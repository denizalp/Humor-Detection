As if it could get any better!\n\nOn our last visit to The Tavern we were told that, instead of choosing our wine from a wine menu, we can go into Sportsmen's next door (pretty much in the next room accessed by a hallway), grab their wine guy to direct us to the stuff we like, check out the bottles in person, grab a bottle, have our server pour it at our table at The Tavern and get charged the Sportsmen's price.  Not even a corkage fee.\n\nEven writing about it makes me giddy.  I do love these guys.
