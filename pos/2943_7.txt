Everything here is priced about 40% higher than other subways because its near a university. The guy was outside smoking a cigarette and saw me walked in so he put it out and came inside. He rinsed one hand under some water and asked to take my order. No soap, no washing. He said he's right handed so he didn't need to wash the other......? WTF are you going to make a one handed sandwich? I left, never to return......
