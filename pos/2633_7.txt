Such a pleasant surprise finding this spot. \n\nIt's most ideal for takeout but you can dine in there as well - no frills. Location can be a parking nightmare. \n\nFood was very tasty but spicy! As someone who loves spice, I was shocked at how hot medium was...still edible though.  \n\nSimosas were good. Butter chicken roti was really good and the veggie rice dish was great. $28 fed two generously.
