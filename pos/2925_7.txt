I will never be returning.\n\nThe people are what made this establishment great-  it seems like the ownership has lost all of their great staff.\n\nIn my first review I could not stress how great The staff were..  After the loss of Ian and Gus., this is now a one star star establishment.\n\nI will never return... the food is mediocre at best.
