Lucky to have pearly whites and remain 100% cavity free with the help of Dr. Taylor's office. Biltmore dentistry located in the heart of Phoenix. Been a regular patient for years. Satisfied with the friendly staff and service I receive every time I visit. \n\nNever had any problems setting up my six month appointment or billing with my insurance company. Definitely a family friendly practice that operates very smoothly.
