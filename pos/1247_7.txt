I really don't get all of the 5 star reviews. This place has good food but their prices are  astronomical. I had a $35 dollar lunch with my son. I had a lamb shank and he had a chicken wrap and we had some hummus.\n\nThe lamb was good but very puny as far the meat goes. So if $17 lunches per person  are in your comfort zone, then party on!
