This Walmart Supercenter is much like the other supercenters with a slightly different layout. Typical Walmart quality with Walmart prices. I stopped in to get a couple items and this one was in the area. Being unfamiliar with this store I began searching for the correct aisle. Wein a few minutes a sales associate offered assistance. There is ample parking and short checkout lines.
