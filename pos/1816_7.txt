First impressions are hard...\n\nThe people were nice the burger was shit. The fries seemed fresh cut but were dripping with grease. No combo's only ala carte items. BURGER, previously frozen cheap ass burger with cheese, flat grilled with no seasoning (that I could detect) The bun lettuce and tomato were good. FRIES nice flavor, nice fresh cut NOT nice greasy greasy... and  Mr PIbb all for $6.17
