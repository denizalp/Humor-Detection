Yesterday, at three, I found out that I have to travel on Monday morning. I noticed that BB was open until 9, called, and they could accommodate my timing. \n\nI decided to donate 8 inches of hair to Locks of Love (See photo). I was nervous. Daphne took excellent care of me - thank you! The cut and style look so good.\n\nFrom the warm greeting when I entered, the attention and care I was provided was top notch.
