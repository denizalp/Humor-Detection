First of all, I'm posting this for someone else, as I am male and thus don't get pedicures no matter what. But my partner is enthusiasticallly in love with Tina's Nail & Spa. The large staff is friendly but not over-talkative, which contributes to the relaxing and peaceful experience some enjoy during their pedi. The prompt service and quality of work is great. The four basic pedicures received have all lasted longer than at other spas.  Tina's is GREAT!!
