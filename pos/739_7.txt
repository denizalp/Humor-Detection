Mmm.... have a previously mentioned my affection for margaritas? Okay, I love em. So i was just here tonight and to my surprise and delight i discovered Margarita Thursdays for $3.49!! Mmmm..... limey & frosty..... *drool* (very limey btw!)\nWe also had nachos, pretty good. Could be cheesier. The chips were kinda weak. The sweet potato fries were pretty good. Not to die for, but good. The chipotle mayo was great though!\nOh ya, i almost forgot... um... $3.49 Margaritas Thursdays. Yes.
