A bunch of us scientists are here in Scarborough for a conference and decided to check out this place for some food and drinks. Before the night ends, we were given the check and someone wrote \"gays\" as the customer name in the receipt. Totally unacceptable.\n\nWe confronted the server and she act like she doesn't know who wrote it. Avoid this place.\n\nUnacceptable and homophobic.
