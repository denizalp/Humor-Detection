Maybe it was a bad night...\n\nThere is a lot to choose from from an Asian food stand point. DO NOT come here if American food is on your agenda. My family and I came on a Tuesday night around 530. The place was basically dead... \n\nThe service and people were nice, but that's not enough to make me come back... EVER!
