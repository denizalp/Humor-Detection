Galleria Mall gets 2 stars because it's a quintessential example of those ugly 1970s malls that litter all of Toronto. If you are in desperate need of a dollar store, a no-name electronics shop where you can get no-name knock off electronics, phone cards, cheap polyester clothing, and things in this vein, the Galleria is the place to be.  It's also worth a trip to watch degenerates try and by liqueur at the LCBO. (This has happened everytime I've been -- though I may have bad luck.)
