This is the first time I was disappointed here. This used to be the absolute best for breakfast. The food this time was very bland, barely room temperature, and the stations were not very clean. The yogurt machine was not freezing properly. The eggs Benedict tasted odd, like cleaner. The breakfast potatoes were very dry and bland. It was super disappointing and I don't think we will be back. The server was very good and kept our drinks refilled. But food wise, nothing was good, just eh.
