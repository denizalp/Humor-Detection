We booked a flight about 3 wks out for Las Vegas during the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.  It was cheaper then Southwest with better flight times available.\n\nI will say, the plane was nice & clean.  And it was cheaper airfare.....BUT they nickel and dime you. \n\n$35 carry on\n$50 luggage- 40lb limit!!\n$3-10 seat selections\nNo free drinks or snacks\n\nThat being said- we'd have flown Southwest for the same cost.\n\nBut like I said- they had better times available & non stops.  \n\nSo you decide.
