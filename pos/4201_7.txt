Great food; insane service.  I mean, Jimmy is engaging, but also kind of scary.  Who is that friendly all the time?   The portions are big, prices are small, and the deli has tonnes of specialty mediterranean items (if you are looking for rosewater or mysterious canned goods with only arabic writing).  You can buy hookahs & shisha too.  \n\nBut seriously: try the falafel, shawarma or donair if you're into beef.  This place is a gem.
