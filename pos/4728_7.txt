Love this place!  If you need something, they will get it for you. Kudos to Total Wine for bringing in Firestone Walker 805! \nStaff is very knowledgable and friendly. Prices are fair. Rewards program gives you coupons to your email, very handy.\nWine tastes everyday... will have a distiller on occasion...nice if you want to talk to them.  \n\nSelection and availability...\nWine - A+\nBeer - A+\nScotch - B+\nBourbon - B-\nSake - D- \n\nThe only problem is location - they are 5 mins from my house...Not good for the bank account!
