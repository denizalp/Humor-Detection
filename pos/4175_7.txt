I love Hob Nobs! I've been downtown for about a year now and go there often, there sandwiches and salads are delicious...  I love vito's favorite, mmmm!\nThey have life music, art from local artists for sale...\nEveryone there is always very friendly, free wi-fi, a nice cozy setting.\nCamel macchiatos are yummy as hell, go get one! I'm pretty sure they even have pizza! (Not that I would recommend combining the two!)
