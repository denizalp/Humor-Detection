This little place is great!  I just tried it today with friends of mine at lunch...it's a cute little cafe and they bake all their baked goods...I only had the little red velvet cupcake but the frosting was delicious and the cake was so moist...the bread pudding looked awesome too but I didn't get to try it,,,I had this amazing fresh salad with chicken, blue cheese, avocado with a balsamic vinaigrette...it was awesome!  I wanted to try the thai chicken wrap because it looked yummy...I cannot say anything negative it was great!  I will be back!
