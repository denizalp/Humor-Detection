Affordable and tasty.\n\nLove that the bakery is neat and clean. Employees are friendly and quick. A nice selection of baked goods. Grab yourself a tray and tongs. Pick your items and pay at the cashier. \n\nIt smells so good in here. We were able to try a couple of things, everything tasted great. Prices are slightly higher than other bakeries around, for good reason though. Flavor is there and it's all fresh.
