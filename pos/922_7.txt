This place was alright.\n\nIt's super pricey, but to be honest, I don't think it deserves the steep price tag.\n\nYou can get crazy fancy stuff here like bone marrow (not my cup o' tea but hey...you can get it). \n\nI got a veggie burger, and while it was branded with the letters \"BG,\" it just didn't stand out too much otherwise.\n\nDinner for three was about $200. Yet, the place is in a shopping center.\n\nIf you wanna impress a snooty person, bring them here. Otherwise, Red Robin has a similar tasting veggie burger for 7 bucks.
