This small Ukrainian\/Serbian restaurant is located on the corner of Rainbow and Flamingo on the South Eastern side. It has a nice patio.The interior is a little darkish and smoking is allowed inside, so if it bothers you you can enjoy your food outside. The service is pretty good and the food is tasty. If you are a fan of European or Serbian food, you're gonna like this place for sure. This is the only Serbian restaurant I've ever been, so I can't compare it with another.\nOverall it's an interesting  ethnic  food, something  different, worth a try...
