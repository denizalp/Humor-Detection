Compounding pharmacy in Summerlin.  Nice size store next to the French Bakery. My doctor called in my prescription and when I called to see if it was ready they said they would text me and they did.  They have a private room for consultation unlike regular pharmacy's where the whole world can hear what the pharmacist is telling you.  However, on this day they were a bit busy and I couldn't wait for consult.  They told me to call back at my convenience to speak with a pharmacist and I did.  Nice and friendly service!
