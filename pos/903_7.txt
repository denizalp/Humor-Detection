Wow, best bakery I've been to in Calgary. I ate my fair share of bread and pastry in France, and this definitely stacks up. De-effin-licious, best $3.50 Danish I've ever eaten.\n\nIf you can tolerate the hipster quotient, and the smell of the organic food store, then you will be blown away by the deliciousness.\n\nDefinitely try it, try everything, I plan on it.
