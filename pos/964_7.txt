I went here on a Saturday afternoon to get a waffle cone and some ice cream. Order some vanilla with some chocolate chips mixed in with a waffle cone. The guy starts putting it in a waffle bowl...I'm like hey...I wanted a waffle cone. He says ..well we dont have any. What? Why? Can you make some? I will wait. No he says ...the bowl is the same price. Fine !! The bowl was stale and I was pissed....shame on you Cold Stone !!!
