One of my new favourite bars in the East End. It's essentially a coffee shops meets bar. The best part about it is the ginormous patio which is really rare to find in the city. \nAnd then when you find yourself quite intoxicated at 2am on the weekend here.... you find yourself drifting towards muffins. Smart.
