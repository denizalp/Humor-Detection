I will drive an hour out of my way just to get my hair done by Jinia Root!  She is simply the best.  She has a creative eye and know what styles work with the right shaped faces.  \n\nShe cut and colored my hair.  My cut was fantastic and my color was the best I've ever had.\n\nMake sure you go to her!! :)
