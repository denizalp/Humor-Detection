I was expecting a greasy burger like I had in Austin! So, that was disappointing but I guess it makes it healthier. We ordered the jalapeno cheese burger and a regular cheeseburger.  They reminded me of a big MacDonald's cheeseburger. Service was great and they bring out a tray of sauces with your meal. The fries were ok. And there wasn't a restroom inside the facility.
