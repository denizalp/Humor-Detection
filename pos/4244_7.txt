Crowbar is one of those small, cozy bars that are just fun to be at. \n\nCame out for a St. Patty's Day karaoke night this Saturday night, and had an absolute blast.  \n\nThis location is a little small, but it has ample seating for its size.  \n\nKaraoke was a blast!\n\nThe best part of the night, though, was the staff.  \nKrista (Crysta?), Angela, and Anthony were absolutely incredible.  They poured good drinks, and were friendly and personable, singing, dancing and taking pictures too.  \n\nI will definitely be back, especially since its within stumbling distance for me!
