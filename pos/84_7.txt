For it doesn't sell alcohol!!!!!!!!! Amazing! Although I don't know how long they will keep that policy in this store. As much as Walmart is hated by many, I'm still glad to find part of my country here. YES, walmart gives jobs back home. \n\nDon't expect to find the variety of the real big Walmarts, this is just another one.
