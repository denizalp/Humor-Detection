What a gem in the middle of historic downtown Cleveland! I thought it was a simple monument- however it had 4 sides to the monument with different statues and even an inside.\n\nThe inside contained tons of historic artifacts dating back to the civil war. The best part about everything was that it's FREE. \n\nTotal time spent here was a little over 30 mins and l would definitely recommend as a quick pit stop in between museums and other things to do in downtown.
