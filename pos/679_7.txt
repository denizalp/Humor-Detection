Could this place be any cuter?  Seriously, what an amazing new place - great atmosphere, friendly staff and an absolutely tasty London Fog = perfection!  I can't wait to come back and try some other drinks and buy some of the luxe sugar cubes too - beautiful and such a nice gift for my tea loving friends.
