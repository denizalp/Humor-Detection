3 words...Pulled Beef Fries!!! These were one of the delicious items on their happy hour menu and they were amazing. Perfectly cooked shoestring fries covered with pulled beef in an amazing slightly sweet and smoky sauce with wasabi creme fraiche...mind blowingly good!  There are also sushi, beer and sake specials. The service was fantastic and the restaurant is beautiful. I would make the 4 hour drive to Vegas just to get these fries again!
