The reason I tell people to stop at the dark, woodsy Yosemite hotel-like Silverton on their way INTO or OUT OF Vegas is mostly due to the must-see Outdoor World\/ Bass Pro Shops connected to it.  (It's amaze-testicles, and it has a shooting gallery).  Having done well at double deck blackjack my recent visit (ooh a black chip!? dang)  I can recommend the table games.  Until I lose.  Oh, and there's a fake apple scent in the casino floor-- it's strong, but it cuts the cigarette smoke, aka Las Vegas' Official Smell.
