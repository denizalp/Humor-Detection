The place to go if you're looking for something for an event that would make your parents disown you. Everything from hot Halloween costumes, shoes, club attire, poles, pasties, handcuffs, you name it. One stop shop for a crazy NYE party! Miaro (super sweet girl with black hair & bangs) was absolutely a doll, immensely helpful and on point. Welcoming 2015 like a walking glowstick hey-o!
