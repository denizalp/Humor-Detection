It's not cheap, but it's convenient. I just needed one pharmacy item and they had a good selection of them. Easy. And with my member shopping card thingie, I saved about ten percent.\n\nThe store is clean and well organized and I like that the floor isn't boring tiles but is a nice high-gloss fake wood style.\n\nEasy.
