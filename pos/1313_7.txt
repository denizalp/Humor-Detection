The customer service here is above all else! I've never had such friendly personal service before! We were greeted promptly and  enthusiastically! We had garlic knots first and they were amazing, great little bites full of flavor. We had the deep dish pizza, half white, half red and it was fantastic!! I love it both ways! We also had cheese garlic bread and Zepolis that were as delicious as everything else!!
