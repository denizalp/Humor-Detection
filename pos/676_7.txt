Owner is rude and manager Amanda does not return calls.  They owe me $500 for an item I did not pick and they are refusing to issue credit to my credit card or another order I already paid for.  Prices are also absurd and they act like you are a bad person if you ask for a discount when buying thousands of dollars worth of clothes!  Go to Nordstrom Rack, far superior service and prices that are 50 - 80% less than Gregory's!!
