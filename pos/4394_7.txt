Quick and budget friendly for small eaters like me.\nThis is the place I stuff my face in between breaks from work.\n\nbacon, cheddar and potato pizza is my fav.\n+ jones creme soda (my fav creme flav soda)\n= my ideal meal.\n\nI had this every day, and I work 5 days a week lol.\nStill not sick of it yet.\n\nStaff is fast and usually friendly.\n\nOne of the employees Carlos provides good customer service and is very courteous.
