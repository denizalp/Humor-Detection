This place, located inside the Venetian was decent and easy to find in this huge property. I had the beef taco salad, my wife the chicken. The beef was a bit chewy but acceptable. Think Chipotle only costlier. Too many other choices for a repeat visit while here though. Just a convenient bite to eat someplace after checking into our room, and needing to satisfy our nagging hunger pains.
