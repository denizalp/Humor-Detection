Beautiful hotel.  Stayed here on a Saturday and Sunday night and got super lucky on the price.  A room on the 7th floor with a queen size bed, couches, kitchen with fridge, all for $60.  I think we got it through priceline or something, but that's an incredible deal.  \n\nIt also comes with free internet and a free breakfast buffet, that actually has some pretty good options.  At this price, definitely would come back!\n\nWhen you pay $60 a day for a room, asking $35 a night for parking is pretty ridiculous...
