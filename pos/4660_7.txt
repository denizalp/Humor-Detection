It doesn't seem like this place opened that long ago, but our condo and the furnishings within were definitely starting to show signs of wear. Also saw several places around the complex where pieces of the styrofoam building trim had been knocked off and not fixed\/replaced.\n\nMy biggest complaint at all WorldMark locations is the lack of free in-room WIFI.\n\nGenerally, the grounds were in good condition, but the highlight of the facility is the lazy river. Great setting to relax.
