Zippy Shell was horrible! They have terrible customer service, misled us on what size container would fit our belongings, verbally told us one thing and did not honor that. Because of their terrible service, we ended up having to rent a Penske truck and driving our belongings across the country. We lost a great amount of money because they were unwilling to make things right or refund us what we paid. I would stay far, far away from this company.
