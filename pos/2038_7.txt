All I have to say is, if you go to this gas station, get in and get out. And don't look at anyone in the eyes! I witnessed this gas station getting robbed!  \n\nOk, so it was just a \"beer run\" (this guy went to the beer case, then RAN out the door) ... but I had more than my share of excitement for the day.
