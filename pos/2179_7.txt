The service was good and we were greeted and seated right away.\n\nThe miso soup was not very good. It was sweet and had a weird flavor.\n\nIt wasn't the tastiest sushi I've ever had, it was just OK.\nI had the yellowtail roll, crazy tuna roll, and caterpillar roll. They had a decent selection of Japanese beer, which was good.
