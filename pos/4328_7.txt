LVAC, please tell your front desk staff that this morning included two staff members, a trainer and a manager to please be slightly friendly upon members entering.  Would a smile or a \"hello\" kill you?!  Not one word or even eye contact from anybody even after checking in...C'mon guys, I know Trump is President, but life isn't that bad.  Perk it up a bit!!
