My gal and I have become regulars at this place.  As a rule we enjoy day drinking so the 11 a.m. happy hour on draft beer suits us perfect.  On weekdays we have the place to ourselves until about 3pm.  The kids that work the day shift are very friendly with fun personalities.  \n\nCan't say anything about the food because as of late I restrict my calories to drink.
