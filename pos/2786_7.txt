This restaurant is located in a not so good looking strip mall. When you enter inside its not much different. This is a very humble restaurant but with very good food. The service is also very good. \nTheir main dishes come with your typical Korean sides, which are all very good.\nWe ordered the combo which comes with three different types meat. We also had the Bi Bin Bab, which is served with chicken broth. \nBoth dishes were very good, and as I mentioned before the customer services is also outstanding
