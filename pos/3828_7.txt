Enjoyed all the food we ordered Especially my lobster pasta yum!!!!! Have stayed at the signature a hundred time and never tried Wolfgang Puck's. Evan tho the waiter forgot our appetizer and didnt get it till our food came i still decided to give it 4 starts. However the restaurant does need another $. Our bill came out too $150 for 4 people and thats with one beer
