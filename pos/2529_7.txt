Personally preferred the OLD Duffy's..\nLate 90's it was a true DIVE bar.  Lot of dealers, drug issues, pinball machines, cheaper\/skunky beer.  Owners would change over every few years.  Peter was the best server you could meet (Fri and Sat nights).  Jimmy the best bartender, EVER.\nThe area has gentrified; the drugs\/pros pretty much all evaporated into hipsters and other boring people.  The old sign was fantastic and unique, now it's an average pub, the interesting regulars all gone.  Nothing special anymore.
