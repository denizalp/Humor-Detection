Gracie is a very popular Italian restaurant. The wait for this restaurant is always minimum 30 minutes unless you have supper at 5:30pm. The service is good, staff is friendly and their food is superb. I had the mussels in white wine and it was delicious. I highly recommend their pastas as they are all very good! If you don't like to wait for a spot, this restaurant is not for you because it is ALWAYS busy.
