At 2:00 AM after countless drinks it is wise to eat before crashing. And quick service and reliable food with limited discussion counts.\n\nThe place has a huge line at all hours and is in the hyper trendy new food court. Great vibe, abundant people watching and good lighting. CLEAN!\n\nEnjoyed a loaded crispy yard bird sandwich, medium pomme frittes and diet pop. Delicious!\n\nBonus was making a frisky friend!
