I have to say that when my dog jake, hears me say camp bow wow he gets all excited.  Everything time I am on my way to take Jake to camp bow wow, jake my dog is barking and carrying on as if I am not driving fast enough to get him to camp bow wow.  I refer all my friends to bring their pets to camp bow wow.
