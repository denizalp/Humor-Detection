Don't bother even registering to this gym or any other Blast Fitness gym. Place is boring! Doesn't have the vibe of encouragement to go back everyday and workout. I had been a member for a year and i pay $20 monthly and they just charged $50 for annual fee, but i only went there 2 times. So if you're considering going this gym, please give your self a favor save your money or spend it to a better, well maintained, upbeat gym.
