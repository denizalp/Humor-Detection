Well ya tried to destroy another potential Superbowl appearance, didn't ya, guys? \n\nGuys?\n\nThere was no legitimate reason why you couldn't have shut out The Jets. One could argue that this is why there's a Steeler Nation; the idea that our games are generally exciting, but Jesus Christ, gang!!!! \n\nThanks yet again for giving me indigestion. My stomach LOVES the stress you guys induce. Let's hope you don't crack up against The Packers.
