After a long day of working with bothersome children, I sought out for a satisfying dinner. This is exactly what I found. My experience began with timely service and a cordial waiter, who suggested some killer Mac N' Cheese Bites! The \"Bites\" were delicious, whereas the wings were simply average. The wings weren't exotic, nor unique, nor anything that exceeds mediocre. However, my overall experience warrants a solid 4-star rating. If I ever find myself meandering along Aurora Road, I will be sure to stop by again!
