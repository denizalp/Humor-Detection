we  called  about  a  washer  making strange  motor   noises  and  leaving oil  on the  floor.  they  came  and  diagnosed  a  bad  motor,  said  it  would  be  $300  to  fix  and  it  would be  better  to  order  a  new  machine .  went to the  store,  found  a  floor  model  at  a  very  good  price. new  machine  install   went  flawlessly; their  install    people  were  great. i will  never  go to a  big box  store  again  for  appliances.
