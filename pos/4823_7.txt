Having just tried the peanut butter and jelly ice cream at Blvd Creamery, I got the same there here to compare (and because i really love PB&J) Yes, it was amazing, while not as rich as at Blvd, it was still fantastic.\nI preferred the service here, as well as the selection and the prices are a bit lower.\nI even got myself a cute shirt here, my son found some goodies, great addition to the strip!
