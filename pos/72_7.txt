A mishap with my stylist landed me in this multicultural salon and thanks to Arshanna (taking me as a last minute appointment) I didn't have to walk around with a hat on for the rest of the weekend:-) I was in and out in no time!  They use a variety of product lines and can accommodate all hair types. Thanks again Arshanna, my blowout was fab!
