Scary place...friendly service and patrons. \nBeen here at least 10 times and every single time some other patron starts up a conversation.\nIf you don't want to be social, don't go here. \nFood is good, prices are good, atmosphere is dark and sometimes very loud, but overall, a nice neighborhood watering hole.\n\nIts always packed, so they must be doing something right.\n\nBTW- don't park nearby where the amateur drunk patrons can side swipe your brand new truck and then just drive-off like the chicken-sh!t worthless scumbags they are.
