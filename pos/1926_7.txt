Old school hand wash with hoses, rags, and good old-fashioned manual labor.  $9 inside and out.  Want some tire dressing?  That's a 3 dolla holla extra.  Nice, hardworking folks work there and they appreciate tips.  Located next to a sketchy market so I recommend you stay in your car until you pull it inside just to make sure someone doesn't jump in your car and drive off in it...
