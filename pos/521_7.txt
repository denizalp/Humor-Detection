I WILL NEVER RETURN HERE!!!!!\nToday's my birthday. I never write bad reviews unless something serious takes place--check my profile!!! \n\nWe made reservations at 6 PM this evening. We arrived around 5:57PM. We were seated right away. \n\nA woman approached and poured my fianc√© and I a glass of water. She said \"our waiter will arrive shortly\"----15mins!!! NO ONE SHOWED!!!! Seriously! I've heard nothing but positive reviews about this place. I'm very disappointed with the service here!
