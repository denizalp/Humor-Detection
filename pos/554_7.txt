After my last post, I got an automated call saying I had missed a scheduled appointment (wut? Lol) Got a call today saying my insurance flat out denied my botox coverage. I was referred to their assistance program since I can't afford to pay the cash price of $1000 every 12 weeks. Thanks for stringing me along another week guys! Guess it's really time for a new office now.
