We come to this GE, one that's been doing battle with the nearby Shop 'N Save for years, fairly often. The store itself is clean and manned by friendly, knowledgeable employees. This isn't as exhaustive as some of the more ornate Giant Eagles in the metropolitan area, but they have the requisite deli, meat department, and seafood section as well as loads of fresh produce and everything else you've come to expect from the venerable supermarket chain.
