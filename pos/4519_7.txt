The best deal when it came to rent a car. I reserved an ECONOMY CAR. They did not have one available and wanted to give me a free upgrade to a SUV. I declined. It took a good 30 minutes for them to give me a COMPACT which was OK. But still, I chosen an economy car because of the gas\/milage savings. Anyway, we got on the road, and it was all alright.
