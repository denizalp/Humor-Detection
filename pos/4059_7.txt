I love Mexican food and this hole-in-the wall has some great and simple stuff! Not fancy, but one of the best bean and cheese burritos I've ever had- their homemade tortillas are OUT OF THIS WORLD! I usually get a bean and cheese burrito and my husband gets a mixed burrito of chicken and steak and loves it. The only reason for the docked star is because of cleanliness...this place could use a good wipe down!
