Been going to this Vons since i was in junior high school. Like all Vons the staff are friendly and they assist you in any way they can. This Vons is located on Pecos and Windmill. They pretty much have everything i need at Vons.  For all you bakery snobs their bakery section is pretty good. I was at a graduation once and i had their cake and i would have never guessed it was from vons!
