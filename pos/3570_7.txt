Probably the ice cream place where you get the most bang for your buck. Unlike Toronto's Sweet Jesus, La Diperie is actually affordable and you don't have to worry about your wife going into labour while waiting in line. \n\n Size wise they got everything but the kitchen sink. From \"Mini\", to \"Petit\", to \"Normal\", and \"Grand\" -- they got all the shapes and size that'll satisfy your weirdess ice-cream fetishes.\n\nP.S. size \"Grand\" aka \"Big\" is not even that big compared to \"Normal\" said my wife. At least, that's what she said ;)
