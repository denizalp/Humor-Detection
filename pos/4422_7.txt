I first have to say that I love Miss D. She is so sweet with a little sassiness! Very pleasant person.  The two negatives about this restaurant are price and wait time. I got the small potato with bbq chicken and veggies at the tune of $12.  Wow!  And the wait?........................waiting......waiting.....waiting....30 minutes later......LOL\nThe potato was good but I'm not sure I will return due to the wait and price.
