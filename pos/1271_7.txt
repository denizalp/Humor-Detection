Made reservations for our Vegas trip months ago, and when we landed and went to pick up our rental at EZ Rent a Car, they said they had NO CARS LEFT. We weren't the only customers disappointed.. Several other people were sent a counter down to Payless  where we were forced to pay at least a couple of hundred dollars more than expected. This was an incredibly unnecessary inconvenience to our family trip. NOT HAPPY.
