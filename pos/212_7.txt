We have been dealing with Casablanca Express for several years, over 10 years now, and for several years we have been taking for granted their good services. When we recently encountered a problem we had the pleasure dealing with Julio, one of their reps, who was very helpful and proved that Casablanca Express cares about their customers. In fact we were surprised how quickly Julio resolved what we perceived to be an issue. I wish that customer services of other companies (including one I am working for) were so caring about their customers.
