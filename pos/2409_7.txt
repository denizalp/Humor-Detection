To all the people bitching and moaning that the place isn't pretty or that their sandwich was not grilled before their eyes to their exact specifications... It's a DELI not THE W! Take your bourgie business elsewhere, you're getting pretentious all over my delicious sandwich.\nFresh, delicious bread; quality and flavorful meats; and just the right amount of condiments. You will not find a dry or drowned sandwich in the place (unlike subway, whose sandwiches swim in mayonnaise).\nIf you come here expecting the Royal treatment, don't come here. But if you come here expecting a delicious 'wich, welcome home!
