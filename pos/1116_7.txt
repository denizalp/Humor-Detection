So earl of sandwich was touted as some high and mighty sub shop, but I've gotta say, it was like walking into an express version of Quiznos with less options, and it was super duper slow and disorganized;\n\nThe bread was crap, the ingredients were crap, the sandwich was more like hurl than earl.\n\nLammmmme!
