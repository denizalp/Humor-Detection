Eh!\n\nWe ate here for brunch since it was free with our hotel stay. The food was not good. It was absolutely disgusting. Food was dry, had no flavor, and looked like it was sitting there all day, I'm just glad we didn't pay for it since was free! Your better off going to a fast food joint down the strip.
