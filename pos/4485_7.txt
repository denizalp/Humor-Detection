Agreed with Susan W.  Disappointing.  It took 5-10 minutes to be acknowledged by the wait staff.  It was the first Thursday of Jazz Festival, however the restaurant was not even close to full capacity, in fact, it only had a few tables when I arrived.  I ordered a Sapporo beer and a Crevettes Cary Rouge (Shrimp - Red Curry).  The sauce was okay, but the dish was average at best.
