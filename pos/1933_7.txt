Stopped in for Brunch.  Some interesting items on the menu and a lot of different style  burgers.  Ordered the Brisket hash.  The brisket was little cubes on top of the shredded potatoes with some red pepper and an egg on top.  The hash was good and enjoyed the flavor of the brisket.  A side of toast with apple butter came with the hash.
