This theater seems very outdated. The concessions a bit confusing - where do I order and where do I pay? Where do I get napkins and straws?\n\nThe seats are old, uncomfortable and stiff. My family and I watched a movie here about a couple of weeks ago. We came home with red bumps on our arms and legs - sure enough they were bedbug bites! Nasty!\n\nThe people that work here are nice and that's the only thing positive about this place.  But I'll never come back. This has been the worst movie-going experience I've had.
