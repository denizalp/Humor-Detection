Hubby went here last week. Cut wasn't great. He won't be back. Freebies of massages and shampoos on first visit but then they try to sell you products etc. Can't anyone just listen, give a haircut like they are supposed to and it look good and go home? Guess not. Can't wait for his hair to grow out so he can go somewhere else and get it cut like it is supposed to look.
