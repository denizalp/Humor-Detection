Came here with a friend looking for some EDC apparel   \n\nCrystal at the front counter was very rude and immediately blurted out across the room that she'll need some ID   \n\nIt's an 18+ establishment.   I'm 34 and the person I was with is younger but was very obviously over 18.  \n\nWe went and dug her birth certificate out of the trunk and we're turned down again immediately without even looking at it.   Apparently they don't appreciate business here
