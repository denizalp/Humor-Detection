Read Sarah A's review for all the details and specifics. Basically I'm gonna make this a Cliff Note review.\n\nChapter 1 - The Buildup\n\nAbout 15 minute drive from the Strip.\n\nChapter 2 - The Climax\n\nDelicious Mexican ice cream, desserts, drinks, and various munchies. Large selection of flavors. \nI ordered Guava ice cream and it was fruity-scrumptious!\n\nChapter 3 - The Wind Down\n\nCheap and friendly staff\n\nThe End
