My husband was working in our yard and some \"dude\" approached him doing the hard sell on a new windshield that wouldn't cost us ANYTHING! Ha! what a joke! \n\nWe live in a community with an HOA and solicitation isn't allowed. I contacted my HOA hopefully they contact the company and let them know they aren't allowed to approach us at our home. \n\nRude ... just RUDE!
