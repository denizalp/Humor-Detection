3.5 or so\n\nI like Chino. I always have. YET I have only been there about 6 times in my life. It is just something I do not crave. \n\nI had Jade Red Chicken. It was mildly spicy but still had a little flavor. The white rice was cooked perfectly. The snicker doodle was the highlight. \n\nService is always great and the place still can use some cleaning.
