I cannot actually review the service because my phone call went unreturned. I left a voicemail for Adreanna last Wednesday asking for an appointment for a basic manicure for the next week. It's Monday and I'm still waiting for a call back. I've been in the customer service industry for many years and the service starts before ever setting foot in the door. I hope business is going so well for this place that they can afford to turn away a potential regular.
