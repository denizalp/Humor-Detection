Excellent restaurant. Fine dining experience. They start your table out with warm bread in a basket & drinks. We were hungry and came to eat! We chose to do the Winter menu special that included a well rounded taste of everything. Our selections included the following: Ceviche that came with a navy bean \"hummus\", it was delicious! The rest of the dishes were outstanding: Lobster pasta, tomato salad with feta, a filet of fish imported from Portugal (I forget what it was called) and baklava, spice cake and two mini scoops of ice cream. It was all fantastic!
