Christine was the only employee working when I arrived at a busy time after work. She was able to greet all of her customers, finalize returns, complete purchase sales, and grab special orders and different sizes for people all at once. This woman needs an award!! She was absolutely amazing! So helpful and knowledgeable. She did not let the overwhelmingly busy store get to her. She was completely calm, welcoming, and cheerful!!! I so appreciate all of her help and her positive attitude.
