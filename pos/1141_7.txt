The food is just average, the best orange chicken is not from Tott's Asian Diner but from Tokyo House where the sauce tingles on your tongue. Tingles! The service was friendly and the portion size was okay. I don't understand why everyone is slapping themselves silly over this place. I'll just chalk it up to crowd hysteria.
