Hardly ever a wait.\nGood quick service.\nStaff is always in a good mood.\nI've been coming here for years. I go 4-6 months without a hair cut. Come here, give my name and phone number at the front desk. Immediately I am asked if I want a #1. It's nice to know I could come here and say \"Give me my usual\".
