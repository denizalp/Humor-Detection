Our limo driver suggested this place so we had to give it a try...\n\nI know it was probably an accident, but I found a strand of long hair in my sausage and another in my drink. Unlucky coincidence or they just hated me?\n\nI got sick and threw up a few hours later.\n\nMy French toast, bacon, and eggs tasted good but ended up clogging the sink.
