Since Rani's came to Vegas, I've never been to any other Indian store. They have an amazing range of grocery and produce items, managed by a friendly and courteous couple who will go out of their way to please.\n\nTheir kitchen is clean and efficient and provides wholesome home-cooked vegetarian food. Certainly a must-go destination for the Indian community in Vegas.
