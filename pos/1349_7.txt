An adorable little place in this cute part of town, it's decidedly casual with a large communal table and a few other areas for seating. It has a rustic charm. \n\nI got a coffee, which was brewed perfectly as well as a chocolate chip cookie. They actually had multiple types. They also had an assortment of muffins that were delicious. Great service and free wifi.
