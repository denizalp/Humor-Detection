Disclaimer: This review is for the lobby bar.\n\nI popped in for a Happy Hour with a friend, and was pleasantly surprised. Happy Hour is from 4-8pm, and all drinks and apps are half price. Skip the apps, and grab a bite to eat elsewhere.\n\nThe main event is the drink menu. Full bar, with a big selection of vodkas (Mtn Dew Vodka! among others). The bartender is very friendly, and the vibe\/decor is really cool.\n\nThis is the perfect place to hang out with a few people after work.\n\nI can't wait to come back.
