I'm always in favor of supporting the small business rather than going to chains, as I had.  When I found out that the owner was going to leave the chain place to open their own business, I quickly followed.  Very pleasant atmosphere and I always get a great cut.  I don't do anything out of the ordinary, but I'm always happy.  \n\nTheir opening prices of $7.99 is definitely a bargain as well.  My whole family has switched over and it's nice to know we're helping a start up business and trying to make it in a competitive market.
