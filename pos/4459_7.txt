I drove my winter weary car here today coated by salt and dirt with dust and debris inside. I left with my car looking better than it did from a past $100 so called detailing. The charge is now $9 for hand washing and hand drying, and $4 for interior vacuuming, window washing, and dusting. Several polite men work hard for the money but Donna Summer never sang about them.  No idea why a previous reviewer found the location scary as it is just one more neighborhood in the rust belt.
