A once in a while guilty pleasure. The dining equivalent of the feedbag. Loads of food, loads of variety, always something surprising. Quantity over quality but then there are times when you'd rather have 4 Shermans versus one Panther. The buffet can get pretty busy on weekends and prices are high on weekend nights. That's probably a good thing or I might dine here every weekend.
