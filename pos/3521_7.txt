Fun, clean park that never seems too busy.  Bathrooms are kinda gross but aren't they all?  Great playground for the kiddies and the library is close too so it makes for a two-fer stop with the lil ones.  Havn't used the pool but it looks nice.  Ill have to get my speedo and check it out sometime.  Legend has it Steve L used to mack the hoes here back in the day too...
