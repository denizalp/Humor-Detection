Perhaps I shouldn't review based on one dining experience.  Still I'm compelled because the food was so good.  I had the Fool Modemas with a side of falafel.  My first time eating the fava bean dish, trying to talk myself out of going back for more right now.  The falafel was the best I've eatened, light, crispy delicious. Why am I torturing myself... getting my keys.   Be Peace!
