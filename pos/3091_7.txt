I will NEVER buy from Louis Vuitton after visiting this store. Their manager, Nancy, and all their sales associates are the rudest people I've ever encountered. They incorrectly charged my boyfriend's card $1,200 and wouldn't refund it; acting like we are the criminals when they were committing a class 5 felony. I can't believe they can sell so many purses while treating their customers like garbage.  I don't want to go into too much detail because it's a long story, but trust me it has been terrible. Don't ever buy from here.
