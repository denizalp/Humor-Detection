Great corner location in a nice shopping center. The shelves are stocked nicely and have everything and more than you can ask for in a dollar store. There's also frozen food section which surprised me. Don't know why. They also have a balloon section with great options. Cashier was friendly was cashing out customers pretty quickly. That's a good thing!
