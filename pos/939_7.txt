I've dined here a couple of times for lunch. It's alright. Nothing ever stands out. And I never leave feeling like I just had a great meal. But it's good enough to actually eat it. So yeah...it's a-ok. The ambiance is more of a lower end casino cafe. The service is generally nice, but not exactly pleasant or attentive. Eh, it's all just fine.
