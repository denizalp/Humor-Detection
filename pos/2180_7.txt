I was in Vegas for the weekend, and drove by Floss...I saw that they had a great promotion and decided to jump on it...The dental office was amazing, the nicest one I have ever been too. All the equipment was brand new and they even had LCD flat screens facing each chair. Pretty awesome if you ask me...Dr. Tounian was kind and caring...  I definitely recommend this place to anyone in need of dental work.
