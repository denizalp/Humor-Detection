Pretty cool park, up in the North West. Even though it is packed with suburban moms with nothing to do with their lives but glare at you if you so ever dare to cross their lovely pinic. But you can get over that. And the fact that most people here let their dogs run off their leashes....that's a tragedy waiting to happen.
