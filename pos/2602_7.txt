Super basic airline. Plenty of add on fees but they're.l not sneaky about it, at least if you book directly. Even after the fees, it's still cheaper for me than other major airlines. \n\nOf the ten plus flights, only one has ever been delayed. And that wasn't horrible since it was a direct flight and a red-eye. So I wasn't going to miss any connections. \n\nIf you're looking to fly on a budget, and especially if you can sleep most of the flight, then why the heck not?
