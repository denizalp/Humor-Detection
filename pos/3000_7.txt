My insurance carrier is a Humana HMO and I am required to be referred to specialist. My referral was to the Shepherd Eye Center for a glaucoma exam. I called to make an appointment and was told that my copay of $25.00 would cover the complete exam, as well as the reflective exam. The caveat, I was required to pay $30.00 for the results for reflective exam. I now have an appointment with the Nevada Eye and Ear. The results of my reflective exam were with their compliments.
