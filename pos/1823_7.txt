This place is great for brunch. We came there for lunch and made reservation through Open Table. We got seated outside which is a nice change considering we dined inside a lot in Vegas. \n\nI had the three fish tacos. It came with Green & Red Rice and also Black Beans. Tacos were tasty. Service was good and they accept restaurant.com certificate as well. Lunch for 4 after the certificate came up to $60. Not too bad for Vegas and well know chefs restaurant. We will be back.
