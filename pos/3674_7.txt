This place is tucked inside the small alley and is not visible from the street. \n\nHuge menu selection and great tasting food. Also have ice-creams. \n\nSandwiches are named after people (allegedly KSU Alumini). I tried the Steve Harvey after accidentally ordering something else at first. Wasn't the menu's fault. I take full responsibility for it. Tasted great.
