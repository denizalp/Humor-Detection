My review is based on an entire easy, hassle-free, convenient to-go order. I downloaded the app and through other restaurant apps it already had my payment info and birthday all filled in. Cool. \nI place my order because my son and I are hungry and soup and sandwiches sound yummy for lunch. Placed the order put our shoes on, drove over and everything is set. She was extremely kind and while nagging up last minute compulsive purchases another hostess\/waiter asks if we are being helped. Love it. \nWill absolutely return for any reason.
