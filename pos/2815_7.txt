The points of difference between this Super 8 and the one on Marketview are that 1) this one has an indoor pool, and 2) it doesn't smell like mold and BO.\n\nAn underwhelming breakfast is served, consisting of a couple cereal choices, donuts, and english muffins.  Better than nothing, I guess.  There's no source of water in the building outside of the pool and faucets.  I vote for a water fountain or bottled water in the vending machine!\n\nDefinitely take advantage of online reservations.  I say this is one of the preferable \"cheap\" motels in the area.
