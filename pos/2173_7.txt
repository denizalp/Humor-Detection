I was at this restaurant when I visited Montreal a couple weeks ago. We went fairly late for dinner (around 1am) and decided to try out this place. The atmosphere was pretty dirty and the location was a bit sketch. \n\nThe food however was pretty good! I got the hot and sour soup as well as the chili chicken and was pleasantly surprised with the taste. Everything was well made and tasted good. The service was average, nothing too special but not bad either. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this location to a friend however beware of the sketchy area!
