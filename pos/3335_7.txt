I got a sandwich delivered from here on Friday that I ordered from Living Social.  I got a toasted ham and cheese with a cookie and a side of pasta salad.  The sandwich was really good and the mustard gave it just a hint of sweetness.  The pasta salad was delicious and the cookie was still warm and gooey. I would definitely order from them again.
