-food is OK; it's reasonably priced considering it's located at the heart of the city\n\n-service is atrocious--not that they're rude, but rather super slow. the iPad ordering system is unique, but faulty, especially for a big party. \n\n-food didn't come out at one point; staff blamed it on the iPad system. turns out it wasn't faulty after all; their kitchen was just slow.\n\n-never return again--not worth the hr+ wait
