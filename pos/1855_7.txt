Angie and I shared the 4 cheese ravioli, each had a salad adn bread. $16 before tip. \n\nThe meal was plenty of food for two and the ravioli was really good. The bread was awesome and the salads were fresh. My only with was for a homemade bluecheese dressing. \n\nThe staff was great. There was no wait @ 7:45 Saturday night. I liked it!
