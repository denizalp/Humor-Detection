I really wanted to like this restaurant, but left extremely underwhelmed. Menu was all misspelled.... flower tortillas?? Lousy service, my food came to the table cold well after my husband was finished with his meal. Chips are store bought (frys brand) and then transfered into a box to look homemade..... Just overall very tacky, horrible service.... Can't comment on the food because we left when mine finally got to the table cold!
