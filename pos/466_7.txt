I had to go here to get a medical exam for immigration to the US.\n\nPros: ....\n\nCons: long waits, brusque staff, report not ready on time when promised and the real kicker here folks - a clerical error that I need to get fixed in the US now, which will cost close to $ 200 USD. Thanks a lot Medisys.
