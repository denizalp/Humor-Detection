The food, decor and staff here is amazing! It really has the presence of an upscale classy restaurant with a local touch. The food and drinks are locally sourced and the quality is better than what you would expect for the price range. The owners, Lexie and Matt, are really genuine people who listen to your feedback and go out of their way so you have a pleasant experience. Try the Upscale Burger, you cant get anything like this anywhere else!
