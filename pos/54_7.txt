One of the main reasons why its hard to even think about leaving the West Coast. I love you guys, thank you for feeding my family when we are craving for deliciously grilled burgers with animal style fries and a good old cola. \n\nI mean what else is there to say? In n out has the tastiest burgers in Vegas. I'm sorry but I don't agree with the new burger places. In n out still beats em all!
