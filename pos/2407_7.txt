The whole place from the interior to the bartenders are cool. You walk in and waif in the scent of spirits.\n\nWe ordered the Gringo, made with horchata, OSF honey liqueur, topped with freshly grated cinnamon and nutmeg, and Honey Cap, muddled lime, honey, and lime juice with OSF Honey Liqueur and soda water.\n\nThey were both very refreshing on a typical hot, Wisconsin summer.\n\nWe were able to grab a picnic table outside to enjoy our drinks!
