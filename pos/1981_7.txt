I was looking for a new spot to grab lunch while at work and Yelp led me to Kiss Pollos! The Kiss salad was every much as great as described by previous reviews. \n\nThe charbroiled chicken is delightful and the lettuce, cucumbers and pico were fresh and delicious. I grabbed some spicy salsa from the bar and mixed it with the jalapeno\/avocado ranch that came with the salad. For under $9 it is a great break from the norm for lunch. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try the tacos!
