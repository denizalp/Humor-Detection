A living hell. All the workers are grouchy bitches, they're boss is some cross dresser named Baby Jane, it's nice that the owner hires mentally deficient girls, but they shouldn't be serving drinks. I think I caught the flu from some guy drinking Wild Irish rose 3 broken stools down from me. I've felt more comfortable taking a crap at the New Orleans Greyhound station on a Saturday night.
