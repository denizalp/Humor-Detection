Wow, I have no idea how MGM's buffet is getting so many awful reviews.  I went for lunch, and thought they had a great selection, with several excellent dishes.  The shrimp ravioli and a few choices at the carving station were particularly good.  Just because a buffet doesn't serve lobster tail and pan-seared quail genitals doesn't mean you can't get a delicious meal there.
