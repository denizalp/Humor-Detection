The $7 plate splitting fee is offensive, and the reason we won't come back. Our check was still $40, which is fine. But I guess the $7 is important to someone. I told the manager, and she just said, \"I'll tell the owner.\" \n\nToo bad, we live right there and we're excited to have a high end dining option within walking distance.\n\nI told everyone who would listen to avoid this restaurant as well. This is horrible customer service and we'll just drive to any of the other 20 Italian restaurants in Green Valley.
