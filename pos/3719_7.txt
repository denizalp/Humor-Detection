Sooo happy with this dealership!! I have been searching for a pre-owned Chevy Equinox and found one listed with them for a reasonable price. I sent an inquiry to the dealership and they got back with me right away. About 2 hours later, I was driving off the lot with an Equinox that I LOVE! It was already detailed and they filled the gas tank. Michael Todd was very professional, friendly and courteous. Would absolutely recommend them!
