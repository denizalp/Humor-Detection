We arrived in Las Vegas on a red eye flight; the shuttle to the rental car location was quick and pretty painless. The Hertz rental process was easy and quick.   We were upgraded to a Mustang Convertible at no additional cost!  Really a fun car to have in Vegas!  Return was just as easy as the pick up.  Would definitely rend from them again!
