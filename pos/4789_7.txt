Stumbled on to this place while I was enjoying a weekend with my Gambler Buds that were in town donating funds to the ever so fabulous Wynn Casino.\n\nLobster Eggs Benedict: A lobster breakfast dish.. Sold!! Its a good ol' fashioned eggs benedict with Lobster in place of ham. This was rich, creamy and absolutely amazing!\n\nMy friends ordered burgers and by the look on their faces and the waxed off plates I'm assuming they didn't crap out on this one!\n\nCafe Food was Oustanding , Ambiance relaxed and the only negative was the service lagged and prices weren't polite
