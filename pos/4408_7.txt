Nothing at all to do with Thai food. No concept at all, zero, just a very poor meal. Fatty beef, watery curry and I asked for my food spicy with brown rice and got bland with white rice.\n\nOne positive, free Thai ice tea with orders over $50.00. it's very good, they probably bought it at Starbucks.
