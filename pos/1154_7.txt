You know when you are hosting someone from out of town who is just a little bit better at being a cool hipster than you?\n\nTake them here. You'll look so good at food!\n\nThis place is just like your friend - effortlessly cool or at least really cool in a way that appears effortless. It's laid back looking and feeling, but the beard-per-capita game is very strong.\n\nThe food is totally good and the beer selection is pretty average for Madison (read: better than most other places).
