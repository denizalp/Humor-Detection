an oasis in the fratastic stretch known as carson street. while there are other legit (and respectable) bars on the southside, dee's has always been my favorite.\n\nthe drinks are cheap and the interior dingy but comfortable. i hang out here and pretend to miss my friends calls to meet them at town tavern.\n\ni can easily say this is the one bar i miss since moving to new york.
