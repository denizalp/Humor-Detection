Hi Monika, \nAs of today, Tim Haines (Hanes?) has still not processed the claim for the damaged\noil painting.   Is there someone else at Two Men and a Truck in Charlotte  that we can reach out to?   How about the owner.....?   Can you please have someone besides Tim contact my sister or me to resolve these issues?   Thank you kindly.
