What do I think about Allegiant??!   Next time I go to Vegas, I'm making the 6 hour drive instead!!\n\nCharge for water.....really? Up charge for carry ons...really?  Highest luggage fees in the industry....really? Giving the wife and I different boarding zones, even tough we were sitting together.... Really?\n\nNope....you made a believer out of me. I'll drive from now on
