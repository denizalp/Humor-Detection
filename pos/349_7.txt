Was a nice, well laid out store for its size.\n\nI'm not interested in the \" arcade\" side, so I didn't go there, and can't comment on that, but I did go in to buy some toys for my wife and I that we had been looking at on their website.... \n\nIt turned out they were much more expensive in the store, even with shipping, and I ended up going home to order them online.....we can wait for a significant savings.
