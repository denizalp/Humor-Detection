One of the usual South Boulevard (aka Burrito Way) Mexican restaurants, Maria's is at the corner near Tyvola. Popping in after lunch, it was quiet. Chips and salsa, as usual.\n\nI had the enchilada and taco combo, which with a drink was less than $10. It was decent and flavorful. And no different than any other Mexican restaurant north or south by a mile or two.
