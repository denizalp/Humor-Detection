it is a really cool place. Good Pizza but nothing crazy. Great for a quick lunch. \n\nJust watch out they only take debit if it is over $5. The lunch special is not over $5. DUH... raise the price to $5 stuuupid. Also if you want a cup togo ... $0.25 more. They are rude and to the point but in a Ny kinda way. \n\nThey do serve Mt Dew and have WIFI for free.
