I've been to only a handful of events here but every time the staff have always been curious, bathrooms are easy to locate, and the space is generally well laid out for each event.\n\nSpecial events parking are reasonable (we paid $7) and again, the attendants working in the toll booths have always been very pleasant.\n\nThe new Holland Pavilions at the Alliant Energy Center is a beautiful new addition with well maintained and clean bathrooms.
