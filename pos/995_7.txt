We tried this restaurant out - never heard of the chain before. We thought it was a decent place to dine. It was clean, well decorated, the food was delicious and the prices were fair. If you are really hungry you definitely want to get the large sized bowl.\n\nWe would recommend this restaurant and location to friends and family.
