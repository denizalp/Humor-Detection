Americanized carnitas. Americanized orange chicken. Refried beans and steamed rice. Put that all into a box as a combo and they call it \"fusion.\" If Trump advertised a panda sporting a thick Mexican 'stache wearing a sombrero, he'd receive hell on earth for being racist. I think it's good humor. But please be more imaginative with the food and quality.
