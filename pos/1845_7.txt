I finally made it over to Jr's. \n\nI had 3 piece cod with frys, the kids had a burger and the fish and shrimp combo. Everything was made correctly and tasted excellent. \n\nThe fish was not greasy, the frys did not taste fishy, the burger was perfect for the kid. The tarter sauce was good too. \n\nI will be back to try some more things. \n\nOnly downfall was they were out of lemons and had one bottle of malt vinegar to share in the whole place. Oh and they charge for credit or debit purchases.
