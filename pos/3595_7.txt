I went to Surrender on a Saturday night.  It was crowded and a long line, but no for bottle service.  Ordered 4 bottles and was given a table next to the DJ.  WOW!!!   What a view of the total party and this awsome looking club.\n\nYou can walk tot he back and out onto the pool, where there is more music and partying.  If you are coming to Vegas and reading this review wondering if it is a place for you and friends to party\/dance\/people watch and have a VEGAS club experience... Answer is \"YES\"    VEGAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
