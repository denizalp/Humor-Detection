The Clark Bar... Beautifully remodeled, gets busier as the night goes on... a great warm-up bar before heading out to C-Street or also an excellent alternative if you need a break from the 'only gay bar in C-U', as C-Street is so-often called.\nGreat atmosphere, good pool table, darts, cool outdoor tiki-bar and funny staff with spunk.
