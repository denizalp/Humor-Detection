After waiting in line for an hour on Wednesday at 11 a.m., I finally ate the brisket, pork ribs, and beans. The beans were great! The brisket was full of fat and tough to eat, even with the so-so bbq sauce.  Ribs were the same. How disappointing and a waste of $15.00!  Why do people think this is the best BBQ?  If there wasn't such a long wait, I'd come back for the beans only. BTW, it was nice to get a free bottled water while I waited in line. Friendly staff.
