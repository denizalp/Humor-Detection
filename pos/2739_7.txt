I was in here with a friend for lunch the other day and really enjoyed the experience.  It wasn't too hot yet so we sat on the front porch.  There was a cute stray cat that hangs around and was fun to interact with during our meal.\n\nWe started with the artichoke dip which was very good.  I also had the Acapulco cheesesteak sandwich which was nice and spicy.\n\nThey have a decent craft beer selection and happy hour prices for most of the day.
