For $40, I can't expect too much, right?  It's decent enough. Cleanish. Terrible lighting in the building, an affront to my delicate nature.  Mattress is super firm. Not bad for the price.  Just kinda 'meh'.\n\nThe more I process my night here, the more disgusted I am.  There were clumps of hair on the bathroom floor.  The mattress was like sleeping on cement.  The couch was stained. It smelled of wet dog.  Ech.
