Love this place! I've been to both Pat's and Geno's in Philly and this place is as close to authentic as it gets in AZ. They are family owned and have been around for some time. It's always busy here and popular with the locals. The cheese steaks are phenomenal and the prices are great. I always order mine whiz wit (with cheese whiz, \"wit\" onions). It's fun to look at all the pictures and news clippings from Philadelphia hanging on the wall while waiting for my order.
