Went to get a shake and requested no whip cream. The lady comes out and it has whip cream on it. She catches it before I could say anything so she said she'll be right back out. She comes back in no time at all. The surprising speed was due to the fact that she just scraped off the whipped cream... poorly I might ad. Apparently actually putting effort into fixing the shake was too much to ask.
