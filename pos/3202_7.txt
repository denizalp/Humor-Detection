This pub is far. This pub isn't great. This pub is in the same building as a sexual health clinic. This pub will get me here for Karaoke.\n\nThe servers are super friendly, the KJ is ridiculously strict with his rules and curation, and I've always had a decent time drunk singing with friends, old and new.
