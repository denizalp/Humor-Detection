One of the best places for friends to hang out or  even on a date.  Pretty large place with lots of tables. Amazing price  for both seating and food. Staff is super friendly and game master Dan (I think is his name) is very knowledgeable and patient when explaining the games. The lattes are made with cute designs. Huge selection of board games compared to other game places. I'd honestly give this five stars because the service is just awesome, but the bathroom here needs some serious cleaning.
