Best fries ever!  This location is old and needs\nSome TLC. Service can be slow and the drive thru is always backed up. The speaker is old so it's hard to hear the person when ordering. But the fries are wonderful. I will go here just to get the fries. Rally's offers some good deals with $2-3 meals. Can I get a \"Heck Yeah\". They do have some good burgers too. The BBQ burger is pretty delicious.
