The BEST Filibertos, and I've eaten at them all as well as the *berto clones.  The meat never tastes like cat unlike at some of them and it's open 24 hours, inside too!  The condiment bar is always stocked with fresh peppers, tomatoes, salsa, guacamole, etc and they actually get my orders right first try.  If you do go late you may encounter a line at the drive through because it's a hoppin place after everything else closes.
