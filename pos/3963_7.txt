This place is pretty darned good. I tried it for the first time today. I ordered take out. We got the Mongolian Beef everyday lunch special and Shrimp Fried Rice. The beef was not too spicey but was a little on the salty side. The Shrimp Fried rice was made Thai Style, curried and with a little bit of raisins. There where plenty of shrimp to go around with the rice.
