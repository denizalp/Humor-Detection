Well, while waiting in the drive thru line for many, many minutes, I've had time to jam out to some radio tunes with my one year old and sing the ABC's few times, and read Yelp reviews and even write this one. I've been to this location on occasion and they've always gotten my \"special\" order correct and are always friendly, but the lines are always slow moving. Good thing I know how to have a good time while waiting...
