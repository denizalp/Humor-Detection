Great night out to celebrate my 27th birthday. Food was amazing, the atmosphere was very laid back, but still has a high end feel. The service was fantastic. Drinks stayed full the whole time. Filet bites were the highlight of the meal followed by the cookie skillet desert. Great for groups. Check them out!
