Fashion Crimes has some wonderful finds.\nIf you can find them.\n\nThat's the whole crime of this store (ok. the awful puns stop now, I promise). Good luck walking around--dresses and racks and people are everywhere.\n\nI say this store is kinda of like the umbra of dresses. Amazing to squeeze through and look at.\nNot somewhere to go if you are seriously trying to buy something.
