This is like the nerdy perverted younger brother to BMV books on Bloor...and I say that in an endearing way.\n\nIt's nerdy because of its amazing comic book collection and old magazines and comic book guides. It's perverted because of it's wall-o-porn DVDs in the back.\n\nAnd although smaller than BMV on Bloor, its selection of books etc. is still impressive and CHEAP. Four stars, because if there's one thing I like more than porn, it's cheap porn.
