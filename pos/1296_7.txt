Great spot on the strip for decently priced booze, $5 flip flops, and all other sundries that you might need but that won't break the bank. What else can you ask for on the strip? This is the second Walgreen's that I have tried. The other was cheaper and had more options but it is still great. Try the beer cooler for a deep refreshing cheap cool-off like no other. Friendly, helpful staff and super clean.
