I been going to jp since it open. Menu are great, will try breakfast one of these days if I wake up that early on the weekend. But rest of the menu are great and portion are great compare to price. Mac and cheese,fresh chilled are great, love onion rings,parmesan French fries, most sinful are late night menu of fried peanut butter and jolley and also fried twinkie too.trust me everything are good. Too many good things too lust
