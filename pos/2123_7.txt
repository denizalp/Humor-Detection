Noodle Asia is located in the Venetian.\nPretty spiffy Chinese joint.\n\nWe ordered Cantonese Beef Stew and Curry Seafood Fried Rice. The beef was tender and seemed like decent quality cuts. A flavorful dish. 5 solid stars. The curry rice was delicious and I don't even like curry much. Booyaa. 5 big fat stars.\n\nAnother must try are the shrimp dumplings. Ooooooo. 5 stars. \n\nMost dishes are about 16.00\n\nA good dinner.
