Found myself without lunch one day a couple of weeks ago and decided to send my help out to this place.  I had the Italian beef sandwich and fries.  Total came to $7.51 with tax.  Other than telling you the sandwich was decent but not great and the fries were crisp on the outside and soft in the middle there is not much more I know.
