forget Mesa grill or even Javiers in the aria, you want a killer fish taco this is the stop for you! delicious and quick... and go for a late night snack and watch the side show of human mistakes roll through.... drunken party girls, crews of dudes with facial\/neck tattoos and mid west double wides hitting four fast food joints before the battery packs on their rascals give out.... god bless vegas,,,,
