My fiance and I came here for Valentine's Day Dinner and it couldn't have been better.\n\nWe had a great table on the beautiful patio.\n\nService was outstanding.  Attentive, kind, and fun.  \n\nThe food was incredible.  We ordered appetizers, sides, and entrees, and all of it was delicious.\n\nBe prepared to spend around $150 for a table of 2.  If you can handle that, you'll be very happy you chose to come to The House Brasserie.
