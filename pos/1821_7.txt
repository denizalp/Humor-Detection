Just unfortunate. It is Thursday night after the first ASU game of the season and a fellow alumni and I are turned away at 11pm after the ASU win wearing shorts and polos in 105 degrees. The door guy proceeded to share that we were dressed like preppies and women. \n\nThis is not the kind of service that should be shared  on an ASU game day let alone in Tempe.
