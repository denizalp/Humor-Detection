I'll never forget the first time I walked into a DSW, it was like a surprise birthday party but instead of guests there was shoes! Any kind of shoe your feet desire! \n\nIf you seek a plethora of brands, styles, and colors then hurry in to your nearest store! The staff is always friendly and willing to help. \n\nI recommend going to the far back where the discount section is. Best deals EVER! \n\nHappy shopping my friends!
