I'm not very savvy when it comes to car stuff but when my windshield wipers became so dry and cracked that rubber was just flapping around like gummy worms in the ocean tide I just couldn't ignore it. I was trying to hold out and just have the dealership replace them on my next maintenance but after the scary ride home I had during last week's rain I just couldn't ignore it anymore. The girl working helped me navigate looking up what size I needed and even came outside to make sure I put them on properly!
