I am not normally a pain-in-the-ass orderer, only at Rubio's. Because they have lots of things that I like but not all in the same burrito. So I order one burrito and make about 22 changes to it. \nThis Rubio's got it right. EVERY SINGLE TIME. And didn't give me an attitude when they did it, either! \nI love them.
