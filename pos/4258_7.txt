Everyone has their store, and this is mine. Let's be honest, I probably spend more time here than at any other retail outlet. I switch up where I get my groceries, but thanks to Ontario laws, where I get my wine, vodka and tequeezy is consistent. \n\nThis, however, is not the best LCBO. Very small, often crowded, no functioning AC (what?) in the summer. You can't get an SOP here, and they don't have any bonus late-night hours on the weekend. \n\nBut hey, they push my drug of choice, so I'm going to go ahead and call them A-OK.
