Located in Garfield. Tightly cramped doesn't really have a super huge selection of products compared to Sisters Downtown but if you're looking for your basic black hair care products definitely make a stop there. \n\n*Note* This store is a little messy but don't hesitate to ask the gentlemen who work here but I wouldn't say they are all that helpful
