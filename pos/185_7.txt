Went there around 9pm still to find people dinning, but great service and they are open until 10pm. An interesting and tasty cocktail menu. The hummus is very good and they give a good portion to share. I had the halibut and let me tell you I loveeeee halibut. This is the best I've had in Vegas for sure their sea food is fresh. The dessert menu looked amazing, but was so full from the apps and entree I couldn't bare to eat anymore. Great portion sizes! Try this gem out!!
