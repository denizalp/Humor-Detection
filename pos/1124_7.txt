Ditto all the previous reviews!!!  From start to finish this company was great to work with.  I recommend asking for Jerry.  He met with us when it was convenient for our schedule and helped us choose a great new look for our pool.  The workers were great about cleaning up after themselves and our pool looks great!  Thank you CDC Pools!!
