I live next door to this gas station (which means I'm living in poverty). I am too lazy to walk to Loblaws so I do most of my grocery shopping here. Good selection of breakfast bars and they're always stocked with my nightly dinner - chocolate milk and Big Turk. Very friendly all Indian staff; I am on a first name basis with all of them.
