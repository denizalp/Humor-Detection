I've been getting my haircut from Rose Valencia for many years now. Always consistent and caring. Sure you can be a guinea pig and go to supercuts or some other amaturer barber shop and try your luck, but like gambling in Las Vegas you are bound to lose! Don't take the chance on your looks and for $15 its a tremendous deal! Tip heavy and tip often! You'll see Rose is quite a Rose! :-)
