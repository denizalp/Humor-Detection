Very good service with a great attitude. \nPlus the food is very delicious too. Very authentic flavors with some modern twists. Highly recommend to order their chips & guacamole OMG. Very delicious too. And leave some of the guacamole to add on top of their scrumptious tacos. Add some salsa on top too for an extra kick. \n\nAs a great alternate, try their seafood enchiladas. Loaded with lobster shrimp and crab. The lobster mushroom sauce has a lot of flavor
