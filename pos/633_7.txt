Manager Mercedes is the worst manager for people that use coupons. 1 per purchase, means 1 per item!! Not 1 per transaction!! And telling me your store coupon policy changed while corporate told me over the phone you were lying about that, but that every store has the same policy. She just hates couponers... It's pretty pathetic but I won't argue there anymore. Corporate gave me a gift card to make up for the rudeness of Mercedes and they told me they would handle it. They advised me to go to another Target.
