I really wish this was attatch the the air port, but they didn't ask me.\n\nIt is a short bus ride from the airport, easy to navigate. The man who drove the bus practically demanded a tip \"Hey you'd tip your waitress!\" is what he shouted at all of us as he was slinging our luggage around. I snickered and walked off. \n\nI loved my rental car, the upgrade was free with military ID and well worth it.
