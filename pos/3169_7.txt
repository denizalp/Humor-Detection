Went here on a Sunday, Kaskade was performing.\nOur group had a lillypad for $1500 and it was average. I went between the gaming pavilion and our area all day and it never got packed like I was told it would get. This is one pool party that GA would be fine for guys. Crowd seemed to be mostly Asian. I did not have as good a time here as I did at Marquee, Liquid or rehab.
