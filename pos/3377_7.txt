Ordered two pizzas online for carryout since this was one of the closest pizza spots nearby. I was surprised at how long the line was to order but I did come around noon which is a busy lunch time. I was able to go right to the cashier to pick up my order since I had already paid online. \n\nLoved how quick and easy it was and the pizzas were tasty. I'd be back to try their lunch specials, they've got some good deals!
