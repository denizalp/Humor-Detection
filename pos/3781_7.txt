I've experienced MUCH better!\n\nI was really hopeful I'd have a great time, two stepping the night away with a nice guy who knew what he was doing.\n\nInstead I walked into a club of hipsters and frat boys and drunk chicks line dancing, I've never seen so many silly line dancxes before! \n\nI'm from Texas, I have been to almost major dance hall in Texas, and I love a good dancehall but this place was a huge disappointment for me.  I'm glad I didn't pay to get in there.
