Yesterday was one of those days. After work, I told myself, \"B*tch, you need a drink!\" So I've been dying to try the Nutella Espresso Martini at 32 Shea...this drink is fantabulous! I had two along with a Chicken Raspberry Salad. Delicious. If it weren't for a group run later that same evening I would have stayed and tried a slice of the Nutella Mascarpone Cheesecake.\n\nIt's not even Noon and I'm craving a Nutella Espresso Martini -- give me strength Patron Saint of All Things Nutella!!!!
