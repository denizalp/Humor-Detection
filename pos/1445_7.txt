This place charges you a 4% surcharge to use your credit card. I politely asked the owner about it, and he started getting all shaky and complaining about the fees. If he wants to take credit cards, he should abide by the legally binding merchant agreement he signed with both Visa and Mastercard which explicitly forbid merchants from charging extra fees for using credit cards. If the owner is going to break the rules in this instance, who knows what other rules he is breaking....like sanitation and safety rules.\n\nAdditionally, the food was mediocre at best.
