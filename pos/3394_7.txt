So impressed! I was looking for macaroons so I stopped by French Grocery last week.  To my delight, they had three different flavors, all equally delicious.  I especially like the \"Chocolate Chile.\" It's got moxie.  The staff was super nice and the owner was even there to welcome customers.  I love that the menu includes both Continental and Creole items.  I little more Paris and New Orleans in Phoenix makes everything better.
