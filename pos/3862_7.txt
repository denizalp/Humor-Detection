DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!!\nHorrible customer service. Food was inadequate and 2 handfuls of croutons was there idea of a Ceasar salad. They also argued when I asked for oil & vinegar in place of Ceasar dressing. Just a joke, not a true Italian Restaurant. I will be telling everyone I know NOT to go to Jessies.\nManager called back and did NOTHING !
