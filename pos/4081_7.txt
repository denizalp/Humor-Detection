Don't go here at 9:01 even though the signs are lit and cars are in the drive thru. The hours aren't really visible so I got caught in the drive thru waiting for the people in front of me, that was fun. There were people even behind me. The food isn't bad, just the customer service is lacking. Almost laughable that a business would turn down sales if it meant staying open for another two minutes. I would think a place like this would stay open as long as the gym across the street, same health conscious clientele right?
