Great service and I was in and out quick. The doctor was very friendly and the facility was very clean. Would definitely go back.\n----\nWent back, and this time the service was a bit slower, but again I didn't wait longer than 30 minutes.  The one thing that concerned me a little was the doctor googled my condition.  Shouldn't they know that?
