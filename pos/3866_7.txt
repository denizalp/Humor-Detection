Saturday night brings all the 18 year olds to the bar. Later and later the crowd turned pre-puberty. I'm not an ageist, it was just ransacked with uni kids. Which explains the sweetness of the cocktails. Almost too sweet apart from the Dark & Stormy was really good. The mojito would make Mexico disown the mojito. The Bourbon punch makes you want to punch yourself for making a horrible decision. \n\nThe space itself is cool and super nice for a weekday date. Hot tip.
