I have no problem being pretty ugly if it means I can hang out in this bar often. This intimate bar has it's own funk to it (the good kind) and damn I still can't get over those drinks! The decor is quirky and gave me a Tarantino-esque vibe as I sat in one of the velvety booths in a dimly lit bar.\n\nService was superb on a weekday and the cocktail menu was great! One of the cocktails I had had a really cool aromatic experience and I highly recommend you go check this local joint out!
