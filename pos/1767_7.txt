People rave about Cornerstone. I've been twice over a span of time and not visits were ok. Not at all horrible but nothing made me jump out of my seat. It's a cute place with outdoor seating and to me the food was average.  Both times I'd been there for brunch and had pancakes and eggs. Maybe I'll give it another shot during a different time of day. Maybe.
