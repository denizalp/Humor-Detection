When you don't have any friends, this park is there for you. You can play basketball by yourself, walk around, feed the birds, literally whatever you want to do. It's super clean. Walking distance from a lot of houses. Everyone is nice. You might get dirty but there's a gas station nearby to get a Slurpees and wash off. I've met some awesome people there! Also there's a dog park - so bring your best friend. Side note - there used to be a blockbuster down the road but it closer so RIP.
