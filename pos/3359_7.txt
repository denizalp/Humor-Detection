This place is overrated. Burger was dry, they were stingy with the gravy on the poutine. The cheese curds felt like i was chewing on rubber. Not to mention I seen the cook picking his ears with his fingers then touching up the buns. This place is gross!! I skipped out on whopper wednesday at BK to pay $13.50 for a shack burger and poutine. I would've had better food\/value at BK. Never going back!
