It's like going to Bullwinkles on super steroids, oh and without the cheesy robots. My first experience with water dancing shows was at Bullwinkle's, so every time I see one it takes me back a ways. This one, is cool with the Bellagio set in the background and it's free (well not free, that large chunk of change you just \"deposited\" at the Bellagio funded your \"free\" show, but hey... we'll just pretend it's free). It's a great example of over the top, huge scale Vegas in all it's glory.
