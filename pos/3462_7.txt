This place was really really good!!!!! We got the tots, calamari, huntsman burger, and the ccb. We also tried the temperanillio wine, a local IPA beer, and this blackberry Moscow mule type of drink. Everything came out in a timely manner, the interior was beautiful, and all of the food was amazing!\nMy only complaint was the soggy burger bun, and everything was a bit pricy for what it was but this restaurant is a very typical hipster restaurant.\n\nOverall I will be back to try the rest of the beer and to try everything else!
