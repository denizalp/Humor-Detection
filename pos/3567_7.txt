Hole in the Wall?  I think Sh!t hole is more appropriate.  While the server was pleasant and professional, they served my daughter sour, curdled milk.  How does that happen?  The garlic bread was stale, the wine was horrible, neither of my girls could stomach their meatballs and the salad was limp.  It was like stepping back in time... and not a good time.
