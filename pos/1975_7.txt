I so wanted to like this place, but I was not a FAN! I got the combo with BBQ pork and teriyaki chicken and chicken fried rice.  The BBQ pork was not GOOD at all, chewy and tough to eat.  The teryiyaki chicken was even worse, the sauce was a clump of jello like substance.  GROSS!  The fried rice was so soggy and the beans did not go with the rest of the food.  =(\n\nThey have a friendly staff and hurdle customers in like cattle.
