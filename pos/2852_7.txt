Giving this place 3 stars is quite generous.  The wait time for a table wasn't so bad.  We waited about 15 minutes, which is average. The wait time for getting your food on the other hand is very long.  My family and I are sitting here as I type this waiting for our order to come out and it's been at least 30 minutes.  The average rating for this place is 3.5 and that's really not all that.  The food finally came out...
