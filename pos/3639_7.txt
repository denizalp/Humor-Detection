Let me start off by saying I'm Chinese. I eat Chinese food all the time. Is this Chinese food? Hell no! Do I care?! HELL NO!!! This place is a godsend.\n\nI ordered the Jade chicken with a stuffed bellpepper and jerk fried rice. All I can say was - AMAZING. It's not a gourmet or luxurious meal that you get, but as a comfort fast food, man was it delicious!! Don't think of it as Chinese food. Think of it as heavenly food.
