It was a good attempt at Malaysian food. I had the nasi lemak. It had all the components if a traditional nasi lemak. The rice was severely lacking the coconut flavour and a bit too wet. The curry was also not spicy at all but more sweet and had a strange gritty texture, like it went through a blender. It isn't a bad place but I just don't feel it's Malaysian.
