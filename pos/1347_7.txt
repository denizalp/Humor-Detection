So, I guess I can't really hold grudges against places I go to all the time. We're in Scottsdale quite a bit because my guy's father lives over there. This Louis Vuitton is also well stocked and the sales associate are really friendly. We like dealing with Jocelyn when she's in. I haven't bumped into that rude manager since last fall. AND they give out water that have regular screw on caps now instead of the pierre with the metal cap so hopefully, no one will ever get water leaked onto their brand new purses ever again!
