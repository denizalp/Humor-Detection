I go to this thrift shoppe because I work for Hospice of the Valley who owns this thrift shoppe. M\nNot only do I get an employee discount, but every thing the store makes goes to helping terminally ill people in the community. They have a nice selection of merchandise in good condition. The price is very reasonable. I did find out that I get a bigger discount on Mondays as a senior. This is were I bring my donations and so my thrift shopping because it all goes for a great cause.
