It's a great production value with beautiful staging and wardrobe but I've come to realize there's very little cirque at these shows.  There's some tricks but it's really mainly dancing in my opinion.  If I knew more of their songs I'd probably love it more. \n\nIt's a good trip and a good show if you got a good price.  I wouldn't pay too high a price to watch it again though.
