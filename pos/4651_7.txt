This zoo is depressing. The animals looked sad and stressed and like they would rather be dead than kept in this zoo. The enclosures are tiny and not fitting to the needs of the animals nor were they clean. It's great that the goats get to be played with, but they could easily escape their enclosure and there was poop everywhere. This zoo is sad and should either make people pay to make it better for the animals or shut it down!! Animals have feelings too!!! #AnimalLivesMatter
