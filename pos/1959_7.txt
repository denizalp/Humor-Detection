Came in on Christmas Eve for the very first time. Picked up two really adorable cookies to bring as a gift.\n\nThe interior of the shop is really inviting. Feminine and trendy. The pastries and treats all look very professional. What a great little shop. Definitely coming back to try a Macaron. I've never had one, but theirs look wonderful.
