This is a tattoo spot located on the way south end of the Strip in what feels like a nearly abandoned strip mall. I walked in without an appointment was able to have an artist work on my tattoo right away. Note: Appointments are best. The front desk staff were less than friendly. But the artists are great! The studio is clean and comfy. Definitely one of the better places I've been to. I'm very pleased with my tattoo and will be coming back for more work.
