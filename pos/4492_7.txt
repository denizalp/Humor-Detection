Drinks are $7 here. LOOOOOL\nOrdered the Earl Grey Pineapple hot tea, Taiwanese popcorn chicken and Bacon Egg Spaghetti (aka faux Carbonara). \n\nThe popcorn chicken was the best dish out of the three things I ordered. It was crispy and not too oily. The drink was alright but overly sweet. \n\nThis place is pretty gimmicky, I won't be coming back.
