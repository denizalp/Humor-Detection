This is my \"go to\" store when I need auto parts\/accessories.  I come here for Gasoline Treatment, Air Filters, replacement Windshield Wipers, and other stuff.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/QgXTuzc_i8dO_p2XD7PP0Q?select=hQ6Js9srvSJuLq1KJ_7L4g\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/QgXTuzc_i8dO_p2XD7PP0Q?select=4_rjsNOrmZ2sSoV3xM0KbQ\n\nThe staff here are usually pretty cool and helpful.....plenty of parking in the lot and KO's is next door (restaurant\/bar)....what more could you ask for?!\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
