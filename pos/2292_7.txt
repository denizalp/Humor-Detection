Very Cute dining. It's perfect for a quick lunch or a dress up dinner. It would be perfect for a celebration or an intimate date. They make their foods from scratch daily and bring you bread while you wait for your meal(s). Their patio seating is really cute and very spacious as well. There is a marketplace adjacent to the restaurant where you can basically order anything off the menu at if you are in a real hurry. \n\nLoved it! It seems that the FOX restaurant chain has yet to completely disappoint!
