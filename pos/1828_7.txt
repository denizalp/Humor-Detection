Waiting an hour to eat brunch SUCKS.  But let me tell you, once you're in, it's well worth the wait.\n\nThis buffet has EVERYTHING.  From sushi to snow crab to pizza to prime rib.  It's all delicious too.  Nothing is dry, bland, or overcooked.\n\nWith that said, it's expensive so fast the day before and pace yourself when you eat to maximize your food intake.
