I have been coming in here for many years now. What is not to love~!\nI think the food is pretty fantastic!  Pizza, really good. Wings,excellant!\nSalads are freash and flavorful. \nLike how easy it is to call in an order, pick it up at the window and go.\nGood staff, the decor is a bit old fashion in an 80;s way. But, in the grand scheme it means nothing. \nI like the food here so I will be back many times!\nLots of parking in the lot as well.
