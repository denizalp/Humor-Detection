I just had the coffee - it was good, 3rd wave. The baking smelled delicious. Everything is made on the premises. A lovely space - good for working, and they have small closed off meeting rooms to rent. Local, independent beautiful working spaces in this neighbourhood is hard to come by so this is a good shout! They have a small\/ snack\/ sandwich menu from what I could see - but didn't try anything. Once I try some food, I'm sure I'll be able to add that extra star ;)
