Parking here sucks. The only reason we ever get pulled here is because Kate Spade Spams my wifes email box all year long. So anytime we are driving by here , they are just happening to have some sort of 50% sale or Buy One Over Priced Bag Get One Half Over Priced. Either way, the Parking here really sucks. If you ave an SUV you will have to find a park in the back or get scratches on your front. \n\nTIP: Check in here on YELP and get a $5 Spend Voucher for anywhere at the outlet.
