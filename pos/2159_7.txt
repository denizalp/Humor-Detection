Got tickets from Tix4tonight for tickets on the same day of the show... they seat you based on 1st come 1st served unless you upgraded & paid more $ to be seated in VIP section. \n\nGreat show for kids =)\n\nMac king was very entertaining & fun to watch. Show was a lot better than I expected it to be. =)\n\nTip: Check in on Yelp for a FREE pic & autograph by the comedian himself =)
