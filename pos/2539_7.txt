You kiss the sandwich\nIt kisses you back, with tongue,\npickles, and mustard.\n\n\n\nLove it.  This place could be a cartoon.  One of the few places in Cleve that you can get a decent tongue sandwich.  Nice deli too!  A half loaf of (still warm) jewish rye, pickles, smoked fish....  oy...I got the shpilkas...\n\nCarry on...
