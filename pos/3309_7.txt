About three minutes after sitting down, rude black female manager kicked me out for not making a purchase right away. I literally was there to check my email, and to plan out my days schedule as I would be using public transportation.\n\nThis isn't the Starbucks way - at least not in Los Angeles.\n\nAnd btw I was planning on ordering a small hot chocolate, but I don't like to be browbeaten and told that I must order something within the first three minutes of arriving.\n\nDisgrace. Stay away from this place.
