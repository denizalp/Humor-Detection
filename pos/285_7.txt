Fast friendly Service with quality burgers. Clean and healthy I consider Magoos burgers to be the best in the area. They have two sizes of patties, a chicken burger and hotdogs. Excellent fresh fries\nand onion rings. They offer ice cream and a good selection of drinks. For condiments they offer fun stuff like magoo sauce, bruschetta, and sprouts. \n\nAlways friendly and busy but they are fast and can handle any rush thrown at them. Burgers are around $5 and fries are $3
