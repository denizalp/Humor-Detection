HOLY MOLE!!!\n\nThis homesick California girl has spent a lonnngggg nine months in this beautiful city without some \"real\" Mexican food. Alas my search ended here. We started with a cold Negro Modelo, chips, cilantro, and salsa from the bar. From there, I ventured into the pork with mole sauce and a lime margarita..... All around the table were satisfied bellies!! Ohhhhh baby, we'll be back for more delicious and authentic food that is served up by a very friendly staff. Ole'!!!!! Viva el mole!!!!
