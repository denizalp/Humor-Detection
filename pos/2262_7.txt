Yeah, these are incredible, a free show in vegas!\n\nWalk into the bellagio as well for their themed seasonal lobby decorations, come through the club and catch a backside view of these fountains, it's super cool.\n\nI was completely enthralled by all the variations and dancing water.  They go on to a new song about every 30 minutes I believe and it's worth checking out.
