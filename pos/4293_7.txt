Very Mediocre and overpriced food.\nIt's riding on the famous name but I can't imagine it tasting the same.\nHostess took me to the wrong reserved table. There were too many service staff. One of them was just standing around fixing his hair and picking his nose. (No joke)\nOne of them took our tea pot for a refill and forgot to bring it back. He stood there watching a chef cut up a duck instead.\n\nI would not come back here again.
