Do not make an appointment at this salon! Amelia is unreliable and irresponsible! I waited 1.5 hours, she changed my appointment time 3 times and NEVER SHOWED UP! Her own employees stated she's \"irresponsible\" this is no way to run a business!  Unless you want to be stood up do not go here!  Find somewhere else to go! I don't care how well you do hair she was\/is unreliable! Did not even have the courtesy to msg me and apologize!
