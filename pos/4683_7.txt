Updating my review.\nI loved this place so much but it has taken a bad turn. The prices have risen to a very unreasonable amount for their juices. And will after well they are out of stock of our coils. We loved the personal atmosphere and the help we would receive but lately they seem to have new people work that don't seem to have a clue about anything we ask. \nThey have lost our business and are going back to vape street even though we can't stand that place because we know at least they have stock.
