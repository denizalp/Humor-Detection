Absolutely WONDERFUL!  Service was good, very friendly and patient with my young nephew!  Food was amazing!  Very fresh and flavorful. It was a bit more expensive than the Italian chain restaurants but worth it, not to mention, let's support our local small businesses!  Can't wait for the weather to cool off to enjoy dinner on their patio!!
