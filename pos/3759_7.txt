say \"au revoir\" to this place...don't ask me how to pronounce it.  please excuse my french, but the crepes here are f*cking nasty!!!  seriously, they are on a verge of becoming pancakes.  i wouldn't even give them to my enemies (thanks to the geneva conventions treaties), not that i have any...\nthis is one of those places that falls into \"what happens in vegas stays in vegas\"!
