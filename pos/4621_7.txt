2 words: WHOPPER WEDNESDAY.\n\nFor 3.99, you get a huge honkin' Whopper (cheese, is extra, no big whoop), a medium fries & a medium drink.\n\nWhat a deal - and I\"m tellin' you, this burger is huge.\nAnd if you're like me, this is 'bad for you' comfort food.\n\nThis is our Wednesday ritual:\nMy boyfriend and I call each other at work to  remind each other it's 'Whopper Wednesday Night!'. \nIt's *that* exciting in my household! \n\nThe area is totally shady, and I'm not sure I'd ever do the 'walk-in' thing, but I feel safe enough in a car with my huge boyfriend.
