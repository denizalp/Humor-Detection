OK, reality check. \n\nPain au chocolat should never, ever be filled with Nutella. And at Aroma, it is. I ordered the chocolate croissant and while the pastry part was sufficiently flaky and buttery, the filling (typically solid, slightly melty chocolate - http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pain_au_chocolat) oozed out like one of those rude cherry blossoms that nobody in their right mind would ever buy. \n\nNothing wrong with Nutella, but it has no place in a chocolate croissant. A shameful offering.
