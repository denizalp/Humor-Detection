This is like all other Tim's that I have been to, busy as can be.  It doesn't really seem to matter what time you go so expect to wait in line (inside and drive thru).  I recommend drive thru no matter how many car are there (and boy can it line up) as inside is cramped.  You may even have to wait outside as the main area which is just inside the door isn't very spacious.  It seems that every time I wait inside I can see the cars just flyin though like the Jetsons.\n\n12\/30
