very meh. I got the greek hot dog with fancy ingredients like feta cheese tomatoes, peppers, and olives. The toppings were ok.. the cheese tasted a bit off, everything else was meh. The WORST part was the bun! SO STALE! How can you have a good hotdog without the bun being perfect??? I even ordered it \"steamed\" but honestly it was just crusty old bun, and I got a white bun! Which usually doesn't go stale as quickly. Anyway I don't know, I like that they have a veggie dog option but I can't see past the stale bun.
