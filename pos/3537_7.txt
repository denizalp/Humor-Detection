Did this place hit the spot? Definitely not. Left lunch so dissatisfied :-(  \n\nLechon lunch plate - tired pieces of pork ...probably  from the day before. Very small portion compared to most.\n\nSisig - waaaaaay to greasy.  Felt like I just chugged a small bottle of crisco and even more left on the sizzle plate. ..ugh\n\nMungo - watery...eh\n\nDesserts on counter near register had mold spots growing in it...wth? \n\nMany other places to go to get a more satisfying meal.
