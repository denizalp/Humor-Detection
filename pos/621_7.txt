Thanks to Steven M on Yelp Talk, I found this place.  It's too bad that this place is closing.  The guy working there was very cool and helpful.  I was able to buy some magazines, a couple of semi-auto pistols, and other accessories for wholesale prices.  Very nice!\n\nI wish I heard about the sale sooner, I heard there was some awesome deals to be had.
