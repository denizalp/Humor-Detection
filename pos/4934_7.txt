this is still my go-to thai delivery near my house. \n\ni still order the yellow curry w a level 3 heat. \n\nthe rating drop is for a few reasons. they seem to have dwindled on the amount of chicken you get. also they've gotten really slow. last time i placed an order, we waited an hour, called and they hadn't even left yet. we ended up canceling our order and going out. i felt bad but we were starving. \n\ni give them 3 stars.
