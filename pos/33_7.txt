I have no idea how I ended up here but I'm glad I did. Looking around, I'm guessing this joint is Korean-based. So I had to test this by ordering something spicy. It was for real. I felt my love handles growing instantly, but it was spicy and delicious. If you think that Del Scorcho sauce at Del Taco is spicy, DON'T try the spicy stuff here.
