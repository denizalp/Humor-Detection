The food was crap but the goblet alcoholic drinks, even at $30 a pop, were worth it!\n\nMy date took me there.  He's not a big drinker, and watching him stumble all over the place was awesome!\n\nI took advantage of him later on.  Gotta love a guy with a sweet tooth and low alcohol tolerance.  This is the place for them.
