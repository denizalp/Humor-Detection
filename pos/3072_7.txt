Another night of sexy, sexy times at Souz Dal. The martini menu reads more like a dessert menu (what a tease) with names like creme brul√©e and creamsicle, and I've recently learned that they carry my new favourite drink - the Caipirinha (Brazil's national drink, apparently). Incredibly yummy and expertly prepared. Amaretto Sours (my signature drink) are smooth, not too icy and just perfectly sour.\n\nOn Mondays, Tuesdays and Sundays mixed drinks are $4 instead of $8. Now that is what we call a \"steal,\" friends.
