I have the secret. You need to go here with someone you don't mind eating off of, maybe even two or more people. Then you get the 3 course option for $20 and everyone order something different. Mind blown\n\nIt's soooo good. That's it and that's all. The thing I enjoyed the most was the biscuit and gravy, I haven't ate meat in soooo long and I loved to have that for brunch. It was nostalgic and delicious
