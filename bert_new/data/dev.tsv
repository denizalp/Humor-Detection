1	0	d	This place is so pretty and serene. My 60 minute hot stone massage was perfect. I will go back! Thanks Elements!
2	0	d	The crew under the leadership of Tim, the general manager, is friendly and provide excellent customer service.  They took care of a problem very professionally.  I will be back.  John
3	1	d	I don't want to tell you how amazing this spa is because I don't want it to get overcrowded next time I go.\n\nHowever, I will be a good Yelper and tell you what a beautiful and awesome spa this is. For hotel guests, it is $50 for a day pass and I felt like it was totally worth it. My husband and I had an amazing experience here just hanging out for a few hours utilizing their indoor and outdoor jacuzzi and their different meditation rooms. We did not get services.\n\nWe loved how attentive the staff was and how beautiful everything was. This was definitely the highlight of our vacation and are coming back to stay at the Aria hotel because we want to come back to this Spa. We didn't really like the hotel room but we really want to come back to the spa!\n \nI highly recommend!
4	1	d	I had a bad experience at Lexus of Henderson. I am trying to lease a vehicle.  I went to Lexus because I wanted to see what their cars are like.  I have never owned one.  My sales guy was nice.  The car I test drove was nice.  The salesman then got me a quote on a lease and financing.  I said I wanted to consider the purchase at home, and I moved to pick up the price sheet.  The sales guy told me that I couldn't take the price sheet.  I told him I needed it to compare with my other quotes.  He told me I couldn't have it.  I told him that I needed the price sheet or I wouldn't consider Lexus.  He refused, so I walked out.\n\nThat is an example of pressure to make decisions the on the property.  There is no way I'm going to make a $45k decision at a dealer. Only idiots do that.  The high pressure technique offended me.  Lexus has lost my business.\n\n**** UPDATE **** I received a voice mail from my salesperson today.  He apologized that he couldn't let me leave with the quote.  (Note, he didn't admit that he or Lexus were in the wrong or that he would give me the quote now.  Instead, he apologized that I would be offended.)  He then explained that he couldn't let me take the quote because it wasn't their \"best offer\".    Really!?#@  I can smell BS from a mile away.  They didn't let me leave with the offer because they wanted to pressure me into a decision right there.  If having me leave with the \"best offer\" was important, they would have offered me their \"best offer\" as I was leaving.  My intelligence has been insulted and my time wasted.
5	1	d	So it has been a couple of years since I have been here, and it has been a coupe of years for a reason.\n\nMy friends and I used to love going to Bobby McGee's for drinks. Any place that serves booze out of a bucket was a-OK in my book- the Q Lounge changed all of that.\n\nFirst off it is trying too hard, way too hard. For the location and the clients there is no reason why there should be bottle service. The only thing this has done is encouraged Scottsdale douche bag wannabes not to travel the distance to full fill their douche bag destiny. The door men act like they are Stacey and Clinton on \"What not to Wear,\" and gave my friend a hard time about his flip flops, while letting in about 10 guys with baggy ass jeans and 3\/4 of their boxers exposed in the meantime. The crowd is mixed, but not in a good way, the music is OK, the set up is cramped, and you pretty much leave disappointed. You cannot aspire to be a Scottsdale club at 20 something avenue and Northern, it is not possible. I miss the old Bobby McGee's, I miss the party buckets, and I miss being able to go in and dance with my friends without having one of them be felt up by some random dude. If we wanted that we would of went to Barcelona.
6	0	d	The primary advantage of The Platinum is location.  We always get a room with a balcony facing the strip to enjoy a birds' eye view of the frenzy below. \nThis time we stayed on the 10th floor & between forays out & to the spa & to the (somewhat) heated pool we kicked back in the suite.  Size is a big plus-- it is a large one bedroom apartment with full kitchen and sitting room plus a foyer.\nLocation is our favorite  plus. \nOne negative is internet-- it is slow & interrupts & is generally poor performance.  Another negative is that on the nice (two) flat screen TVs they actually offer only cable.  But we didn't go there to watch TV.\n\nA big plus is the Well Spa where Cindy was unbelievably fantastic for hair color\/cut & if you can take an actual deep tissue massage from an expert ask for Ellen.  Pedicure was great from Valentina (I might have her name wrong, sorry but she had a Russian accent).  Genesis at the desk was an excellent concierge.\n\nThe Well Spa is recently redone & all new but the hotel rooms are about ten years old & could use a re-do.  The enormous jetted tub in the bath was a dream but I was glad I had no trouble getting in and out of it and the caulking was wearing away.  The 5th floor pool was warmer on one night than on another but the cool thing was the stacked & folded pool towels by the door as you enter. \n\nAt first we wanted to walk & leave the car but after a few San Francisco-type homeless encounters on the filthy Las Vegas sidewalks we just took the car.  Calling the valet before we came down was almost no wait.\n\nOverall The Platinum still meets our needs but we paid top dollar at NY.\nThe Well Spa was a GREAT experience and we will go back. If you don't want to sleep in a casino The Platinum is a non-gaming option with a great view of the strip.
7	0	d	The best place to get duck taco, and hummus. And the customer service is great. I would definitely come back to this place
8	0	d	I felt it was necessary to write about Yogurtland once again. I went on a Wednesday afternoon at 3 and was so surprised to see the line was at least 20 people deep. I thought it was going to be a long wait in line but the exact opposite. As a matter of fact it is 3:27 right now and I already enjoyed my tasty treat at the shop and drove back to work! I was pleasantly surprised that there were all new flavors to choose from. I got Dutch Chocolate with Reece's peanut butter cups, Peanut butter with brownie bits and Lemon Lime Tart with strawberries. Every combination was delish and the best part, $1.83! You read that right folks... But one of the main reasons for my update was the feeling of the place today. It had a sense of camaraderie, everyone turning to their neighbor to ask their opinion on certain flavors, taster cups weren't absent just not really being used. I think everyone realized we didn't want to be on the line ride long. The staff was as friendly as ever and everything was very clean. Even with that many people there still was seating. Me being a lone traveler in Yogurtland that day I shared a 4 top with a family of 3. It was a moment that reminded me of small town life where everyone gets to know their neighbor. Very nice.
9	0	d	I have had my nails done a few times at Urban Nails. It was recommended so I thought I would try it out. I went in each time and got a gel manicure. The first time I went I also got a parafin wax treatment on my hand. She first gave me the wax treatment, then she gave me my shellac manicure. When I left within hours the gel polish lifted. I came back and they fixed it. The woman who fixed it said that the nail tech should not of done the treatment prior to my manicure !!!!! Even though it was fixed it lifted again after a couple of days. By the seventh day more then 3 nails all were ruined.\n\nI decided to give them another chance and the gel polish lifted again.\n\nDue to such a bad experience, the amount of money and time spent I will not be returning.
10	1	d	I have just had the worst experience of my dining life here. First off, the service was so slow. Second off... you won't believe me but 5 hairs were found between me and my friend. FIVE. And also there was a dead fly on my plate.... after we sent back my biscuits and gravy which were the most contaminated, another HAIR was found bathing in my gravy. Can you say disgusting? \n\nOur waitress (who on the record was great) asked the manager to come over. She didn't come over for 20 minutes and even said \"Oh, the kids?\" Mind you I am 20 years old,in a great college, and have worked in a restaurant for 3 years. I do not appreciate not being taken seriously especially when there was so much wrong with my order. She first took off $2.40 which was a penny less than my DRINK. So I basically would've saved a penny if I had gotten a water. When I went up again and told her it's not right that I have to pay $15 when I ate nothing , she ignored me looking at the ground and took off half.  \nI have never been to a more disgusting, poorly ran place in my life. A multimillion dollar company such as Ihop should have just taken the $15 check off completely. That is NOTHING. To say the least I am disgusted and biscuits and gravy have now scarred me for life. Take your business elsewhere where there ISNT a hair salon in the back and dead flies.
11	0	d	The quality of the food is second to none.  Dave Russo and his team know how to make wonderful food, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  I've never had any food that wasn't very well prepared.  Try the chicken liver appetizer or a plate of oysters on the half shell :)\n\nThe service is *usually* good: when they're on their game no one does it better.  Sadly, when they get busy, the service slips perceptibly.  Also bear in mind that regulars get *much* better service than unfamiliar faces.\n\nOn the downside, even taking into account the very superior quality of the food and service, the prices are still on the high side.  Accordingly, 4 out of 5 stars.
12	1	d	This place is the absolute worst bank I've ever had. Completely rude over the phone , unreliable and definitely a mistake to bank with them. I'm switching all my loans and accounts to a different bank. Any recommendations ?
13	0	d	As good as it gets for the fast Mexican \/drive through style restaurant. I haven't tried everything yet so cannot give 5 stars but its about there.\n\nThe carnitas are a must (can put them it pretty much any form, on fries, in burritos, in tortas etc). Beans are good and fish tacos are better than rubios. They give you plenty of food here for the money. One odd thing is they do not have any adovada type meat. They have several mexican drinks (horchata, bottled meixcan sodas, etc)\n\nSalsa bar is definitely more authentic mexican style (so my mexican wife says). Nice variety with Red, Diablo (should be hotter with that name), green, chile\/oil, carrots, roasted chiles. \n\nFor south Chandler this is the best place i have tried so far in this genre.
14	1	d	Worst corned beef hash I have ever had. Homemade but the canned was much better. Never order again. May not even go back.
15	0	d	One of my favorite streetwear stores. The employees are really helpful and I love all of their clothes. Would come again
16	0	d	This place is super-stylish. Cheerful, modern space. Perfect for talking or working (there's wi-fi).  Really good coffee (but I'm not a fanatic). Food is well-crafted from excellent ingredients -- they're small plates, so don't expect to get stuffed. Great addition to Central Phoenix.!
17	1	d	As a regular as this establishment, my father has been coming to this location since it opened several years ago. So it was a surprise for me to hear the following as I write my super negative review. If you want a nice peaceful meal without being verbally assaulted with false accusations by the wait staff, unfortunately this is no longer the place to come. \n\nNegative stars big time as I listen to the story of the crazy waitress verbally assault and make false accusations of my father. A waitress that he has never seen nor dealt with prior to this embarrassing assault in front of other patrons. She threatened police action if he were to go back, he one upped he and offered that the police come now. If they had anything substantial to back their crazy accusations, why didn't they call the police? Because they have just lost a regular patron due to a looney toon waitress. \n\nHe has been a regular at this establishment since it opened without issue, and is friendly with the rest of the wait staff, unfortunately the manager that he is friends with had recently resigned her position and the new manager, which he didn't know either, backed up the crazy waitress. Luckily he received supportive comments from other wait staff.\n\ni find this type of behaviour despicable, deplorable, and unprofessional. Outrageous lies by a waitress, backed by a manager new to the position, we think we have an idea of what she was trying to do, but i don't want to be hit with any slander.\n\nObviously I don't even think they deserve the mediocre 2 stars that they do have, but maybe Yelp should allow at least a zero star rating, as I feel i am over rating them by being forced to give them one star.
18	1	d	DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. The vet was not knowledgeable at all. She overdosed my reptile (she accidently admitted it on the phone). My reptile was very sick after overdose and still recovering. \n\nDuring the physical exam  they could not take my reptile's leg out and the vet took her behind doors to have her inspected. When she came back with my pet, my pet was very scared and inside her shell. God knows what they did to her. The vet should have made me comfortable by doing the physical in front of me and not behind doors.\n\nDuring the examination, they did not discuss any alternatives for my pet and jumped right to spending $1000 on x-rays and unnecessary vet care. Also, the clinic kept calling me and insisted that I come in for another appointment and spend few hunderds more. I felt it was all about money and not about making my pet and me feel comfortable. They expected me to shell out more money on expensive follow ups when the mistake was theirs.\n\nI will never go to this place again. Due to overdose my reptile has permanent damage to her leg and she now walks around with a limp.\n\nP.S: If you are looking for a reptile specialist do not go to this place and if you do then at least make sure that you are not attended by Dr. Morrow. She doesn't know a thing.
19	0	d	As an MMA fighter, I absolutely love request a test.  I've used them twice already and they're awesome.  Very convenient.  They know exactly what blood work you need per state, they will automatically fax over your results.  You can create an account and your results are online for download anytime.  You can pay over the phone and go to a LabCorp or something like that, super easy.\n\n\nHighly recommended!
20	1	d	I don't want to shop for sex toys in A. lights so bright that it makes everything and everyone washed out and pasty, B. a place where the quality of the products is questionable at best, C. where inevitably, a creep will follow me and my girlfriend around, trying to see what we're looking at.\nWhy does Phoenix not have better sex toy stores??
21	0	d	Just text Dan! No need to shop around. All i do is text Dan and he calls me shortly after. I have several rental properties and he has been to all of them for AC repairs. He is always on time, usually the same day service, and has no problem getting cold air for my tenants immediately. His prices are honest and not outrageous. If you want quick service with an efficient, honest person, simply call or text Dan. With all the BIG companies and hundreds of repairmen out there, I like knowing that the person i spoke to on the phone is the same person that is coming inside my home. There's lots of whack-jobs out there, and Dan is as honest and friendly as they get! Thanks Dan!!
22	1	d	Wanted to make reservations so I called in today but nobody bothered to pick up. I was put on hold for over 15 minutes so I just hung up. Very disappointed.\n\nI came here once during the summer and really enjoyed the food but they really need to improve their customer service.\n\nI'm not sure if the line was just busy or something but having to wait so long just to call in for reservations is just ridiculous. \n\nI'm so sad now ;-;\n\n\nUPDATE!\n\nSo half an hour after I posted this, KaKa messaged me and apologized and the manager personally helped me make my reservations!\n\nWhen I arrived the manager personally came to the restaurant to apologize even though it was her day off! \n\nIrene is super sincere and she explained that there are hundreds of calls everyday and that they try their best to accommodate. I really appreciate her coming on her day off just to make sure all her customers are happy. She takes her customers very seriously so I truly appreciate it!
23	0	d	Dr. Liu could possibly be the best dentist in Las Vegas.  Five stars to the staff as well.  Never enjoying going to the dentist in my life and not having the best smile but Dr. Liu is caring and makes sure you are ok as he does what he does with the most care and least pain.  I don't know how he can do what other dentists are not capable of in taking care to make sure the experience is as painless as possible yet you can tell he has your best interest in everything he does.  I can recommend Dr Liu and his staff to any of my friends, clients and co-workers and know they will be pleased and I have for many years. He and his staff deserve their success as a successful honest dental practice here in Las Vegas.
24	0	d	Recommended for casual lunches or dinners. Our favorite pizzas are the Big Kahuna and Da Works. Since can usually handle one small pizza for both of us, we ask half and half. We add a Greek salad and we get a full delicious dinner.
25	1	d	It's here. The Face Shop. In less than a decade The Face Shop has gone from a single \"no no that's not at all a rip off of The Body Shop\" store in Seoul's fashionable Myeong Dong to shy of 1,000 stores in 22 countries. But, apparently, and probably with some pride, NOT JAPAN. The Face Shop's gimmick seems to be getting a pretty boy kpop star (no, NOT Psy!), slathering him (yes, him) up with all manner of Face Shop cosmetics, and then demonstrating if Face Shop can make a Korean male so pretty you'd try to set him up with your oppa, it can work wonders on your study-tired craggy old hobak face. What's wrong with you? Maybe you should have listened to your mother. Face shop BB Cream. Stat.\n\nThe current Face Shop male model is Kim Hyun-joong and his face is well plastered all over this P Mall store. Kim who? Like the guy from Boys Over Flowers (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GG9eyqg4nIc&feature=g-upl). I mean, duh.
26	0	d	Yonge\/Bloor station happens to be the closest station to my apartment, so I use it on a very regular basis. During rush hour it can get hectic, as it connects the Yonge and Bloor lines so there is always a ton of people transferring from one line to the other.\n\nThere are a few different entrances and exits here, so when I am not going north or south, I usually enter via the entrance beside Jack Astors as it's WAY quieter and avoids all of the craziness.\n\nOverall, a decent station. I like how they have Presto readers and vending machines, so you can pick up a transit pass without having to wait in line at the collector booth.
27	1	d	Red chille Carne is the best. Every Wednesday they have special priced menu where meals are 7.95 and kids eat for 1.50. Such a great deal and it is very filling. The food is always fresh and hot when they sever you. Bean dip and salsa with chips when u first arrive, um I'm good. Definitely recommend this place for any occasion.
28	0	d	I had an amazing experience with Diana and let me explain why. If your like me and absolutely hate shopping and do not know a thing about fashion, Diana is the one who can change you into a new person. She came to my house for about an hour, looked at the clothes I had, asked me what I wanted and asked me my general sizes. She didn't measure me or anything, but almost everything she bought fit me great. Our next visit was a few hours long where I tried on all the clothes she bought. I'd say out of the 200 items she brought to me, including full business casual wardrobe, dresses, shoes, jewelry, purses and other accessories, I agreed to buy 150 of the items. And do you want to know why? Because Diana got all of these items off discount\/clearance stores\/racks and the prices couldn't be beat! She found me full outfits for under $50, shoes for under $20, etc. And anything I didn't like or want, she did not pressure me to keep them! Diana says that she wants her clients to be happy and wear the clothes she bought, so if there was anything I was skeptical about, we decided to just pass on. She brought so many options, that I have new outfits I can wear for the next 6 months! I even texted her about 2-3 weeks after I purchased the clothes, and told her I had changed my mind on some of them, and she came back to my house, reimbursed me and returned the clothes. I have gotten so many compliments on my new attire and have Diana to thank for all of it! Thank you Diana for all of your help! You know I'll be calling you again once fall\/winter seasons start!
29	0	d	This visit I used a debit card and was charged a..50 debit fee. This is a pretty steep fee compared to what processors charge restaurants. There was not a sign giving notification of.the fee. I have to remove a star.
30	1	d	Postino never disappoints. I'm thrilled with their new downtown Gilbert location but more over their delicious bruschettas and excellent service. I went here for the opening party on St. Patrick's Day and had a fabulous time. The wine selection is, as always, superb.
31	0	d	I found Vicky through a groupon over a year ago and am so happy I did.   She does a great job, sells quality products at reasonable prices and does her best to accommodate changes in appointment times.   I can't reconcile what I have experienced with Vicky with the 0ne star review other than to say you can't please all of the pelople all of the time.
32	0	d	Randomly landed here twice through yelp while on travel and enjoyed a quick nice meal...  A whole in the wall place that's clean and offers good service. The afghan tikka on a snowy in Calgary night was too good and so was the Wednesday special  Haleem.\nI am coming back here for sure. Give them a try!
33	1	d	Surprisingly decent venue- larger than expected, back wall is a massive bar. Lines for drinks get long, and prices are predictably steep for generic draft beer, but the staff are friendly. In addition to bartenders, there are a lot of people cleaning and monitoring the crowd, which is a nice touch.\n\nBathrooms are huge with 20+ stalls, so getting in a trip between sets isn't a huge wait as it is at other venues. The acoustics are fairly good, but I found it odd that the general admission\/floor area is divided up by odd iron rails- I understand they don't want a giant mosh pit going or anything, it's an unusual setup.
34	1	d	Nice staff, excellent server and friendly bussers. Smelly building, like an old home, needs to be deep cleaned and renovated. Food was good. But the atmosphere and smell is enough to make me not come back.
35	0	d	I was looking for a new restaurant to go to when I came across  Los Olivos reviews. I have eaten here many times over the years and I will admit that a few times I didn't absolutely love my meal but these people who give out one star and two star reviews like they are God Almighty just makes me sick. \nLos Olivos serves authentic Sonoran\/Arizonan Mexican Food and does a great job at it. I love this place. Yelpers please remember especially if you are reviewing a small business that there are real people you are reviewing. Lets change the culture of Yelp by remembering what our mothers told us a long time ago. If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all.
36	0	d	Arrived on busy Saturday needing a  table for 8. 20 min wait seemed about right.  Helpful staff. Great portions. Good place for hungry family.  Pizza, wings, chili, pastrami all solid in my book. Lots of TV's!! \nBonus.
37	0	d	This gym has everything you want, and very little you don't.  No sauna (who wants to see naked old men anyway?), no pool, but they've got sleds a ton of box jumps and ropes.  Never lacking pull-up bars or free weights, along with lots of machines that are glimmering clean.  An under appreciated aspect are the weirdly motivational pictures hanging throughout. Check it out, you won't regret it.
38	1	d	Perfect! Happy hour mon-sat 3pm-6pm\n\n\n3.5 stars\n\n All we wanted to do was to grab something to eat after a long drive from California to Arizona and we found this on rurual road, in Tempe. The exterior may look plain but hey, there's a bar and happy hour happening so why turn around?\n\nWhat does happy hour have? Well, well , well... 1\/2 off appetizers, $2 blue moons and drafts that they carry. And there's specials on selected food.\n\nGot the..\n\n+ fresh rolls ($3) chicken - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=N1mhk603JkCFuPZJ58Cxew#mYLsvj4kSTgz7tqwKX07NQ \nYou get to choose either chicken, beef or tofu. We got the chicken and it was pretty good. The sweet and sour sauce was a bit different from the Thai places I've been to. Usually there's garlic in it, but at Thai Basil, they put chopped up peanuts instead. So if you're allergic with peanuts, best ask for the sauce without the nuts!\n\n+ Papaya Salad ($6.25) mild\nTasted great! Only sad thing is that we only had one shrimp :(\n\n+ red snapper with mixed veggies and bamboo (mild) http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=vhgbwyKOgx0caLeacQ1zQQ#pD9KU2uHEGRBQS4H02AJEQ\nOh so yummy! Tasted garlic-y and having it over rice is delicious.\n\n+ Bluemoons ($2 each)  - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=vhgbwyKOgx0caLeacQ1zQQ#A2vWUeFM6vWyQXZeJJvwEw \n\n\nService - Was great. The ladies who works there are very helpful when we asked what in what and they will let you know what's their special of the day. And yes, there is a bar here. Eat while you drink in front of a big screen t.v. \n\nOverall, not a bad place. I just wished they gave more than one darn shrimp!
39	1	d	From the Instagram-worthy dragon in the lobby to the cool industrial-pirate-ship style theater, Ka just oozes unique coolness from the moment you walk in. Unfortunately, I can't say that this is my favorite Cirque show in town- the characters are interesting, the performers are talented, and I really like the costumes, but there's not much of a storyline and some parts seemed to drag.\n\n I really enjoyed the underwater scene, the jungle scene, and the gold couple- they had such chemistry! The beach scene with the animals was some comic relief, and I want to recreate the crab costume myself. I would come again if the opportunity presented itself, but it wouldn't be my first pick to take visiting friends from out of town.
40	0	d	Since this is pretty much right beside my place, you can say I go here often. Large portions, great staff and unreal hot sauce. Make sure to get Garlic, Hummus, Tzatziki sauce and hot sauce on your plate (sounds weird but amazing). Also, avoid going right before they close because your food will be cold, saying from experience.
41	1	d	I would say this has a few things going for it: clean, good value, central location on the strip, and the pool.  It looks nice, but fairly small and non-descript.  I only stay here when I have a longer than normal stay, but I prefer the upper echelon of hotels, and this is just above average.\n\nNote about the pool.  There's a lot of families.  They have a large wave pool, which is overrun by kids.  They standard pool is also nice, but overrun by adults!  Do not look for peace & tranquility here.\n\nProbably a 3.5 star, but I just can't round up.
42	1	d	We saw \"The Artist\" here last night after the Yelp Elite Event, and my only complaint is that I'm not sure this was the right theater in which to see such a piece. My enjoyment of this throwback silent film was slightly reduced by the sounds of explosions occuring at showings on the other screens. Other than that, this is an impressive theater with efficient, friendly staff that ISN'T wayyy out in Suburbia. \n\nYes, parking's a bitch and a half, but it's South Side Works, and it was a Saturday night, so it kinda goes with the territory.
43	0	d	After the debacle that was Hooters Hotel and Casino, it was so nice to know waiting for me was the Venetian Prima Suite on the 36th floor!  What a beautiful hotel and better yet an absolutely beautiful hotel room.  Soaring Ceilings and large picture windows accentuate this 1500 square foot gem overlooking the las vegas strip.   This suite comes with a luxurious 200 square foot bathroom with jacuzzi tub and dual head shower.........blah, blah, blah\n\nOkay enough of the late night, real estate channel sales tactics.  At the end of the day, it was a nice, clean, hotel.  I'm not a gambler as I mentioned in other reviews, but I did drop a couple of hundred in a matter of minutes.  I guess they have to pay for it somehow!  \n\nStill love it though!!\n\nA quick tip: Unless you want to pay out the ass, reserve this suite a couple of months in advance and it will cost about half of what it is if you wait.
44	1	d	eh 2.5-3 stars for tea here.\n\nI LOVE AFTERNOON TEA!! If I'm having a Birthday or a celebration or ANYTHING I always drag the girls with me for tea.\n\nUnfortunately we made the wrong decision to have a friends Bridal shower here. While the snacks were good, they messed up on my tea!!! I ordered the lychee tea and I struggled to drink it. It was a horrible floral flavored tea, Like I was drinking some freshly plucked marigolds or something, ack. I drank everyone else's tea instead of my own. I finally voiced to employees that my lychee did not taste like lychee, and they said it wasn't lychee that's why. Not even apologetically, she then came back with our bill, and I was still charged for the body wash tasting tea.\n\nOh well, won't be back here that's for sure. Also, the venue looks a lot more impressive in pictures than in real life.
45	0	d	I went to grab lunch here, and instantly was overwhelmed with the great aroma as we walked into the bakery. The store is filled with free samples all over, and I was able to try almost all the different sorts of bread. My coworker and I got 4 cakes; the japanese cheese cake, new york cheese cake, mille crepes cake and the green tea mille crepes cake. We also tried the sea salt coffee. The cakes ranged from $5-$8, so they were a little pricey but it was definitely worth it. Everything was so delicious, and they had great customer service. I will definitely be back!
46	1	d	My dad and I stopped in here on a Tuesday night for dinner a few weeks ago, and we both felt this place was just ok.  There was nothing wrong with the food when we ate it, but it was about $50 for two of us with a tip.  Too steep for non-memorable food.\n\nI ordered a shrimp burrito ($12) that was ok.  The amount of shrimp was decent for the price, but it was just beans, rice, and shrimp.  My dad ordered a burger that was also fine.  We then ordered 2 slices of cake.  A chocolate cake, that was supposed to be super chocolate-y, was flavorless.  The red velvet was slightly better, but at $6.95\/slice, neither was worth it.  My dad ordered a beer that was ok, but overall, most of the food was something you could make at home.\n\nI wouldn't come back here except for the Vegan options, which bumps this place up to a 3 star rating.
47	0	d	I absolutely love this place and frequent here at least twice a month! I always get the same thing, Plain waffle with whip and powdered sugar, sausage and scrambled eggs with a coffee. I'm a big waffle gal and would choose it over pancakes anyway. Their waffles are big and fluffy and sooooo delicious with their WARMED blueberry syrup! They recently remodeled the place and I think it looks great! They are very clean and always greet customers as soon as they walk in the doors. I love that they have a coffee station, I can refill my coffee and put a different flavor of creamer and it's just a cute setup! I always recommend to my friends. Don't forget the stamp card too!
48	0	d	Two words: avocado toast   .   You can get the onions on the side if you aren't sure if you want them on the toast.  I think they are delicious.\n\nI looooveee coming here for work meetings.  They offer free wi-fi, have a decent amount of seating, and have a variety of options for drinks and food.  Out of town guests really like coming here because of the environment.  \n\nThe presentation of the food is picture worthy and tastes as good as it looks.   The customer service is always on point and if they are out of something on the menu they always have a comparable option in mind that you can order.
49	1	d	I moved in to Altitude Sixteen 75 about a week after ConAm took over on November 3rd. I have been so happy here and absolutely love it. Moving in to a complex with friendly staff and great amenities has been such a relief for me! I love this complex! I have not had the chance to speak with many of the girls up front but Amanda is always very helpful and the other girls up front always greet me with a smile! Since being here the carpets have already been cleaned in the halls at least once which is so nice that they actually take the time to care for the upkeep of the property. I really appreciate that! I tell my friends and family about Altitude all the time and how happy I am here. I love having friends and family over to show them this beautiful property.
50	1	d	I actually did not enjoy anything about the food that we got from here.\n\nThe fact that regardless of the place, regardless of the 14 oz of meant, $14.95 for a roast beef sandwich is BEYOND ridiculous.\n\nAnd what does it come with? Meat and bread.\n\nBUT WAIT! Thats not all!\n\nFor only $1.50 extra, you can get a slice of cheese.\n\nAnd for $1 extra, you can have lettuce and tomato.\n\n...wtf?\n\nI LOVE roast beef sandwiches. Absolutely love them. I was not aware it was possible to make a bad roast beef sandwich.\n\nThis was definitely the WORST sandwich I have ever had, in any variety.\n\nFirst of all, the roast beef did not taste like anything. It was bizarre. It tasted like water.\n\nAnd the issue with Vegas is the concept of less is more is OUT THE WINDOW.\n\nWe had to completely de-construct the sandwich before we could even take a bite. There was nearly a pound of roast beef ROLLED into a huge roll and slapped on these squirrely pieces of bread. \n\nNot to mention there was a half a pound of iceberg lettuce and white onion. What DELI doesnt offer red onion??\n\nIt was such a disappointment. Especially since the bf had really wanted a pastrami sandwich, which is also never bad, which I vetoed because I had a queasy belly and wanted something with a little less flavor. NOT SOMETHING WITH NO FLAVOR.\n\nIt was just an absolute failure. Depression and a failure. ):
51	0	d	Took 35 minutes for 8 wings to go :(\n\nMost expensive and worst wings I've ever had! Service was just as bad. Employees like to chitchat while you're standing there right in front of them waiting to place your order. You don't even get ranch with your wings that's extra. \nThe girl taking my order was filling up dressing cups at the same time and acted like I was bothering her!! I should've walked out.
52	0	d	Not a bad little place if you are heading into a movie. It is a relatively healthy little arrangement for 1\/10 the time as the more tastey finer dining of Persian room right down the street. Eat here if your in a hurry and Persian room if you have all the time to really enjoy the experience.
53	1	d	The last time I remember going to the doctor was after NYE 1998. I was celebrating the coming New Year with friends in our favorite bar in Detroit, Michigan, when I finished a mouthful of shrimp and told my BFF Ricky 'I don't feel well.' My next memory was being surrounded by a bunch of over-animated queens who could barely conceal their snarky attitudes because I was the shit and I ruled that part of town. I spent the rest of the evening in Ricky's car turning the engine on to melt the frost on the windows. Well, after we made it back to Ohio the next day, Ricky told my parents what happened and they made me go to the doctor. Something about thinking my epilepsy had returned. However, after several tests and a few thousand dollars out of pocket, they couldn't tell me what had happened and concluded it was just a fainting spell. \n\nSo, clearly, I was hesitant about going to a doctor once I moved out to Arizona and hadn't made any appointments with a doctor for about 8 years. Sadly, I developed a painful ear ache and was left with no choice, after almost 2 months of self-medicating, but to schedule an appointment with a doctor. Since I'm generally lazy and look for the easiest way out of something, I found the addresses of fie general practitioners covered by my insurance in our ZIP code, mapped out which was accessible by light rail, by light rail and one bus transfer and by walking distance during a pleasant month in Phoenix. That's how I decided to go to Dr. McRunels. \n\nI was feeling a little uneasy about seeing a stranger and having to go through my medical history (back home, we went to the same doctor who delivered us so he was kind of along for the journey of our lives). But the staff and Dr. McRunels dissipated any concerns by being professional yet friendly. This wasn't what I was expecting. Even though I had gone for my ear ache, they were willing to discuss any other medical concerns I may have, whether my body was functioning any differently in the past few years, if I developed any new moles, and other conditions that may have presented themselves in the years since I last had a thorough exam. \n\nNot surprisingly, I survived the appointment and was able to fill my prescription at Target in 20 minutes. \n\nNow I can call my mom and let her know I now have my own doctor!
54	1	d	I promise you I though I was tripping when I left out of this MAC store. It started with me walking in and immediately caught eyes with the employee and said hi, she didn't respond and looked down at whatever it was she was doing. I've never been so obviously rejected in my life. \n\nIt was so bad I thought of any logical explanation to add to it but I know for sure she saw me and she heard me. I walked to what I came in there for but because I knew I didn't want to deal with the girl, I put the brushes down &&left. \n\nMost awkward\/ rude shopping experience ever!!
55	1	d	First time here...  here's the gist of the AYCE Sushi side of the restaurant (they have a hibachi side too)...\n\n1. AYCE... reasonable... made-to-order\n    Lunch - $20.95 (11:30am - 3pm)\n    Dinner - $25.95 (3pm - 2am)\n    \n*Rules: \n    No Sharing\n    You'll be charged for leftovers\n    45 min for lunch\/60min for dinner\n    20% tip added to parties of 6 or more\n    AYCE cannot be combined w\/any promotion\n\n2.  Funny cheeky names for sushi rolls... \n      - Screaming Orgasm \n      - Double D\n      - Something Wrong #69\n      - Burning Your Ass\n*Wanna know the ingredients... come on by!\n\n3.  Decor is modern, music isn't too loud (good for conversations), and drinks were constantly refilled. \n\n** All in all... \nReasonable AYCE price!\nMy favorite thing all night... the oyster on the half, ama ebi (fried head) and Korean ice cream sandwich.\n\nPass on no rice rolls (not sushi). And the pumpkin soup (pureed).
56	1	d	After four years of silence, the time has come for me to dust off the review writing pants and get down to business. That being said, Wildfish is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.\n\nThe girlfriend and I came here last night with her parents for a Mother's Day dinner and everything was great. The hostess offered a rose to every Mom that came into the restaurant that night, which was a great touch. As far as the dinner was concerned, the food was fantastic.\n\nThis is one of the best places in town to get oysters as they are always fresh, and the selection is constantly rotating. Once again, they did not disappoint. The entrees were highlighted by the Swordfish with red chile vinaigrette, New York Strip with black pepper sauce and my plate of Georges Bay Scallops that were seared to perfection, and topped with citrus juices and brown butter sauce. Two words - Damn. Good. \n\nThe service was good and is typically very consistent in my experience. Attentive but not overbearing is always the key. All in all another solid dinner at Wildfish. Great seafood in Scottsdale is hard to come by and these guys nail it every time.\n\nBonus: Happy hour here is awesome, $1 oysters...cant go wrong with that.
57	1	d	I dig Miller's Alehouse for many reasons. 1. Sports. 2. Sports. and 3. SPORTS!!! It is just  a fun chill place to be at to watch all the games with there crazy selection of HD TV's (basketball - GO CELTICS!, football - GO CHARGERS! and the bf's team EAGLES!, and they even show the UFC fights - BJ PENN!!!! 20 secs?!) Woah. \n\nThe back area is where the hype is. More for the over 21+ age group. Everyone is more \"expressive\" so try not to take what people say seriously. It's just a game. Yeah right. haha. \n\nI haven't tried full entrees at Millers Ale House yet except for the appetizers. The \"Zinger Mountain Melt\" is one of the best Wing & Zingers to choose from. Crispy crunch chicken fingers and french fries with melted cheese and bacon on top. Yumm. Good enough to serve 2-3 people. \n\nFor drinks, they know how to take care of you. They have drink specials everyday! Beer they offer average on weekdays a bucket of 5 for $8+ and on weekends 5 for $10. \n\nThis place is a perfect spot to hang out with your friends and just have a great time.
58	1	d	im literally laughing as i write this review because i just remember my friend getting kicked in the head by an over eager woman trying to pole dance on a platform right next to him. hahaha.\n\njet nightclub is okay. the energy here is definitely not as crazy and fun as some other clubs... and we only came here for the open bar since i was staying at the mirage at the time.  there are 3 different rooms playing different music which is kinda cool..but id prefer one huge party in one room than 3 disjointed rooms if you know what i mean. the DJ wasnt really getting the crowd pumped up so we left early.. the crowd is definitely really mixed and they seemed a bit older. im glad i gave this club a try but i doubt ill be coming back especially with so many other hotter\/newer clubs out there now.
59	0	d	This is not the best Chinese you can get, but the price to quality ratio is superb.  $5 lunch specials, around $7-8 for dinner.  Ready in 10 minutes.  Even though there are tables in here , it is best to CARRYOUT.  The decor is less than inviting. \nI order from here fairly often and it seems like they do a decent amount of business.
60	1	d	Terrific, affordable food and beverages at this newly opened restaurant. Ask for Yuhao to be your server. They were delightful and completely accommodating in every way.
61	0	d	Above average breakfast.  Wide selection of breakfast breads.  Good oatmeal.  Buckwheat pancakes.  That about sums it up.  I much prefer it to the very popular US Egg franchise that is always packed.  This place is a little more low key with higher quality fare and better atmosphere.
62	0	d	Everything I've ordered here has been okay. Just a decent burger place. The service is always great though.
63	0	d	Honestly, this place is not that great unless you have no idea what you want to buy. The staff was very friendly and the environment is nice but the prices were kind of ridiculous, at least the things I looked at. I know that you won't get as much of a warm welcome at a Petsmart but the prices there are WAY lower. If you're just looking for a nice place to shop, this could be good for you but I'm on a budget and it's not really worth the extra cost or the much smaller selection.
64	0	d	Apparently this nail salon has something against starting the acrylic right at the cuticle, there was a big gap from the cuticle to the beginning of the acrylic nail, it literally looked like 3week old acrylic nails. Went back two days later (unfortunately couldn't go back the next day due to a graduation i attended) and when i showed the guy who greeted us (i believe the owner) the problem he insisted that these were old nails and when i told him they were two days old he tried saying the problem was the nail grew too quickly, seriously?! He then called the lady who did the nails over and started talking to her in their language which im sure he was talking crap!...anyways, she went on about how that is the \"professional\" look and how she cant go near cuticles and all she offered to do was to repaint them closer to the cuticle but that even that didn't look \"professional\" and they as a salon dont start the acrylic near the cuticles. I have never had this problem anywhere else in the 10 yrs i've had acrylic nails done. The nails were done nice but the big gap made them look old and unprofessional. I went to a different nail salon and asked what they thought of the nails, right away they recommended that they needed to be filled in....CaliNails did such a great job and fixed a problem that shouldn't of been one to begin with. As far as JB's Nails , I do NOT recommend this nail salon.
65	1	d	The largest of the HT stores deserves my undivided attention and it's hard to obtain because I am an elite Yelper (said with my best Cartman voice).  But, seriously,  I got one word for location...DAMN!  This place rocks!!  It's so big and so clean and every one is happy,  it's like being on vacation.   There is a nice large bar that serves beer and wine but no liquor and there are musicians ever Friday.  No bands but I've seen a couple of singers\/guitarist.  Tonight was just a solo man, but he performed well.  There is a clean juice bar and excellent grocery options and prices.  Even if you're not in the area visit on a Friday and you'll be a fan!
66	0	d	Bye bye Pain! I happen to really like Dr. Wolff. He was VERY personable. Did I have to wait....yes but after going into my first appointment it was because he takes his time with you! I don't mind waiting, I just adjusted my schedule to fit in more time! He really cares, he's honest and I feel really wants to help his patients! If he can't help you he will tell you! Ok the good news...I had multiple issues from doing 29 years of deep tissue massage! Torn labrum in the shoulder, arthritis, bursitis, tendinitis on several tendons and a host of other shoulder issues. Other doctors said shoulder surgery with a 6 month recovery! NO thanks! PT didn't work. I also had a sore elbow from a previous extensor tendon tear repair in the elbow & a cyst in my wrist. I couldn't sleep at night and I don't like pain meds! He did PRP & blood cord injections on all 3 areas! It feels so good to be out of pain without the surgery,  meds, cortisone shots and 6 months of painful recovery!! I can't thank him enough!
67	0	d	Yooo I just ate the other half of my chicken philly from Saturday.. Omgg it was so bomb..... LOVE YOU GUYS KEEP UP THE GREAT FOOD.. If you havent been to this established walk into the street stop put your foot out and let it get ran over.. Cause thats what everyday is going to be like until you have food from there..
68	1	d	My first reaction upon trying the tiramisu cake was, \"WHY DOES THIS TASTE LIKE THIS!?????\"\n\nI literally said that out loud as i continued to stuff my face with all its tiramisuey greatness. I was seriously so confused and angry that an amazing dessert had been in my vicinity for so long and my taste buds were just now being introduced. \n\nIt was huge (for me) so I was able to enjoy some for breakfast the next morning. best decision of the day was eating cake for breakfast. Anyways, the next day (last night), I was over in that hood with a friend and went back. Unfortunately they did not have the tiramisu cake, but they did have buy 2 cakes, get 1 red velvet cake free! whoooa, bros. The chocolate chip cookie cake was just as excellent!!! I am currently eating the red velvet cake at this moment and it's cool, but I'm not like red velvet fan #1. \n\nMy name is CoCo, I know desserts, and I know you should go eat them here.
69	0	d	A great place. The service was excellent even with a large table. Protein pancakes are amazing.
70	1	d	Super crazy, first thing arrived to restaurant -not sure where or who to speak with to get a stub for a table. \n\nWaited 1.5 hour for a table and a long time for food. A girl took our dim sum paper and first wrote wrong table # (over heard another waiter yelling at her. FYI - theres a sign with the table # at the center of the table!)  then the dim sum paper was left on counter and did not input into system for the kitchen. we had to chase order then find out it wasn't input. \n\n\nFood 4\/5* not bad for food in terms of plating, flavor and sizes. After order went in, everything we ordered came out very fast. The fish congee $5.99 was a good portion size, and the fillet was grouper not frozen basa. \n\nWhen food arrive, there is was no bowls or plates. \nSeem like a lot of people were complaining and unhappy. This place was filled with negativity.\n\nLimited seats, environment seem like it is for dinner or set dishes, not the typical Chinese dim sum place. Spacious environment yet not enough servers. Everyone is new on the job, inexperence with serving as well as running this type of restaurant. Servers need to open every dim sum dish to see whats in it and process slowly. \n\nPerhaps it is their first day, but very disorganized. Require more training for everyone and the flow of how the system works needed massive improvement! Sitting here is quite entertaining (pun intended), lots of conflicts and drama to watch.
71	0	d	Another place my OH friends brought me to that they frequent often. This place has an explosion of randomness from Krispee Kreme & Dairy Queen signs which I don't believe they sell. Some video game screen titles over the beer coolers & random decorations for the upcoming holiday. Their menus are on the back of album covers which is different.\nFood wise I'm told they have a special every month which my friends have tried & sound amazing. I had the Monte Cristo which is deep fried w\/ powdered sugar on top. It was amazing! Huge portions. The fries are okay, but their ranch I believe is home made.\nOne of my friends at the Parma which I got to try & it was so tasty! The cheese was melted perfectly w\/ the sandwich. The chicken didn't taste like any bar type food I had prior. \nAnother friend had the Godfather & he said it was like 'heaven in his mouth'. I chose not to try it as he seemed to not want to share w\/ the group, that's how good he thought it was. \nSlow service during peak hours, but very casual environment. Def wishing one of these would pop up in my neck of the woods on the west coast. Worth checking out!
72	1	d	We find this location to be a good instance of the chain and have never had issues here.  Our new puppy enjoyed his visits here as well.  There is ample selection of pet products for really most all of your needs.   The staff is friendly and helpful.   Of course,  Fonzy is so cute he has instant rock star status and the staff love when he visits. We'll continue shopping here for sure.
73	1	d	The concept of a fast food pasta was so weird to me, until I tried Piada! I love getting the pasta bowl with steak+pomodoro & basil pesto sauce. The portion size is also really, really big! A whole bowl lasts me about 2.5 meals. I've also tried the piada with calamari, but I think the pasta bowl is much worth the money. \n\nThey're also doing online order now, so it saves you the time from waiting in the longgg lines.
74	0	d	Old, tired, dark...but close to the airport.  The South Premium Outlets reminds me of the older, indoor malls in Buffalo with lotsa kiosks in the middle of the hall.\n\nAgain, as with any mall, check out the directory of the stores before you head out there.  Stores sounded promising, but when I actually got there, it's just soo dim inside, it threw me off.\n\nI literally went into 1 store and that was it for me.  No real deals there.
75	1	d	So the cupcake thing hasn't quite run its course yet. I'm fine with that. Where else you gonna get your cake fix without having to whip up an entire Betty Crocker? I'm also fine with being a guy that like cupcakes. There's nothing better than some butter cream in the beard.\n\nTiny little boutique bake shop in Tremont. It's cute, girlie and Pepto Bismol pink. Looks like they're also into the wedding cake thing judging from the looks of the place. Cookies on the shelves, too. They've got a nice selection of cupcakes from which to choose and they're all labeled - a simple but very appreciated act. I get so annoyed when bakeries and donuts shops don't label their products (hint hint Jack Frost!). Anyway, they've got the usual suspects including German chocolate, red velvet, strawberry, and vanilla. Some stand-outs include carrot, grasshopper (mint chocolate) and Signature (Cookie Monster face with a little cookie in his mouth).\n\nWe went with the German chocolate and peanut butter lovers. Moist cake, buttery smooth frosting and, at $2.50 each, priced right. I do like the \"down the middle\" application of the frosting that seems to be the trend right now. I've seen far too many cupcakeries miss the frosting:cake ratio. C&C gets it right. I still think that Campbell's in Ohio City has better cupcakes. Maybe it's because they're just a little bigger. Then again, Campbell's doesn't put frosting in the middle. I don't know. I'm torn. Anyway,   still a solid offering when you want a little sweet something and you're meandering around Tremont. Also good when you don't want to pay $8 for dessert at one of the local eateries.
76	1	d	This place is pretty bad.  The decor looks like the contractor went to Lowe's or Home Depot and bought all the \"fancy\" materials from the discontinued materials section (and just a note here to the management: really?  bathroom stall doors that go all the way to the floor?  Western civilization pivots on the ability to look down and see if there are feet under the door and thus realize that you have to wait a minute instead of jiggling the door handle like some pee-filled serial killer).  The service was equally uninspired -- my least favorite combination of ingratiatingly peppy and incompetent, and the food was mediocre when it got there. It took so long to appear at the table that I was sort of hoping that the cook had sent out for it from another restaurant, but no such luck.  And I only thought this might be the case because the menu says that the kitchen likes to get food from local sources. This might be technically true -- they might like it -- but there's not much evidence that they actually do it.  I think I can honestly say that the last time I experienced this kind of ambience I was in an airport restaurant.
77	0	d	Went on a Saturday evening.  Very few diners by six but the place was packed by eight.  The quality of the food was very good.  Inari sushi, agedashi tofu and veg tempura for appetizers.  Three of us had the special (sushi, ebi, salad, misoshiru soup, etc.) and one had the tonkatsu dinner.  While the quality was high, the portions left a lot to be desired.  Service was fine and the ambience was what I'd call neighborhood-comfortable.
78	0	d	A hodge-podge of bars, restaurants, small stores and street vendors of every sort. \nA nice vibe and place, a little something for everyone. \nNice taste of Pittsburgh.
79	1	d	Fun place to look around for all kinds of plants. They have a wide and extensive variety of merchandise. They even gave a lot of unique pots and metal lawn art. Super cute stuff! \nI came here to get ideas for replacing some old tired overgrown plants in my backyard. I was overwhelmed with the possibilities. The employees were kind and helpful without hovering. \nThere's chickens and roosters running about the property which made the experience shopping here most interesting! Lol. Very colorful. \nI will likely be back to purchase some plants. There prices seem competitive with the box stores and quality seems to be a little better on some items.  \n''Tis the season for planting in the Phoenix area!
80	1	d	I hate to do this but I have to.\n\nAbout a year ago when I got my first dog, Spencer, I was out for a walk with him when Sonny approached me with a business card. I don't know why at this point it never occurred to me that people provided services for dogs other than walks and house sitting since I travel sporadically for work.\n\nThe next time I had to leave I gave Sonny a call to see if he could take care of Spencer, he sent me a form to fill out and it was done. I was very pleased at how and quick easy the process was. I wasn't aware of any red flags at this point.\n\nI was a bit worried at first because Spencer is a gentle, cheerful dog and I feared (like most dog owners) that he may not come back the same but he did so I was happy.\n\nAs time went on, my schedule became so chaotic that I would find out I had to leave in 24-48hrs and it was great how accommodating Sonny was because he always took him in. The convenience of having someone take care of him on a whim was enough for me to totally overlook some problems that began to arise.\n\nA few examples.\n\nWhen it was time to pick him up, we ALWAYS called before pick up...\nThey would tell us to come by later at hourly increments at a time. \nFor instance, we'd give a 6pm pick up time (which he would agree to), if we were running late we'd call and confirm for 6:30pm pick up. \nHe would then tell us to call at 7pm, we'd call at 7pm, he wouldn't pick up or respond for another 20 minutes or so then call back telling us to come by at 8pm. \n\nThere have been times he'd hold us off for about three hours, other times he'd tell us to come by the next day. Eventually he would say that he's out getting groceries, that Michelle is closing up the shop and that he'd let us know when one of them was back. Interesting... Now I'm under the impression that sometimes the dogs aren't even supervised, maybe it's been this way all along hence all the delays when picking him up?\n\nAfter a while, it seemed like they didn't want us entering the house, we'd knock or call when we were at the door and they'd bring Spencer out. This made me a bit uncomfortable because I felt as though they may have been hiding something and\/or they didn't care to have us sit down and talk\/give feedback on Spencer's interactions or behaviour.\nSpencer would also REAK of dog soil. I managed to convince myself that it's a dog kennel so he's bound to stink but in retrospect something is very wrong over there.\n\nThe last few times I went to them to board Spencer wasn't too long ago and when things took a serious nose dive.\n\nThe second last time Spencer was there, he came home with a very strange residue all over his fur from his head to his tail that was very difficult to get off. I suspect another dog marked him while they weren't supervised. Of course, picking him up was a pain in the ass as usual but we were used to it by now.\n\nThe very last time I ever allowed my dog to be in the care of Sonny and Michelle, I texted Sonny (since he never picks up) the moment I got back and asked when would be a good time to pick him up. \nTo which he responded...GET THIS... that the dogs were at the house (not the daycare...I still wonder why) with his PARENTS, he added that his parents were \"in and out\" that day, that he had called them, they didn't pick up and that he left a message. Didn't even answer the question as to when I could pick him up. How reassuring!\nThen I ask if today isn't a good day.\nHe replies that that day was fine and that he just wasn't sure with his flighty parents. What?\nThese excuses were a load of bull and I expressed my concern to him about Spencers wellbeing. He assured me that he was fine, reminded me that his parents are just in and out, that Michelle will be home at 6:30pm at the latest. He added that he still hadn't heard from his parents so I asked, no one is watching them?\nHe finally calls me and explains that he is up north, Michelle is at the day care and the dogs were left with his \"flighty\" parents at the house.\n\nHM\n\nI finally pick the dog up at 6:30pm sharp bring him home and guess what? His tail is blue. Yeah, that's right, his tail is fucking blue. I examine it--I stare at it, I touch it, smell it and it is INK from a pen. What the hell happened that he got ink on his tail? I have no idea. Any explanation? No, just handed him back like nothing happened. My boyfriend and I have tried calling them about it and still we've had no response.\n\nRecently at the vet, I learned Spencer never had a bordetella shot because I didn't ask for it (I didn't know dogs needed it to board) because Sonny didn't blink an eye when I gave him the papers.\n\nThey claim to treat your pet like one of their own--yeah--leave them alone hours at a time unsupervised is what they mean. The only flighty people in this situation is them and as far as I'm concerned this is just a cash grab, nothing more.\n\nDon't let cheap prices and \"convenience\" suck you in like it did me. Have your dog crated when unsupervised too.
81	0	d	The pho is probably the second best in the valley. I typically go to the egg roll factory in Chandler but when I'm up in Scottsdale this location is not only the busiest but the tastiest pho. So spring rolls are good but the peanut sauce is not sweet enough. I haven't tried the sandwiches yet but the FO is good.
82	1	d	Methinks not is right. This place continues to disappoint. The food is overpriced and I don't know why I came back here, especially since the last time I swore this place off forever. Silly me. I ordered the steak salad, which comes with lettuce, steak, and then you get to add all of your toppings like cheese, salsa, beans etc. They asked if I wanted any dressing for my salad, I said I would take the chipotle ranch. The lady gives me a smalll 2 oz cup of dressing for a large salad. I asked for another dressing AFTER I paid, so they wouldn't attempt to charge me. Well the joke's on me, that ranch was DISGUSTING. It was probably some Sysco brand goop, mixed with ass, it was horrible!  I had already poured most of it onto my salad, so I couldn't eat anything more. I debated whether or not to ask for a refund, but figured I would just chalk it up as a loss and never return. One of the only things I did like about this place is they have the Freestyle Coke machine, but everyone has that now and even still if they were the only restaurant in the world that had that machine, I wouldn't step foot in this place again. I mean it this time.

84	1	d	I bought a deal on Angie's list for a garage door tune-up for $35. I thought the price was good and after the work Lonnie did I am happy with the price of the deal and the quality of the work.\nI was contacted by their office girl to schedule an appointment almost immediately after I purchase the deal. I don't remember her name but she was very pleasant to deal with and I got an appointment for the day and time I requested.\nLonnie from A1 Garage Door Service called ahead of time to notify he is on his way exactly like I was promised. My appointment window was 12-2 and Lonnie was here at 12. \nHe was professional, knowledgeable, very thorough and friendly. He answered all my questions and addressed my concerns. He checked the door alignment and all the hinges. He sprayed all the metal parts with a greaser and lubricated the hinges with a paste. He kept on checking for the noise reduction and smoother operation by opening and shutting the garage door repeatedly. He didn't stop until the majority of the noise and shaking of the door disappeared. Lonnie said it will even get better in a few days as the opening and shutting of the door will help to spread the grease into all the dry areas while pushing out the dust which cause  a lot of the noise. He also recommended a change of the plastic rollers that are currently on the door to nylon ball bearing rollers which according to him will make the operation so much more quiet. He informed me of the price that A1 charges for the rollers w\/install and lifetime guarantee. I will consider.
85	0	d	If I could give 0 stars for this business I would!  Was totally ripped off!!!\nTook my car in to have NC Inspection.  While waiting, I could hear yelling coming from the service area.  After waiting 35-40 minutes the manager,  Will, came out and told me my car did not pass inspection and I needed new tires for it to pass. ( I had already been told by another employee they were fine).  I told Will that and he said \n\"well they won't pass for NC\". I left without buying tires.  Went around the corner to another place of business and had my car inspected and it passed! No problems with the tires. Later  in the afternoon I received a car from the gentleman that does the state inspections for this Tire Kingdom.  He apologized to me and told me my car was really okay to pass inspection including the tires but his boss, Will, had told him to fail me so I would buy tires.  Inspector refused to fail me since it really was ok and that is what all the yelling I heard from the service area was about. He told me he could not go on knowing that I had been  cheated. He said he had to do what his boss said even though he is the one that is certified to do the inspections- NOT WILL.  Kudos for an honest person there even though the manager is a crook.  I made a complaint to Corporate and have had several conversations with someone \nfrom Corp.  They admitted Will was wrong and should not have done that!   \n\nHOWEVER, Will is still the manager there so BEWARE!  \n\nI was taken advantage of by  this business just so Will could sell some tires.  What does it say about the company that keeps someone like this on as an employee and especially as a manager!!???   \nANOTHER BEWARE- I went on Better Business Bureau  site to file a complaint.  You may want to read about this company on the BBB site before you think about doing business with them.
86	1	d	We had a picnic here with a group from church and we had an absolute blast. The owners were very kind to us and extremely accommodating. It was a super rainy day and the lifeguards had left but when our kids expressed interest in swimming the owner sat out in the rain to lifeguard until one of the lifeguards returned. We are so thankful for their kindness and because of them being so accommodating to us we were able to have a blast even though the weather was crummy.
87	1	d	The first time I went here I got a cappuccino and it tasted burned and most of it was foam.  The second time I went here I got a cappuccino and this time it was better, it had less of a burned flavor and more coffee this time.  Needless to say not sure ill be back anytime soon.
88	1	d	Are you kidding me? $58. for a 2 night resortless, resort fee? That's more than half the price of the room charge!! \nThis is a hotel casino... No resort here! \n  Linq is like like spirit airlines. They charge $55. for a carry-on and $50. for the first checked bag. \n Get a players card and stay somewhere else.  You'll probably get a comp
89	1	d	My husband and I have been working out here for about 2 years, him more regularly than I have. One of the best gyms I've been to, it's bigger than a Snap or Anytime Fitness, but not the insane meat market that is LVAC. The gym is always very clean, rarely crowded and has excellent equipment. The owners are serious about fitness and lifting, and that's evident in the equipment they've chosen and how it's maintained. We recently moved so unfortunately, its no longer really possible for me to workout there, but my husband will probably continue to go here regardless because he likes it so much. They also play pretty decent music. I do wish they had a second squat rack, because occasionally you get someone who hogs it up for 20-30 minutes and it really messes up your workout.  Other than that or if the facility was a little bigger, I would definitely give them 5 stars. Also, Our old gym had TV's on each piece of cardio equipment and that was a nice option, but sometimes the tv's wouldn't work or would have static - so it's not the end all-be all. Overall a fantastic gym.
90	0	d	Today was my first time eating at Served.   I had the pleasure to meet the Chef\/Owner.   Chef Matthew is doing some crazy good things with this inventive menu!   I had the Roasted Pork Belly Bahn Mi and it was one of the best I've had.  Besides the sandwiches you can find some really interesting and creative takes on familiar items such as Oaxacan Braised Short Rib.  This spot is worth your time!!!
91	0	d	This place is very inconsistent. IDK if they use ingredients from different places or if they don't follow a recipe or what the deal is.  But today was my 3rd time in and my food AGAIN tasted different! \nThat's the kind of thing that drives me NUTS!
92	1	d	First of all the address on your website leads customers to an old location. Secondly although it says \" open now \" on the website  the store is closed! \n\nDon't think I will ever trust cox for my communication needs when they can't get their own communication correct !
93	1	d	This is, hands down, my favorite hidden hole-in-the-wall in Charlotte.  The problem is, it's not that big a secret anymore.  Pull up any evening and see the yuppie smattering of BMWs and SUVs lining the parking spaces at the front of this little unassuming building that houses such a number of tasty eats.  Add to that it's at the intersection of Eastway and Shamrock and the contrast is only that much more apparent.  That's right true Charlotteans- Eastway and Shamrock!  Double-check your locks before you head inside for some true Vietnamese delights.\n\nAs any regular knows, the place is actually run by a head female server who knows her customers to a fault and greets you with hugs and an almost scary photographic memory of what you like to eat and drink.  The top steak houses in the city can keep track of my visits all they want, but they still can't recite and confirm my order for me before I've even slid into one of the booths to prepare for the meal to come.  I kinda of like that, even if it locks me in before I've perused the menu.  Luckily, I've carved out a trio of favorites that the head server runs thru before we send the order back to the kitchen.  \n\nHighlights include summer rolls- tender rice paper wraps fresh shrimp mixed with greens, bean sprouts and mint leaves.  The star here, though, is really the peanut dipping sauce.  I unabashedly lick the little blow clean and have yet to find the equivalent anywhere else.  It adds the perfect mix of tang and savory to contrast with the fresh earthiness of the greens and mint leaves in the roll.  I could make a whole meal out of these.\n\nFor mains, I'm a big time fan of the lemongrass curries.  Be it chicken or tofu, the flavor here rules- delicate lemongrass with the base heat and pungency of curry.  The balance is near-perfect and I find myself using the side dish of rice to soak up every bit of the sauce.  The fresh cilantro on top is like icing on this cake.  I even love that you have the pull the herb's leaves off to mix in yourself- you control the strength of that element.\n\nOn colder nights, I also advocate the clay pot house special.  It's a mix of meats served with vegetables and a rice cooked in a savory tomato base all melding together in a very hot clay pot.  It warms me up and is one of those \"stick to your ribs\" dishes that leaves me full.\n\nMeals are always finished off with a check and a couple mini peanut butter cookies, thicker than they are wider.  Nice and cakey, without being overly sweet.  You also get a tamarind hard candy, wrapped and perfect to open later.  On the weekends you also get the most wonderful sesame bun with a sweet bean curd filling.  I would threaten to cut my dining companions if they shut me out on this last piece, it is served hot and I could eat dozen if they'd let me.\n\nIn short, you get a get a mix of fresh herbs and savory sauces that are really perfect together.  The menu is many, many pages long, but do not fear- just tell the server what you like and trust in her.  \n\nYes, the prices here are a notch above what you might expect, but I have found portion sizes to be generous and the wife and I get by usually sharing a single entree, especially after each having a couple of summer rolls.  The service, though, is especially efficient and expedient, even a single sip of water tends to generate a refill within seconds.  I can deal with that.  If you drink iced tea, they bring you a whole mini pitcher just for yourself.  Beware- I find their tea is brewed really strong and the sweet tea- well, hope you like the sugar you true Southerner, you.\n\nIf I had one complaint here, it's the soundtrack that is on endless loop.  Jazzy elevator music classics that are cheesier than any dish you will find on the menu.  I swear every time I walk in I am \"treated\" to \"My heart will go on\" the Titanic theme song and the theme song from Bonanza- all in the mellow, jazz style that is meant to stay in the background but ends up being that gnat in your ear that just won't go away.\n\nStill, I don't come hear to enjoy the tunes.  I come to enjoy the food, and that, my friends, is superbly executed here.
94	1	d	This is not my favorite place to get my car inspected. It is certainly not that clean, the employees are not friendly but the inspection only took 15 minutes and I passed. They tried to sell my some fluids and light bulbs, etc. I had some fluids in my back seat and asked them to help me and they refused. Probably wont be back.
95	1	d	Usually I am stuck at Zara's on Long Island standing there while my wife tries on various items. So when I saw a Zara in the mall I said to my wife \"no way, we are on vacation, you can model clothes for me to look at back home.\" But she says to me that this Zara is unisex, so I say, oh ok cool. Twenty minutes later...I am standing in Zara, watching her try on new clothes.Damn my wife and her shopping trickery!
96	0	d	Finally got to try their popcorn chicken!\n\nCrispy on the outside. Juicy on the inside. At $4.99, the portion was not bad. Made fresh to order. Cute place. Like that they have the fake food display of their menu items. Hope they stay in business for a long time.\n\nI'll be back to try their $3.49 minced pork on rice.
97	1	d	From my first visit to this one, it was a definite turn around.  I met a friend here for Friday Happy Hour.  Unfortunately we found out it was their last Friday night with HH but it was certainly memorable.  \n\nWe decided to start off with their Cheese Plate.  This cheese board was one of the best assortments.  Creamy blue cheese, brie, truffled parmesan, aged parmesan, homemade jam, fruit and toast.  Each cheese sang a different melody.  It was simply amazing!\n\nMy Yelp friend and I also opted to share some of their dishes: Caesar Salad, Lump Crab Cakes and Cavatelli & Short Ribs.  The caesar was very large and fresh.  The large salad was plenty to share with leftovers as well.  The fresh parmesan crisp in the center gave it a great flavor.  The 2 crab cakes were a delight with the lemon aioli.  The lemon kicked it up a notch with the real crab.  The cavatelli & short rib had a unique flavor that was my winner of the evening.  It was a wonderful pasta and meat dish that is delicately sprinkled with fresh parmesan.  Everything sitting on our table would be highly recommended for another order.  \n\nService here does not go unnoticed.  Our waitress, Jenna, provided such attentiveness and gratitude.  Her friendly professional attitude completed the wonderful evening.  I hope they bring back the happy hour again soon as I would love to enjoy their delectable dishes!
98	1	d	My family and I dined at RM Seafood on Christmas of 2009 (this review is long overdue). Even though this meal was nearly five years ago, I remember it to be quite pleasant and enjoyable, although incredibly overpriced. I have no recollection of what my father or I ordered, but I do remember my sister ordered the \"BLT\" Iceberg Salad (currently priced at $14) and at the age of 14, she was surprised when a giant chunk of iceberg lettuce was placed in front of her, and she realized she had to eat the salad with a knife and fork. My mom had gotten the Maine Lobster, which was market priced and around $80 at that time. Even though it was delicious, my mom realized she could get the same Maine Lobster over at Red, White & Blue for almost half the price at $50. Since RWB is no longer open, I guess if we ever stay at Mandalay Bay again, we're going to have to go to RM Seafood for good, albeit pricey, lobster.
99	0	d	First trying this place .pretty dam good I must say food has lots of flavor definitely comeing back again . But it's going to be awhile cause the portion where so big
100	0	d	We have now been here 9 times and i can honestly say that it is an absolute gem, every time we have been we have had a new server but still a fantastic service, this is not a typical Vegas place this is not a strip property this is a legit mom and pop store with great ambience outstanding service and lets not forget the food which is absolutely spot on, consistently good and delicious!\n\nA must to try is the white fish Ceviche for a starter, the portion is generous and it is just a fantastic dish.\n\nWe have tried a lot here and again it has all been great, if you have the chance please don't miss the opportunity to dine here, i don't care if you are a tourist or local this is a great place.
101	0	d	Went here for lunch, the hostess seemed to be out there not quite awake, the food was good but the service was the worse I've ever had. We waited close to an hour for our food because we were told the big group was ahead of us yet we put our order in before they were seated......we had to ask for silverware, then napkins and then ketchup.....our waitress acted like we were putting her out by asking for these things.....we weren't the only ones waiting forever the table next to us that we were talking with were waiting forever also.......will never go back would never recommend this place to anyone
102	1	d	Lovely dining experience overall. Set menus 2 to choose from, and an additional special menu. $150pp and up. I had the special, truffles for $200. Very generous with the truffles on every dish.  I had an opportunity to taste from the other menu that was also ordered at the table.  The oysters topped with caviar were absolutely divine!  Top two in my book!  Friend said the risotto was the best he had ever had. After so many courses the entree was quite large. I wasn't able to finish all my food. I was very full and satisfied. We had a show to catch and the waiters were great getting us out on time.  We were not served any dessert from our menus. A little disappointed about that. Only enough time to serve the birthday cake we brought in for our celebrant.  Would love to come here again.
103	1	d	This is my new favorite place for Dim Sum in the valley.  We have dim sum at least once a month and have tried Great Wall, Golden Buddha, China King and C-Fu gourmet.  I believe that Phoenix Palace is the best of the bunch.\n\nHere is why:\n1.  Food quality:  Every dish was prepared perfectly.  Most were slightly above the other restaurants in term of taste.  There were exceptions (we like the shrimp stuffed eggplant best at C-Fu, and the chow mein better at Golden Buddha), but in general, this place was better.\n2.  Cleanliness:  Not that other places are not clean, but this place was spotless\n3.  Price:  We order almost the same thing at most dim sum restaurants as we have our favorite dishes.  We ordered more than usual here this morning to try some things (10 dishes total) and our bill was $25.78.  We usually average $33-$35 at the other places, and we brought quite a bit home\n4.  Selection:  I have seen that the selection has decreased at the other places as their clientele diminishes.  For instance at Golden Buddha, one of the original dim sum places in the valley, you would wait at least 30 minutes if you did not get there before 11am.  Now it seems that the place is barely full, regardless of when you arrive.  As a result, the selection seems to have gone down.  At Phoenix Palace, we simply could not order everything.  When we left, there were still many things that we had still not tried.  We also had a few things that we had never had before (very surprising since we have dim sum so often)\n5.  Location:  I live in the Ahwatukee area, so this is slightly closer than Golden Buddha, and far closer than Great Wall.
104	0	d	I recently moved to Vegas from NYC and took my time to find a good hair stylist. Going for 5 years to the same person to get your hair done makes you not want to rush to switch to someone else. I found Raul through his website and, of course, numerous of excellent reviews on Yelp.\nI couldn't wish for a better result. He did an amazing job! Worth spending 3 hours in that chair:)\nRaul has a great personality, is very friendly but on a professional level. From now on I'll trust my hair to him only! Very happy about finding and meeting you, Raul. Thank you!
105	0	d	Foot massage? Ha, it was like a cotton candy ball being thrown at my feet. Then they charged me twice. Worst pedicure I have had.
106	1	d	I came in today to get something really small (spare key) and browsed the aisles looking to do some research on mini fridges. The brands available is very limited in this niche category (Magic Chef and another brand I never heard of).\n\nI really don't like the design of any of them, as the tiny freezer in these is 99% to say there is a \"freezer\" and that is it. But walking around checking this and the full size fridge, I came upon a 3.5 cu tf mini fridge with green tag marked down, and is \"damaged\".  At a regular price of $160, and discounted to  $100, it was a decent deal I couldn't pass up.\n\nAfter deciding to buy it, 2 store associates assisted me in locating a cart and loading it, so I can get it from the back of the store to the checkout counters. Once I paid and was outside, another associate saw me in the parking lot and helped me load it into the backseat of my car.  So service was great today.\n\nSo far pleased with my most recent trip to The Home Depot.   4 stars.
107	1	d	Singaporean food! I was craving for something different & this was a good mix of asian food. Located off the end of the strip. Definitely a hidden little gem next to other shops that aren't even restaurants. Small parking lot.\n\n* Ordered:\n- Chicken Bacon Truffle Burger (4\/5 stars): Talk about egg porn! This was one of their off the menu specials & the fact that I'm not much of a fan of bacon in my burger, the egg drew me to ordering this. Anything with \"truffle\" in it, you already know it's going to be a crazy combination of other food in the burger. I loved how it was served with potato chips & a large sliced pickle. It balances out the salty part of the burger to sour to sweet. \n\n- One buttermilk fried chicken bao (4\/5 stars): This is the main reason why we went here! What was deceiving was the portion size. I didn't know it would be a mini size until they asked if I wanted one or two. It seemed like a snack to others, but this could be just another meal if you order 2. Crispy, buttery, & soft on the bun side. Thankful we decided on this!\n\n- #3 Roasted Spring Chicken with Rice (4\/5 stars): AH! Such a good plate filled with both rice, chicken, & lemon with seasoning to squeeze all over. I love the way they roasted the chicken. It was perfect to its crisp.\n\n- Milk Green Tea & Vietnamese coffee (5\/5 stars): These 2 drinks were first served to us & I almost finished it before the food even got to us! SO good! The milk green tea was not just any green tea, it was very mellow on the milky side. I loved it! Same goes for the Vietnamese coffee. Something to keep us awake throughout the day yet very light on the coffee side.\n\n* Service (4\/5 stars):\nShout out to LIZ! She was our sweetest waitress! She acknowledged our outfits & conversed with us like any other customers dining in. She deserves the full 5\/5 stars for her friendly service, checking up on us, & made us feel welcome. As for the girl who took our order at the register, she didn't seem pleased to serve us. Simply took our order & gave our number, nothing too dramatic, just no expression of a smile & kept talking to her coworkers. They have a \"House Rules\" posted & it seems as though to help them better, TAKE YOUR ORDERS TO GO! It's such a small dine in that it's understandable that they'd love to serve everyone but simply can't because they do not have the space for it. \"To go is helping you, help us, help you\"\n\nOh & rule number 9, when you're in Vegas though... \"No shirt. No shoes. No service.\" Straight up & simple!
108	1	d	Scott L's review holds true. There once was a \"Judy\". She was the nicest little old Italian lady and she made one of the meanest pizza's I ever had the chance to enjoy. Ahhhh old memories. \n\nUnfortunately, the time came for her to sell the place. Skip forward to present time and ya, it's crap. Wouldn't eat here if it was the last place that sold food. \n\nAvoid at all costs. Surprised they're still open though lol , who the hell eats here?
109	1	d	Been using this company for OVER a year. They finally ruined my opinion of them by using the \"bait and switch\" technique that so many carpet cleaning businesses are infamous for. Charged me an extra fee for something which they have always included as part of the service (steaming the area rug in my one bedroom apartment). The technicians flat out said they don't clean rugs, when I called Brent to find out what on earth was happening he claimed they \"never do it without an extra charge and noting in on the paperwork.\" Well that is funny, seeing as how they have always done it with the regular carpet cleaning without any extra charge or issue, and why is it my problem that they haven't included it in the paperwork? How on earth would I be privy to what should and should not be included? Brent said it always has to be noted in their service and it has never been noted in mine... At this point he was basically implying that I was lying about the fact that they have always included cleaning the rug at no extra fee, when in truth I was completely unaware of this \"policy\". \n\nIdk what the guy wanted me to say, every team has ALWAYS cleaned it, without question, so this entire time I have been under the impression that it was simply part of their service (which was great up until the last two visits where things have really gone downhill.) This is an example of yet another company trying to make an extra buck by surprising their clients with new charges that simply did not exist before, at least not to the client's knowledge. Surprise! \n\nUnfortunate, because I have been a client for so long and everything started off so well. Brent wasn't even the least bit concerned over my situation or surprised by it, instead he told me it would be $10 dollars. That is where the customer service started and ended, not even a canned apology or \"our mistake,\" just an attitude of \"it is what it is, get over it and pay us.\" Thanks guys, really fantastic service you're doing.
110	1	d	Decided to try this place after reading the Yelp reviews.  \n\nLocation is the dumpy, divey, sketchy Twain Avenue at Palos Verdes St.  I've never witnessed anything violent there, but there are plenty of derelict-looking people standing and shuffling around on the street, so you may feel uneasy.  I wouldn't let it deter you from visiting, however; they seem harmless.\n\nPizza quality was pretty good; definitely better than the Palermo's location located across the street.  It was also ready in the 15 minutes it was promised.
111	1	d	This place just opened on Parc, and it already feels like home. It smells like fresh donuts and coffee, which is how I want every place to smell. The donuts are traditional Russian style, which makes them smaller and lighter than what you might be used to.  They are light and sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. They are made to order and fried in front of your eyes, which makes them super fresh. The coffee is fresh and supplied by 49th Parallel (a Vancouver-based roaster). I had a double-shot espresso with a thick crema and a sweet aftertaste, and I loved it. \n\nThe atmosphere in here is also really welcoming. Floor to ceiling windows, the shiny blue floors, and fresh white walls give this place tons of natural light. It's the perfect place to meet friends or read a book, and there is even a huge bookcase of take-one-leave-one books and board games for patrons to enjoy. Almost all of the tables were up-cycled and renovations done by Boris and Grant themselves, two of the smilest guys on the planet.\n\nCome in for a quick coffee and donut, or stay and make friends. Either way, you'll love Chez Boris and all of its delights.
112	0	d	Fantastic. Amazing, amazing show!!!
113	1	d	Service that went above and beyond excellent!  The food was great too. \n\nMy father is the most high maintenance customer that ever came into a restaurant, in other words he is a huge pain in the ass. He thinks it is clever to ask for a plate of lemons, squeezes all of them into his water, adds sweet n low, and is proud he got free lemonade. He is also hyper critical of servers and demanding with no regard to everything they do. Don't even get me started on how he hits on female waitresses. Hey, I love my dad, but he is no picnic. I just wanted to give a little exposition so you would understand how fantastic the service was.\n\nThe waiter actually took the time to pay attention to my dad's unfunny comments as my mom and I cringed in embarrassment, even though I'm sure he had things to do. He made a decent wine by the glass recommendation for me, and gave me great ordering advice when I was wavering. He kept all our our drinks filled and the table cleaned as we finished things like soup and bread. We never wanted for anything from soup to dessert!\n\nThe lobster bisque was delicious, I had the Pappas Greek Salad, which was great, and prepared table side with flair. My parents split the Tilapia, which they loved, and the waiter brought them two plates without them even asking; thank God.\n\nSince it was my mom's birthday we did dessert as well. Thank god I had soup and salad. Of course my dad had to ask for my mom's dessert to be comped in front of her since it was her birthday...classy. My mom and I both had the crème brulee, which was not the best I've ever had, but still pretty good crème brulee.\n\nOur waiter was friendly, patient, attentive, and overall fabulous! Seriously, who knew service would be this wonderful here?  I will be back for sure!!!
114	0	d	WE were here in Las Vegas to play in a  All World's Softball Tourney for the weekend. This place is a nice place to play at. They have replica fields that include Yankee Stadium, Crosley Field, Angels Field as well as others. The ball park is spacious and very clean, They have Batting cages for baseball and softball.  Food and drink can be found around the park, they are a little above the average price and the food is ok. They great fields to play on and they do keep the park clean, This was a great place to play in and we will be back for the next event here.
115	1	d	It's at the far end of the strip, and it's not completely \"vegasy\". Which I liked. Not a lot of fanfare, no tiger shows, no dolphin habitats, no magicians, no roller coaster, no celebrity shows, no fancy restaurant. \nIt never got too crowded, and taxi's were always available to snag.\n\nAvoid the check out lines and use your t.v. remote to pay your bill.\n\nThe only downside was the pool area. Tiny, crowded, and no waterfalls. :(
116	1	d	I have found the rest of the stolen relics of ancient China! It's at the lobby of this Buffet on York Mills...\n\nDragon's Pearl has to be the most ridiculous restaurant I have ever been in all the GTA. At first I was deterred from coming here, because the flyer I received in the mail had spelling mistakes. But to quote my friend Chris: \"Usually restaurants with spelling mistakes have good food, because they won't waste time trying to spell things, and just focus on the food.\"\nWhat a load of bollocks...\nSo I've come here twice so far, and it's a miracle I've made it out alive both times. \n\nThere is always somehow a crowd of people hanging out by the door, even when there is no wait..there they are. Did someone pay them to loiter here so it appears that reservations are hard to come by?\nBy the lobby, I was met by the heads of the twelve animals of the Chinese Zodiac. The replicas of the relics that Britain stole from China and refuse to return which was featured in the news? Well, the Chinese news anyway.\nThere were swarms of people waiting for a table, and immediately I regretted not making reservations. However, we were sat upon arrival because there were only two of us. Walking in the venue for the first time is a \"trip\" itself. The spine of the chairs at the long tables were taller than I was, there are elevated tables on boats, and four round booth that were bird cages. The other tables had chairs so heavy, I struggled like I suffered from obesity simply trying to stand up to get more food as the arm rests kept getting in the way. Some buffets discourage you from eating more by adding MSG or other things to the food, I guess this one discouraged you using shame...\nThere are European chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, but the furniture were oriental. Wood everywhere like it was cabin fever, and busts of the strange blue statue outside with swirly tits hanging from the walls. I asked a waitress what the blue thing was, and she just smiled at me. If I were apart of the blue man crew, I'd be talking to my Lawyer.\nThe entire place felt like a theme park, they even give you an individual \"lobster ticket\" before seating. A voucher for lobster....food ticket, literally. I felt like I was back in 1992 Communist China, lunchtime. \nNothing matched, it was horribly eclectic. It were as if the designer had Mad Décor Disorder. Picture: Columbus arriving in Asia, and the first person he met was Tim Burton.\n\nNormally, buffet stations are set separately. At this place, it's all one sided, stretching across the entire length of the restaurant, which is a traffic catastrophe. It was the Great Wall of Dragon's Pearl. You vouch for your lobster at the beginning of the line, this is a huge tack, but most other buffets never offer lobster..so it's forgiven.\nI've forgotten about the unusual design of this place once at the Great Wall..I mean food station. There is so much food! A handsome selection of seafood, a sushi station where the chefs behind the counter doesn't have to feel ashamed about, and even a Peking Duck point! \nThe desserts and salad bar weren't too shabby either. At the end, there is a noodle pulling station. Which means everything was fresh. But I didn't bother with that, because I just don't have the stomach for it after slobbering my plate. The quality of the food is a bit above other buffets as well, and there is a completely boring projection on the wall while you're getting your food...for no apparent reason.\n\nAt this rate, you'd expect the service to fall short, but it just doesn't. Napkins and refills came regularly, most of the time without having to ask for it. Even the ambient music here was tolerable. This is what would happen if Chef Ramsay opened an 'All you can eat' joint. There is simply very little to complain about. \nYes, I felt fatter each time I struggle to stand up from my seat.\nYes, the concept of a lobster ticket is as kitsch as it gets.\nYes, getting the food made me feel like I was in a concentration camp.\nBut it's all good! I strike fear in the hearts of places like Mandarin and Buffet King, but Dragon's Pearl laughs at me, as I've never been able to get beyond three plates, and still have enough endurance for dessert. \nYes, this was like a endurance test. Like a Marathon, only the opposite. \n\nThe second time we came here, after paying the bill we saw our friend at another table getting up for food with his girlfriend. So we quickly went to their table and sat down, confusing the hell out of the waitresses. When they came back, we pretended to look through the drinks menu, which sent them looking for their tables until they realized what we've done. That's the kind of euphoric state I am rendered to after dining here. Don't park your car too far from the entrance, you won't make it back if you do.\nOh, you can also buy jewelry here..?\n\n\nDragon's Pearl. I would hate to see the size of the oyster that dragon had to swallow just to get to that pear
117	1	d	We lost power to half the house after calling several companies that advertised 24 hr service this is the only company that even answered the phone. They got here very quickly the tech was very knowledgeable he found the problem almost right away and even more shocking they had the part in the shop so very happy they had our power up and going in no time I would have paid double what I was charged to get my power back so I was extremely happy with the prices and even more happy with the tech will definitely use again and tell everybody I know.
118	1	d	Dislike, dislike, and dislike! This place is cheap for a Vegas buffet, $10.99 AYCE, but service seriously sucks. Came here with a group of 9 and we only had half of the party there, yet they already expected us to pay up front 18% gratuity already. Um...no. How do they expect their customer to pay before they even sit down. Heck no, they better sit us down or we will just peace out.\n\nAfter 10 minutes of 'fixing the issue' we sat down and ate. Nothing special at all here other than it's cheap. There's breakfast (bacon, eggs, hash brown, toast and etc) meats (ham or roasted beef, pretty big piece and chewy). Soup (chowder or chicken noodle were mehs) Big selection of greens at the salad bar. A plate and a half, we were done. \n\nWhen we were about to leave and just calculating our bill with each other standing up, freakin lady was already creeping behind us REMINDING us about the 18% gratuity... -_- seriously? Half of our group left, including me without a hesitant about the tip and left. Well deserve tip is when there's a well service to customers. This will be our last taste at the Terrible's.
119	1	d	Let me start this review by saying, I was here on a convention with 12 other people from my organization.  The night we went here to dine, we asked for seating for 12.  The rude ass lady said, \"You will only be able to pay with one check and the 20% tip would automatically be added to any parties having more than 6 people.\"\nWe said we would all like to pay with separate checks and we were here having a convention and their one card \"rule\" wouldn't be possible.  She then grabbed a menu and shoved in our faces pointing out the 20% tip for more than 6 people.  Saying , \" See its the rules!\"  Granted it did say that about the tip, not a big deal.  The issue was 1 card per group.  So stupid. We then asked to seat us in 3 groups of 4 people.  She sure did.  Each group was seated in 3 separate corners of the restaurant.  What a BIOTCH!\nAfter the shit storm of attitude from the \"hostess\", we placed our food order and got some drinks.  The food was great, but pricey.  The drink was beer, also pricey.  The waiter was a bit friendlier than the rude ass hostess.  \nIt was the only time I ate there in a week of my stay.  Even if I go back to the hotel, I will not be eating in this place.\nRude is apparently the only way these staff know how to act.   BAH
120	0	d	Just came in for lunch and got AYCE lunch for $21. Sushi was amazing, service was fast, and quality was excellent! \nWill definitely return in the future.
121	1	d	If you're in a pinch and you need something for your dog this is the place to go. The staff is helpful when you can find someone and they have a decent selection of dog toys, food, and leashes and other walking apparel. If you're looking to buy your dog toys there are several other better options in the neighborhood I think there one place is called discount dog toys are discount puppy. They do dog training here but from what I've heard it's not very expensive and it doesn't work very well. I found the doing some research and going on Amazon and purchasing doggy treats is more cost effective and just generally more effective. Also parking can be a disaster since it's in the same parking lot as Walmart so you may want to go at a time that's not very busy or where no one else is going to be there like the evening time.
122	0	d	Everything was amazing including Lobby bar EXCEPT construction that started right above our unit at 8am.  My toddler was still sleeping from a 12 hour travel day.  My husband called front desk only to be told it's not above our unit which was incorrect lol Then they offered us to move.  My son is sleeping so no I don't want to move.  The noise continued.  I wish they booked us in another room to begin with:(. I love the Hilton but this was certainly not the best stay...
123	0	d	I have yet to try something at Yoli's that I did not enjoy. The chorizo skillet, green eggs & ham omelet, French toast, and cheddar biscuits are just a few highlights. My bf & I have been going here for Sunday breakfast for over 6 months now, we love it...the courtyard, the food, the staff, the ladies singing in the kitchen! :) The only reason I hesitated before giving a 5 star review is the more people that try it, the less chance I have of getting my favorite window table on Sunday.
124	0	d	Incredible.  \n\nYeah the portions are smaller than most restaurants (who overfeed us anyway) but it is WORTH it.  My husband got the four cheese ravioli with meatballs and I ordered the White corn agnolotti with lobster and it was so delicious and unlike anything I had tasted before.  They were a delicate pasta with a hint of corn and truffles with tender pieces of lobster that melt in your mouth.  \n\nAbsolutely mouth watering.  The bread the waiter brought was delightful, with an assortment of what I believe was French bread, sour dough, and a unique and tangy olive bread.  \n\nNot to mention the alluring atmosphere of a French street paired with \"street\" performers in the form of a flutist and violinist.  Very romantic and classy.\n\nWolfgang puck lives up to his hype with this winner of a restaurant.
125	1	d	411 for CPR- AED - First Aid classes for Red Cross Las Vegas location.\n\nThose with busy schedules and visual learners will benefit taking the online plus classroom training. Sign up and pay for the course online.  It's $90.  Make sure you can make it!! If you cancel you lose that $90 or it costs more to reschedule....something screwy like that,\n\nThe online course requires you have high speed internet and the latest pc to view the course. I have the latest Surface Pro PC and high speed internet thru cable company and still had just a couple moments where parts of the video kept buffering, Took about total 3 hours to complete in between my busy schedule.\n\nScheduling one that's right for you is easy. Go online here:\nhttp:\/\/www.redcross.org\/take-a-class\/cpr\nI like they have classes held on Sundays, more convenient for me.\n\nDont forget bring to print copy of your online certificate saying you took and passed the online course! \n\nSkills part is held in classroom setting at the Flamingo location. Take elevator to second floor, I believe it's Suite 206 you'll be looking for. If you are going for recert it's 45 minutes covering CPR and AED. First time, it's one hour covering AED,CPR and First Aid\n\nClass size is small total of 10. Our instructor didn't waste time, started on time and ended a few minutes past scheduled time. It was people taking the class who were late and so that meant we ended a few minutes past, since we had to review what they missed.  So please be on time for class.\n\nThe classroom, sectioned in 3 parts. CPR first, AED next, and first aid last. In each section you'll watch a video, then instructor will go over the how-to and you and your partner will practice. End of class, they'll let you know if you passed. You get your certificate emailed to you.\n\nFrom recent experience, I highly stress it's so important that you can recognize if someone is in need of medical attention, and  know CPR\/ first aid.  You never know if you will be that person that can help save a life. Also keep updated too. There were some minor changes this time around.\n\nI liked taking the course thru here vs third party. Pretty organized, convenient, plus Red Cross is well known and most widely recognized organization.
126	0	d	There's a lot of dessert places in the area, but their aesthetic presentation really blew me away! Everything they bring out is instagram worthy. Also, the pricing is competitive (in the field)\nI got the perfect parcel crepe, which was a brownie, vanilla gelato wrapped in a crepe with walnuts, strawberries and lots of chocolate drizzle. My only complaint is the crepe was kind of tough. \nMy friend got the C'wow (the coveted melting chocolate dome!) so props to them for offering it first. Lots of footage to share.
127	0	d	It was a lunch all you can eat special kinda day. The day menu excludes few items only served in the evening. So  3 stars for now until i experience the full menu
128	0	d	Easy restaurant to get to before the Cris Angel show. Food was delicious and staff was friendly. Noticed that the server was a bit hesitant on sharing their pre fixe dinners they've been offering.. which I get.. higher check total means more tips. \nI didn't order off of the prefixe anyways. Their bone-in rib eye special is worth sharing with someone and their sides are of decent sizes. I do recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a good steakhouse on the south side of the Las Vegas strip and for the simple convenience of eating before the show.
129	0	d	Went on a sunday morning around 10am so of course it was quite busy, the wait time was about 45-60 minutes but thats fine, thats what is expected for breakfast on the weekend. next time will try counter to shortcut or avoid any wait time since its usually just 2 of us.\n\nService was excellent, my cup of coffee never went low, waitress checked in on us frequently, and the food came out in just 15 minutes. Ordered the corned beef hash (not something i usually order but heard great things from others) and side of biscuits and gravy. Corned beef hash was just as i would imagine it to be, and the serving size of the biscuits and gravy was enormous. \n\nI made a couple subs to my order and the waitress knocked it out without any hesitation or upcharges. Also the food was pretty cheap IMO, for 2 ppl and 1 side the total with tax was only $22\/23. awesome
130	1	d	I'm gonna pop some tags, only got twenty dollars in my pocket...\n\nIf that is the case, you might as well go somewhere else. The selection is rather slim and thrift shopping is not even fun here. I did a quick scan around the room and was not able to find a section worth looking in.
131	1	d	We got a mailer for one free night.  We decided to take them up on the offer.  The hotel us quite pleasant with tastefully done rooms.  We had a lovely room on the 4th floor overlooking the roof of the casino, but I could see Black Mountain in Henderson quite well.  What more do I want from a free room?\n\nWe had requested one king, but we ended with 2 doubles instead.  No problem.  The room is a good size.  There is a refrigerator, but there is no sneaky honors bar which is great!  They do offer wifi, but it is not free.  There's a $12.99 charge per day.  I checked the website before we went, and I saw that wifi was available in all rooms.  The key word - available.  But, there's no resort fee so it's almost a wash.\n\nThere's a nice large table\/desk with reading lamp.  There's also a place to plug a Cat 5 cable.  I didn't try it to see if I could have internet access without the fee.  It's better being able to sit in bed while reading reviews on Yelp done by friends.\n\nThere's a bar in the rooms that extends into the room by the sink.  It would be convenient if you were having a party or guests for drinks.  You could drown your sorrows after another UNLV loss nearby.  There was an abundance of very hot water and the tub\/shower combo was very large.  It delivers.\n\nI liked the place and I liked our 1 night stay.
132	0	d	My boyfriend and I have one trip to Vegas annually where we pack in shows and experience culinary delights. We were transported to another world the minute we entered the front doors of the Venetian. The beauty and timeless class of the decor was evident in even the smallest details. The casino had many choices and options, something for everyone and the staff attentive. We went to our room and that is what completely separated the Venetian from all other hotels we have stayed, including the Bellagio. The room was outstanding and exceeded all expectations! The king size bed was separated from a large step down sitting area. There were 3, yes 3 televisions, including one in the very opulent bathroom. I never wanted to leave this room as it was so amazing. The only problem was they offered no coffee machine as other resort\/hotels offer. The dining was superb and many amazing choices with well known award-winning chefs at your disposal. The Venetian links to the Palazzo via shopping and cafes so it was easy to enjoy both properties. We have decided that this is our new favorite and \"go to place\" for future visits to Vegas!
133	1	d	Ever since I moved to the Tempe area, I've been making occasional appearances whenever I stopped by Fujiya next store.\n\nSurprisingly though, I've stopped by twice this week!  Now my wallet [I spent at least $20 each time]and waistline begs me to stop, I'm addicted to their sukiyaki beef sandwiches on fluffy white bread and their miscellaneous selection of adorable and yummy pastries.\n\nWhile I sit here typing this review, my mind is wandering to the green tea mousse, green tea pudding, and the cute cream puff in the fridge.  Yummy!\n\nNow if they would just hire me...!
134	1	d	I still love Ocean Poke. With so many poke places popping up it's hard to differentiate which one is better than the other, but Ocean Poke has some unique things that others don't. They have different flavors of rice now, I especially love the cilantro lime. They also offer soba noodles, greens, and quinoa. They don't charge extra for crab salad, masago or seaweed salad and they only charge $1 for avocado. They have a loyalty card where you buy 9 bowls and then get 1 free. They offer so much more than the others which is why it's my favorite.
135	1	d	Eating pizza here borderlines having a religious experience. \n\nAte here with my brother who consumes pizza like its his job. Vincent's had been on our radar for weeks and, upon pulling into the parking lot, I understood why. The place has this old route 66 roadhouse vibe, complete with crappy neon. But don't, dear friends, judge that proverbial book by its cover because the true magic awaited us inside.\n\nWe were seated right away by a super friendly, young waitress. Big, clunky picnic table style seating, with a HUGE bottle of franks red hot on the table!!!! YES. We ordered out pies, 2 total: one with all of the meats (too many to remember) and another with onions, peppers and mushrooms. Both a size small. \n\nThis pizza is more like a sculptural work of art, with a taste to match. The crust was light and crisp with a nice sweetness. Tangy perfect sauce and huge chunks of veggies just strewn about, like someone hand- ripped the green pepper and scattered it about. I love, love me some rustic throw-down pizza and I think that Vincent's just may be the best example of this I have ever seen, with a taste to match!\n\nDon't expect to get up and run the 5k after this one though. There are greasy gobs of cheese for miles here. You may fall asleep at the wheel on your way home so I suggest pairing this fantastic meal with a large fountain drink.
136	1	d	This place has been on my radar for a while, I finally made it over!  We were a bit scared when we pulled up and the place was packed but once we went inside we were happy to find out why.  It was all you can eat Maryland crab (they were all about the medium size) The prices change with season but it worked out to be about the same for a dozen for medium size but you get 2 sides per person with it.  So we felt we defiantly got our bang for the buck!\n\nThe decor was all Sea Fairing and Maryland themed very fun and very clean!  The bathrooms were especially clean.  You may sit at a family style table if its busy and you are a small party but I felt ok with it because the condiments made for a nice divider.  The staff was AWESOME!  All of them greeted us when we walked in but it wasn't the fake cheer you sometimes get, it was a really nice happy to have you here kinda greeting.  We felt welcome and looked forward to our meal in a nice cheery environment. \n\nSo as I said we did go with the all you can eat, but beware if you do not eat what you order you will be charged so do so according to your eating abilities!  We also opted to order the crab cakes upon recommendation from our waiter.  They are as he said pretty much all crab and ohh so good!  Highly recommend them...  The crabs are seasoned while and after they are boiled with an amazing seasoning that goes inside during boiling and get all over your fingers and the meat of the crab while cracking \n\nI luckily have been to a Maryland crab place in Maryland so I have had a tutorial in crab cracking but if you have not the guys that work there will help you out and they also have a diagram\/tutorial to help you crack them!  They have a Yelp Check in offer good on regular priced orders and beer and wine.  I will be back! :D
137	1	d	This place is beautiful on the outside but once you live here and experience all the ghetto people who live here and blast their music all hours of the day and night then you'll know you made a mistake to be paying such a high rent to live in the ghetto!  Not only that the building are cheaply built with paper thin walls. I can hear the neighbors conversations and all everything else they do. The quality of the fixtures are so badly built that my kitchen sink fell out of the counter top the day before Christmas. It took them 3 months to fix it. My bathroom light fixture broke and it took them another 3 months to fix it. Management is always changing because they can't handle the stress of working here. You can hear the freeway noise all day and all night. Neighbors smoke weed on the balconies and throw their trash over the the side.  People walk their pit bulls without leash. One pitbull attacked my wife and dog because it wasn't on a leash and the owner thought it was funny!  This place is a fucking nightmare!  I beg anyone who is considering on living here to find someplace else!!!   You will regret living here!!!!
138	1	d	My experience was that of an excellent education tainted by bullying and intolerance.\n\nIn the 1990s I was the son of a poor single mother in the inner city of Cleveland.  St. Ignatius admitted me and gave me enough financial aid to attend, for which I am deeply grateful.  Today, partly due to the excellent education they provided me, I have earned my Ph. D. and lead a successful and happy life on the other side of the country.\n\nHowever, their kindness does not excuse the harmful behavior that often took place and which seemed to be part of the fabric of the school's culture.  For example, while I was a student several of my classmates were bullied to the point of committing suicide, such as an acquaintance of mine named Owen French.   Once, when news hit of a different student committing suicide because he was gay and bullied we had an all-school assembly.  Administration did not address bullying at this meeting, but instead warned the students against talking to the press about the school's culture.  I am still in shock today that this was how the school responded to the suicide of a gay student.\n\nI also had a close friend named David Snyder who had a visible medical condition.  The word \"teased\" does not capture the malice and abuse he suffered because of this.  Four years of ostracism and abuse took its toll on him and not too long after graduation he would also be dead.\n\nThese are just some extreme examples, but I can say that in my experience, homophobia, racism, elitism, and general xenophobia against anyone different were rampant, daily phenomena.  At best this mindset was tacitly approved by the school's power structure, at worst, encouraged by it.  \n\nTo my knowledge, there was no mention of the students who committed suicide in our yearbook or any admission on the part of the school of failure to protect these kids.  \n\nI would call on Saint Ignatius to take responsibility for bullying and intolerance. I have since been back and I saw a plaque that honors another student in my class who died of natural causes.  Someday I hope to tour the school and see a plaque with names like David Snyder and Owen French conspicuously displayed saying, \"Bullying contributed to the deaths of these students, and we will never let that happen again.\"\n\nUpdate 10\/31\/14.  If you view the other posts you will see the \"nothing is wrong\" attitude which is really the root of the problem.  One 5 star reviewer admits, \"No, it is not for everyone\" which is all too true- perhaps much more true than he intended to admit.  Not everyone is welcome.  He goes on to completely dismiss bullying and intolerance saying, \"There is no 'boys will be boys' attitude in the culture of the school\".  Another 5 star reviewer implies that bulling is everywhere so St. Ignatius should not be held responsible.  This is the viewpoint of the powerful majority; of those who fit in and do not face the stigma of being \"the other\".  I'd encourage everyone who denies a problem to ask an actual student to count how many times a day they hear the word \"f-g\" (homophobic slur).  When I attended, I counted it in the dozens.  Blindness to the problem is the luxury of privilege.
139	1	d	Enjoyed my visit to this spa- the local rate for a day pass is only $30. Access includes fitness center, four soaking tubs of various temperatures (women's section), sauna, shower\/locker room, and an extremely well-stocked vanity area, complete with slippers and a plush white robe. I don't go to this type of business often but I think it's awesome and can spend a relaxing day here as part of a staycation. Maryann is super sweet and attentive!\n\nTIP: Locals get 20% off weekday services.
140	1	d	Rude and unhelpful.  Walked in 10 mins before they closed, as soon as I get to the counter they asked what was going on, I said my girlfriend has a severe headache and heart is racing, her blood pressure might be high.  John, the guy behind the counter said this isn't the emergency room this is an urgent care and we don't do anything with high blood pressure.  They didn't even check to see if that was even the case just told us to go to the emergency room.  The information wasn't the point of contention for me it was they way he said it.  It was clear he didn't want to even see her and that he was ready to go.
141	1	d	I'm going to chalk this review up to growing pains and I promise to revisit this location again soon, but my first visit to Farmer Boys was less than successful. I'm so happy to have a nice new burger joint on the Southwest side of town, but this place was more of a miss than a hit with me. And I know my burgers! \n\nLet's start with the positives: the place is spotlessly clean. I mean \"I'd have zero qualms about eating off the floor\" kind of clean. That's a pretty major feat considering I visited at 12:30 on a Tuesday during peak lunch rush hour. The place was packed, there wasn't any seating, but it was super clean. The interior design is very welcoming and comfortable too...if you can find a seat! I asked for my burger wrapped in lettuce low carb style and there was no confusion, so yay for that.  \n\nNow for the not so good: the menu is a little confusing if you are a first timer. Step back and really study it. Lots of choices, and it doesn't make sense what you get with what. Like can I have fried zucchini if I get a combo, and how many do I get? Nobody could give me a definitive answer. The employees were confused too -- they didn't know what was supposed to come on my burger (and subsequently left the avocado off of my avocado burger). We also had to ask several times for silverware and a side of mayonnaise. When I finally got the kitchen to give me the missing avocado, I was handed a cup of mashed up avocado instead of the pretty slices shown on the menu photos. It still tasted good so I didn't care, but I think this is worth noting. \n\nNone of these complaints are that serious, but there was one big problem with my meal: it simply didn't taste very good. The food tasted fresh, but it was so bland. It was like the cook forgot to season my meat and zucchini. It was so weird! I don't cook with salt at home -- I actively avoid eating it -- but I had to reach for the salt (something I NEVER do). Freddy's, Fatburger and Smashburger all make more delicious burgers. \n\nI really want to give Farmer Boys another chance, and I think they deserve one. But I wanted to share my first impressions for now.
142	0	d	Two trips here and two very different experiences.  I want to really like this place...location is great, decor and vibe is good...what's inconsistent is the service and food. I ordered the Bison Burger for myself and a kids slider new for my daughter...the sliders came out like rocks and had to be returned. Not sure why they ever left the kitchen? Staff...I don't know. First visit a month ago the waitress was great, attentive, etc...last night like it was a hassle and just not interested. I don't know...maybe an off night, but not a good second impression.
143	0	d	Great menu, best Hawaiian in Phoenix!  Had the combo with pineapple chicken, chicken katsu and the kalua pork.  Super flavorful.  Potato salad was tasty too.  Will go again!  Soon!
144	1	d	Holy view, Batman!\n\nMy partner took me here for my birthday. It has always been on our list of places to go, but let's be honest - this place is expensive, so you need a good reason to go. For most people, it needs to be a special occasion.\n\nFun fact - my ears popped when I stepped off the elevator.\n\nWe were greeted by two hostesses who knew it was my birthday and wished me a happy one. Then we were seated right by the window with a view facing West of the CN Tower and the rest of the city (RBC building is beautiful at night).\n\nEverything was as expected. The service was impeccable and the food even better. I had a Pimm's Cup and my partner had a very nice glass of red wine. For starters we had goats curd and steak tar-tare. Both were delicious and beautifully presented. Then for mains we had the duck breast and Alberta lamb. Both out of this world - especially the veggies. I think they may coat their vegetables in crack.\n\nAt the end of the meal we ordered caramel lattes which were also delicious (they can do no wrong apparently.) Then they brought out a small dessert with a candle melted to the plate that said Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce. Very nice touch.\n\nThe only negative I can really give Canoe is the bathrooms - they are very office building feeling (yes, it's actually in an office building) but I feel they could have a more luxurious vibe for the amount you are paying.\n\nWonderful experience and we will definitely be back to try more food.
145	0	d	I used to be a regular at this restaurant and I was very happy to see that the restaurant has been doing well these past few months. For unknown reasons the management of the restaurant has changed. I am disappointed with every single dish I ordered. Naan bread was too chewy and lumpy. Appetizer, if it can be called that, was a joke. For $5, all I received were 5 measly pieces of \"paneer pakoras\". I think it is time to find another Indian restaurant in the valley.
146	1	d	My beau dragged me here, and I am so grateful that he did -- The Twinkie Boy Milkshake is amazing! Why haven't I seen this before? Vanilla Ice Cream, Twinkie, and Caramel Syrup? Done and DONE! Imagine that, and they puncture that twinkie with the straw that you're drinking... That's a glass of deliciousness!\n\nThe Lamb Tandoori Burger is Ace. Can't go wrong with Colorado Lamb*, Mint-Cilantro Yogurt Sauce, Cucumber, Olives, Red Onion, Tomato. My beau craves this everytime we come to Vegas, and I wouldn't call it \"being dragged to\" anymore. I'm looking forward to my next visit. \n\nAlright so it's a rockin' spot set up at the Mirage. Ambiance and food. Yes please!
147	0	d	Great place to take the kids and even for adults. Even a good date spot.. we go every once in a while and paint soup bowls and we're building up a great collection of them. My kids usually paint on canvas which they also offer. Only gripe is I wish they stayed open till 8 on Fridays. I work late on Friday and we would go way more often if they stayed later than 6. Otherwise, solid place.
148	1	d	For the most part, shopping along the Las Vegas Strip has been a disappointing experience. The Sin City offerings seem to be either schlock or luxury goods, and not much in between. Of course, maybe my retail tastes are quirky to begin with. As for fashion, Gayle has asked that she be present before I buy anything she'd be forced to be seen in public with me.\n\nAllSaints Spitalfields had me at the multiple vintage sewing machines in the window. Once inside, I was impressed with the wandering layout, featuring clothes on old crafts tables and drawers stuffed with belts, wallet, and other leather treasures. Service was spotty as staff seemed to be concentrating on getting their displays right (thanks to full colour photos a guides). However, I was happy to just wander around and take it all in. I left with a nice wallet (as if I needed one, but it was a cool design) and some fashion ideas for future Gayle consultations.
149	0	d	One of my coworkers mentioned this little spot he heard about not too far from work. So today for lunch a few of us decided to check it out. My personal favorite places are hole in the wall joints so walking into this restaurant definitely provided that vibe. Miss Dee, the owner I believe, was one of the nicest owners I have met at a restaurant. She immediately came out of the kitchen and personally greeted us with amazing hospitality. She gave us the low down of her spot answering any questions about the food we had. Now onto the meat and potatoes, literally! Three of us got a large loaded potato, each topped with different meats. One had the beef brisket, the other had pulled pork, and I got the buffalo chicken. Don't expect your food to come out in a minute like it was just microwaved. Everything was freshly put together and it was beyond worth it! Each meat was cooked to perfection with amazing flavors throughout the potato. Combine that with melted cheese, sour cream, and other delicious toppings, this potato can't be beat!  Will definitely be a return customer to try out other various customizations on my loaded potato!
150	1	d	I hate this place. If you read my reviews i'm pretty forgiving, or i'm polite.\n\nNOT that my opinion is always spot on but still. This is the first 1 star and if I could give a half star I WOULD!\n\nMy family celebrates birthdays, anniversaries, all sorts here. AND I HATE IT. I have now started making up excuses not to go if they say there celebrating it here. I feel sorry for my aunts\/uncles who pay so much per person for such crap food, and crap service. So why go if ill already be a debby downer.\n\nThe food is not all that great to begin with usually warm close to being cold than it being hot going to warm..kind of like it was just sitting in the back just waiting for the tray of food outside to be consumed and tada refill right away!. The interior looks dirty from the minute you walk in from the tons of people walking in with their kids and slapping their snot, or saliva all over the doors. Only to see this clean when the people are all either gone or away from the front.\n\nThe floors are sticky even going on carpeted areas, which shouldn't be sticky but it is.\n\nThe washroom's smell, and it doesn't look like anyone clears out the garbage as often as possible. \n\nThe staff don't even greet you with a smile, nor do they even care if you need  anything. \n\nI think what's change my family's mind about going here is when the party is over and its now time to compare the count, they always double count people. WHY...When we confirmed a certain amount of people we usually go UNDER not over because going over we have to pay for people who dont show up. \n\nok we confirm 120 people but 125 people show up...we pay extra thats fine. but if we confirm 130 and only 125 show up we still somehow had to pay 5 extra people.\n\nNOW. They still dont give enough tables, chairs or room when you confirm 120 people it was like 100 chairs and all squished into this small area when clearly they could have given us a private room not having to share with another event or have their other patrons annoyed with how loud our party was getting when all they wanted was a peaceful lunch.\n\nAgain because there wasnt enough chairs and table and room for at least 120 when people sat down they were being counted again because new cutlery and cups were provided. My Grandfather said to the woman to stop taking his cup and cutlery she said it was her job he said well stop adding another line to your damn paper! Ive been here since the beginning of the party!\n\nANYWAY as if that wasnt enough these people expected a tip of like 100+ dollars. I have no problem giving tip. BUT staff was hard to approach, they even told my aunt to wait when all she was asking for was smaller plates for cake which in the end she just walked up to the dessert area and grabbed herself. There is another reason but I want to keep that for myself I do not want to get into trouble for blasting this on the internet...\n\nParking is huge its right next to the movies, and a kid play place, and a jewelry store. It is Scarborough so keep all valuables out of sight.\n\nHope this review helps you avoid this place!\n\n\n\nSOMEONE TELL ME WHY IS THE IMPERIAL BUFFET IN MISSISSAUGA SO MUCH BETTER? That will be my next review! They actually get 5 stars from me!
151	1	d	This place gets 5 stars not because it's the fanciest...not because it's the hippest place to be...it gets 5 stars because it doesn't try to be anything it isn't.  It's a dive bar w\/ cheap drinks!  You'll see casino workers from nearby (Ballys, Flamingo, Quad, Harrah's) getting their cheap after work drink on!  My favorite bar tender is Mama-son!  She's hillarious and takes good care of us!\n\nIf you're a priss and can't stand a little smoke - this is NOT the place for you.  I am a non-smoker, and I tend to leave my jacket in the car and change out of my clothes as soon as I get home...but hey - it's the price you pay for a $3 glass of wine or $2 shot\/beer!
152	1	d	I really wanted to like this place... (Sad)\nI like restaurants that are dog friendly because I'm a dog lover. The girl who waited on us was very nice and sweet (Oh, I feel bad now). Patio seating area was spacious and comfortable.\nEverything was amazing except for the food I had.\n\nSalad... Fresh and crisp looking outside. Inside of it was just soggy pieces. I thought they put seaweed inside (Serious).\n\nChicken Piccata... I tasted nothing but white wine and lemon. I had to put a ton of salt to eat it. Never tasted chicken piccata this gross in my life.\n\nDog meat ball... Way too salty to give to any dogs unless you want your dogs to have their blood pressure skyrocket. Yes, I tasted it like I always taste anything I give to my dogs. \n\nDog dessert.... The ice cream was definitely for human. Well, it was much sweeter than my Haagen dazs vanilla ice cream. Of course my dog loved it. Hope she doesn't get diabetes.\n\nThey were out of Veal and turkey meat balls.\nMaybe everything tasted great if I had a bottle of red wine or two like the other couple that was sitting across from us. Too bad I didn't drink this time. Next time, I'll come back with a designated driver :-)
153	0	d	Really tasty, fresh Italian food. This is probably one of the only Italian restaurants in Scarborough, so I go here all the time with my grandfather who lives nearby. The service is really good - and the food comes out very fast. I always get the penne arrabiata or tortellini - both are delicious. Tomato sauce isn't too spicy. The soups are also always tasty if you're getting an appetizer - I recommend the minestrone. Most of my family members always get the veal with a side of spaghetti. I'm a vegetarian so it's not my style, but it's very popular. - it's also massive.
154	1	d	Not even in Montréal yet and we were searching for something to satisfy our Thai tongues. This place was on the top of the list. The location's pretty central considering Sherbrooke's one of the main boulevards.\n\nThe service wasn't what we expected because we were forced to turn away, due to the lack of seating. Make sure you have a reservation! We were back a couple nights later and noticed how top-notch and accommodating the service can be. The prices aren't too complementary to the portions, unfortunately. For example, the PAD THAI (ooooh my god, please don't get me started, I love this dish everywhere. Ya gotta be able to make this dish anywhere).\n\nNow, the other noticeable quality for Pamika is the taste, and how authentic it is. Our taste buds were all over the place, such that the ecstasy had us saying at one point that this is the best Thai restaurant in Canada. My Thai girlfriend agreed it was as traditional as you can get, without actually being in Thailand. It's really 4.5 stars, because of the smaller portion. But, you can't really go wrong here.
155	1	d	This was really 3.5 stars and I'm rounding down to 3 for a few reasons...on which I will now elaborate.\n\nDistrict could be in any Sheraton, anywhere.  In fact, it is strikingly similar to Rum Fire, the trendy restaurant in the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed for a few days this summer before my family arrived and we stayed moved to the family place.  The flooring, the red circular lounge area, the live music on Thursday nights...it was all the same.  Heck, even the menu was the same.  The difference was that in Waikiki there was a \"Hawaiian\" slant to everything and the live music was much, much better.  (And of course the beach front setting).  I get the impression that they are trying to market themselves as a \"downtown restaurant\" more than the \"place in the Sheraton\"...but to be honest, it is your quintessential trendy hotel restaurant.\n\nThe bartenders were really friendly.  The wine list for a \"wine bar\" is incredibly lacking.  Nothing interesting, nothing fun.  The pricing is on par with what I would expect from a hotel.  The space is modern and trendy, something that there isn't that much of in downtown.  I love the charm of a historic home, but I also love sleek and modern lines.\n\nWe selected a few small plates, or appetizers, depending on which of their menus you are looking at.  The crab cakes were good, if nothing short of predictable, and the chips and dip were surprisingly unique.  A dill dip and a French onion dip provided a nice departure from the regular spinach artichoke.  I'm not sure this is a place that I would come to for dinner, and it is definitely not a place I would come to for brunch.  (The brunch menu is a typical hotel menu, with typical hotel pricing).  I think that for me District will just remain a place for drinks and small bites.  \n\nI'm not going to lose my mind over this place.  It's not that great, I'd say it's fairly generic.  But the staff was friendly and it's within walking distance of my place.  I'm sure I will be back for drinks.
156	1	d	I have no previous memories of Africa.. now after visiting Memories of Africa, Peri Peri chili powder and Beef Biltong now will be always at the back of my mind. \n\nBeef Biltong supposed to be a South African delicacy with beef air dried instead of smoked to create that unique taste and texture... (and the addition seasoning of Peri Peri sure helps with the taste!) \n\nMy friend at first was really skeptical... since the Beef Biltong in the fridge looks not too appetizing but after she start eating that, she could not stop!... Beef Biltong is something that you have to eat every single bites of it before you can stop, that is addictive! \n\nThere are also bottles of condiments, sauces, seasonings that are all from South Africa... which is quite unique and you cannot find in a supermarket near you! \n\nThe store is nicely maintained, the store owner is so so nice... asked me if I want a cookie... hey not going to say no... yes please!
157	1	d	Holy wow!\n\nThe food here is AWESOME. \n\nSeriously, if any Yelper wants to come here to try it for the first time and they have no one to try it with, please send me a message ahead of time just so I can join you and have an excuse to eat there multiple times. Yeah, I'm serious. \n\nI've never been to El Salvador and have never eaten Salvadoran food. I had no idea what \"pasteles\" were, but they remind me of India's samosas and I would've stuffed myself silly with them if I had an endless supply. I was actually secretly mad that my friends looked at what I ordered and took away huge chunks of it to \"sample\". Doesn't \"sample\" imply \"tiny little bite\"? Since when did its definition change to \"help yourself to a huge chunk that's up to one-third of the whole piece\"... times two for both the friends I was with? Jerks. \n\nI don't even remember the name of my main entree. It had chicken and onions sauteed in a delicious sauce, some really unique-looking and tasty bean dip thing, and rice. A tiny cup of soup preceded each of our meals. All of this was accompanied by a thick, Salvadoran-style tortilla thing that I also forget the name of. \n\nNothing fancy here in terms of atmosphere\/vibe. The decor is interesting enough, but it's basically like a no-frills typical Phoenix Mexican dive except nothing is even remotely Mexican. No liquor either, which kind of irked my friends at first when I dragged them here and forced them to try it. \n\nThey thanked me later.
158	1	d	A truly horrible experience and a complete waste of $100 pp. \nThe problems begin quickly with rude unattentive service. Failure to bring drinks promptly, failure to bring extra plates, failure to even have chopsticks on the table, failure to bring prepared sushi on time. \nThe food, the lobster miso, is frankly gross. The rolls small and outrageous prices even for Vegas and all of em fell apart as we tried to eat them.  I know MGM is hurting financially and have drastically even cut back comps to  a bare minimum, but come on $16-17 for a  sashmi salad? Their signature roll is horrible.  The saki prices though were avg for vegas, but you needed several bottles just to choke down the pork we ordered. Being a 20+ yr mlife member , I believe this is our most disappointing experience ever.
159	1	d	So in the spirit of burger week in Toronto, I decided to visit a brand spankin' new burger bar in the hood that's NOT offering the $5 burger specials.  It was storming all day and I was too lazy to hit the gym.  That's when I decared I was going to go all out and call it a \"fat day\"... and a fat day it was!\n\nArrived at 8:30pm, this corner block restaurant is a lot bigger than what it seems from the outside.  The two of us were greeted and sat by the host.  Right away, I concluded that it had a good vibe with some background music and friendly staff.  But wait, something was missing.  Why do they NOT have TVs?? I was really hoping to catch the NBA playoffs!\n\nIf you have read my reviews before, you probably have noticed how difficult menu-ordering is for such an indecisive food-lover like myself.  The Works decided to make it even harder by having a million choices on the menu!  I hate it... I love it!  \n\nButterscotch Chocolate Milkshake: $3.97 Kid size (4.5\/5 stars)\nIn addition to a beer, I've really been a sucker for milkshakes lately, and since it was a \"fat day\", I went for it.  SO MANY to choose from, but this one hit the spot!  Oh, and all drinks are served in a measuring cups! TOO CUTE!\n\nTower O Rings: $9.69 (3.5\/5)\nA little pricey, but the portion is fit for 3-4 people for appetizer!  Huge onion rings stacked on top of another!  You get 2 choices of dipping sauce and we got the chipotle mayo (ALWAYS get chipotle!), and the curry mayo (ACTUAL curry flavour!!).\n\nSk8r Boy burger +banana: $12.78 (4\/5 stars)\nI really wanted to get the Hunka Hunka Burnin' Love, which is peanut butter with bacon and banana on your choice of patty.  Can you spot what is missing on this? CHEESE!! How can you have a burger without cheese?!!? Then I saw the Sk8r Boy, which is the same thing but with jack cheese instead of banana.  I did what Superwoman would do: get the Sk8r Boy, and ADD BANANAS!! Oh I am a genius!  Only criticism is the thick beef patty was done med-well to well, so a bit dry for me. \n\nDead Ringer burger: $12.89 (4\/5 stars)\nBBQ smoked brisket, bbq sauce, jack cheese, and a onion ring.  I was a little hesitant with this one at first 'cause I don't like the sweetness of bbq sauce.  But then, who doesn't like meat on meat?! It actually wasn't that sweet at all, but again, a bit over done for me.  Definitely asking for a medium patty next time.\n\nService: (5\/5 stars)\nShe's awesome! Patient, friendly, and attentive.  Extra star for sharing the same great pb and banana burger taste as me!\n\nI love the menu, although a little overwhelming.  With all the choices, it brings out the worst in me.  But it is so descriptive and funny to read!  Salt and pepper shakers are in light bulbs, the decor is all construction-themed.  I also noticed the front wall is a garage-style door that opens up during sunny days.  They definitely need TVs, but either way, I am coming back as many times as it takes me to go through the entire menu!!! Sponsors? (If serious, send me a msg! haha)
160	0	d	Great service. I had a groupon for a contact lens exam here so it was extremely reasonably priced. Dr. McCord was quick, professional, and helped me pick out some cheaper lenses that feel great. I'll be back. They also have a great selection of glasses.\n\nMy only issue is that the people answering phones aren't very professional.
161	0	d	Great food!!!! Had to wait a little but my family and I were entertained by the noodle maker. Also my sister pointed out the walls in the back may need a new paint job.
162	0	d	Delicious vegan junk food! Prepare to be stuffed but don't expect anything to be healthy despite being vegan or vegetarian.  We split a sandwich and an app and we were still stuffed. Only negative was the number of hipsters.
163	1	d	We love the Water Street District in Henderson. Old School Nevada small casinos and Great Food with Great Service.\n\nWe enjoyed a hearty meal with salad bar and drinks for under $40. There is no long wait to be seated like at some of the other establishments in the area.\n\nThe porterhouse was cooked perfectly and was so tender. I love it when they charbroil my MEat!! I've paid $0-$50 for a steak and they were no more impressive.\n\nThe salad bar is small with just a few items but its fresh and does the trick. If your looking to get out and enjoy a quiet meal TRY DOWNTOWN HENDERSON.
164	1	d	Delicious new Colombian Restaurant just opened in Pineville! \nLocated in the Tower Place Shopping Center this yummy new restaurant has that  delicious Colombian rotisserie chicken that we love. \n\nThe owners are hands on and will give you samples of nearly anything on the menu. We sampled almost 1\/2 the menu ! He kept bringing samples !!! I almost got too full to eat but hey I took one for the team and had black beans with veggie rice. It was delicious! \nThe hubs had 1\/2 chicken with a sweet potato !\nIt was so delicious!\n\nChicken soup, chicken salad or rotisserie chicken this place has it all !  Be aware that the chicken salad is a salad with shredded rotisserie chicken on it not the American idea of a mayo based chicken salad . \n\nThe menu has a nice variety of all things chicken!\nThe wraps and bowls will not disappoint!\n\nThe sauces were delicious.... some were really spicy ! \n\nThe drinks are as yummy as the food . Be sure to try the Pineapple with mint ! It is so good !\nDon't miss this place when venturing out for a new place to try ! It is two thumbs up
165	1	d	No wonder it's closed. I had no idea how it remained open so long. Super hard to navigate, no customer service to speak of, and really overpriced.  Not going to miss it.  Let's see how it does in its new location.
166	0	d	If I was reviewing strictly on the room I would rate a 3 because the room looked great; however, due to the unprofessional staff on site, Jordan, I didn't stay so I can't say if the bed was the best or if the shower worked so I'm not sure if the room deserves a 5.  My husband and I booked originally because the price for their best room was good and we wanted a little \"get-away\" while he was on vacation and I had some time off work prior to some medical testing.  Apparently the hotel doesn't do their own reservations so when I called I was transferred to the \"reservation\" line.  The reservation was completed, I was given a price and told we would pay at check-in. When we checked-in by Matt however, we were told something completely different, that the cost of the room plus $50 would be authorized on our credit card.  This wasn't a horrible amount so I didn't dispute it; however, I do keep very close tabs on my credit card and checked the charge later in the afternoon and it didn't match what we were told.  The amount was less than what we were told. Most people would just let this go; however, I didn't want to run into a situation where they would run additional charges later when I wasn't expecting it. \nMy husband had to go to a store close-by and pick up something we forgot and stopped by the front desk to ask.  It was apparently shift change from Matt to Jordan but between Matt and Jordan neither could agree on what was being authorized and why.  Jordan was very rude and basically telling my husband that he couldn't add even after my it was made very clear the concern was that the authorization was too low and we were very aware of what the charges were supposed to be. Matt then told my husband that apparently the $50 authorization we were advised of for damages is not always $50, \"there doesn't seem to be a rhyme a reason and no one seems to know how much or how it works\".  This explanation didn't really make sense or make me feel better. Why were we told $50 at check-in and now it's \"no on knows how much or how it works\"? If this company has my credit card information someone better be able to explain the how and why of the amounts they're charging.  He was given cards for management who of course weren't there and basically told to scram.\nI went down to the front desk and waited behind a couple who were local and came in to book a room for someone coming into the area.  I was astonished to hear Jordan tell them (after he ran their credit card) \"There are going to be some extra charges on there for incidentals but I don't really know how much or how it works\". Really?  I usually appreciate transparency but in this case that should have been disclosed PRIOR to charging to card in case they weren't okay with \"I don't know how much or how it works\", to me that's being professional and respecting your customer.  Unfortunately it's very clear that Jordan has never been taught to respect other people and that became even more clear shortly.  Yelp does not allow enough space to describe all the unprofessional behavior that followed so I am condescending and describing what I feel others need to be aware of.  \nI explained to Jordan I was uncomfortable with the \"I don't know\" explanation my husband was given; however, it became clear that he was not going to be helpful so I requested a receipt showing what was being authorized on my credit card. That was also refused. He had started out with his voice raised and ended practically yelling at me which is beyond unprofessional so I asked him to stop.  He also refused stating I was being rude so it was okay for him to be rude to me. I'm not sure why asking a representative of a business to be professional is being rude but since it was apparent that he was not going to be helpful I decided I was wasting my time and there was another guest waiting behind me.  As I turned to leave I heard a sarcastic comment so I said \"excuse me\"? and he yelled \"Have a good day\" across the lobby. I knew I did not want to deal with him when I checked out the next day so I went back to the front desk and asked when he worked the next day as I didn't want to have to deal with him.  I was told \"I'm not telling you. You're threatening me now. I'm calling the police and having you removed.\" Excuse me?  I specifically said I don't want to deal with you when I check out, how is that a threat? I sat down on a couch in the lobby and looked for a contact number to reach a general manager and the whole time he's yelling at me across the lobby while there are guests coming in and out.  Another employee had walked up to the desk and looked at him in shock but never said anything to Jordan.  I was finally able to speak with someone and we were advised that Jordan never called police, we were asked to stay but there was no point in staying.
167	0	d	Parking is plentiful with easy access from Riggs or McQueen avenues.  The establishment was very clean and inviting with plenty of booths or tables for seating.  Service was excellent with employees quickly taking your orders and being responsive and polite.  Our order was filled and on our table in a very short period of time.  We ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and it was very good.  In addition, we also ordered a pizza for later on.  By the way, their pizza is fantastic!  We would recommend this location to anyone.
168	1	d	Girlfriend says \"Want McDonald's for lunch?\"\n\nI'm super hungry.  But I've been trying to do no fast food for Lent.  \n\nGirlfriend says, \"Oh yea, you weren't eating fast food yet, right.\"\n\nI see the golden arches in the distance.  Quickly slipping I say, \"Um, do we have food at home for lunch?\"  \n\nGirlfriend says, \"Not really, we need to go grocery shopping.\"\n\nI freaking kid you not, while we wait at the red light freaking church bells go off right behind us.  Yes, automated, on the hour church bells.  I couldn't make this stuff up.\n\nI say, \"Um......\"\n\nThe light becomes green and girlfriend says, \"Let's just get it.  We'll go shopping later.\"  \n\nI hadn't made the decision, so somehow that made it better.  I dove in with both feet. Bring on the Big Mac!!!  Coke has never tasted so cold or so good coming out of that giant straw.  \n\nAnd finally, in an act that could almost be a sign from the big G, the McDonald's that has never ever gotten our order completely right - got the whole thing perfect.  \n\nSo if you ever go here, and don't hear the church bells, check your order before you pull away from the drive through as in the past this location actually gave us 2 double cheeseburgers with no meat.
169	1	d	BIG VENT!!! So, I ask that everyone stop shopping at Ross Park Mall!!!\nTeens cannot \"hang out\" there. They are made to leave by the mall cops if there too long without purchasing. (They ate subway and got drinks at another place) It is a \"shopping\" mall as the obnoxious guard explained with sarcasm.\nAs I start to get angrier and state there are kids out drinking, smoking, doing drugs, these kids get removed from the mall for not spending money?!? Apparently they had hung out with a few others, one had jumped over an end table, another threw a quarter at another. Not these boys, but kids they were with at one point and were no longer with when told to leave. They were watched for 2 hours.\nThen, the mall \"cop\" stated they need to be \"taught\" how to act. A snarky comment by him insulting the raising of my child and to him on his rather age appropriate behavior.\nSo, I ask that you all stop shopping at Ross Park! I will take my business elsewhere, I hope you do too!\nKids have been \"hanging out\" in malls since malls were built but now, unless you spend money, you are assumed to be stealing and \"taking up space\" as was also stated by the guard!\nFU Ross Park!\nI'll be returning all my purchases made on Monday and explaining to the stores why I am returning them, that will be my last visit ever!!!\nResponse...\nWell, Kevin, I sent an email the day this happened. No one bothered to respond adding insult to injury. Not sure why I would bother calling when there is no response to my direct email.
170	0	d	Monty's has started to bake their own doughnuts and they are without a doubt the best doughnuts in Madison.  One day they had a cake doughnut with oreo crumbles and icing and it gave me flashbacks to Voodoo Doughnuts in Portland, OR.  If I had a higher metabolism I'd stop and pick up a couple of doughnuts every day before work.  I can't do that but I do enjoy one once or twice a week.  Caveat emptor, these things are addicting. I only hope they broaden the variety of flavors.
171	0	d	This place is amazing, great customer service. The owner Kevin always goes out of his way, to make sure I'm happy and got everything I needed before I leave. Not a better place on in Las Vegas, so when your on this side of town make sure you check them out!!!
172	0	d	Not so satisfied, with the service made. Very incompetent, in working. With this shop, could not fix. My check engine light. Drive back, and wanted more money! And I paid hundreds of dollars. With just, replacing a gas cap. You be the judge...
173	0	d	I LOVE shameful Tikki room!!!! Having been here a couple times now, I am so thankful toronto has such a cool spot around. Very casual but also super fun and cool with all the Hawaiian themed drinks and decor. Def a place you can go just to chill with friends, host birthdays or even have a date! Venue is small so def make a reso if u Can!\n\nMost of their drinks are rum based but they also serve other liquor as well. Each drink is based on the number of barrels (oz in the drink) and are tasty and fun! Some drinks come with fire and other comes with cool stir sticks! If you order their big bowls you tend to get a show of the big gong and smoke! It's definitely cool to share with lots of people if interested in getting the big bowls!\n\nMy fav drink there is the blue hawaiann! Although there is no fire in this drink, it is super tasty and comes with a pina colada vibe.\n\nServers and bar tender are also super nice and friendly with rexommendations as well! Definitely make a point to check out this cool spot!
174	0	d	Hands down BEST Thai food I have ever had, better yet...best of Las Vegas!!! Amazing service, beautiful restaurant, great for family dinner or date night. The food was absolutely delicious!! Not one complaint for this lovely place!! Highly recommended to anyone and everyone!
175	1	d	I'll make this review as short and sweet as possible to go along with the rest of my overtime take out meal series.  Japango, what can I say, there's a fair bit of hype associated with this place.  First off their sushi always looks fresh and I have had a few of my friends tell me this place has some of the best donkatsu in downtown TO.  I figured hell yeah, I'm going to order a donkatsu dinner to highlight my evening at work!\n\nFirst off when I received my meal, none of the items in my combo were labeled.  Simply bagging all the items in one bag together and writing the name of the person can't be that hard right?  So after 15 minutes of sorting through other people's meals, salads and soups I finally put together my donkatsu combo.  I started with the salad first, and what a mistake the lettuce was totally spoiled!  Not sure if it was due to the fact it was put beside hot food, but I had to throw it out because it was so gue-like.  Now on to the miso soup, I should call it me no soup, because it tasted like water with sand in it.  Finally the creme de la creme the donkatsu...when I opened the box it looked as if a small child had vomited all over my Styrofoam box.  Not only was the pork not crispy, it was totally wet and the sauces kind of just soaked into the box and rice making a non pleasant chunk of food.\n\nI mean it was take out and I should be a bit more forgiving, so I'm dropping a 2 star instead of a 1.  I might give them another shot, but will be definitely ordering sushi next time.  Please label my boxes next time Japango or I'll have to JapanNo on my next order!
176	0	d	I love this place! I own a store across the street and have been ordering from here for over a year now. They are just the nicest people with great food and even better prices! I have never been disappointed. If there is ever a problem they always make it right
177	0	d	Good spot for a quick lunch or if you are a true fan.  Came here with some work buddies for a bite.  No complaints and quick service.\n\nI got the Wahoos salad with their fish.  Love it.  Fresh and simple.  \n\nPersonal aside, the music here is great.  Chill atmosphere for sure.
178	1	d	Is it even Sunday morning if you're not out to breakfast?\n\nI didn't think so.\n\nWe originally wanted to go to Kitchen Table because its close to my place and I heard nothing but good things, unfortunately we got there and there was an hour and a half wait. My heart said stay but my tummy said go, so off we went.\n\nWe happened upon this little road side gem and i am going to be honest this place looks like the type of place you stop in the middle of no where at a truck stop to grab a bite to eat before hitting the road. I was weary to say the least.\n\nWe got seated right away and the food was fantastic! I had Corned Beef hash and it was actually true corned beef. I was very impressed. The only reason for 4 stars instead of five is that instead of hash browns they give you those weird potato chip type things. Is that becoming a thing? I really don't want that to become a thing because ewe.\n\nFriendly, quick service and great food! This was a Sunday win for sure!\n\n**They have an Omelet on the menu that sells for $69.00 and it has raw liver, Grunion lips (when in season of course) Petunia petals, mint chocolate chip ice cream among a few other strange ingredients. If anyone orders this omelet, please, send pictures.**
179	0	d	As a homeowner who takes pride in my home and surroundings. I am very pleased with BDG maintenance and friendly service. I had to call during rainy season for a problem that was quickly resolved.
180	1	d	Paid $5 for a parking at this sketchy ghetto parking lot, got chased by a creepy drunk old man and walked a good 20 min to get me some of your delicious burger. Why do I do this? Because you have a special place in my heart.\n\nFukuburger serves some Japanese-style fusion burger. I first had Fukuburger few years ago at First Friday. I ordered their Buta Burger which consist of all beef Fuku-patty with applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, pickled red onions and red ginger, topped with Japanese BBQ sauce and wasabi mayo. \n\nTotal 2 hours of wait for a burger which sounds ridiculous, but as soon as I took a bite, I fell in love. It was none like I had in the past. I love their Japanese twist of adding wasabi mayo and red ginger in a burger because you can't find that combination anywhere, especially on their juicy beef patty. I devoured my burger like a gorilla.\n\nEver since the day I met Fukuburger, I started having dreams about it. My love for Fukuburger kept growing by day. Then my second visit slapped me in the face. My buta burger was cold and their patty and bacon in the burger were extremely dry. I'm still giving this place 4 stars because the girls that takes the order are super friendly and I love their system of calling out the orders where customers get to choose a creative name to be called for a pickup. \n\nI was disappointed by my second visit but might give another chance in the future. Check their website to see where they are today: http:\/\/www.fukuburger.com\/
181	1	d	My order was simple: two large pepperoni pizzas and a two-liter of coke. An hour and a half later, the driver showed up reaking of some herbal substance or other and forgot my coke. No biggie, but I called back to complain and I got hung up on. What's up with that?
182	0	d	Clean restaurant, great service, menu is way to big and too many things to chose from which I sometimes find too time consuming however the biggest disappointment is their go food quality. I went there years ago when they first opened and it wasn't that bad however for my second time there nothing was prepared right. Bread had too much garlic salt on it, Cesar salad had a non cesar type dressing, steak was overly salted and it kept sticking to the stone. We had potato skins as an appetizer and the cheese on  It resembled cheese whiz. \nWouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The only person who should be going there is Robert Irwin from restaurant impossible
183	0	d	First time here and I've gotta say, it was actually pretty good!\n\nI ordered Spicy Tonkatsu ramen: The broth was very tasty and the waitress asked for a spice level (I ordered medium). I feel like medium was a good level of spice balanced with flavor. It wasn't spicy per se, but it was very nicely flavored. It looks like they use a chili oil (I saw reviews that said the broth was oily) so yes, it SEEMS oily, but it's the chili oil. It also comes with a good amount of noodles, and chashu. The bean sprouts are marinated to be spicy (which didn't seem spicy? Idk - my spice level is pretty high) and it also came with green onions and an egg. I ordered an extra egg (I heart nitamago)!\n\nFor dessert I ordered red bean ice cream that came with colorful mochi toppings and had a little bit of condensed milk mixed in. Perfect.\n\nAll in all, coming from Los Angeles, this place served the best ramen in AZ.... Will come back whenever I'm in town.
184	1	d	1 bartender 3 cooks and 1 server with 30 Customers. The food took almost one hour to come out of the kitchen. The portions were extremely small. The burger was like chewing an old shoes from the side of the highway.  you can't hardly call this place bacon bar with only a few bacon items on the menu.
185	1	d	Generally shunning chains in favor of local novelties, Elephant Bar vaguely known as a failed branch once occupied space at a local mall back home, it was on the invitation of Rosie Gillam that three friends sat down to taste the restaurant's newly debuted Brunch menu, conditions that an honest opinion be offered based on the overall experience with a particular focus on the food.\n\nUnabashedly rooted in its theme, a large pachyderm and giraffe statues overlooking the foyer as well as the adjoining bar, Elephant Bar Henderson is located in The District at Green Valley Ranch at the end nearest the Casino and managed by Mr. Mike Tuttle who has overseen operations at several locations over the course of a dozen years, there is little doubt that management long-ago learned to take care of its employees, our waitress a nine year veteran despite her young age while several others have worked nearly a decade at the space.\n\nGenuinely a happy feeling family eatery, the global cuisine admittedly all over the place with obvious \"something for everyone\" intent, a first look at the Elephant Bar menu reads much less elaborately than other chains looking to sell their items with hyperbole, signatures and dietary discretions indicated by icons with additional verbiage limited to method and content.\n\nBopping IHeartRadio standards, volumeless ESPN on screens in the Bar, it was with warm greetings from a server prone to \"Hun\" and \"My Lady\" that the table was greeted and with suggestions for signatures offered an order was composed to take place in three courses, a total of eleven plates showing far better than many have suggested though a few of the newer selections certainly need to be tweaked or reworked.\n\nStarting out with \"Shareables,\" plenty of coffee, water and iced tea  refilled readily while the table dined and conversed with Mr.Tuttle, first bites of French Onion Ribeye Sliders showed a decent grade of meat topped in Swiss Cheese with caramelized Onions, the 'au jus' a bit oversalted and mostly unnecessary while sauces accompanying the Crispy Green Beans and Coconut Shrimp were equally flavor-marring, the parmesan crust alone making the former irresistibly crave-worthy while the later was already quite sweet without the \"Pan-Pacific\" sauce included for dipping.\n\nLooking at Braised Lamb Shank as a bold move for such a restaurant, their 2014 bankruptcy and subsequent purchase by Chalak Mitra group no doubt contributing several flavors familiar to Southern Asia and India to the spread, it was on the strong words of Mike that the re-launched lunch optioned was ordered and with a falling-from-the bone texture combined to a deep sapor it turns out that the General Manager was spot-on in his recommendation, each bite as rich as expected with necessary levity added by steamed spinach.\n\nImpressed by the Angus burger with Blue Cheese and Pears, the beef soon to be upgraded to Prime per management, items from the Brunch Section were soon delivered in the form of a duo, the Raspberry Passion Pancakes fluffy with buttermilk flavors that help to prevent passion fruit from overwhelming while the Sunrise Breakfast Tostadas are unfortunately *far* to rich to be enjoyable, the tortillas holding up better than the table's tastebuds to the mixture of bacon, peppers, onions, eggs and layer-upon-layer of thick, salty cheese.\n\nInforming the GM and waitstaff of the Tostadas' issues, the comments appearing to be taken seriously and passed on to the Chef, dessert was composed of two Elephant Bar Signatures plus the Brunch-Only French Toast-Butter Cake Sandwich - the Cobbler and Cast-Iron Cookie each hitting all the right notes beneath melting ice cream while thin slices of Cream-Cheese infused cake were mostly lost between bread, the Gooey greatness better appreciated in the classic preparation with toffee sauce and ice cream adding even more richness.\n\nAdmitting up front that national chains are not frequently a part of the dining agenda, menu prices alone amusing considering the higher cost generally involved in weekend plans, Elephant Bar suffers many of the flaws frequently associated with such places by attempting to be \"everything to everyone,\" but at the same time manages to execute some pretty complex flavors with a service staff that outperforms many \"celebrity\" spots on the Strip.  Sure the sauces, seasoning and sodium content can tend to be overwhelming, but when taken as a whole there is no doubt that the menu executes better than others in its genre, particularly as relates to plates bearing \"signature\" status.
186	0	d	Awesome food. Big portions. Had to ask for coffee twice. Would come back again for sure
187	0	d	I feel a little guilty giving only a 2 star rating, especially since I tend to be so generous with the stars. Border Grill wasn't terrible, but it was incredibly unspectacular in a city that has a lot of fun places to eat at every corner.\n\nOne of my girlfriends loves Mexican food and will basically choose anything resembling it. So when we booked a stay at THEhotel, she was really eager to try Border Grill.\n\nWe had lunch and opted to sit outdoors. We nibbled on some guac along with the complimentary chips and salsa. She ordered a bloody mary and a mix of 3 tacos (I can't remember exactly which ones), while I had a glass of white sangria and the turkey tostada salad. \n\nI ordered my salad sans cilantro, and when it arrived, it was absolutely filled with the evil green stuff. I realize this is a common ingredient in Mexican food, but restaurants have always been kind in accommodating my request. It had already taken a very long time for the food to come, so I was a little disappointed. The waitress owned up to the mistake and took the blame for it, though, which I did appreciate. The salad itself, even corrected, was just okay. The drinks were also fine. Service was pleasant but slow and not exceptional.\n\nOverall, I did not hate my experience, but I wouldn't recommend Border Grill nor would I return.
188	1	d	This is an okay joint that is somewhat clean. Last time I was there they had a smokers room with tvs that were close to the stage. This room us great to hit on and work deals out with the girls. I've been to far more superior clubs than this one in montreal, but this one is good for a pitcher and boobs if you live nearby.
189	1	d	Pearlz Oyster Bar is a seafood \/ cocktail bar located in Charlotte, NC.  According to their website, they are \"The Eclectic Little Oyster Bar\" with several locations (including Columbia, SC; West Ashley, SC, Charleston, SC).  \n\nThey have Happy Hour specials!!  We were able to order the dozen oysters for $12.  Woot Woot!!\n\nFor entree, I ordered the Shrimp and Grits based on the recommendation of our waitress.  One of my colleagues ordered the Pearlz Signature Burger, so we ended up splitting our entrees.  My motto is always \"variety is the spice of life\" or \"sharing is caring\"!!  For dessert, I ordered the chocolate cake.  NOM NOM NOM!!\n\nMUST GET item is Shrimp and Grits!!  You won't regret it!!  ENJOY!!
190	0	d	These guys are great. I had Alberto help me with a part I needed for my Whirlpool electric oven. He was able to get me the original part and was well knowledgable. He even gave me a 10% discount for being a first time customers.Nice waking into a shop and immediately being greeted and not ignored. I love supporting local business no more online repair clinic for me. Keep up the great work guys. Thank you Bryan
191	1	d	Warning friends, if you PARK valet or handicap, your car might get a dent on your fender from the Valet guy. Check your car out. Or carry lots of insurance, making dining even more expensive there. \nI was parked in handicap and he dented my rear fender, but unfortunately I didn't catch him.\nMe, next time I will have to sit by the window and watch the car every second.
192	1	d	La Fonda is located next to Oregano's on Shea.  It's a small little Mexican restaurant, but the food is really good.  The salsa is delish and the margaritas can always bring a smile to my face.  They're really strong, like a good margarita should be, and purchasing a pitcher of them mid-day when I should be working, makes them taste even better.\n\nThe waiters are friendly and fast, and I've never had a bad experience there.  It's a casual place, so you can come dressed however you want, and it's the perfect spot for a quick meal.  I've never had to wait for a table either- which is good for me, but probably not so great for the restaurant. \n\nA couple of times, I've come here instead of going to Oregano's when they have their two hour wait going on, and I'm always glad I did.  Give it a try next time you're in the area!
193	0	d	This a great restraunt with great service. Many different sauces to choose from. Nice atmosphere.
194	1	d	What a great addition to the downtown area! Smooth Eats stepped into a former juice bar but added friendly service and a limited but well-executed menu. It's definitely an upgrade in my book.\n\nThe smoothies are all $5 and you can add on extra ingredients like flax seed, protein, etc. but I stick to the basics. The Beetbox and ProGreens are solid smoothies... actually, they're liquid, like they're supposed to be, but the flavors aren't overwhelmingly earthy, bitter, or sweet, which seems to happen when I take a chance on chain smoothies. \n\nThey have paninis, toasts, and acai bowls for those wanting something more substantial. So far, I've only tried the SD Toast (sundried tomato pesto, avocado, cilantro, sea salt) but I was impressed. I plan to try their strawberry version on my next visit!\n\nTIP: If you're driving, this grab and go business is in a paid parking area. Short of them getting a dedicated parking space out front, your best bet is to pull into the lot around back and be quick.
195	1	d	This is an updated review THIS WAS SOLD TO NEW OWNERS. So completely different nothing tasted the same. The old owners family biz are long gone. Bunch of teens sending out microwave meals only a matter of time before this place closes.
196	0	d	Simply the most fun! Anyone can play great service and pub grub food hits the spot!\nPeople of all ages and skill can play. Don't need your own clubs. I hate playing golf at a course takes up the entire day. This is fun!!!!
197	1	d	Good creamy ice-cream in many exotic Indian Flavors. \n\nThe ice-creams are all natural and don't contain eggs.\n\nI didn't know what flavor to order here. I tried a sample of one of the more colorful flavors. Maybe it was Mitha Paan? WOW! it was so intense. I wasn't ready for it. It had so many flavors going on that my brain couldn't process all the flavors going on and it ended with with a fennel flavor finish. So different and interesting.\n\nI wasn't prepared for that kind of excitement so I went with a lower octane flavor of Lychee. It tasted just like Lychee with chunks of Lychee in it. The Ice-cream was creamy and delicious.\n\nMy husband had the Butterscotch. It was also very good and tasted just like Butterscotch.\n\nInteresting sugar-free options are on the menu too.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean and bright.\n\n Plenty of easy parking.\n\nThe woman working there was cheerful an helpful.
198	0	d	I suggest skipping this place and go to the food court. Restaurant: walked past many dirty tables. Washroom was filthy.\nWaited for 20 minutes for the server to arrive. Food took a long time to arrive. \nFood: I had their all day breakfast. Ordered poached eggs and they were cooked properly, but the plate was dirty, toast was cold and the potatoes were soaked in oil. The coffee was fresh and hot, which was the highlight of the meal! \nHad to get up and find someone to get the bill and when it arrived, it was wrong! \nThis place has significantly declined over the years. There are much better options.
199	0	d	The food is so delicious and makes my belly extremely happy! The flavor is literally like a punch in the mouth. The desserts are also awesome and fun to pick out: )  the chicken tikka masala is my favorite. And this is my favorite place to get the masala!
200	1	d	I have a feeling their Mahi Mahi tacos will be calling my name. Beckoning from below Potomac Ave (I live in Dormont, hence the reference). So I'll absolutely need to answer this call often. \n\nThe tacos were packed high with rice, pico de gallo, lettuce, guacamole, and aderezo chipotle mayo. Come to think of it, I think the mayo and gauc really put them over the edge! Plus, they came on Las Palmas corn tortillas (I asked!). \n\nWe ordered a side of chips and salsa too. While the chips didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked, I wonder if they were also picked up from Las Palmas and not baked in house? The salsa was good though, and wasn't too spicy. For those who love spice, this might be mild for you.\n\nThe place is pretty basic Mexican joint. Quick and friendly service, with plenty of seating and parking. I'm actually surprised it wasn't busier on a Saturday night, but they're new, so hopefully word will spread about their great Mahi Mahi tacos and beyond!
201	0	d	Another great experience at Big O.  Service writer Raimon Broughton was friendly, pleasant and didn't waste a lot of time trying to upsell.  Brought the wife's car in for oil change and tire rotation.  Arrived at 7 am and was out the door by 8 am.\n\nLove this place!
202	0	d	I have another update on this wonderful recliner and La-Z-Boy service:\nThe chair is now 2 1\/2 years old. In the meantime my husband is a permanent resident in a nursing home, and of course, the chair moved with him. \nAs of yesterday the chair is not reclining, heating, massaging once again.\nI called the store in North Olmsted, OH (Ursula) around 6pm, and after explaining the situation, she promised to send a fax immediately to the service department, making it an emergency because of the personal situation. I was told the chair is still under warranty.\nI received a call today at 10:30 am from the service department, they received the fax after 9pm last night, but did not read it until this morning, because they close at 5pm, and they will not come out before tomorrow afternoon.\nThe electric parts of the chair are under warranty, but I have to pay for service call and labor.\nLa-Z-Boy cannot be serious!!!! I paid a lot of money for this recliner, and their stupid warranty does NOT cover labor? \nFor the money I paid I could have bought 3 lift recliners at DrugMart, and they last longer. I know what I am talking about, because we had one. We just sold it, stupid me.\n\nI repeat myself, but I will NEVER ever buy another piece of furniture from LA-Z-Boy, nor will I recommend them. And I still consider to contact the Better Business Bureau.
203	1	d	This review is strictly for the esthetician services at Aveda Institute. \n\nI needed facial, badly. Ok, ok, I didn't \"need\" a facial, but I sure wanted one and I didn't want to spend a bunch of cash. Enter Aveda Institute. It's right around the corner from me, conveniently located in the north end of South End! This particular cosmetology school offers a whole variety of spa treatments from hair, to skincare, to waxing, etc. After chatting with the very since receptionist about their facial types, I chose the 60 minute Tourmaline Facial, priced at $45. (which is an absolute steal)\n\nAmanda was my esthetician and she was absolutely wonderful. The whole process took roughly 1.5 hours (exactly what the receptionist claimed on the phone) and I was so happy with the experience. Amanda took me through a bunch of different questions in the beginning to determine my personality, goals of the facial and scents to go along with it. It was super relaxing and my skin is quite happy with me. This particular facial focuses on exfoliating and re-engergizing the skin. While Amanda offered to do extractions if needed, I chose not to. For $45 this is an amazing facial, I highly, highly recommend it!\n\nNote to those who want to score some amazing and affordable Aveda services here:\n\n1) Call ahead. If you work a traditional 9-5 job and you need a Saturday appointment, expect to wait at least 2-3 weeks for an available time slot.\n\n2) Be patient and kind. These men and women are students at the school. While you are paying for their services, keep in mind that they are still learning and you will likely have to give your input to their instructors afterwards. \n\n3) Block out some serious time, especially for hair treatments. At a previous visit it took almost four hours from start to finish for a partial highlight. This as no fault of the student's, it just took a long time to flag down an instructor for the various parts of the service.
204	1	d	inside rio all-suite hotel...off to the far right and back from hotel entrance..away from everything else and can be difficult to find...beautiful entrance with elephant statues greeting guests...butter chicken and side order of nan roughly $35 total after tax and tip with no drink orders...first, mention prices are quite high for indian...but, decor is elegant and sophisticated to justify the higher pricing...in for a quick meal and taking a seat at the bar...full menu provided and order with the bartender...bartender busy filling drink orders for the tables, so taking some time to place the order...ordered and food taking equally long to be served...butter chicken was tasteful in creamy buttery rich mild curry spices and nan piping hot, but an extra charge for nan and not included...decent meal, but have to mention that $35 is really steep!
205	0	d	Rented a bike from Golden Triangle Bike Rental for Pedal Pittsburgh on Sunday 8\/28\/16.\nStaff was very friendly and professional.  Bikes are fantastic.  Rented a hybrid that made my 12.5 mile ride such a pleasure.  Don't hesitate to rent your bikes here.  Plus they are at the start of the trail to anywhere you choose to bike in Pittsburgh.\n\nHad a blast
206	0	d	They have a lot of vegetarian options and a few items can be made vegan, you just have to ask your server. I had a really sweet waitress who called the bakery to double check if their sourdough had eggs or dairy (no eggs, iffy on the dairy) and gave a suggestion for a scramble with no eggs or cheese. I ended up ordering it and it tasted great! FYI their potatoes are fried in the same oil as the meat but they can bake them desperately, it just takes a little longer. Thank you for taking care of my needs Le Peep!
207	1	d	I was very impressed. This is the best Mongolian grill I have been to so far.\n\nA lot of people seem to be complaining about the fans and the way you have to put together your own recipe....and I don't get that. We live in Phoenix, the fans were quite welcome; and there are racks of recipe \"cheat sheets\" if you aren't creative or your culinary aptitude is nil.\n\nThat being said, I was thoroughly impressed with the selection of all ingredients--particularly the array of spices and sauces to choose from. The \"3G sauce\" as it was called if I remember correctly, is recommended highly. \n\nLike others have said, a bottomless bowl is definitely not necessary, one bowl was more than enough. Also, they have bottled domestic beers for only $1 all day every day last time I was in, so get down on that, why not. Two beers cost me less than my friend's coke.\n\nThis place deserves a higher rating, give it a try.
208	0	d	The family was back in Vegas over 4th of July weekend, and so we had to come back to Frank & Fina's for some authentic Mexican, and man they didn't disappoint, at all!\n\nLast year we visited on 4th of July, this year we visited a couple days before the 4th, thinking it would be less full, and boy were we wrong! It was actually packed (and for a very good reason!). Fortunately, we were seated immediately upon getting there, and were delighted to see that a couple of the waitresses recognized us from our previous trip, welcoming us back.\n\nYou can't come to F&F's and not order the Empanadas appetizer! You just can't! Four beef\/cheese filled turnovers, that taste awesome paired with the chipotle ranch dip that comes with them! Hands down their signature appetizer!\n\nOn this particular visit, we were fortunate that the house specials of the day included Spinach Tamales (pictured). While I didn't taste them, pops and moms each had one and they both loved the taste and texture of it. Moms wasn't expecting it to taste great, but the seasoning of the spinach won her over. Being a vegetarian, she often complaints that there isn't much great tasting vegetarian fare these days at restaurants. She kept complementing how great the tamale tasted and pops echoed her sentiment. A first, since we're used to tamales with pork\/chicken\/dulce, but never one made of spinach. Kudos for the great idea to the folks at F&F's!\n\nMyself, I was hungry and so I had the Shrimp al Mojo de Ajo and the Al pastor burrito. The servings here are always generous, and so I skipped on the beans\/rice and gave those to my parents, and I just went in on the shrimp and the burrito. It was my first time tasting the Al pastor burrito here, and I am glad I did. It is now one of my favorite dishes here at F&F's. The meat tender, cooked to perfection, and the Al pastor flavoring just perfect, not too heavy, not too lean. The Shrimp were also great tasting and plentiful. It took well over an hour, but managed to finish my entree LOL\n\nOverall, service was great as always (And who doesn't appreciate when the wait staff actually remembers you from a year ago?). That is truly an awesome thing. So far, we are 2\/2 with F&F's and have made it our favorite Vegas Mexican restaurant. We shall return in the fall again!\n\nUntil then, happy adventures folks!
209	1	d	Kyoto is an Old Town staple. It was there long before the endless miles of trendy restaurants, sushi joints and clubs. It was there when Devils Martini, Myst and Axis Radius were the \"cool\" spots to party and it was the place you'd visit for sake and Teppanyaki to get the night started right. But those are the days of yesteryear, the real question is: how is Kyoto now? Still chugging! \n\nSo the decor isn't as trendy as some of the newer restaurants out there. So the building is a little run down. So there are cooler spots to visit at night. Who cares! Kyoto is fun, it has good food and the drinks are flowing and flowing...and flowing! \n\nI visit Kyoto when I want to sake bomb and enjoy fried rice that becomes a beating heart, a flaming mountain of onions, one heck of a fire show and of course hearty, decent food! Yes, it's cheesy but it's fun...especially when sake is involved!\n\nKyoto is a fun spot for a group dinner when you want something lively, you want something close to the bars in Old Town and you want something that isn't too stuffy. Be warned, it gets crowded, so make a reservation or get there early.
210	0	d	Great spot in the heart of Toronto for a little history, scenery and culinary experience.  Fusion menu of different bites, I enjoyed the lobster and shrimp rolls.  The cheese plate to start was good and the overall experience was worthy of a second visit.  Try both the sangrias red and white, refreshing treat!
211	1	d	It is truly an oasis!  \nThe 11,000 sq. ft. building houses desert critters, exhibits, environmental classes for children and adults and a gift store that sells Seeds of Change!   Lots to do for the kiddos.  \nThere was even a \"Meet and Greet\" the animals class going on when we were there.   The staff are very friendly and helpful.   \nFour miles of paved and dirt trails for walking, hiking and even biking paths intertwine the park.   Plenty of trees for shade.  \nFishing with an urban permit is allowed.  Just don't know what the maximum you can keep.\nNo jungle gym around.  Just a little pony wall for the kids to walk and balance on.  They still had a blast!\nThe Ramadas are open for reservations.  I would say they hold about 30-50 people.   \nCheck this place out and don't forget to go online for class schedules.
212	1	d	I Absolutely love this store and have been several times over and it is always much Fun! I always find whatever I am looking for no matter what I could want or desire! They have a great variety of toys, clothes, shoes, videos and party items. \n\nThey also have a 20% off Yelp check in discount off of any one item! I love this store and the staff is laid back and always super friendly. \n\nMy recent visit was really fun as I took my baby girl to check things out because we love anything Nympho related. We are such Naughty girls that we never want to leave the store!\n\nI will be back many times over for fun goodies to play with!
213	1	d	Why would anyone want to go to a place like this? Everywhere you look is pure terribleness.\n\nThe place itself is sooo 30 years ago and has more awful wood veneer than the veneer room in an '80s Chrysler minivan factory.\n\nThe menu is ridiculously confusing and most (not all) of the workers are unattractive and unfriendly and simply don't care and don't care to help you.\n\nAnd the food is sooo unhealthy! After ordering a hotdog and a small fry, one of the workers was like \"Anti-diet food right there,\" he said.\n\nOh, and the bathrooms aren't much bigger than the large fries!! If you actually manage to find them and survive the climb down the veneer lined, near 90 degree angle stairs. \n\nSo why the 4 stars? Because the food truly is good and they came up with a winning idea many years ago and they're simply leaving good enough alone.
214	1	d	With a name like Springs Preserve and the emphasis on gardens on their website, I was under the impression this was a botanical garden. The garden was not suited for adult horticulturalists, but better geared towards small children with concrete paths and fortified borders that prevent trampling. It is rare for me NOT to take a photo in a botanical garden, but there were no images worth capturing.\n\nThe site contains the Nevada State Museum, Origen Museum, Springs Amphitheater, Desert Living Center, Botanical Garden, and Boomtown 1905. This mélange of museums was an annoying mystery of confusion.\n\nConfusing Layout: The entrances to exhibits are not clearly marked. I was unsure which buildings had exhibits even with a map. Inside the Origen Museum (spelled Ori-Gen on the building showing they don't know how to spell names of their own museums), three of the four galleries funnel visitors out the back of the building instead of returning to the central lobby to start another gallery. I still don't know what the Desert Living Center (sounds like a retirement home) is after being there. The place has the flow of the Winchester Mansion which was frustrating and annoying for someone that doesn't like to waste time getting lost on his vacation.\n\nConfusing Purpose: Not sure what has been \"preserved\" at Springs Preserve. The heavily constructed compound of buildings destroyed more than it preserved. With the campus of outdoor plazas, amphitheaters, and meeting rooms, a key purpose seems to be the preservation of having a conference.\n\nConfusing Prices: Be prepared to pay more than the general admission fee. The butterfly exhibit cost extra. The Boomtown 1905 Train (which was a short rail-less tram ride) cost extra. Some demonstrations cost extra. Crafting classes cost extra. While planning this trip months ago, I had read about a combo ticket that gained entry to both Springs Preserve and the Nevada State Museum, but it appears that policy is gone. Because I thought the old policy was still in effect, I saw that the visitor brochure treated the Nevada State Museum like a footnote, and there were surcharges on many exhibits, we skipped the Nevada State Museum. So, we erroneously missed a major piece of this hodge-podge of museums because, to be repetitive, this place is confusing.\n\nFinally, this is not a good tourist attraction for out-of-staters like me. The pricing structure and event schedule is geared towards visitors that can easily return like locals.
215	0	d	Dustin was awesome amazing customer service skills give him a raise he helped us find exactly what we needed
216	0	d	I've been to other Panera Bread Co's in the Midwest - they have always been pretty popular. Me, never really been a fan and this one left me with the same impression - food-wise. Worse was - as other have said - the flow from order to service in the place. Odd layout and awkward waiting area.\n\nVery slow service and the staff members did very little interaction, other than answering questions I had to ask to ensure I was getting the correct order. Are there two bagels there? Is this the whole order? etc. No smile. No thank you when I left.
217	1	d	I've been wanting to visit ChopShop since I saw a long line at the Scottsdale location. I am never patient to wait in line so I didn't go so here was my chance on a Friday around 4pm to go to the Tempe location. There was probably no wait this time and I was right. We took advantage of happy hour sangrias for $5. It was good, but the portion was a little light. \n\nI ordered the shrimp protein bowl with forbidden rice and fiancé ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl with forbidden rice. Both were good, healthy, and filling. I also ordered the almond butter brownies. That was a total \"fail\". I can make better paleo brownies...\n\nThe bill = 2 sangrias, 2 protein bowls, 1 brownie = $36.21 + $2 parking fee.\n\nOverall, I think ChopShop is a tad bit overpriced and a little overrated.....and I'm a little over it.
218	0	d	Always gotta come here for my crab fried rice cravings. Everything here is delicious and I love that you can customize spice levels on nearly everything and I do love spice! Probably my favorite Thai place in Vegas and the prices are decent!
219	0	d	the breakfast are of course egg-ceptional. except i never get the eggs. the protein pancakes.....so freaking good and belly filling. and healthy except i usually douse them in syrup, but so what. great friendly and quick staff. very affordable.
220	0	d	We were looking for a dinner place in the Yonge-Eglington area and bamburger came up as an option with a solid 4 stars. Unfortunately we were really disappointed with the quality of food here. The only good part of our experience here was the service. They had 5$ margarita specials which were crap. We ordered a bamburger with caramelized onions and cheese. The burger lacked flavor and was not worth the 13-14$ charge. We also ordered the club sandwich which was ok.
221	0	d	It's the second time that my buddy and I went to this place... First time it was for happy hour on a Thursday night sometime in January and back a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night to watch the game in the bar section.  Food is ok, but nothing fantastic for the price and the bar section is crammed against a wall and I don't feel it gets the space and love that it should get.\n\nNot going back anytime soon.\n\n===\nAdditional comment:\n\nI'll give it another shot in a warmer month.  I don't think that this is going to help much for the bar section when trying to watch a game, but I promise to try it!
222	0	d	We love coming here, particularly for lunch.  It's fresh and much care is put into every dish.  The sweet potato fries are the best anywhere.  The soups are fresh and they have many different types of grilled cheese.  One particular is served on a pear bread that is amazing!  The kids menu is even good.  Not that substituted junk food many restaurants will skimp on when it comes to the kids menu.  Only one thing I would change is they serve an amazing peach\/pear cobbler and the fruit is very skimpy.  It needs more fruit and less topping.  You kind of have to dig around to find any fruit.  Maybe it's because the time of year and they will add more fruit around summer.  Not sure... But this place is still a 5 star!
223	0	d	Yes I was a walk in but I did not expect to wait an hr before the art is could meet with us. And when my friend and I tried to leave they did pushy rush sweet talk to get us stay. We stayed and the artist was amazing and drew up the bff tatt we wanted. But the wait game or we can schedule appt later pushy tactic wasn't working for me.
224	0	d	DO NOT COME HERE!! WILL DAMAGE YOUR PHONE TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN!\n\nThe only reason I came here was because my LCD broke and the person who worked at verizon told me about this place. What I should have done was research more repair shops than this place. \n\nI paid $235 to repair the LCD on my galaxyS4. It worked for a few weeks with no problem. Then all of a sudden my phone wouldn't charge at all and wouldn't even turn on. I went to verizon wireless and they got it to turn on and as soon as they started charging it for me, my phone became burning hot to the point I couldn't even hold it in my hands. My phone shut off automatically due to the heat and I couldn't get it to turn on again. \n\nI took it to a different repair shop that's been recommended by many people. They took apart my phone to see what was going on, and the guy asked me if I replaced my LCD on my phone before. He said that the people that replaced the LCD did something with the electrical wiring that's causing short circuits in the phone and basically will be hard to fix. \n\nSo this repair place basically F'd up my phone. I paid $235 to these scam artists for them to only break my phone to the point of no return. I lost everything in my phone. All my contacts, photos! Everything! \n\nDO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT THESE PEOPLE TO DAMAGE YOUR PHONE!
225	1	d	3.5 stars.  Solid but basic.  A decent grocery store for the neighbourhood.\n\nI find Longo's the consistent decent smaller grocery store that is buried in a neighbourhood.  This one is no different and has a fairly easy parking lot to get in and out of.  It's been a while since I stepped into a Longo's.  My past experiences have been very good with lot of unique little curated items that go beyond your Food Basics and No Frills.  This spot is well maintained, clean, with many staff keeping everything in order. \n\nAs for the produce themselves, I felt they do have better items than a No Frills or Food Basics.  Nothing is wilted, mushy, or looking damaged here.  The only concern I had was that the offering felt very standard.  If you were looking for something a little more special... you wouldnt be able to find it here or if you did find it, you wouldnt purchase a small amount as they packaged them in larger containers.  So mushrooms... your basic white, brown, and portabello is only available but if you want a nicer oyster, you'd need to buy a whole box.  Same for peppers.  Overall, I do feel the quality is better so its definitely a step up from most spots.  The butcher area was smaller than other spots but everything looked fresh.\n\nAs for the prices, I felt they're a touch more expensive but if it's to maintain better quality, I could understand it.  They do have things on sale but sometimes the $0.50 off a $10 item seems a bit silly.  It's not a value spot but it's acceptable.  Service at the cashier was nice and pleasant.  They had at least 4 spots open so there wasn't a crazy line up here.  \n\nOverall, I wouldn't purposely drive out to here for my groceries but if I was desperate for the basics, it would work in a pinch.
226	0	d	My regular hair dreser is on the south side and I live in Avondale & needed to find someone closer. I did my research & decided to on Luxe Appeals b\/c of the reviews. So i I visited Zanette at the end of June to get a relaxer Touch up. she wasn't fully paying attention to what she was doing and and more concentrated conversing with her father so I probably shouldn't have been surprised when I realized that getting half through my hair with the relaxer she had to mix another bowl, I knew right then my hair was gonna be over processed. She washed it more than a couple times and conditioned it so I thought that maybe she had neutralized it enough... wrong, the next day my edges were itching like crazy. b\/c I was going on vacation I had to wait a week to get it deep condition by another stylist somewhere else b\/c my edges felt like hay and were breaking off really bad. I was able to save the front but by the end of July the back of my hair was gone, bald. Now my hair was pretty long, mid shoulder blade length when i went to her, all of that is noticeably damaged even after multiple deep conditionings. Here we are in September and my hair is still falling out. I should request free conditioning treatments, but now I dont trust them. She might be great with weaves, but dont let her relax you.
227	1	d	I haven't purchased from Europtical, but that's not enough to keep me from reviewing them. \n\nI have frames I love, I wasn't in the market for more, but the beloved frames of mine arrived in the post wonky and ill-fitting. I walked in, asked them if they wouldn't mind adjusting them for me and with a smile she whisked them to the back and bing bam boom - adjusted!\n\nA month or so later, the frames again began to go a little haywire so I popped in after I grabbed an Americano from the adjacent Caribou Coffee. The gentleman who took my frames warned me that the adjustment came with a certain amount of risk and by the way, the reason they went wonky was due to my removal style. I slapped my own wrist and off he went. A minute later, he came back and made sure they felt better (which they did on the first try) then sent me on my way. Both adjustments free and with a smile. \n\nSadly, about two hours later on a flight to Chicago, the overhead bin opened during takeoff which sent a bag careening towards my head thus knocking my glasses to the floor and out of shape. I'll be visiting Europtical for yet another adjustment and while they never suggest I do, at some point I should probably buy something...
228	1	d	If your looking for brand name clothes, housing items, and other necessities, then Heartland Town Centre  is the place to go. Having stores sporadically spread out just a little over 4 quadrants means you might have to jump into your car once, twice or three times to \"store hop\" which can get tiring but can add a little bit of fun to your shopping experience. \n\nThere are number of clothing wear stores here with usually 50-75% less what you'd pay at a regular retail price. Hence, shopping at Heartland requires precision, an art form rather of which shop your going to go next. A place to be avoided on boxing day if you hate rush, and are slightly claustrophobic. \n\nBeing at Heartland usually will typically turn into an all-day venture, but one that can save you some money and get you some great items and make you feel like Alice in Wonderland as you accomplish this goal. 4 stars for having just about every store imaginable, throwing Costco in the mix, ample parking, and some good eats nestled in every quad.
229	1	d	This European market is a new find for me- I usually just take my business to Jones Market but love to stumble upon and explore other options around town. Heads up that this place does not have a produce section, but they make up for it by having a deli with sandwiches baked goods. \n\nExterior needs some work- appears to be a generic convenience store. Inside there are several rows and a few refrigerated sections, the aforementioned deli and a dine-in seating area, a ton of sweets\/baked goods, and a large section of alcohol\/wines and smoking paraphernalia\/products. \n\nStaff is laid back, store is clean. \nHighly recommend the deli section- they have a bomb Italian sando, as well as a really good turkey BLT option that's great with mozzarella. The meats and cheeses are cut to order. Baked goods include breads (day-old for as low as TWENTY CENTS) as well as sweets (giant cupcakes for under $2). Pricing is good, selection is decent.
230	0	d	We had some phenomenal seafood here. The service was fantastic. Our waiter provided the best customer service ever
231	1	d	I'll be contacting the BBB to report this business because it is blatantly RACIST & I don't on speak racism lightly. Matter of fact, I posted their racist comments in the picture gallery for others to review.  I found this place via Groupon and decided to give it a try. I thought the deal they offered was pretty good and maybe this can be a go to place for me and to bring a few of my friends in the future. I was wrong. The 20 minute detox was ok. The \"70 minute\" massage was ok even though the therapist keep stepping out to drink water and stretch quite loudly. The rooms are not private or remotely sound proof and I was even ok with that.  What was NOT OK was an unspoken minimum $10 tip. I found that out when I opted to give a $5 tip which is my right.  The set\/given price is the price, anything extra is at the customer's discretion...you can't force a tip.  The service was ok, not excellent and there was serious confusion due to me opting to give $5. After about 1 minute of me saying \"I want to give $5\" and them pointing at the paper saying \"good equals $10 suggested tip\" they finally got it. It was ok not good but due to the confusion & unnecessary racist remarks I will not be back to this business and would not suggest anyone else go there either. If I could give a rating for zero stars I would.
232	1	d	I've been to this airport at least 8 times over the past 2 years.  It's a pretty decent airport......has decent food, bars and most importantly FREE Wifi for internet access.\n\nAnother reason I enjoy this airport is the easy pickup\/drop off system for rental cars.  All you have to do is take one shuttle for all rental car companies, which takes you a couple of miles away to a central rental car location.  It's very easy and you don't have to deal with the airport pickup\/drop off passenger traffic.  Very convenient.\n\nOverall, it's a decent airport and the FREE Wifi is what makes it 4 Stars in my book.\n\nWill I return?  There's no doubt I will someday and I will be pleased as long as they hook up the internet access!
233	0	d	This place is excellent !! 5 star customer service and they also got my son's damaged I pad screen fixed in 60 mins!! He really needed it repaired quickly for school!! Stop in and asj for Morgan he is the best!!!
234	1	d	This place was great. Came here after the Boulder City Beer Fest and grabbed some grub. \n\nTo begin with, PBR on draft for $2. Deal? I think yes! \n\nFood: the food was great. I got the chicken strips with fries and a side of their homemade ranch. Diner style and really good after a day of drinking and being out in the sun. The girlfriend got the fig burger. Doesn't sound good off the start, but let me tell you...if you like the sweet\/salty combination, DEFINITELY give this burger a try! \n\nThe staff here is super friendly, and the place itself is dog-friendly as they have patio\/sidewalk seating. \n\nWould I come back here? Absolutely.\n\nWould I recommend this place to others? You betchya.
235	0	d	The food is consistent and very good. I have 2  favorites, louisiana pasta and the southwest chicken salad. Both are always excellent however I have noticed the amount of chicken in the lunch salad has become smaller. The portions are too large so my wife and I often split an entree. The vanilla bean cheesecake is perfect and during the holidays the pumpkin is worth a trip. \nThe bad. They can't make a cocktail to save their life.you have to chill the martini glass first and if the alcohol is an inch below the rim you've done something wrong. I have attempted drinks here 3 times. Never again.\nService is usually top notch.
236	0	d	This place is the best! They do a great job and are very friendly. I had two bridesmaids dresses altered here and they came out great. Highly recommended
237	1	d	Cibo is the average person's answer to Pizzeria Bianco.  I've rarely had to wait over 10 minutes to get a table.  Patio seating is quaint, romantic and perfect for a private date or a larger group.\n\nCibo has mainly salads, pizzas, and desserts.  Try the margarita pizza for a taste of a pure italian wood fired pizza.  Each serves 1-2 people.\n\nLocal favorite.
238	0	d	This is a really nice studio, very clean. You can tell it's still new but the place has a great vibe. I took an evening yoga class. The teacher was great. I really enjoyed it. They also offer other services, like massage and all different healing modalities.
239	0	d	We went for dinner my fiancé and another couple.  I am Mexican and I am a very picky eater but the enchiladas that I had were delicious! OMG they were so good!  I will definitely go there again! The food was full of flavor and I felt like I was at home.  Costumer service was friendly and very attentive.  Best Mexican food in town!
240	1	d	Wow I am really surprised at the reviews here as I did not think Crazy Pita was that great. Being that I've been to quite a few Greek\/Mediterranean places in Vegas I was kind of hesitant to try this place as it looked like a chain. I am not sure if they are or not, but regardless I was not impressed.\n\nCrazy Pita is located in Downtown Summerlin, and is easy to get to as it is situated outside of the shops. You can easily park in the lot out front and walk right up to the restaurant with ease.\n\nI ordered the Lamb Pita, which comes with french fries. But unfortunately, after I ordered I noticed you could switch to an alternative side, which I wish I had done.\n\nI took my food to go and when I arrived back at work there was ketchup smeared all over the inside of my to go container - because they had put a bunch of ketchup in it for the fries. It was all over the fries, and yes, even on the pita. Yuck. I didn't really tip my container that much, but I guess when I swung it in the car is probably when the ketchup waterfall happened.\n\nThe pita itself was OK -- Paymon's is better. The lamb was all right, not the best, not the worst, and it was in BIG chunks inside the pita, which made it kind of messy to eat. I would have rather just had the lamb chunks on a plate. The fries were HORRIBLE. Don't know if they were previously frozen, but either way just completely lacking any flavor\/spice\/etc. \n\nOverall, doubt I would return. There are better places to get a pita in town.
241	1	d	Ok- my biggest problem was that I had at my disposal either yelp check in coupon  for 15% off AND the 15% off one handed out at the nearby hotel I was saying at (downtown grand) but what sucked was neither is accepted at happy hour which is why I went to this establishment- I think both the coupon here at yelp or  the hotel should have stated it. My meal ran about $16 so I would of saved a bit to tip more...just saying\n\nThat said, it was super slow when I arrived. Servers were cut but mine was a nice rocker girl. She got busy after a bit but still was attentive. I got the meatballs, calamari and personal pizza ( the meat one). Meats and calamari were great, pizza was ok and a good size. I took half of it back to my room for snacking later. \n\nThe place works for happy hot adjacent to the hotel and area of downtown3rd.
242	1	d	While waiting for time to tick down which seemed to be forever cut through this casino since it was on the way. This is my first visit to this casino so decided to explore a little. I was surprised that in Binion's name is not hotel but a gambling hall. That was more interesting too. I absolutely love the hidden history of old Las Vegas, so decided to find a small cafe or something and eat a bite to consult Google about such history. The Binion's Cafe is what I came across which served really feel good food with that small town feel where there is probably still a Main Street, and only one post office with horse tie ups out side of it. \n\nThe casino gambling machines seemed to be upgraded in the last couple of years, I asked my server about this and he informed me they are still in the process of upgrading to provide the best guest service and stays. I tried my chances after eating at the cafe, but no luck this time it was a bust. \n\nThe brick adds a great feature to the old time feel I believe that Binion's is still trying to convey to their guests. It feels good in this hotel too, with great positive vibes. All of the staff that I did interact with was very helpful and pleasant. The customers that are gambling are very nice and while I was gambling struck up a conversation with me about the awful Vegas heat. The cool blowing air conditioning inside of Binion's keeps us all cool. One of the best things about this hotel that I did not notice was the casino spray that is used to help mask the cigarette smell. I did not notice it here, so it seems like the renovations that Binion's is doing is making new casino smell.
243	0	d	$5 cover Saturday night. Night at the Roxbury was a good time, but okay club. Quite a mix of all kinds of people with different styles, half sports bar with games- half dance club, and people just stand around and socialize on the top floor. Outdoor area as well. Right next to Dandelion. I'd go back, but I'd like to try some other places before returning.
244	0	d	When the baked potatoes have been sitting that long it is better to offer a substitution than deliver the poor quality you delivered tonight. Three of our 5 meals revolved around  those old potatoes. Tip for those ordering late. Stick with a sandwich those were tasty. Recommend the tea as well.
245	1	d	My husband and I came here last night for dinner with our 8 month old baby.  I wasn't sure what to expect after I called and made reservations. The lady I spoke with didn't seem friendly at all.\n\nOnce we arrived, we waited about 5-10 minutes for our table to be cleaned and they added a high chair our baby.  We got seated and our waiter was very prompt and came by to ask us for drinks.  Our drinks came pretty quick. We ordered our food and starters. I got a Caesar salad, which came with a small croissant. That croissant was like butter. They drizzled a sweet sauce over it which was like heaven.  The croissant was warm and crispy and soft on the inside. So yummy.  The salad was okay.   Like any other Caesar salad. The dressing was perfect though. Not too much or too little. My husband got the soup of the day, which was the tortilla soup. It was savory and delicious. He finished the entire cup. He also ordered the shrimp-escargot. Forgot the name of it. It was really good. Escargot styled shrimp with butter and melted cheese. Sooo delicious. \n\nWe waited quite a bit for our food. But when it arrived, it was massive. We were so full from the other food that we ate only half of our plate. I ordered the ribs and chicken combo, very good. The ribs are coated in a BBQ (I prefer my ribs dry).  My chicken, I didn't taste it, I was too full.  My daughter enjoyed it though.  My husband ordered the 14oz boneless ribeye, had it cooked medium.  It was surprisingly good. My husband is quite the cook when it comes to steaks and ribs.  The steak had a firewood taste which made it taste better. And his potato was so good.\n\nWe ordered dessert to go but it came with ice cream so our waiter brought the ice cream out and saved the brownie for later. He was so sweet, he doubled our scoops because he wanted to see if we could finish it all.  inside joke there.  But we did manage to finish it all.\n\nAll in all, great place for couples, groups, and kids. The crowd is older folks, maybe retirements, CEOs, etc.  We would come back if we are ever in this area again.
246	0	d	This place is really underrated in Shadyside.  I think it has some of the best burgers in the area.  You're able to customize your own burger so you can make it to your liking.  I got a double burger with onion rings and mango habanero on the side.  Just a heads up, the mango habanero isn't like Buffalo Wild Wings, it's more of a buffalo style sauce.  Also, on Thursdays, they have $1 drink night from 10pm-midnight.  Definitely a good pre-game spot.\n\nBig Stack Burger: 8.5\/10
247	1	d	The folks here are great. Since my transfer from disgusting smoker to guy who vapes I've made this my go-to spot.\n\nI'm not an expert on the subject by any means but these guys really take the time to help and be sure that you are getting what you want. They also have tons of great flavors that they let you try before you buy.\n\nReally cool part to me is if you spend a tad more money you are getting \"juice\" made in Prescott, not that \"who knows what is in it\" crap from China.\n\nNote that they don't have refills for \"Blu's\" or other cigarette type vaping devices. Just the refillable kind.
248	1	d	This is a new store inside Fashion Show Mall, across from Guess if I remember correctly. While shopping around, I noticed this store and thought, \"great! i can probably find a dress to go out in at this store.\" After walking into the store, I already found a dress I fell in love with - a turquoise silk halter dress with a gold koi fish print. \n\nThe store itself is pretty small, but has a good selection of dresses, tops, pants, and also menswear specifically for going out. They also have a large screen tv and had a Tiesto in concert DVD playing, pretty neat.\n\nI am giving the store three stars not based on their clothing selection, but the service and some other aspects I noticed. The girls working at the store were very helpful with what I needed, but were also very pushy. After entering the store and finding the first dress, and having them put it in the dressing room for me, I told one of the girls that I wanted to continue looking around. While I was trying to do this, she kept grabbing other dresses and bringing them to me asking me if I liked them. It was nice of her, but she was doing it in a very pushy way. After I tried on the dress, I was getting ready to leave the store, and the same girl asked me if I was going to buy it, and I told her I wanted to look around more. But she kept pushing me, and asking me why don't you buy it now? You're not going to find anything else around the mall. \n\nSo after that, I left the store pretty annoyed. Needless to say, I did go back and buy the dress since I liked it a lot. One other thing that bothered me was the fact that none of the clothes in the store had price tags. So basically, the staff could have been giving me any bullsh*t price if they wanted to. The girl told me it was $50 and that it was actually a special price during their opening week. I figured $50 sounded about right, maybe a little higher than it should have. But still, they need to get some price tags on their clothes.
249	1	d	Bottiglia has a southern chic vibe, once inside you would never guess you were in a casino in Las Vegas because it didn't feel over the top like most Vegas restaurants. I appreciated that they had a live musician singing and playing guitar throughout dinner, and service was prompt and friendly. \n\nThe best part of dinner was the complimentary basket of bread. Fresh and delicious, loved the crispy Parmesan cracker. The rest of the food was mediocre: caesar salad, gnocchi, and eggplant. \n\nI would order the eggplant again but skip on the rest. Perhaps we ordered the wrong thing...
250	1	d	My girlfriends and I (the Girl Posse) were looking for something to do on a Saturday Night.  Being that we're all married 30-something(some with kids) music fans, we don't always get a chance to get together and head out to a show.  But somehow the planets were aligned and the whole bunch went out to Moondog's for some great live music.\n\nThis is another one of those places in which I can't believe I'm the first to review.  Moondog's is a local institution, people!  It's been around here ever since I can remember.  Rusted Root played here in their pre-\"Send Me On My Way\" days.\n\nIt's everything you want in a small music venue.  Although does mean a slightly cramped seating area and the requisite long lines for the restrooms, it's a great intimate venue to see live music.  And Moondog's brings in the music!  It has everything from rock to blues to folk music.  The Starlite Lounge Restaurant is next door and you can order food from there and bring it into the club.  \n\nIt's local music folks.  Come out and support it!
251	1	d	No ladies and gentleman your not in kansas anymore. Your in friggin good ol las vegas be prepared to walk (and have your feet hurt cause you dumb broads are in 6 inch high heels, drunk off your ass) OR pay for a taxi (which should be against the law because they practically wallet rape you)\n\nWAIT! YOU SAY THERES ANOTHER SMART OPTION?!?!\n\nYes, folks, its called the monorail. Its not popular with the locals (because how often to locals need to go to every casino) but its the best kept secret for the tourists. Its like bar hopping but without the bars. Hmm, i guess i should call it casino hopping? If you want to save some cash and save your feet do the responsibly smart thing and buy a pass. Its only 12 bucks and you can ride it back and forth within a couple minutes... wait that sounds dirty.. hmm. you can go north or south :)\n\nThe monorail is completely safe! Not like NY where you have bums everywhere begging for money to use the subway. Its clean and surprisingly not busy. Why you ask? I assume because not many people know about. How often when your drinking do you look up and really admire the monorail. Umm, never! Your looking at all the bright lights like a kid in a candy store. \n\nThe only thing that i don't like is that it doesnt go to down town \"old\" las vegas, where fremont street is. If it continues down I'm sure those casinos would do a lot better. HINT HINT expand it please!!
252	0	d	Wow do these guys have everything or what. Games from the 40's forward. Like a kid in a candy store my day was made when I found this place, it is some of the cheapest entertainment in Vegas, so get off the strip and check this place out!
253	1	d	One cannot go wrong with a sweet treat on a hot Valley of the Sun fall day!  This DQ has solid offerings, is clean, and they are pretty quick with the orders.  My issue is with the extremely angry, moody, rude older Hispanic woman that works the counter regularly on Monday afternoons... She just oozes hatred... Hatred for her job, hatred for the customer, and hatred for everything in life... And that's why I can't and won't give this place anything more than two stars; because every time I head to the freezer for one of my tasty DQ treats the bitter, angry woman appears in my head!
254	0	d	5 etoiles surtout pour le service de Benoit et Tristan (qui se sont excellement ratrapés apres une confusion de reservation). Ambiance tres agreable, tres beaux local , decoration chaleureuse, service courtois de tout le staff, assiettes correctes , drinks delicieux :)
255	0	d	Wow this place is pretty cool.  Lots of old school pinball machines and some more modern and you can actually play most of the machines there.  Most of them are a quarter to play so it won't break the bank lol.  Come check it out.  It is pretty interesting and they give you a little history about each machine on a printed card next to it.
256	1	d	Dr Sharma is a good man, and thourough. (Lebowski quote) I wanted an actual Doctor vs. The procare\/quickcare I'd been relying on for a while because they always seem to RX the same zpack\/cough syrup\/nasal spray package regardless of what I have as a sickness and lately don't even seem to try to figure out what I have just RX meds. In January I got really sick and am pretty sure it wasn't diagnosed as serious as it was. Now sick again in March with lingering shortness of breathe from January's bronchitis(?) I read Dr. Sharma's yelp reviews and I'm glad I did. In and out in less than an hour for a new patient was good enough for me. Friendly listened and RX a steroid to get rid of possible chest infection from Jan. and antibiotic for current sickness (sinus infection?). Friendly, patient and efficient. Seemed to remember and be familiar with his existing patients. Didn't RX seemingly unnecessary things. When I asked for natural remedies he had some suggestions there too. I will go here from now on. They accept walk-ins and if you don't have insurance there's a flat fee for appointments as well.
257	1	d	This should have been a five star review. The hotel is amazing, the service is top notch and I had a wonderful time at the hotel. However, one thing really made me feel like a criminal and put a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nI like to iron my shirt before a big day of meetings and being CES, I wanted to be in top shape. I pulled out the iron and ironing board. To my surprise, not only did the ironing board have a iron holder bolted to the end of the board (making that end worthless and making ironing a shirt challenging) but it had a security cord attaching the iron to the board. Did they think I was going to steal the iron? Do they really have a problem with that? \n\nI've stayed at hotels from no star to four star and this is the first time they have ever been attached. It's challenging enough to iron with the cord much less having two cords. I hope that Vdara will correct this. I can't imagine that iron theft is a problem and if it is why don't you just charge the client. \n\nIt's a bummer that such a classy place has this low-class security.
258	0	d	More like 3.5 stars, but you'll get the picture.  \n\nTHEhotel (besides being kind of obnoxious to say) is a gorgeous hotel.  Stylish and chic--as a lot of other people have pointed out.  Nothing outdated here, so far as I could tell.  The suite was roomy, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and we loved having the extra bathroom\/TVs, etc. \n\nThe clientele was generally young\/trendy and attractive, or this is at least the clientele THEhotel is trying to target--we'll have to go back when the pools are open and the weather is warmer to check out the pool scene at Mandalay Bay.  \n\nService was generally good.  The $18\/day resort fee was painful, especially because it included things like newspapers that you have to specifically request, spotty internet service, and the ability to use a gym with no weight room (access to the weight room costs an extra $15.)  \n\nLocation is basically the Mandalay Bay, so you're on the edge of the Strip, and will need to either cab, limo, drive, or build in a lot of time to walk.  We walked during the day to the strip (taking advantage of the shuttle that gets you to the Excalibur) but generally cabbed it at night.  It's only a $10 cab ride to the center\/other side of the strip, so not too bad.  \n\nWithin THEhotel, there's no casino but it's connected by a short hallway to the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, which is huge, and has tons of restaurants, bars, etc. \n\nHint: there are a couple of nice pool tables hidden back near the lounge near the front desk.  It's a great diversion if you're looking to spend some time away from the tables. \n\nI would probably recommend staying here in the summer, given the reviews I've seen for the pool next door.  In the winter, it's not quite worth being so far off the strip, when you have similarly trendy options like the Cosmopolitan or Aria that are right in the center of things.
259	0	d	Caught this Starbucks not only over charging me but charging my transactions multiple times! They don't even fill their drinks up all the way. What an awful location!
260	0	d	Great food, excellent service. What more can you say about a place. Everything I have had here has been amazing and I will continue to return and try all the other amazing items on their menu.
261	0	d	You can get really good and cheap traditional Chinese food here. Their lunch special is awesome! $5 dishes and the portions are the same as dinner. They have about 60 items on their menu. And the lunch special is everyday from 10-3pm. I've included a picture of their menu here.\n\nI've only been there about 3 times so far. I had their dim sum (8 kinds, $2 each I believe), which is not  great.  But my favorite is #33 House Special Fried Rice. It's fried rice with spicy garlic and seafood. It is so good!\n\nI've also gotten their Hainan Chicken Rice (#2), Beef Chow Fun (#38) and Pork Rib in Black Bean Sauce Hot Pot Rice. They are all pretty good. \n\nBecause of their lunch special, it can get really busy at lunch and the service can be slow and sloppy but their great food and cheap price totally makes up for it. Give this place a try! You will love it!
262	1	d	Einstein Bagels is a nice place to go and get a quick breakfast.  They have great bagels and sandwich's to choose from.  It was my first time coming to Einstein's.  \n\nThe atmosphere was great and they had free Wi-Fi, also the staff that was working that morning where really friendly and helpful.  I had the southwest Turkey-Sausage Egg White sandwich and it was pretty good and spicy too.  \n\nIf you are ever in Vegas and looking for a place to eat that is not to expansive you should head over to Einstein Bros.  It is just a couple of miles off the strip.
263	1	d	There is something wrong with my butt or there is something wrong with the chairs at Noodle Bar. I like you David Chang and we love you in our city. I get the concept of Noodle Bar - quick service, eat and leave, but boy those chairs are uncomfortable.\n\nAfter I whined and complained about my butt and the chairs then came the pork belly buns. I think I inhaled both of them in 1 min flat. A perfect bite - I understand why they are famous and why they made the Momofuku brand famous, just EXCELLENT!!! I almost forgot about my butt and the chairs, almost...
264	1	d	Reunited and it feels so good!!!\n\nIt took me numerous tries at numerous salons to find \"my\" nail lady. The nail technician that is skilled at doing nails, that is a good conversationalist and that is respectful of my time. Thanks to a recommendation from Shirley B., I had found \"my\" nail lady, Tina,  at another salon in Henderson...\n\nAs one might imagine, I was very disappointed when I arrived at that other salon for my appointment only to be told that Tina was no longer working for them. Back to square one, it was time to try to find a new nail lady. \n\nI tried a couple places and the nail techs were ok, but they weren't Tina. Then one day I got a text from Shirley B. There had been a Tina spotting in the Henderson area! She was currently working at the new salon Nails with Love. I quickly looked the salon up on Yelp, saw that I was able to make an appointment via the website and signed up for a gel manicure the next day with Tina. \n\nTina is fantastic at nails. Want a specific design? She can do it. Not sure what you want? She'll find the perfect design for you on Pinterest. Want something simple? She'll make that look good too. Her gel manicures last me three weeks without any lifting or chipping. And the prices at Nails with Love are very reasonable. Make sure you check in on Yelp for 10% off! \n\nThe salon itself is nothing special, it is currently being renovated. There was no sign out front when I was last there, Nails with Love in in the same plaza as Rosatis Pizza and Wahoo Fish Tacos.  \n\nI am so happy to have found \"my\" nail lady again! Thank you Shirley!!!
265	1	d	Very unprofessional environment filled with unfriendly people. I went in with a friend and one of the barbers was drinking beer and on the phone while cutting someones hair. No one greets you when you walk in and don't even bother smiling at anyone 'cus they'll look right passed you.
266	0	d	Hands down...the best Applebees I've ever been to. Our server, Caylan, was amazing and the manager was super friendly. Our food came fast, our drinks were always full, and she even got us drinks to go without even having to ask her. The restaurant was cozy and very clean. I will definitely be back. Highly recommend going to this little hidden gem.
267	1	d	When someone says \"Lets get Mexican for breakfast... there is this place on 12th street and Van Buren....\" my stomach takes a dive and common sense tells me that it's probably not a very good idea, but I was in an adventurous mood and Dallas G. is normally always spot on with his restaurant choices, so I decided to give it a whirl. \n\nUm... hell yeah! La Tolteca was awesome! Any place that has a full on Mexican bakery staring you in the face when you walk in is fine by me! I was lovingly admiring the watermelon shaped cookies from afar. I will be back... my stomach said. \n\nWe got up to the menu board and I was impressed with the huge selection of items they had to offer. Honestly, if you cant find something that gets the juices flowing here, you have some seriously demented taste buds. \n\nI opted for the egg and cheese burrito with pico and a side of beans and rice. I slathered on the green sauce from the salsa bar and munched away at the deliciousness as the sweat poured down my face. This was one spicy, but tasty, breakfast! \n\nD.G. got the huevos rancheros. I didn't try them, but they looked pretty damn good and he seemed to be enjoying them. He also opted for the horchatta, which I normally don't like, but was pleasantly surprised with. \n\nAnother thing I really want to point out is that the people that work here are REALLY nice, even to us whities. Normally I do not get such a welcome reception, but honestly, the workers were dancing and singing to the festive tunes and even the lady at the pick up counter had a smile on her face. \n\nI planned on hitting up the bakery for that watermelon cookie, but my $6 breakfast burro, rice and beans had me FULL... so I will be back for you my little cookie.. yes... I will be back!!!
268	0	d	Holy Ravioli!  This has got to be one of the premier hotels on the planet.  Get lost on a stroll through the canals, stop to smell the anchovies and hear the chorus of street performers at any given moment.  Add to this the blue man group and tao beach and not much else is needed for an awesome vegas vacation the griswolds would be proud of.  Casino wins sold separately.
269	1	d	Kamakura wouldn't be a great Japanese restaurant back home, but it's pretty good for Champaign, and my heart lept to see Katsu, Udon, Soba, and so many other thigns that remind me of home.  Te setting is a bit too 'Orientalist,' and the food average, but I'm definitely coming back, because an approximation of the food I'm used to eating in California is better than none at all.
270	1	d	And now ladies and gentlemen, the category tonight: Things that make Siu-Wok A-OK in my book.\n\nHere we go....\n\n#10 - I can actually understand the people that answer the phone\n#9 - The sweet burn on my tongue after eating a mouthful of Kung Pao Chicken\n#8 - The lack of lasting gastral repercussions from eating said Kung Pao Chicken\n#7 - The friggin huge area to which they will deliver, for a minimal $2 charge (beware their website says it's a buck-fifty, but the gas crunch is effecting everyone)\n#6 - The pork fried rice that is literally one part rice mixed with one part tender \/ tasty pork\n#5 - The place is actually clean\n#4 - The coupons attached to the menus that they send to my home at regular intervals\n#3 -  I can call in an order, hop in my car to pick it up, and be back watching quality reality programming within 15 minutes\n#2 - They have Mr. Pibb on tap\n\nAnd the number 1 thing that makes Siu-Wok A-OK in my book...\nEight... yes count 'em, eight, yummy soups that they will deliver to my door when I just can't bring myself to change out of my pajamas!!!
271	1	d	Yo, check it. I went with my homegirl Gaby and it ended up being one of the best conversations I've had in my life. We talked about love life, career, etc. Ya know, catching up. She's a cool ass chick, love her.\n\nAfterwards, we watched Drive. Ryan Gosling is a beast. Respect.\n\nDrive was better than Passion of the Christ and better than Lethal Weapon 4.
272	0	d	my roomie and i decided that we deserved to treat ourselves with mani\/pedis after a long hard week. great service. the nail techs are really nice and do a great job. i think they liked that i was vietnamese, thats probably the most i've spoken in vietnamese in a very long time.  very clean salon. the chairs for the pedicures were nice...they had a weird butt massage thing going on them as well as a back and neck massage. not the cheapest but at least they take their time.
273	1	d	This show definitely killed it! After watching Lereve and O show way too many times, I thought of coming to Treasure Island to watch Mystere! It was not a mistake at all and I am so glad that I came to watch this show. The show started with the clown messing around with audience for start and it was fun to have the interactions with their actors. Throughout the whole show, I was amazed at what the performers could do and I am definitely going to tell everyone about it- totally go watch Mystere!!! I had a great time and great laugh at the show. If you are ever looking at some sort of show similar to the O show, give this a shot! Even though they do have a smaller theater, it is still an awesome opportunity to watch Mystere. \n\nOn holidays\/weekends, arrive 30-45 minutes prior to the show because the line can get pretty looooong.
274	1	d	We went to lunch at Ming's on 7\/24\/12.....4 total in our group.  We have been here as a group on a few occasions.  Today's service was at best BAD.  One in our group wanted a salad and to put Shrimp on top...told \"No, you order from box menu\".  That happened and our food was brought out.  The server kept his attitude (this is the same server we have had on several different occasions.).  He slammed food on the table, he did refill drinks though!  At the end, all the meals were placed on one bill...simple (Thanks boss!).  His service was at best BAD.  He was only tipped 10% for his service.  This guy had the guts to come back to the table, tell her that she only tipped 10% and to put more on the tip!  Wow.....words were exchanged and he walked off.  Never in my life have I seen that done.......STAY AWAY from this joint!
275	0	d	I picked this restaurant because of great reviews. I was very dissapointed. Received spoiled appetizer (crab with grapefruit), waitress with no hesitation offered a different one. Brought tampanadas that also had a wierd taste ,like old oil or something. Main dish was pretty good (shrimp with scallops). Desert was the best dolce Leche cake with fresh fruit. Service good but food not so much.
276	0	d	I was excited to see a Tapas bar that opened in Glendale!  They serve paella!  But I had a bad feeling about the restaurant when I saw a harsh review on Urbanspoon.  I went on a Saturday night, and man was the reviewer spot-on.  The food is pretty good, but the service is atrocious.  I'm hoping that with a little more time, they'll work out the service kinks and become a better restaurant.  I really want Sabor to succeed.
277	0	d	I called the Queen Creek location to see if I could get \"tons\" of rock delivered to my home on very short notice & not only were they able to fit me in & help me complete my project but their staff was awesome! I worked with Kranston & Jessica & they were both efficient, polite & helpful. The price was a lot lower than I expected as well which is always a plus :) I would definitely recommend to family & friends.
278	0	d	I work right in town and I order lunch here maybe 2-3 times a week. I am in love with this place! Their sushi is so fresh and so delicious. I can honestly say this is the best sushi I have ever had. I have been do many sushi places and this one beats them all! Their Bahama Mama is my favorite, nice tasty lobster on top of their shrimp tempura roll. ahh so good! consumer service is also amazing! wish they were open on Sunday!
279	0	d	Went to dinner with a friend here and both of us absolutely loved the atmosphere.  Our waitress was so friendly and cute!  I love how cozy this place is making it the perfect setting for girl talks.  \n\nWe both shared a pizza, desert (cheesecake) and I tried the \"bitter\" soda.  I enjoy the food very much!  \n\nI also love the music selection! \n\nI will absolutely come back to this spot for dinner. =)
280	0	d	I was excited to try this place and they did not disappoint. Everything was fresh and perfect. I treated my husband for his birthday dinner and expected it to be pricy but I didn't mind because it was worth it. From the service to the ambience and of course the food. Try the ceviche\/sashimi sampler!
281	1	d	Went here for Hair Wars on Sunday night.  The DJs were awesome and played such a wide range of music!  Staff was super-friendly.\nDidn't see Cary Hart, which was a bummer.  I mean, he's single now, and I love the color pink, soooo.....
282	1	d	I was truly DESPERATE. I had a custom-made bridesmaid dress that was purchased online; despite providing proper measurements, it was one size too small (attractively accentuating my gut) and instead of being a relaxed A-line skirt, it was a ridiculously short and tight pencil skirt that made it nearly impossible to walk\/sit\/exhale\/use the bathroom.\n\nNot having the time to re-make the dress, I found Cherie's Yelp reviews and gave her a call. She soothed my frayed nerves and promised to do what she can, despite the fact that she was swamped with other dress alternations, as the late summer\/early fall is peak wedding season. \n\nI initially asked for a side slit (as it would the quickest fix) but in the end she also let out the side seam to provide additional breathing\/belly room - extra work which she didn't even charge for (it came out to less than $20 with tax.)\n\nShe literally saved me a TON of unneeded stress and grief, as the dress fits perfectly now.\n\nI've read other reviews where she's apparently got \"an attitude\". For the record, her attitude is pretty freaking AWESOME: she's a no-nonsense lady who tells it like it is. If you're asking her to do something unrealistic, she will say so - as it should be.\n\n(And yes, she did rightfully chastise me for buying a bridesmaid dress online. Lesson learned!)\n\nNot only is she a talented seamstress who knows what she's doing, but she's a lady who will espouse motherly advice and opinions with hilariously blunt honesty. I seriously want to adopt this woman.
283	0	d	Having eaten at many Friday's around the country, this one has the best decor I have seen.  Most Friday's seem to go overboard with the memorabilia.  The mural on the wall is great link to the community.  I need that artist to come paint something similar in my son's room.\nAs for the service, they were very busy for a Friday night.  But with so many tables, my wife, 2-year-old son and I were seated within 10 minutes of check-in.  The hostesses were very friendly and even talked to my son.  Our waitress was very friendly and checked up on us regularly.  However, other waitresses did seem frazzled and lost.  We had one stop by our table to ask to see the kids' menu.\nOur appetizer (chips and salsa) came out quickly with very fresh chips.  Shortly after the chips were gone, our food arrived and was very good.  My only complaint is my steak (ordered medium-rare) was slightly overdone but not to the point requiring it to be sent back.\nOverall, it was a great experience and we'll return soon.  Now they need to bring back the fried mac 'n cheese  and cherry limeade slushes.
284	0	d	Came for a salad and the service was fast I took my salad back to work and the lettuce was wet and wilted. The feta was soggy and d the only things edible was the gyro meat olives and pepperchinis I was disappointed needless to say. Won't be returning but worth a shot.
285	1	d	God awful exepriance here today. Long time customer who was screamed at by a waitress to never come back because I chose not to leave a tip. Came here many times  usually decent enough  service unitll today. I feel like every other industry the food service industry is performance based. To treat a customer like that is wrong we were even followed out the door and told to never come back. Needless to say Thai house ahas lost a customer . I would encourage folks to co sided the moltirude of other fantastic Thai options on Scottsdale and not offer their patronage to the likes of the folks working here .
286	0	d	I went to Structura after I bought a groupon for a 60 minute injury massage. I have had a problem in my shoulder area for over a year now. I have seen chiropractors, I've been to the doctor for X-rays and nothing has gotten better until now! I told Dustin about the problem area and he listened and strictly focused on just what I needed. The session was painfully good, I feel 100 times better. The pain that I was constantly feeling has subsided greatly. I got one of the best nights sleep in such a long time after the treatment. I will be back for follow up treatments. Very highly recommended!
287	1	d	Well I have to say, we ended up here late at night, very hungry and not expecting much.  I'd already hit a more popular pizza spot nearby ( way earlier in the day) and honestly I wouldn't even compare the two.   They have the big slices here; but we decided to order a whole pizza and everyone just split it.  It was piping hot and delicious, great chewy crust, not overly cheesy or greasy... and the sauce was very nicely spiced.   Probably was my favorite thing I'd eaten on this whole trip, and the fact it was in the hotel lobby where we stayed was really convenient.  Next time instead of the hassle of finding parking on the strip for pizza not nearly as good, we'll be coming here for sure.  \nOnly problem is, it's a tiny little spot with not much seating so you either have to hope to be quick to get a table or take it up to your room.  Luckily we got a table right before the place filled up to capacity and then some.
288	1	d	I stop at Love's when headed to Caliente or Pioche because it has everything you could need for a road trip. I stopped in to get drinks and snacks for our latest trip and debated getting something from the Godfather's Pizza they have inside. Between Godfather's and Subway the smells were killing me. It just smelled so good and other people thought so too because the line was no joke 20 plus people deep. you can order a whole pizza, but they don't sell it by the slice. They have the mini individual pizzas starting at $3.99 and you can make it a combo blah blah blah. I decided to peep out the jerky section. I remembered they had a lot to chose from the last time I was here and man was I right. I picked out a couple things and then went in search of something \"Hostess\" for my wife. Too bad they only had Little Debbie! It's all good my wife is a fan of her too so the iced honey bun I got her went over well. They have oil for your car, jerky, candy, drinks, pizza and even a gift shop area. Some things are way overpriced but that is to be expected. It's your typical gas station\/convenient store with a few extra bonuses.
289	0	d	I had called these people to try and get some warranty work done, I can't even get a call back!  Hands down the absolute worst service out there!  Not much else to be said really.
290	0	d	Moderately long wait, but what an adorable place! Got and split corned beef hash and the salmon hash and a bloody.. whew! Delish! Very different and yet amazing. Great service too.\n\nNeed to come back and get the boozy milkshakes and the cake!\n\nPro tip: free iced tea refills!
291	0	d	Should have paid attention to other reviews and not brought my business here. Twice they have put me in a jam for business travel because they did not have clothes ready for Saturday pick up. \n\nThe first time I left feeling it was my fault because I dropped the clothes off on Friday @7:00am. I asked for Saturday pickup. When I went to pick it up I was told the one day turn around cost more and since I did not pay extra I should not have expected it on Saturday. \"Friday drop offs are ready Monday\". I thought since I asked for it on Saturday, I could expect it on Saturday. \n\nMiss #2 Dropped off a bagful of clothes on THURSDAY at 7:00am for Saturday pick up. Show up on Saturday and only half is ready because \"it's not suppose to be back until Monday\". When I say I am screwed because the clothes are needed of travel on Sunday I was scolded for bad language. \n\n\"If it's set for Monday why is half of it here?\"\n\n\"I don't know, it's suppose to be here on Monday\"\n\nNo apologies for this screw up, only blaming the other worker.\n\nAlso was informed that I \"should thank them for being honest\" How were they honest? They gave me my shirt that they previously lost and it was unaccounted for. \n\nParting words from the cleaners \"don't take your bad day out on me\" I was having a fine day until YOU missed delivering on having my clothes ready on Saturday.
292	1	d	I had the Rebel Special which was a concoction with banana, strawberries, and Nutella. I had this with a Strawberry ice cream, and it was fairly darned tasty. The crepe was nice and fluffy, the fruit tasted fresh, and the ice cream was pretty good as well. The staff was friendly and helpful in explaining and suggesting which treats to get. Will try to make it a point to return at some point.
293	1	d	My girlfriend and I placed a bet on the afc winner while on vacation. We came back with her winning ticket and cosmopolitan told us that the sports betting winning ticket needed to be mailed in. Now they are refusing to pay a totally legit winning ticket. What a classless company. They will take your money any way they can but if u have a winning ticket and did not read the fine print on the back they will not pay. Point is if your on vacation don't place a bet on a future payout like Super Bowl or u may get stiffed.
294	1	d	I came with my job to volunteer and I enjoyed every min of it. Never knew about this organization and I'm glad I do now. \n\nCan't wait to come back.
295	1	d	Needs A Wash.\n\n   I love grease, I am also a fan of spoons but Greasy Spoon, not so much. I don't drop this term a lot...but...despite all my efforts to think of a better word to describe the place...all that came to mind was....shiddy.\n\n  I had the pulled pork sandwich and as a man who has spent significant time south of the Mason-Dixon line, I'd like to think I know good pulled pork sandwich and this was not. Too sweet, under seasoned and fall apart...but not in the good way.\n\n  My girlfriend had the duck confit club sandwich, which missed the mark and was a bit of a gong show, even compared to the pulled pork sandwich. I'm sure she would have settled for a standard club sandwich that maintained it's structural integrity. You know what I'm sayin'???\n\n (fart noise)\n\nWaka Waka
296	1	d	I came to beaver valley stone looking for some landscaping material and ideas .\n\nThese two clerks helped me a lot,\nThey offered contractors that can do the work, and also showed different products to get the job done.\n\nAs long as you tell them the exact material and measurement that you like \nThey can give you a rough estimate of material cost \n\nMy experience at beaver valley stone was great, and I would recommend them to all my family and friends.
297	0	d	Oysters for $1 at happy hours(3-6) nobody can complain, best deal in Las Vegas.\nFresh Sea food millions miles from the ocean.\nAnd lots of other good food, excellent service, very nice stuf.\nWill come back for sure.
298	1	d	Do not buy their meat! Literally over and over and over I bought meat that was bad when I brought it home. One night I was shopping and picked up this huge pork butt to cut up into pieces to freeze four different dinners. We are walking around the store doing our shopping and I kept like smelling my fiance and then smelling me. I couldn't get over it the whole time we are shopping what is that smell and he started smelling around he couldn't figure it out. Finally when we get to the checkout I realize it was the pork! Chicken pork and beef stew all a bad idea. The chicken is usually pretty clear that it's bad but sometimes you just don't know until you open it up when you get home and smell it. I bought some steaks from the other Smith's a bit up the street the 24 hour store, and got food poisoning. By that point I had already known the meat was bad at both locations but ended up buying steak anyway. Dumbest move I'll never forget! It's a clean beautiful store with great service as long as you stay away from the meat!
299	0	d	Our Doctors office moved here (Dr\/owner retired) so we had no choice but to try 4C. We were with our former Drs office 22 years, but we will be with 4C only 2 visits. The service levels are simply ho-hum to disappointing. Bye bye.
300	0	d	We have gone to Puppy Luv for many years. They love and care for both of our dogs. Brandon does an excellent job grooming. The new owners are friendly and courteous. We moved from Cornelius 3 years ago to Winston but I still drive to Cornelius to Puppy Luv.
301	0	d	Love this place! Cool vibe, great food, friendly service, good prices. Well worth checking out.
302	1	d	Decided to make the most out of not bringing lunch by stopping by Cane's. I've heard a lot of good things about it, and one location just opened up in the LA area. I was happy to see the many locations around Vegas and even though it's not the healthiest meal option ... you have to try everything once, right? \n\nThis location of Raising Cane's is on Flamingo and Maryland. It's located by UNLV and lots of shops, so it can get quite packed during lunch hour. While the parking lot had a ton of spaces (thank you Vegas!), the indoor dining room was full. \n\nMenu was really simple - there are a few combo choices or you can order items a la carte. Most of the combos include chicken fingers, crinkle-cut fries, Cane's sauce, and a drink. One might offer Texas toast, the other a Kaiser roll, or coleslaw. You're able to order more or less of an item separately. Items aren't too pricey and you get filled up with all the food. Since it is fast food, everything was boxed up and ready to go within minutes. \n\nThree freshly fried chicken tenders ... they were delicious, but I definitely hated myself after consuming the food! Super crispy on the outside but tender meat on the inside. Not too much flavor to the chicken though, so I had to dunk the pieces in the Cane's sauce. Unfortunately I didn't have enough sauce for the chicken and tenders, which was disheartening. The French fries were unique - most places don't offer crinkle cut anymore! Soft on the inside but crispy on the outside - they threw in a good amount, too. Texas toast was nothing special - guess I could have eaten chicken and the sauce with the bread, but I didn't think of that until after I finished. And of course, finished the meal with some sweet tea. \n\ntl;dr - A good place to eat if you're craving something unhealthy. Workers are friendly and nice, and food comes out fairly quickly. This location is super busy, but there are a ton around Vegas.

It's located on a quiet street, right across from a park - probably the only quiet little patch in the downtown core. \nThe patio is lovely on a sunny morning, and the inside is cozy and feels like Sunday morning (no matter what day it is).\n\nI had the Norwegian Eggs Benedict - which was really nice and light. But filling. I had brunch with a few friends there, and they all seemed to enjoy their plates of food. (Except for the crepes with basil and tomatoes, which was a little meh).\nAfter we were done eating, we noticed the table next to us ordered the caramel waffles - and Oh My! That smelled like heaven. I am going back to order that next time.
304	0	d	Soooo good! So many options for the build your own burrito, and I have yet to have anything that was not amazing. This is my new favorite spot! And the jalapeño sour cream chips, you have t have those.
305	0	d	Best corn beefed hash I've ever had! They also give you incredibly generous portions like potato, watermelon etc! Kind of on the pricier side for breakfast, but their twisted farm food is colossus like the poker tourney !
306	1	d	October 28, 2018 Sunday - 7:45 AM for breakfast \n2 Adults\n\nAtmosphere - 4 stars\nFood - 5 stars\nService - 5 stars\n\nBackground - Heading home, back to Reno, and wanted something away from the strip and on the way home.  Yelp helped us find this place.\n\nAtmosphere - Part of a strip mall.  It feels like this place has been here for decades.  Not the place is worn down but just the style of woods, tables, and the art.\n\nFood\n  Drink - Coffee and I actually was given and insulated coffee pot.  Woot Woot!  I would have finished that thing off but I have a long car ride in front of me.\n\n  Breakfast - The Mexican omelette, it had me with chorizo.  The jalapenos were a nice touch too.  I think most of the heat came from the Habla Diablo salsa, which they advertise on the back of the menu.  Side of cubed home fries went well with the omelette.  That four egg omelette was filling.  \n\nService - Our waitress was great.  Like a diner you pay the cashier near the door.\n\nFuture - Sure.  Now I am curious about Egg Works, their other restaurants listed on the menu.
307	0	d	My favourite Chinese resto chain has finally arrived in Mississauga! Great service, super tasty food and awesome decor. \nBest dishes to order: spicy salty squid, sweet and sour pork\/chicken and hot pot rice. \nBeware of long lineups, especially on weekends starting on Friday night! Expect to wait about 30-45 min for a table around dinner time, but the service is quick and food arrives within 10-15 min of ordering.
308	0	d	This place is eh.  Not sure what all the hype is about. Nachos barely had avocado and the pork was definitely poor quality.  Friends had the prime rib and although it looked good, they felt it was nothing special.  I had the bbq chicken.  The chicken was fair but I must say that the corn muffin was great!
309	0	d	This place really hits all the bases.  Perfect for dinner with clients or drinks with friends.  Food is great.  The kale salad and the short rib are some of my favorites.  The ambiance is perfect during the day and switches to an upscale night club which I equally enjoy.  If you are in old town and want something I step up from the rest I would certainly recommend Dakota!!
310	1	d	A cool, hip cafe that I stopped at briefly on my way to a Sunday Funday meetup in a nearby park during my weekend visit to Madison. It has a fun vibe and vibrant color scheme, reminiscent of places like Starliner Diner in Columbus, Papermoon Diner in Baltimore and the like. I only got a mocha having already eaten breakfast, but if I were a local, I could see this being the type of place I visited regularly. Very, very large patio, by the way.
311	1	d	I came here a few days ago before the Opening Day game for the Diamondbacks.  My boyfriend was very excited to try this place since we heard great things.  However, we didn't have a very good experience.  As I walked into the establishment, I noticed how dirty the whole place seemed to be.  There were dirty tables everywhere and the floor was no different.  No one was coming around to clean either.  \n\nWe ordered the Diamondbacks Opening Day deal with 2 tacos and a beer.  We ordered one pork and one steak, they were both bland and tiny and the chips and salsa were just okay. Everything was overpriced for what you got.   We ate outside on the small patio and it was like a garbage bomb went off out there.  Someone finally  came out to clean the tables, but didn't bother to pick up any of the napkins, salsa, or other trash on the floor, that patio remained dirty, even after it was \"cleaned.\"   It was a complete mess.  \n\nI don't see the big fuss over this place, I will not be coming back.
312	0	d	Terrible customer service from the bartender. I would never go back to this 1 after being judged & discriminated against. The cameras clearly showed I wasn't with them let alone come there with them. I'm not discriminating anything except letting everyone know to not go to your bar because of terrible service. I go everywhere in the area & have never had a problem except in this bar. I would never step foot in this place again! I've also got many other people that will never go there because of the way I was treated over a simple glass of house red wine & Prime Rib.
313	0	d	I really enjoyed the pizzas I ordered here.\n\nThey are done Turkish style with the pizza in a teardrop shape.\n\nThe pizzas I had were great with toppings I don't see often (lamb anyone?) and the fact that the pizza box was stuffed with lemon slices and tomato slices and onion slices and hot peppers, geesh, makes me want to go order one right now!
314	1	d	yes yes yes! came here last night for the Grand Opening and was so im pressed. The owners Pam & her sister Christina have done a fabulous job here. 12 craft beers on tap and an array of craft cocktails they know their stuff. My favorite drink is The Green Bitch, consisting of green charteuse, strega, lemon, celery, egg white, simple syrup, and curry bitters... amazing. after two of them i had a pretty strong buzz. the bar has almost a Victorian feel to it. i really like it. the only gripe I had with this bar is the location, its not really in walking distance to the other bars downtown that I frequent but totally worth the drive! i highly reccomend this place to check out :)
315	1	d	Ive been attending Vegas Hot for about six months now I LOVE everything about this place from the Variety of classes, instructors, and pricing. Alexis is my absolute favorite instructor but all of the instructors seem like they truly care, they allow you to make requests at the beginning of the fitness classes to give whatever body part you want that day some extra loving during that class. Vegas Hot is truly AWESOME!
316	0	d	I love this health club!  I wish I lived closer as it's the nicest Village in AZ. There are so many great machines that can work just about anything and so much room so you aren't waiting to use a particular machine or elliptical.  It feels like \"home\" being there and everyone is so friendly.  Just like being around people you care about every single day.
317	0	d	Great spot if you have gluten-free needs!!!! The food is delicious and there are so many choices, which is not typical of most bakeries. Gluten-free food is often times very dry, however the pastries from here are not. They are soft and moist. I love this place!!!!
318	1	d	I booked a ticket through US Airways from SFO-TPE (Taipei, Taiwan) about three months ago. At the time, we were not given the opportunity to select seats when we booked the tickets online. Since then, we've been given the run-around on how to acquire seats. Most people are probably thinking, what is the big friggin' deal? Well, being newlyweds, traveling to Asia for our honeymoon, being able to next to each other on a 13-hour flight IS a big friggin' deal!\n\nHere's the gist of the rhetoric that is given to us after about 20 phone calls spanning the last few months:\n\nUS Airways: We don't have access to their seat maps. This is a flight operated by EVA Air, please contact them.\n\nEVA Air: You booked the flight through US Airways, so you need to get your seats from them.\n\nUS Airways: There is no way we can assign you seats. Since this flight is operated by EVA Air, call them for seat assignments.\n\nEVA Air: You booked the flight through US Airways. Have them make a request for seat assignments, THEN we will assign you seats.\n\nUS Airways: I don't know how to submit such a request, but have asked my supervisor to do so.\n\n(a month passes)\n\nUS Airways: We still don't see confirmation of seating assignments. Call EVA Air to have them assign you seats. They're the operating airline for this flight.\n\nEVA Air: You booked the flight through US Airways, so they need to make a request for seat assignments. We are not able to pull up your records from the Confirmation Code or the Flight #s because those are ones associated with US Airways. Call them for seat assignments.\n\nUS Airways: We cannot assign you seats because it's operated through EVA Air. We can put in a generic request. \n_________________________________________\n\nMind you this conversation has gone on for the last three months, neither airline able to give us our seat assignments. This basically means we have to show up at the airport and take whatever seats are left. Most likely they won't be together nor will we have the aisle seats we requested. \n\nOn both ends, they keep pushing the responsibility onto the other airline. It's always, \"We can't do this.\" \"We don't do this.\" \"We don't have access to this.\" \n\nSeriously, why partner with another airline when you can't do something as simple as assign seats to your customers? We are well into the 21st Century, and it's the year 2013. If you can't put a seat map on the web for customers to select seats when they're purchasing the ticket, you need to revisit Corporate Efficiency 101. How is it that requests are put in time after time with no response from EVA Air, and NO ONE does anything about that? There is a communication breakdown somewhere, but no one cares enough to do anything about it (citing \"it's not company protocol to contact the other airline about this matter), nor do they want to want to improve upon this issue. \n\nThink twice before booking a flight from US Airways operated by a foreign airline. Actually, don't even think about it. Just don't do it!
319	1	d	The boyfriend and I stopped in at Islands for a quick drink and dessert at the bar. I'm not sure why but it certainly became a great evening thanks to our friendly bartender, Kelsey. \n\nI can't imagine not wanting to stop in for a cool blended treat in this hot weather. The vibe and people make it that much more amazing. \n\nIf you're in the area make it a point to stop in and hopefully you'll get Kelsey for your bartender!
320	0	d	Prices still high even going out of business. As I was going in everyone was not holding any bags as they were walking out. Had a 20% coupon that they emailed me off sale and clearance prices would not honor, expires April 23rd. Hellooooo that's why your going out of business your prices to high you need a coupon just to shop there.. See ya Sport Chalet...
321	0	d	Monty's is a retro diner. We originally went there because it was one of the few places open on new years day, but I was pleasantly surprised. They have a lot of classic American breakfast dishes. I had the tempeh hash with scrambled eggs which was quite good. It was flavorful and tasty.
322	0	d	Great Service and communication! I have been bringing my Infiniti here for about 9 years and whether its a simple oil change or major repair, they always take care of me. My service advisor, Aaron, always ensures that my car receives the best care and is sure to keep me updated on status. Thank you!
323	1	d	It's a small bar just located just outside the store but the drinks are incredibly good and the service is great however they do close early.
324	0	d	Nothing was bad for our visit, but nothing was great either. The bar has nowhere to stand if the seats are full, there were 4 beers on tap despite brew being in the name and the food was good, but not great. I would say for the price point that it was uninspired.
325	0	d	Let me start off by saying this was the first time for all 6 of us to have bubbles n brunch here. The place is beautiful and had a great atmosphere. I would have given 5 stars if the service was better. Food was good. But every time we needed something we had to look for her and call her over. Plus 2 of us ordered crepes, we had no idea we were able to get anything off the bar behind us that comes with your when ordering crepes. Fruit potatoes etc. all n all we had a good time but the service sucked!
326	0	d	The customer service at this location is the worst I have ever experienced. I have to say that the older lady that is short and has short black hair is the rudest person I have ever had to deal with. I will not be returning to this store. Furthermore, be aware that they are happy to take your money and even happier to upgrade you to a more expensive bag but they will NOT honor a return. And quite frankly I believe the quality of LV is going down. I have LV bags that I have been carrying for 30 years now and they still look great!  However, this new $3400 Bag has white glue on the seam in the inside pocket and they are willing to do nothing about it. Either it's the manager at this location that's making customer service and the employees to act this bad or LV is just going down hill. With service like this- nothing will change until their sales drop. It's unfortunate that an icon like LV has to go to such a low.
327	0	d	I am SO TORN\n\nI actually like Freshii. I like the Salad's, I like the fact that the Chicken is raised without anti-biotics and such (I contacted head office and asked) and I like their burritos when I am cheating with wheat. I also like the bio-degradable bags, the enviro-conscious bit.. everything, but I have recently become.. aggravated with Freshii. \n\nHere is the deal. Freshii has a loyalty card program. You collect stamps (8 or so) and you get a free salad. Everyone is used to the loyalty card system these days, right? December, I am particularly busy and not finding the time to prepare my lunch as often. Freshii is right beside my office, and they offer healthy and quick lunches, although not cheaply. A customized salad is basically $12. I get it. But I am also somewhat relieved that after 8 of these puppies I get one for free. \n\nI pick up a non-descript loyalty card, and begin stamping away during December. I happily make my way through right before the holidays and decide to save my salad for the first day back in the office. I visit January 3rd and am told that I had to redeem my free salad in DECEMBER and that my card is not valid. Absolutely NO WHERE on the card, menu, box the cards sit in, ANYWHERE is any messaging regarding the \"same month\" rule. Not even a \"December\" on the card itself. I very begrudgingly purchased my salad and left. Honestly I have yet to return. I then contacted head office again and go not response. TIGHT.\n\nIts the little things. I was eating here twice a week before, now .. Im ticked.
328	1	d	This morning I had some time to kill after running an errand downtown.  I'd heard of this place but didn't know they had moved Downtown right where the old Steel City Diner used to be.\n\nMethinks I was on a \"mission from God\" except I wasn't in a suit, shades, and hat. I might as well have been. I just didn't know it until then. THIS is what I was meant to do yesterday. The visit to the DMV was just a sideline. \n\nWith no idea where to eat, all of a sudden, I saw the black and gold logo!\n\nI swear, I heard a horn section blasting in my brain! \n\nThe Soulsonic Superpower beckoned me! \n\nI walked in and felt pure love, a love...unlimited. I saw a long counter, booths everywhere, and a big fella who could have been a linebacker in another life said to me, \"Sit down anywhere, dude!\"\n\nPhotos of athletes, jazz musicians, and other important folk adorned the walls. A sax and a trombone were right above me near the ceiling. \n\nNow I won't lie. I was a little disappointed at first. Allow me to 'splain.\n\nThis was shortly after 10am. My stomach's desire was that storied pulled pork sandwich and their potato salad of course. If you read my reviews, you KNOW I have to try any potato salad I come across because it is an addiction I cannot be delivered from. Even the gospel music playing in the background couldn't change that. \n\nSo, I looked at their breakfast menu since it was just a little early for lunch.\n\nHell, I could get an omelet anywhere y'know? \n\nThen I saw something called a \"Steak and Egg Sandwich.\" Hey, why not?\n\nI watched a guy who looked like a recent culinary grad make it.\n\n\"You like onions and peppers, right?\"\n\n\"You know it!\"\n\n\"MY man!\" he responded exultantly. \n\nIt was placed right in front of me, piping hot in a HUGE hamburger bun. It was a Philly Cheesesteak with FUNK, but for breakfast. \n\nI even met the mythical yet down-to-earth Big Mama herself. Again I felt LOVE. \n\nNothing can get your mornin' movin' like a soul food breakfast.\n\nI'm gonna be back for that pulled pork and potato salad though.  I HAVE to come back now!\n\nOr else Big Mama'll be mad!
329	1	d	Fun place to relive your childhood days! I remember going there as a middle schooler and hanging out with all my friends. Video games galore. They had a special on Tuesday, 3 hours of unlimited play for $15. You can't earn tickets for prizes but who cares. UNLIMITED play!!!\n\nMini golf was fun too. They have 4 different courses, they need a little updating but overall they are pretty decent. Bumper cars, roller coasters and even a hanging rope type obstacle course. \n\nFun! Fun! Might be too hot during the summer days so maybe a night activity during those hot summer months.
330	0	d	I enjoyed the service and food very much! Personally, I drink A LOT of ice water and I never found myself having to wave the waitress down to give me some water haha. Also through out the dinner she came by very often to check up on us and even chatted us up. Plus a point for when I asked for a picture she suggested to go to the lounge to take the picture minus a point for not really know how to take pictures LOL \n\nWe order the Appetizer of the day which was kobe beef, it was 3 slices of thinly sliced kobe beef and the stone was seasoned with salt. I must say the kobe beef was the high point of our dinner. We also order the mussels in blue cheese my gosh  it was quite a big serving compared most places. IT WAS SO DELICIOUS. I'm not a big fan of blue cheese but I just kept eating. They give you a lot of other choices for sauces too and the waitress seemed to recommend their beer or blue cheese most. \n\nWe were kind of stuffed with the mussels at this point but for the main course we order the seafood platter and the surf and turf. For my ex seafood platter that comes with TIGER SHRIMPS, SEA SCALLOPS, CUTTLEFISH. The lemon got burnt before my boyfriend even began \"cooking\" and it just had this weird smell. Everything was so bland. It was really disappointing . For my surf and turf the lobster tail was way over cooked, I was pretty peeved about that and the sirloin was just sirloin hahaha nothing much to say about it typical piece of meat lightly seasoned with salt. \n\nWe  concluded the appetizer was DEFINITELY the hit for our night! We will be coming back again I am looking forward to trying the fish combination and many more appetizers. But it's not a good sign when I just want to order appetizers and not the main meal.
331	1	d	I wouldn't call myself a yogi, but i am an appreciator of a good yoga class that is a decent workout but also one where a good calorie burn is not its sole purpose. I had tried out many yoga classes around the valley for a while. From wannabe-yoga at gyms where you end up just doing crunches and everything is rushed with no focus on alignment, to free drop ins at reeeeeeeeally expensive yoga centers where everyone there probably naps in a backbend, feeds themselves with there toes, or just drapes their leg over and around their head as a nice morning stretch. \n\nThe last and best spot I found was SWIHA. I'm a big fan because: \na) Price. For a damn good class, you definitely get your money's worth especially compared to valley yoga centers. I think its $5 for your first class and $12 for each drop in. Of course, multi-class passes drop the price as you buy more classes.\nb) its awesome. The classes I've been to range from Hatha, Flow, Vinyasa, Anusara, Level 1-2, Yin, etc. All of the instructors are very welcoming, knowledgeable, and willing to assist students in wherever they may want to travel within the class. The instructors realize that many students may be participating for a good workout, but they also remind participants to keep a focus and benefit from the many delicious things yoga has to offer. \n\nso, for beginners, novices, amateurs, hard-core yogis, or just clumsy but ambitious kids like me, I highly recommend SWIHA for your every yoga need:)\n\nnamaste:)
332	1	d	Parking sucked, but I parked across the street.  I know we here in AZ are spoiled.  We park right by the place we go.  lol!  Finally got to try Windsor, about time!  The staff was super friendly.  I got the:\n1.  Cheddar Fondue:  Warm MJ pretzel, apple slices & sausage - Eat this when the cheddar is melty.  It is a very tasty appetizer.  \n2.  Buttermilk Fried Chicken:  The king of fried chicken & your favorite side - This is the on the block special for Monday and Tuesday's only.  Chicken was very good, crispy, moist on the inside, and good coat on the chicken.  The mac and cheese side was pretty good.  \n\nToo full, could not handle dessert.
333	0	d	my wife and I ate there on the evening on Nov 11th 2017. I enjoyed the halibut entree. my wife did not enjoy the braised short ribs. I think I have the description correct. they were a bit chewed and not as tender. the french fries have no signature at all.. no flavour, not fresh cut and unimpressive.
334	0	d	Bradley Ogden is a fantastic restaurant.  It boosts that is has the best burger in Las Vegas, and I would have to agree with that.  The prices  are decent for the type of place it is.  The menu is simple, and the food is great.  Worth trying if you're looking for a place to grab dinner in Caesars Palace.
335	0	d	The food is good if you can get past seeing the small roaches running across the floor. I just find it hard to down my meal with small sewer roaches running across the floor.\nThe first time I went there it was take out, so I did not notice the roaches. The second time I ate there after purchasing the yelp coupon. It was then that I noticed the place has small roach problem. Yuck........
336	1	d	I had a sweet tooth today and as I was checking out restaurants I came crossed Amy's so I went to her website. Their desserts look so good I thought I drive down and pick one up.   The desserts they have look amazing so I bought two pieces of cake which were delicious.   Somewhat expensive but well worth it.    I was with my son and we didn't have time to sit down and eat but he wanted to go back and actually try one of their meals.  The place was absolutely spotless.   A very feminine looking restaurant. The owners were there and were very nice.   One of the reasons I want to go back is because they had an interesting menu and the place was so clean. I'm dying to try a pear salad.   Maybe tomorrow
337	1	d	It's a really great place. 10\/10 would recommend the casitas; however our room did have two types of cockroaches so that was interesting lol my boyfriend & I practically hunted the big one. ewwwww but we got him. The other one was in the shower & it was a tiny baby. I squished it
338	1	d	Run, don't walk, away from this agent.  As an out-of-state buyer, she misled us totally on our recent almost-purchase of a multi-unit apartment building in Phoenix.  She mis-represented the list price on the property -- quoting a non-negotiable price that was more than 30% ($200,000) over the listed asking price.  We trusted her and wrote a full price offer at this inflated fictitous price.  The offer was, of course, accepted.  She then went on to mention that someone in her office was a partial owner.  She failed to mention that the property was for sale for months at a much lower price and stated, instead, that it had just hit the market that day.  She also mis-represented the apartment vacancy rate -- stating that  50% of the 48 apartments, rather than the approximate 25% we saw upon inspection, were rented.  Fortunately, we uncovered many of the concealed facts during the diligence period, but not after investing thousands of dollars and 2 trips from CA to AZ.
339	1	d	This review is a little bit late but here it is. I visited Vegas for the holidays and stayed at The Flamingo. Wanted to grab some late night eats before I went to the room for the night so I stopped by here. Not bad at all. The price was inflated but it is Vegas so that does not really count against them. The pizza slice was generously sized and perfectly greasy after a night of cocktails. Keep in mind the pizza sits under heat lamps for who knows how long so it is not going to be amazing. They throw it in the oven when you order it to heat it up. The service was just ok. Nothing special. They have like a mini food court and this place had the best food in my opinion. Looking for something quick and easy this is a good place.
340	1	d	I consider myself a sandwich connoisseur.  So much so, it's to the point that the missus shakes her head at how much I love the things.  But it's the sheer amount of variety that makes them appealing.\n\nSo after reading the reviews, I had to go and check this place out.\n\nI decided to be different and try the regular turkey sub, and it was really good.  Not the usual deli slabs of meat, but chunks, and it was moist and flavorful.  Perhaps a little too much lettuce, but I could adjust that, so who cares, really.  The missus got the meatball sub, and that was no slouch.\n\nAs I ate, I read through the reviews on here, and each one was a variant of the same message:\n\n\"Try the Bobbie!\"\n\"Try the Capistrami!\"\n\"Bobbie!\"\n\"Capristrami!\"\n\"Bobbie!\"\n\"Capristrami!\"\n\"Bobbie!\"\n\"Capristrami!\"\n\n\"Alright, dammit, I'll try one of the sandwiches\", I nearly cried out, but I figured that would only get me more unusual looks than I normally get, so I went up to the counter and ordered the Bobbie for dinner later tonight.\n\nHoly crap, I am a convert now.  It was like magical wood nymphs placed happiness upon my tongue.\n\nSo let me join my voice to the chorus extolling the virtues of the Bobbie, and now I feel compelled to see what the Capristrami is all about.\n\nThese are FINE sandwiches.  Well worth the trip off-Strip to sample one of these.  And prices are pretty fair, all things considered.\n\nI think I have a new haunt to get my sammich on.
341	0	d	Blanca, I know I told you over and over today how happy and was but I will say it again, YOU ROCK! Thank you so much for making me feel comfortable and relaxed the whole time. The atmosphere and homey feel really make it so nice. I love supporting local business over chains and the fact it is you and your brother is sweet. I wish I could do something like run a business with my brother. My hair feels great and I forgot about my anxiety for the first time ever with a stylist. I will be coming back as long as you are willing to have me.
342	1	d	The drinks are cold, the food is hot, and the service is good. \n\nThat is the best way to describe this place, we had a good time here. The drinks were very cold, especially when it is hot outside.  The food was tasty and severed in a very fast manner.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful with the menu and when we asked a question, she was very knowledgeable.   \n\nIf you are down on Fremont St, this is a good place to grab something to drink and eat.
343	1	d	I recently held a conference in Charlotte and needed the dreaded \"Boxed Lunch\" for 120 guests traveling on buses. \nI could have ordered a wrapped sandwich with a cup of condiments, individually wrapped salt, pepper, mustard & mayonnaise, a cup of salad, a cup of fruit, individually wrapped plastic-ware, a wrapped cookie and a bottle of water all neatly crammed in a White Box that our guests are expected to unwrap, smear, spread, layer, open, stir and toss while bouncing said box on their closed-legged laps!\n\nDean & Deluca saved the day with their Bento Boxes! These things are Ahmazing! Everything you need while balancing just one simple container; just remove the lid! Filled with moist, tender and delicious morsels (about 7-9ounces) of beef or chicken, 3 fresh salads, a slice of cheesecake w\/ brownie swirl and the cutest miniature salt & pepper casters nestled along with plastic-ware and a napkin and served with a unique soda.\n\nIMPRESSIVE and Affordable...I SAVED over $2,000.00 by choosing Dean & Deluca's Bento (I suggest renaming them \"D\"ento) boxes had I chose to use the Westin Hotel to cater those aforementioned White Boxes.\n\nThese are my secret weapons now.\n...I just wish there was a Dean & Deluca in Every City!
344	0	d	Edible but nothing to rave about.\nReally, were some of you guys drunk as fuck when you ate this or published reviews?  I was expecting a delicious white spinach pizza...but noooo just cheap cheap below average pizza. 3$ a slice of white spinach.
345	1	d	I've never seen so many fat, ugly people working in one place and all of them doing nothing.  Yet another store that claims to carry PC games but couldn't tell me when or if ever they would carry a major-market PC game expansion.  This is my 2nd trip there, the last time they tried to sell me a laptop with Vista despite a quick explanation that we were just trying to see if they had any XP inventory.  \n\nUg.
346	0	d	I have loved bobbies for 15 years plus! Today was the worst Bobbie ever! I opened my beautiful pink wrapping and what a disappointment! I can even explain ! What the heck happened? It looks like a peanut butter sandwich! Is it because I was getting a sandwich free? (Because of buying 9 sandwiches with app) Why isn't someone trained right? I didn't want to call the manager and complain because what's going to happen? Oh the next ones free?! No I don't want a free one! I wanted this one to be awesome! Ughhh well I will not be going to this Capriotti's ever again!! I hope someone from management sees this review! I hope y'all train you staff to make them the right way! Please
347	0	d	I've had Nook cater for work events (thru Platterz) and their sandwiches are always a hit with colleagues and clients esp the Chicken w\/ Avocado and the Greek salad. Presentation is very professional too:)
348	0	d	The shop is my spot, and I'm a commuter. I've been getting my hair cut by Brandon since before I permanently lived in Arizona! Followed him from shop to shop because he can cut my difficult hair and turn it into a calling card for himself. Everywhere I go I get, \"yo my man, where do you get cut like that?\" A few shops in the hood had Brandon for some time and the level of atmosphere was not quite on par with his knowledge, abilities, and customer service; until now. The Shop by Lefty has the atmosphere and professionalism I desire, and befitting my barber. Everyone in the shop is \"Major League\" in abilities and customer service. I rarely have to choose another barber, but if it comes to that I have no doubts my cut will be top notch. Even my son got his first haircut here. Best shop in AZ!
349	1	d	WARNING: delicious sugary cocktails will induce a zombie-like state of general braindeadness the morning after consumption.\n\nSo many great reviews of Fire on the East Side, yet none really pay homage to the glorious and extensive cocktail menu!  I met up with a girlfriend here last night, and we did our best to sample as much as possible.\n\nNot only does FOTES have a great selection of cocktails, but they offer them in a wide array of variations.  Yes, you could have a glass of their house sangria (red or white), but you could also have their peach, mango, or raspberry sangria (the mango is great, and the peach is phenomenal).  A good mojito is tough to find in Toronto, but at FOTES you can get an awesome coconut, raspberry, and I don't-even-remember-what-else mojito!  A lot of their drinks include tasty fruit puree, like the \"Blueberry Pie\" -- very fresh, and way too easy to drink down.  If you prefer martinis, they of course have a big list to choose from, along with standard mixed drinks and wines galore.\n\nThe patio is small, but very nice.  Service was great -- not too intrusive, and the waitress always seemed to come by just as we were ready to order round 2 (and 3 and 4...).\n\nThe only thing stopping this from being a 5-star review, was the very gross bathrooms that the venue shares with Fly (the club next door).  Please fix the toilets.  Ick.
350	1	d	3.0 Stars\n\nLocation Overview:\nThis location is in the middle of nowhere which is good so that it protects against any damages to on going pedestrians or cars, etc. It is an out-door paintball field. A place that is small with 3 fields (building their 4th) is actually not crowded. It is off the road of St Rose Pkwy by the M Resort. Be careful not to pass it, it is tucked away.\n\nCustomer Service:\nSo this is the main reason why I did not give Combat Zone 5.0 Stars. I have been here 5x and every time I have come in the younger staff has always been a little on the rude side. Their demeanor is just blehh and careless. There is an older gentlemen that owns the place who is absolutely about customer service and making sure things are good.\n\n*****However, after my last visit I feel that I may not be going back. As we were      leaving (in the parking lot) I heard a ringing noise and my boyfriend turned around and saw that my truck had been hit by 2 paintballs. I was not upset but I did walk back into the front store and told them what happened. Again like the careless kids that these employees are... the guy put his hands in the air and shrugged. he said \"Well, i can't do much to help you\". He couldn't come to look at my truck, give me paper towels, give me a big F U... nothing. So I left and that was the last time that I returned to Combat Zone. \n\nCustomer Service Cont.:\nReferees are okay. They take their time getting to the field but they make sure for the most part that no one is cheating. \n\nQuantity\/Quality:\nQuantity as far as fields is pretty good. It is a small place with three fields (4th being built). However, being that it is mostly hard rock and dirt its a little uncomfortable. Quality as far as equipment for some reason the paintball markers run out of air fairly quickly. I have had a couple of rentals jam up because of paintballs that have popped inside. It is good to get seasonal passes or Christmas tickets because they have awesome deals. For a full equipment, gear and paint expect to pay around $150. Quite pricey but if you have your own gear and equipment then you should only have to pay for in-house paint. \n\nSide Notes:\nExpect to pay around $150-$200 for equipment, gear, paint, and other necessities per PERSON.
351	1	d	Soooo torn on this one. We came to Tandoor after seeing a movie at the neighboring Cinemark. I am going to break down this one by category.\n\nAmbience: Overall, this restaurant has little to no ambience. We were sat next to a booth that had a sloppy patch job of gray tape on the seat. I could not stop staring at it. Our booth was nestled into a corner with overgrown, dead plants dangling into the backrest. Odd.\n\nService: Very slow. We only saw our server once and had to ask the poor high-school food runners multiple times for water (people eating spicy food always want more water). Make sure you plan your visit accordingly with extra time if you need to be somewhere.\n\nPrice: I never mind spending money while out (after all, we came out, didn't we?), but I found the prices to be steeper compared to other Indian options in the area. Also, a simple side of white rice that typically comes with many traditional dishes is extra. Just a pet peeve.\n\nFood: This was probably the best butter chicken i've ever had. The tomato and butter sauce was the creamiest, richest, most delicious thing ever. Order it with a side of naan and just wipe the dish clean... it is that good. We also had the shrimp curry... big pieces of shrimp, but just OK. Go for it spicy if you're thinking of ordering it, as the mild spice is very plain.\n\nOverall: I'll probably order take-out next time. I can't stop thinking about that butter chicken.
352	0	d	Only giving two stars because the nail tech was so sweet. That being said, she needs a lot more experience. Had my nails done last evening and thought they looked just \"okay\". Now looking at them today I could do them better myself. None of the tips actually have color on them. Chose the most popular package \"top pic\", which was supposed to include the paraffin wax and hand massage. Seeing she wasn't doing that before she started painting my nails, I assumed she had a different way of doing things. Nope. When asked if its included they said it wasn't, but I questioned it some more and they agreed. Their solution??? To go ahead and charge me for it anyway and make up for it next time :\/ Again, very very sweet girl, but did a terrible job. Not worth the overpriced fee they are charging in any way, shape or form. I actually feel bad writing this, but had I read the reviews before and knew what I was in for I and still chose to go in, then at least I would have known to inspect the job closer before I left and had them make it right before I left and gotten my money's worth.
353	1	d	I'm usually never on this side of town so thanks to my fellow Yelpers for convincing me to try this place out. There were many other great choices I had near the area but so glad I chose this one.\n\nSmall, cozy little restaurant with a pretty big menu and really great prices. I had the hardest time deciding but I went with the panang chicken and some fried flat noodles.\n\nThe noodles came out first and I had planned to eat only half of it while the panang was coming out. Well, I've never been good on that portion control thingy and I ended up scarfing the whole plate of noodles down. It came with Thai sweet chili sauce and I added sriracha on top of all that. Very delicious, better than my usual pad see ew. \n\nThe panang was simple, not filled with bamboo shoots and other veggies. Just a nice thick curry sauce and some red pepper flakes and of course the chicken. Although I don't mind bamboo and veggies I prefer my panang simply made like this. It was a little bit salty which may be bad for most but I loved it cuz I am a sodium freak.\n\nI would love to come back and try all the other dishes. The Thai beef noodle soup and grilled meat dishes looked really good. The service was very friendly and attentive.\n\nThe great thing is that this isn't their only location. Phewww, cuz out of all 3 this was the furthest from my house. But if  this were the only location, I would definetly come back here. Next time, I'll be going to either the Chinatown location or the one in Summerlin.
354	0	d	We stayed here for two nights in June of 2013, during the EDC weekend (we were not participants).\n\nGreat breakfast\nFree wifi\nFree parking\nNO resort fee!!!\nWithin walking distance of the monorail, not too sure about the deuce. We just parked at the flamingo and walked from there.\nPool is a little chilly. No hot tub.\n\nThe staff wasn't overly friendly, but I enjoyed our stay! We stayed in the suite with two queens and a pull out. No room separation, one room, three beds. \n\nOverall nice and I'd stay again!!
355	0	d	Sales associate told me I only needed mouse not mouse and keyboard. Problem was with Logitech equipment only six months old I kept losing connection. My tech blamed adapter. Geek squad said plug both adapters in for mouse and keyboard to synchronize. Waiting to see what happens. So far I haven't lost connection.  My wife bought an Apple Watch from Britney and she was so helpful in making the sale. She knew everything about it and made the sale a learning experience.
356	0	d	Best corned beef sandwich I've ever had, hands down. Nothing beats it! I've loved it here since I attended Notre Dame College and still love it nearly seven years later.
357	0	d	I was skeptical but they nailed it.  Varied menu with good drinks and attentive service.  Vegetarian options were good and the price was right.  Small space laid out for maximum effect. I'm curious what happens when Belair opens, but for now they have a niche on the square.
358	1	d	Woe! Woe, wait just a minute!  Hold onto your hats cowboys\/girls, this Portillo's is the real deal!  It's worthiness is much greater than some of the 3 star reviews I'm reading on the Yelp iPad-acus.  I've been here now 3 times (Yes, I missed a checkin for you fact seeking yelp nerds) and this is the Portillo's I've grown to love when traveling to Chicago many time over the years.  \n\nThis Portillo's reminds me of the one in Dekalb IL.  The decor, shape and  size are very similar.  The food taste just as good as well!  The only thing different are the droves of people trying to go here for a bite to eat all at the same time!!  But don't let that stop you from giving this Portillo's a try!  It's a fantastic place to go for a delicious hot Italian roast beef sandwich dry, dipped or wet!  Their hotdogs are great and so are their salads (believe it or not :-) \n\n If your feeling adventurous and hungry, I must warn you this can NOT be good for your health but it is really tasty good, try their Italian roast beef and grilled sausage with peppers!  OH MY!  It is an extremely dangerous and yet delicious mouth full of goodness!  You'll be tempted to order one of their DELISH shakes and a side of fries with this, but don't unless you are eating with someone that can call the paramedics in case you get a carb overload... \n\nThe only downer about Portillo's is how they want you to wait at the counter to get your food before sitting down.  This is not how the AZ peeps like to do things.  So they should adjust to their new environment and come up with a better way to get people their food. \n\nIn looking forward to going back again real soon.  I hope to see you their!
359	0	d	Great local place! Had fried fish which was really great and my wife got a burger which she loved. Grape ice cream for dessert was very intriguing and was definitely worth the try.
360	1	d	We had early evening reservations for a group of 4 on Tuesday of this week. We were seated at a table in the bar area where it's a bit noisy but convivial, especially the one chick grinding on her boyfriend's lap at the bar. Group orders cocktails, appetizers, salad, 4 entrees, a bottle of wine, dessert. Service and alcohol are wonderful; food mostly bland except for the veal chop parmesian, which was excellent. The service has been paced perfectly: no long waits between courses and no courses overlapping. Group has just finished dessert and has paid the bill -- a mere $600 -- and two of the group are slurping up the last of the wine. Older dude (I'd generally use the more respectful \"gentleman\" but it doesn't apply in this case) comes over and says, \"It's time for you to leave. You've been here long enough.\" Group looks up and thinks he's being funny. Nope. Crabby dude says, \"I'm serious. I'm the manager here and I need this table.\" Group looks around. There are two empty tables next to us. \n\nMost of us are fairly cosmopolitan and have eaten at swanky places all over the world, but never, repeat, never has anything so uncouth and rude happened to us in a supposedly classy but definitely expensive joint. We could certainly understand if the four of us had been loud and obnoxious or rude or cheap or spent an extra hour dawdling after we'd finished our meals. And even then we would have expected the manager to say something like, \"Hey, I'm sorry but we need this table for a large group. What if you head over to the bar and I'll buy you a drink?\" The woman who had treated us was not only livid, but embarrassed, and she dashed out of the restaurant. Two of us were slower and a different manager came up to apologize for the old man, saying that had happened a few times that week. What? We then made our way through the throngs of people waiting to be seated -- oh, sorry, there were only about 4 people standing in the lobby.\n\nSo, a fun evening with friends was soured for no reason whatsoever. Plus I had to use up time which could be spent on better things writing this because I could never forgive myself if I didn't. For the record, the dishes I classified as bland were the mussels (puny mussels in broth not even interesting enough to dip bread in -- if you're into mussels, try the green mussels from New Zealand served at The Barrymore up the street), the shrimp appetizers, the garbage salad and the Osso Bucco, which was tender but didn't taste much different than mom's pot roast.
361	0	d	Dr Crum delivered my first baby last week. I had an amazing experience with Dr Crum and entire staff of Paradise Valley OB\/GYN. I would not have asked for anything better than this. With few complications in my pregnancy ,Dr Crum always gave the best advice for me and my baby. Following her instructions, My D-Day was absolute easy. Overall staff in Paradise valley OB\/GYN has been amazing throughout. Starting from wonderful lady at reception to the ultrasound practitioner, Everyone is very professional and they know their job well. \nThanks everyone for the wonderful experience.
362	1	d	Did not start off well with the receptionist telling us the restaurant bar was closing in 20 minutes while the dining area was fine.\n\nKind of did not sit well with me\n\nHad the Blackened Salmon, Chicken Fried Steak and Pastrami Sandwich. All our food was prepared well and tasted very good.\n\nCan back again a few weeks later on a Thursday on $7 Burger Night, unfortunately the Cardiologist Burger is not included, but theTexan Burger is.\n\nThe Cardiologist Burger is one if the better burgers I have had in a long time, this burger includes the burger, pastrami and bacon on a pretzel bun. Pretty much all my favorites. \n\nThird time in 3 weeks, this time ordered the following entrees- Blackened Catfish with Wild Rice and Ceasar Lettuce Wrap Pastrami with Mac and Cheese. All again were excellent. \n\nTip is to get their Groupon and save some $ !\n\nWant to try there breakfast sometime.\n\nStarting to really like this place and you know I will be back.
363	1	d	I was fooled the first time.....I returned to this store due to my first experience....after three times being treated like shit by the notary, I will not be back... she must hate her life, herself or anyone that walks into this place....what a bitch...
364	1	d	This place leaves a lot to desired. My dad and I went during the week because he was craving Mexican food. So, I suggested we give Gil's a shot - trying to support local restaurants. \n\nIt was in a pretty dingy strip mall but we weren't deterred. There was a family eating on the patio so we decided to eat inside (and were the only ones in there, aside from one guy that stopped in to get a take-out order). \n\nWe started with chips and salsa. The chips were descent - thicker than normal but tasty. The salsa (if you can call it that) was horrible. Not much better than tomato paste and a few spices. \n\nThen, we got a cheese crisp with green chiles. This was the highlight of the meal. Not a memorable cheese crisp but the green chiles were fresh and not canned. \n\nFor entrees I got a shredded beef taco and my dad got a combo plate with an enchilada, rice and beans. Pretty bad - bland and nothing to come back for. \n\nThe 1-star is for the friendly service, good chips and okay cheese crisp. But, if you're wanting Mexican food, you'd be better off at Valle Luna or Manuel's. \n\nAnd my rating is not because I'm comparing this place to normal \"Mexican food\" places - I know this place is supposed to be \"New Mexican.\" I have been to good New Mexican food restaurants - this will never be one of them.
365	1	d	I would give zero stars if I could. I was 7 cents over and I went in and deposited cash the same day and received an overdraft fee. I spoke with Andre at the Chino Valley branch and explained that when I called and asked about the fee scale was told as long as I deposited by the end of the business day I would not get an overdraft fee. \n\nAndre explained that it doesn't matter how much you go over...even a penny and you deposit within the minute you will get an overdraft and there is no way to reverse it. Big banks aren't even that bad. \n\nSo I ended up closing the account because that is absolutely ridiculous. I will continue to let people know about the banking practices of this horrid financial institution.
366	1	d	I would give NO or Negative star if the options were available. \nI stayed at the Hotel from the 26th of May 2016 till 27th of May.\nArrived at the hotel around 9pm Friday night and parked my Car on the 4th floor near the bridge to the Hotel. I never moved nor drive my car during the entirety of my stay. \nCome sunday after checking out to go home I realized a noticeable dent on the rear left side of my car.\nFiled a report with Hotel security and was told they will review the camera footage and will let me know who hit my car and ran.\nApril 6th I don't  hear anything from the Hotel, so I called them.\nThey told me they have the footage and seen who hit my car but CANNOT and WILL NOT give me the information. (I NEED TO GIVE TO MY INURANCE).\nThe LADY who works in Risk Management even gave me a snarky remark and told me even IF I file a police report they don't need to give it because it's private property. \n\nEven after my insurance company  (Geico-THE BEST INSURANCE COMPANY EVER) called for the information. That same lady from Risk Management told Geico to FUCK OFF.\n\nSo I am stuck paying for my own repairs. (Thank god for low deductibles) Still it's about $500 out of my pocket.\n\nSo moral of the story IF you get hit in MIRAGE's parking lot and you don't know who hit you; YOU are pretty much FUCKED.\nAnd will be ridiculed by thier bitter  staff from RISK Management too.\n\nGood luck people.
367	0	d	Dined at Bottiglia this evening.  Food was delicious, serving staff excellent, and the interior decor very inviting, light, and bright.  BUT, the music is so LOUD, that the three of us at a small table had to lean in to hear each other.  It is beyond me why restaurants need to blast music.  People come to restaurants to enjoy the food and converse.  We had considered having our \"girls night out\" at this restaurant, but know that with 6 to 7 at a table, we wouldn't be able to hear each other. Please turn the music down so diners can hear each other!
368	0	d	This is such a great park to go for a run\/jog! I used to be able to just go here right out of my back yard so it was really convenient. I've seen some really beautiful sunsets running through here and I really miss that about this place.
369	0	d	Came again, although a little later than opening time.  Food still is authentic and really good.  We had a few unique dishes this time.  Kids love the place even though we actually don't do anything else at the Gold Coast.
370	1	d	Id give a 1 star if the food wasnt so delicious here. thats why im giving two. \nThe service was horrible. came here for a going away party last week and we were sat in the middle of the room at a long table. My boyfriend and I were a little late so we asked the hostess if she sat any big parties, who ever she was texting on her phone was obviously waaay more important then we were so we found our party ourselves. once at the table it took us 15 minutes to be able to order drinks. I ordered my usual scotch and soda, never being asked what scotch i wanted, but i assumed they would just give me their well scotch. was i wrong about that... but we will go over that once i tell you about our bill.\n\nour drinks finally arrive about 10 minutes later, i ordered water as well so i reminded the server when he dropped off our drinks. Our water never came, even after reminding him a 3rd time.\n\nThe food was amazing, as usual. We had the heirloom salad, padron peppers, artichoke toasts, ceviche, ahi poke, and we split the spicy shrimp. (i obviously took a break from veganism for a night) The heirloom salad is freaking amazing, ive never had such a great salad. \n\nOnce getting our bill, we noticed i was charged for Macallan 12. For all my scotch drinkers that are reading this, it is a crime to mix Macallan 12 with soda.. If you cant just drink it straight, just admit to yourself that you are by no means a scotch enthusiast.  And with a price of $14 (i think?) a drink, we werent too thrilled. On top of everything the tip was already included, and we werent told this. So for horrible service we ended up tipping double. \n\nOn our way out the same hostess was still on her phone texting away. If we didnt live in Veer Towers and were so close to this location we would never return. You would figure with all the bad press this restaurant has endured they would step up their customer service.
371	1	d	Cruised in on a holiday Saturday p.m. & they were empty. First time we'd seen more than one stool available so we saw our chance & grabbed some wood. \nVery, very knowledgeable staff walk you through the diff types of oysters & pairings. So yummy & fun. I def recommend.
372	0	d	If you want an all day breakfast, this is the place to come! We ordered the shrimp and grits...yum!
373	1	d	Writing this for two reasons. One: To confirm that this is a legit spot which will last until someone knocks the plaza down to become a bigger mall or housing. Reason Two: To mock the dolt-girl who asked in a review \"Is punk rock still a thing?!\" Laughs. Points at girl. Laughs more. Ah. Kids today.
374	0	d	Amazing. Still not sure how we got here but we went out for a drive this morning and ended up here.  My wife loved the OJ, said it tasted freshly squeezed. I looked over the bar and saw the Zumex machine full of oranges and realized, it was freshly (automated) squeezed.  Wait staff was great, food was amazing (grits a little salty but they immediately replaced them).  We'll definitely be back, maybe even tomorrow.  Oh, have a biscuit, they're fresh and not heavy at all.
375	1	d	We came on a Saturday at 10 for their all you can eat tappas brunch. Now all I can think about is going back! We had a reservation and were seated a few minutes after they opened. Our server was one of the best servers I have ever had somewhere. While we were looking at the brunch menu, she suggested she could just get us started by ordering a few items while we decided specific items we wanted. A few minutes later our came the items she selected and ever dish was better than the last. When we ordered more, she got thm out timely and even brought some on her own. When we said we were full, she told us to sit a few minutes so we could make room for more! We never felt rushed or like we ordered to much which is the case so many times when it is all you can eat. \n\nAll the food was amazing. The most memorable was the has with fried egg. The meat was so flavorful I could have eaten this alone and given the restaurant 5 stars. I also loved the shrimp and grits, french toast, and pork belly with waffle. They kept our drinks full and took away plates that were empty quickly. This will be a regular stop on every Vegas trip from now on. I can't wait to try \"regular' menu items because if you can get that many dishes right, then the other stuff has to be good!
376	0	d	I have worked with Aaron on three jobs and found his customer service, communication and work output to be above reproach.\n\nMet him when I was desperate to repair my dad's half-empty cracking plaster pool with broken equipment so I could sell the house.  Absolutely gave me good advice and budget friendly recommendations.\n\nCalled him over to my house and we went from plaster to pebblesheen.  He coordinated with our team who were handling backyard remodel and kept me informed about all aspects of the job.  Had the misfortune to have Ironite from my winter lawn blow into my pool (this stuff is DEADLY to cement, tile and pools - stains it rusty yellow!!!).  Aaron handled the cleanup job on time and on budget.
377	1	d	Cici's is a buffet-style pizza restaurant for family-style eating. This location has a nice salad bar, fresh, hot pizza, low, low prices, and is nearly always crowded on weekends. I took my twins here tonight, and it was a mob scene. \n\nThe help is cheerful and efficient. They know how to keep the food moving and the people moving and the mouths full. With a crowd like the one we saw tonight, it's hard for the bus boys to move through the aisles and clean tables, though. These people hustle!\n\nThis is definitely a \"strap on the proverbial feedbag,\" inexpensive, all-you-can-eat restaurant. I'm always sadly amused at the number of exceedingly obese people who frequent this place. Tonight, there seemed to be an inordinate number of flatulent fatties wearing stretch clothing and tattoos, and smelling like they hadn't bathed after afternoon orgies in the hog barn. \n\nThe pizza was great, but the ambient odors from the guests were, well, off-putting to say the least! Even my 11-year-olds were grossed out by the egregious display of gluttony and poor hygiene! But, we're all guys, so that didn't stop us from eating.\n\nHey, at these prices, with such tasty comfort food and no limits, you get all the hungry dregs of humanity. It's a freak show, but we'll be back with the kids. \n\n(I need to get to a real haute cuisine place soon, to recover from this!)
378	0	d	Awesome Chinese food. Food was delivered in a timely manner & arrived piping hot. Delicious!! Finally a great Chinese place on the west side.
379	0	d	I really was hoping this was a great restaurant, since I live just around the corner.  The teriyaki chicken was dry and very plain. The Mongolian beef wasn't spicy at all and had more sauce and onions was over kill.  The sizzling rice soup, had no water chestnuts, and  the rice that goes on top of soup was completely burnt.   I paid 30.00 and was very disappointed.
380	0	d	Wasn't impressed.  Run of the mill bar food.  The thing that I wasn't thrilled with was that the menus were sticky the floor dirty and the tables had crumbs on them.  Makes you wonder what the kitchen is like
381	0	d	Nothing bad about this place. The food is delicious and it's great portion sizes. We went on a Saturday afternoon there was no wait. Wait staff was friendly and quick. The quesadilla is huge. The only thing I would say needs improvement is the decor. Pretty boring in there and there is a ton of seating. That doesn't affect how good everything else was though. Would definitely recommend, and will certainly be back.
382	0	d	Worst place to buy your furniture. We bought our couch here 3 months ago. And we have an ottoman that was supposed to be delivered a week or two after. Till now we haven't gotten it. Whats worst is that they seem not to care about it. They made their sale and they don't care anymore. We try to get an update every now and then when we will get our sectional. But every time we ask they seem not to know anything about it. So yeah. Poor customer service. Save yourself some trouble and go somewhere else to buy your furniture.
383	1	d	It's never a good sign when 27 seconds into walking somewhere, you feel as if you've made a horrible mistake... That you're about to witness an example of what  Ignatius J. Reilly would describe as  the contemporary world's lack of \"theology and geometry.\"\n\nI went to the Dominion Square Tavern about a week ago to meet Joanne. I thought it was a bar. But it's not. It's a sort of restaurant. But with a bar. But fancy. There's also a sign at the front that says you have to wait to be seated. So I waited. I wanted to sit at a table, but apparently you can only sit at a table if you're eating. So I had to sit at the bar and felt self-conscious the whole time that people could see my buttcrack...\n\nAnd that's the trouble with this whole thing, really. Because this is the kind of place where I go and I think that the problem, really, is me. Because as I sat there with Joanne, getting progressively drunker on blah-ish expensive drinks, eating so-so fries, developing that sinking imposter-syndrome feeling, the place kept filling up with people for whom this was all Just Fine - a good time on the town: sitting there without really experiencing any sort of discomfort at the faux-nostalgia of the whole thing, feeling ok with listening to hours upon hours of contrived acoustic string-band music.
384	0	d	I'd give this place three stars just for the name. I also very much enjoy the veggie options and several of their salads. Everything is always fresh, service is fast, and it's just great to be in NoDa. \n\nI've never had to wait for more than 1 or 2 people in line in front of me, so it's a good spot to grab lunch when you're working. I like to eat-in, as the deli itself is pretty cute, combining kitsch with down-home in a way that seems peculiarly Charlottean to me.\n\nIt's cute and bright inside, and there's lots of seating. There are a couple of televisions in the little dining area up front, so it's nice to sit there and watch the news with the folks who work there.\n\nSometimes, there's an interesting lady out front selling jewelry. I'm not sure if she's a permanent fixture, but she's kind of fun.
385	0	d	I can't really comment on the pricing here, as I don't consider a dish 'expensive' at $10-$12, even if it's $2 more than what's average in this city. If you're going for a Vietnamese meal, you can always expect it to be $13 and under, so I don't pay much attention to price, rather taste and quality.\n\nI enjoy coming here because it's one of the few Vietnamese restaurants in the area (at least from what I know). I think the portion sizes are just right. I've tried the Pho, Lemongrass chicken, and grilled shrimp on different occasions. The food is never greasy, and the bowl comes with a lot of lettuce and sprouts (which I enjoy).
386	1	d	I needed this. A quiet seat by the window. Steaming bowls of delicious miso ($10) followed by two sushi rolls to share. --A Spicy Tuna Roll ($12) and a Caterpillar ($24). \n\nThe waitress was cheerful and sweet. The room comfortable and quiet. Beautifully decorated. \n\nAll of that said, I am sure I wouldn't eat here if I weren't staying at the Mandarin. The hotel is out of the way. A bonus for a hotel but not necessarily for a restaurant. Especially when it's $80 (with tip) for two bowls of soup, two sushi rolls, and some sparkling water. Since this is the only hotel on the strip I'd sleep in, I probably will be back. It's convenient and it's good. But in all honesty, it's fairly forgettable.
387	1	d	If I could give negative stars, I would.\nDO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR HAIR, LADIES!!!!\nEmilia is AWFUL!!!!  I did a trial here with my girlfriend for my wedding (my girlfriend was my bridemaid) and Emilia did an average job using a curling iron. After the style fell out after 1\/2 hour, I asked her if she could do the same style in rollers for my wedding day. \nTHE DAY BEFORE my wedding, I get a TEXT from Emilia cancelling my hair appointment because she is not confident she can do what I want. WHAT?!?!?!??!  SERIOUSLY?????  \nFirst off, who does that the day before a girl's wedding? \nSecond, how bad do you have to be as a stylist to not have confidence in using ROLLERS?\n\nI will be reporting her to the Better Business Bureau. \nFortunately I got my hair done at Caesars Palace Hair Salon.  They are AWESOME there.  I just loved it there....and they made me look like a million bucks.\n\nEmilia, you should be ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!!!!\n\n(In all fairness, Vision Hair Salon operates with various contractor stylists renting out the space of the salon...so there may be other hair stylists who are good here, who shouldn't be punished for the audacity of Emilia.  The manager who I complained to about Emilia was really, really nice and seemed genuinely concerned about Emilia's behavior, which was a good thing!)
388	0	d	They did a great job. Awesome service at a fair price. The website makes scheduling easy.
389	0	d	Please people do NOT get ripped off by these guys. Came and said our blower motor was bad on our system. Then told us it was going to be 1,100 bucks to fix it. When I asked how much the labor was and how much parts were the technician couldnt tell me. They carry a book with various prices to fix different HVAC systems. The page they show you will have the name of the problem and just a price. RED FLAG !!!\nThis is like 600 bucks overpriced based on our model and tons efficiency etx. Dont get jacked up. These guys are rip off artists!
390	0	d	Totally bummed. Can't comment on food do to misleading website.  Hours stated food till 230am on their own website and even on cleveland.com. Drove an hour for a late night dinner to find out kitchen was closed at 130am.  Guess we'll try the food next time in the CLE.  We was really looking forward to a loaded up dog.  Sad dogs here for now. Off to Rascal House tonight.
391	0	d	Took my 5 year old grandson here, he loved it. All the levels are not exactly good for those chaperones who have trouble walking for long periods of time, but he has enough energy for the both of us.
392	1	d	A tad pricey for a dim sum place but plenty of great food options! I ordered around 10 dishes and my total came out to be around $50ish. Compared to NYC dimsum, this place isn't ... that great. What makes up for it though is the great service and quickness in which the food arrives! I highly recommend ordering the fried sticky rice. I never had sticky rice that was \"fried\" but now I'm on a search for that in NYC. I DO NOT recommend the xiao long bao because it was a measly portion of 3 mini bao's that had the flavor of cardboard. My boyfriend liked the egg plant stuffed with fish paste dish so I recommend that. Lastly, they charge $1.00 per person for tea (which surprised me because in NYC tea comes for free!) Nevertheless, they have many tea options (black, red, chrysanthemum etc.) They're open until about 10:30pm, so if you're craving late night dimsum this is the place to go.
393	1	d	I dont love this place because every time I leave I feel like I've left behind the bulk of my personal wealth.\n\nI also dont love this place because the food has gone down hill from what it USED to be, and the service is BAD.  BAD.  Pro tip:  you better decide what you want to eat and drink in advance because if you sit in the bar booth area, you're going to have ONE shot with your waiter.  And a long wait.\n\nHowever, the beer list is amazing.  Incredible.  I'm tearing up just thinking about it because beer is a hobby of mine.  My favorite beer on the menu is Urbach 23, and you can't afford to drink it.  Neither can I.  Does anyone need an $18 beer?  I believe the answer is, YES, once in your life you do.  Usually on your birthday.\n\nThis place should not cost as much as it does.\n\nI really love Belgian beer.\n\nThe Sharp Edge is the restaurant equivalent of an abusive boyfriend who isnt even cute that I love more than anything and will never break up with.\n\nIf you do get the food, try the chicken salad, it is quite good.
394	0	d	Nous avons célébré un anniversaire là-bas. Personnel très dévoué et à l'écoute. La nourriture est excellente. L'endroit est petit, pas beaucoup de places de parking, mais l'endroit est chaleureux. L'équipe est resté beaucoup plus tard que la fermeture et ne nous ont pas incité à quitter !
395	1	d	I LOVE MEXICANS.... I MEAN MEXICAN FOOD!\n\nPepe's compared to Roberto's. \n\nPepe's knocks this one out of the ball park. The reason being the quality of food is way better. I want it to be known that the staff here is very friendly, maybe a little to friendly I had a guy in the back winking at me.\nAlso the first time I was here one of the employees actually asked me for my number, at that time (2010) I was single and to this day I still talk to him as a good friend.\n\nOverall you can order anything with the carne asada and it will be great. The carne asada is finely chopped and has very minimal fat. They season their meat very well, not to salty nor to bland. The add a side of beans and tortilla chips.\n\nThe only thing I would do different is keep the salsa station clean.
396	0	d	Beautiful bathroom, comfortable beds, and late check out is great. The Bistro has great offerings but the prices are a bit on the higher end. Valet is also on the high end ($20).
397	1	d	When we arrived to Vegas, I decided to check out Groupon deals and sure enough this place popped up. \n\nWhen looking at the menu on Groupon it showed 2 vegan breakfast wrap options. When we arrived to place our order they only had one. Oh well...we decided to go with the Tofu Soyrizo Spinach wrap. We still had money left over and was going to get the Tortilla soup but it was considered a lunch item and not part of the groupon deal. \n\nWe asked the cashier what else on the breakfast menu is vegan? He said the oatmeal, parfait and our wrap. We just had oatmeal that morning so we weren't in the mood. We double checked with him if the parfait is vegan because it said \"yogurt\" on the menu. He said yes, so we assumed it was a soy or coconut base...Oh HELL NO!! We later found out after taking several bites, me running to the restroom all night and calling them back that it had dairy. Not a happy girl. \n\nThis point I would give them a hater review but the wrap was actually good. Maybe it was a training error on the managers part. \n\nI would recommend the Tofu Soyrizo wrap. It was very flavorful. Right amount of \"sauce\", preventing it from being dry. The added side  of tofu fries compliments the wrap. \n\nVegan-avoid the parfait and Everyone else-definitely order the parfait. Although we were \"snaked\" the granola and the large amount of yogurt and fruit can make this a fulfilling meal.
398	0	d	We went for lunch today, this was my first time here, its nice big area with a good variety of food. Besides the buffet ,there is raw food which the chefs cook to your taste. Lots of salads and desserts. \n\nThe birthday person is free which is good and they give a senior discount too.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the chicken wings and rice, it didn't taste good as the wings were not fresh and the rice was very hard.
399	0	d	Forget about all those franchised stores... come here for real deals! You will never be disappointed!
400	1	d	Being born and raised in Montreal, someone suggested to visit this place as they had authentic Montreal Smoke meat.\n\nThis place was hustling and bustling with people even at two o'clock in the afternoon and rightfully so because it's a great place to grab a quick bite with the menu offering so much. On the right hand side of the diner, there is also a take-out section.\n\nI ordered the Centre Street special that had my smoked meat sandwich coupled with fries and coleslaw ($13.50, a bit pricey). Upon my first bite, my eyes rolled to the back of my head. Just like how I remember it!
401	1	d	Because we were weren't able to make a reservation on a Saturday night for Lichtfield's at the Wigwam, we were told that there would be a 1.5-hour wait - much too long after having driven half an hour to get there. Too hungry to drive back, we found Red's Bar and Grill through the yelp app and decided to have dinner there. It was a good call; though it was a Saturday night, there was plenty of room at the tables in the bar area (there would have been a 30-minute wait if we wanted to be in the main dining room). Our server was very attentive and we got what we ordered pretty quickly. The Korean wings we ordered as appetizer had a mild kick, a nice crunch, and were very flavorful. I ordered the \"Jesse\", their version of cheeseburger with fixin's: a good-sized patty with melted cheese, topped with bacon and tomatoes and a mayo-based spread, all on a soft fresh bun. I had ordered it medium but it came more like medium-well; still, it was tasty and satisfying and the fluffy-battered onion rings were a perfect side. I liked that the big-screen TVs of the bar area had their volumes set to low, so that we could enjoy both viewing the events on the screen while hearing our own dinner conversation. I hope to be back at a future time, and in the daytime so I can dine at their patio and enjoy the view.
402	0	d	Great customer service! The man who helped me was so pleasant and accommodating. Juice was delicious. This is my new go to place!
403	0	d	LOVED  this boutique athletic store. I was tired of wearing Lululemon and wanted to try some different brands. I found this place based on yelp reviews and a simple Google search. The clothes are made for running around or working out.\n\nI tried a new type of yoga pants from Brazil. I went to a hot yoga class and by the time I went to my car the pants were dry. Similar to onzie pants but with more support. They are also a pair of pants I could wear with a booty and a cute top.\n\nThe girls are super helpful and very sweet. A must to try for anyone who wants a different type of workout gear!
404	0	d	I ordered custom-made cushions for my patio furniture.  Unfortunately the manufacturer made some mistakes on the final product.  Kim, the manager took the necessary steps to insure my complete satisfaction.  I couldn't be more pleased with the results.
405	1	d	Nothing you can really see or visit... tangibly. But any lack of progress you experience in Arizona you can link to the Center for Arizona Policy. The best analogy is that the Center for Arizona Policy is to Arizona as cancer is to people. It's a self-righteous, holier-than-thou nexus of bigots who seek to merge the church with the state. It promotes a \"pro-child\" agenda to siphon people's money into its coffers, though doesn't really do anything to support children. It's never opposed education budget cuts, doesn't do anything to help Valley Big Brothers, Big Sisters, isn't big on helping out homeless children. It's mostly a scheme to preach a lot of lies and dogma, founded on fabricated statistics involving no research to people, in order to frighten them into writing checks. Their greatest success is that members don't do independent research, accepting everything CAP presents as truth. \n\nIf your ambition is to use Yelp to review something before giving your money to it, you are doing some sort of research. Please be advised to do a little more before giving this awful place any of the money you worked hard to get.
406	1	d	You know how when something or somebody amazes touches your skin or lands on the shirt you're wearing and you swear that you'll never wash it again? That's how I'm feeling about the food I ate from Eats of Asia today. I held off for HOURS on eating or drinking anything else to let those flavourful afternotes linger in my mouth as long as I could.\n\nI made my way through a spam musubi, lucky pig bao and dan dan noodle bowl. The spam musubi is far better than anything you'd get at the local convenience store in Hawaii, you must try it! Lucky pig bao, oh my goodness, like an open-faced steam bum served up with braised pork belly, hoisin, cilantro and crushed peanuts. Remember your napkins for this one. If you're extra hungry, you HAVE to try a bowl, the dan dan noodle bowl is a fun show as they hand pull the noodles before cooking them. Once ready, they get all gussied up with pork, veg, sweet shiitake mushrooms and dusted with some crushed peanuts on top. Those noodles are sooooo soft! Loved the flavours coming out of this noodle bowl with a fun amount of spice to it too.\n\nBeing street food inspired, this food is best eaten on the go, however, if you want to sit and take a load off, grab a stool and talk Asian food shop! You'll love it! I promise!
407	1	d	I really love the platform business model of The Juice Standard, \"Sustainability.\"  I am a big advocate for simple living.  I had a work event at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, and I lucked out and found TJS on the 2nd floor wondering around during my break. At the time of my visit, they just opened (2 days in business) I was told.\n\nI'v always been a huge fan of any businesses supporting the environment and reducing the ecological footprint.  TJS I was told encourages their customers to return their bottles for reuse. TJS is also on a mission to change the way their customers through education to help achieve zero emission.  \n\nTheir drinks ranges from Product-Cleanses to juices.  I got a chance to sample their Bee Alkaline and it was fantastic.  I'd definitely make an effort to come back here when I am back in Las Vegas.  Keep up your awesome mission TJS!  \n\nUntil then, be kind to one another and Cheers! :p
408	0	d	Going to start off saying first! The staff and the owner are all awesome. Everyone is friendly and very helpful. I've been here twice and my favorite thing is the Philly Gyro. I'm not a fan of the traditional gyro sauces. So the philly and fajita style allows me to enjoy the meat with the extra flavor.
409	0	d	Coulter Nissan far exceeded my expectations.  They are very good people. I recommend them highly.
410	0	d	spettacolare, anche con la canzone \"proud to be american\"
411	0	d	It's really nice to have a new restaurant with a big menu in Town Square, especially one that is reasonably priced so I was very excited to try this place out.  My boyfriend and I went in for lunch and it was pretty slow so we got seated right away.\n\nI wanted to try something different so I ordered a crepe.  They have four to choose from and I was leaning towards the BLT crepe, but I didn't really know what to expect so I asked our server for her recommendation.   She recommended the chicken and mushroom crepe because she loves mushrooms, AS DO I!  So of course I take the recommendation.  My boyfriend ordered a boring old club sandwich.  When our food came out and I started eating my crepe, I realized it was the BLT, not the chicken and mushroom.  Unfortunately, it was not very good. There was a lot of sauce and very little bacon and tomato.  I tried to eat it but had stop at almost halfway through, and it's a pretty small portion so I didn't eat very much.  I debated saying anything because I felt bad that it WAS my original choice before she gave her recommendation.  Finally I decided to just tell her that it was the wrong crepe. She was SUPER SUPER nice and apologetic and immediately took off of our bill even though I objected.  \n\nMy boyfriend's club sandwich was pretty typical, but good.  They put avocado on it, which gave it a little extra oomph.  Next, we moved onto dessert and ordered the Cookie Jar Sundae.  It was huge!  This could easily feed 4 people.  It was amazing!  So much ice cream, chocolate chunks, whipped cream, cookie pieces.  YUM.  We finished this between the two of us like little piggies. \n\nSo even though my crepe got messed up and the BLT crepe I ended up getting was not very good, I'm going to give them 3 stars based on the excellent customer service we received from our server.  I'd like to go back and try something else, and hopefully it will be a higher star experience.
412	0	d	The coffee is made with love and fabulous!   I tried the Cafe Churro and the sweet mix of cinnimon and cream instantly relaxed me.  They also have jugos, my husband tried the mango, generous swrving light ice and he enjoyed it.  \n\nPlease realize this place is starting out small.  They have to drum up the business to pay for the permits to have outdoor seating and to sell food.  Right now they dont have any food other then cookies.  If they get there rhis place will be out of this world if the food is as good as the coffee.  Support local business and be patient this is a diamond in the rough.
413	1	d	I'd been to this shop in the past. I was in Arizona for a week and wanted a particular comic that was coming out, but didn't have a free day to make it to the shop until the weekend. Naively thinking, \"Heh, it's Arizona. There's no chance this thing will be selling out. I doubt anyone here's even heard of it.\" \n\nLo and behold, we pull up a couple days after new comics Wednesday to discover every copy, including ones with the more expensive variant covers, had been sold, and we just left (picked it up later at Golden Apple in L.A.). This was long before my days on Yelp, when I would have at least hung out to get a feel for the place. \n\nSo just for you, Yelp, here's my latest visit:  \n\nWalked in and were greeted by a small gentleman at the counter who welcomed us with a big smile. He asked if he could help us with anything, and we said we were fine. \n\nThe shop is long and narrow, filled with boxes upon boxes of comics - an entire wall of graphic novels to the right, racks of new releases to the left. Glass display cases here and there with figures and rare prints. We were amused to see coffee mugs shaped like the heads of Star Trek: Next Generation and Original Series characters in a case near the Golden Age comics. You can pick up a ready-made collection in a short box for $100-500 depending on your penchant for back issues that might break your bank. \n\nOne of the X-Men comics on sale in the case was drawn all over by a kid, with his own personal dialogue bubbles and \"colored\" in all of the block lettering with a blue pen. It appears to be X-Men #7, the \"Return of the Blob,\" which was the first appearance of Cerebro, the first issue where Cyclops was named leader, and the second time The Blob shows up. Were this comic mint, it'd be worth $1,600 to the right collector (even if it were graded \"fair\" it might fetch $100), but with all the scribbles on it, All About Books & Comics has it at $30.   \n\nMoving on, there's a small room in the back filled with nothing but discount back issues stacked in uncovered boxes on shelves. Depending on whether you're an organization freak or a \"treasure hunter,\" this room could be either intimidating, exasperating, or downright exciting. As far as I know there's no order to where the comics are placed, most aren't bagged and boarded, and you'd have to pull whole boxes from the shelves in order to go through them. Your call. \n\nNear the rear register, there's a rack of clearance items, a chunk of which being old science fiction digests and a few no-name graphic novels. I picked up Sergio Aragones' \"Mad About Mad!\" and Michael Chabon's \"The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist\" for 99 cents apiece. \n\nI stumbled upon All About Books & Comics by chance this trip, disappointed with a wasted journey to McFarlane's only to find it closed up on a Sunday. AAB&C definitely put me in a better mood, though. \n\nThe bag they give you for your purchases has a sticker on it with their accomplishments: \"Arizona's Only Original Comic Superstore,\" Will Eisner Award Winner, \"Over 10 Years as New Times Best of Phoenix & Best of the Rep!\" and \"over one million comics in stock.\" Not sure about the others, but that last one's definitely the truth. They're jammed to the gills with comics, and I love it.
414	0	d	LOVE LOVE LOVE this salon!!!! I have long hair so getting my hair trimmed can give me anxiety! This of course was before Adam became my stylist.  He is amazing! Always listens to exactly what I want, doesn't take off too much or over texturize my hair. You can tell he, as well as all the stylists at this location have a passion for the industry. I would highly recommend making an appointment and seeing for yourself.
415	1	d	I ate there on April 25, the day before the board of health shut it down for 3 dozen cases of food poisoning. I choose firefly based on the comments on Yelp. From NY, and now back home and suffering from food poisoning from their cheap and bad food. Be warned, if they open again. What happens in Vegas does not stay there.
416	1	d	Past experiences have been okay, nothing spectacular. There's some nice employees, but mostly rude, unhappy employees. The past 2 visits were probably enough for me to finally make a commitment to a new store (Robert at the Ray and Rural store is amazing). But at the McClintock and Guadalupe store there's a short dark haired woman always there to greet you with a scowl, and a man Gina that has terrible customer service. I decided to try the garlic & herb smear which was so disgusting, and had the worst texture, so I asked to exchange it for the one I shoulvde gotten in the first place. But Gina was making unnecessary remarks and laughing because we bought the tub on Monday, unfortunately opened and tried it on Wednesday, and came in Saturday because it was Thanksgiving and Black Friday. We even wasted two bagels because my sister and I didn't think we had to try it first, and he says we used almost half the tub. AND four weeks prior to this, we asked for 5 cranberry bagels and they gave us 5 cinnamon raisin instead. How does that even happen?!? #LookOutForTheManGina
417	0	d	I've been here twice now and the food is delicious. There is a big selection of seafood and innovative dishes. The dessert is also amazing. As someone with a huge sweet tooth it was hard to ignore on my first round through the buffet, but I managed. The presentation of the desserts was beautiful and they tasted great too, especially the bread pudding. \n\nThe most recent time that I went, we went because we remembered there being sushi. Unfortunately, there was yogurt and fruit in its place and they started setting up the sushi section as we were leaving.\n\nThe service of fabulous. We were there for the unlimited champagne brunch ($5 extra). She joked around with us, cleared our plates, and made sure that our champagne glasses were always full.
418	1	d	If you're going to pass out free \"single scoop coupons...honor them and don't say the coupons are only good for kids scoops. You have it on your signs...Single, Double & Kids...the coupon specifically says \"single\". \nThe ice cream is always soft and melty here. Unfortunately for the kids who work here, if a customer asks for another scoop because they don't like the melted ice cream, the employees have to pay out of their own pockets...ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!! These guys probably make minimum wage and you expect them to pay for poorly refrigerated ice cream because you're too cheap to crank up the freezer to a normal level!\nVery disgusted with this BR. It's hard enough for these kids to earn a wage but this is unacceptable. I am boycotting this location and encourage my Yelpers to say something on here for these poor kids.
419	1	d	Came here for takeout for tonight's dinner. They were quite busy with a private party and tons of takeout orders. I was debating between the falafel and the lamb shawarma. Per the nice cashier's suggestion, I ordered the lamb shawarma with a side of fries. After a 7 minute wait and admiring the clean, well-kept interior, my food was ready. When I opened the box, (2 minutes afterwards) I was saddened by the lackluster and limp fries, no salt or seasoning and not cooked well. Nothing special there. The shawarma was chocked full of lamb but was only topped with a hefty amount of raw onions, tomatoes and a little sauce. None of the other toppings listed on the board were present.  The pita was sadly store-bought and served room temperature. The lamb was tough, lukewarm and lacked flavor. I had to go back in just to get hot sauce which made it tolerable but it still wasn't the flavor journey I was expecting. Maybe I just came at a bad time given all of the good reviews. Unfortunately, I have to admit,  I've had better shawarma off street carts. \n\n3 stars for cleanliness and good customer service.
420	0	d	Holtzman did a shower project for us in 2012, I did a review but it is not on here. Our shower project was set up with Brandon, he was pleasant at first. our project was over 8k. Before the project was complete I asked to have the shower doors re-done to the original plan I was told no the glass had already been ordered. When the shower was complete one of the three body jets hit me in the face and I could not turn it off. I told brandon this he stated my husband told him where to put the jets (not true) and that the body jets always come on with the main shower head. I told him I want it separate and he stated none of my other customers want it that way. I asked for it to be fixed along with grout that was chipping away. He would not respond. I had to file a complaint with ROC at which time we found out his plumbers were not licensed. Roc told them to hire a licensed plumber and to fix the shower how I wanted it. It took them three attempts to match the grout. Brandon was very rude during the end process after he had all his money. A customer should not have to go all the way to ROC, the company should stand behind their product.
421	0	d	Very delicious food!  Very flavorful and plentiful portions!  Very close to UNLV!  Convenient spot for lunch and inexpensive!
422	0	d	Had the chicken schwarma and falafel with a side of jalapeño hummus. It was so delicious!
423	1	d	Ticoz is a chill spot, and like it's sister spots Fez and Switch has a well thought out menu.  Here they have healthy southwestern dishes that do not weigh you down.  I  also like the weekend drink specials as a cheap hangover medicine or a chance to repeat my debauchery.  The staff is always jolly and attentive,  but Cheandra seemed to stand out as a great bartender and server, keeping pace with my date and I's every need.  I highly recommend taking a break from the sun to visit this cool, quiet and relaxing place;  and say hi to Cheandra for me!!!
424	1	d	Wifey and I each ordered Omakase style which was delicious, fresh, and exciting. It's 5 courses, and they threw in an appetizer to hold you over while they made it. It's pricey with tip, I think we spent $300+, most of which was paid for by wifey's dad, who is a chinese mobster.\n\nGo here if money ain't a thang and you want some yummy fish.
425	1	d	I came here last night  since I've been craving sushi lately and after reading fellow Yelper's reviews, I decided to come check it out.\n\nBelieve the hype.\n\nI find most really good sushi joints in Montreal fall either between the food-court variety  or the super, high-end, astronomically priced variety. Finding something decent in the middle is a tricky act to follow. However, Saint Sushi delivers on all points.\n\nNot only is it moderately priced, you get lots of bang for your buck. The flavors are just simply amazing. With a  hip attitude and tasting menus named after gangsters like \"Bonnie\" or \"Clyde\" or maki rolls named after singers like James Brown or Madonna, if you like trying out unique sushi flavors, then come here.\n\nTheir \"Sapins de Noel\" (Christmas tree) is a particular delight,. Lobster on a rice cracker, it's a wonderful, unique take. Then there's the ambiance and service. The guys running the place are really nice and friendly, they want to make your experience a positive one and it really shows. Plus there were all these great 80's tunes playing, with a mix which went from \"We are the World\" to \"Grease\" to \"Home Sweet Home\" from Motley Crue.  I felt like I was suddenly back in the fifth grade listening to the radio while noshing on great food.\n\nSo with great tunes, great service, great food and great prices, please pray tell, why would I want to go anywhere else for sushi now?
426	1	d	This is the second time we came to this location and they ran out of chicken! It's a 20 min wait for a chicken breast. Don't waste your time at this location. Does Pizza Hut run out of pizza?
427	0	d	My new favorite theater.  In general, I try and avoid theaters that are attached to a mall. This is remote enough that the crowd is not too crazy.  Super friendly staff. Neat facilities. Plenty of space to lounge if you happen to get there too early for your movie.  You can get extra plush seating for a bit more, and have a beer and above norm theater food too. Yes, pricey but still nice to have that option. If you happen to just go with regular theater seating, it's still better than your norm. Leather(ette, possibly) seating, nice back support and ample give. And the screen, super clear and digital. I will definitely be back, next time going for Star (similar to Cine Capri).\n\nTip, wanna just try it out?  Go early. $5 a movie for a regular digital is an awesome deal.
428	0	d	First time here and last, there are to many other places to eat decent sushi that I won't have to go back to this place. When I got there on a Friday night after 8:00, we were seated at the last table that was part of the prep area or kitchen not sure which. I asked the server if they had any happy hour specials and she said no, I turned the menu around and they had a big red area that said happy hour! I asked another server if this was good right now and she said yes, so I guess the first one didn't hear me correctly. Anyway, the sushi tasted like it was pre packaged and not good. I can't figure out where all the 5 star reviews come from.
429	0	d	This place is horrible!!!!!! The general manager is awful, he doesn't care if you get your furniture or not, he just cares about the sale!  They promise you furniture that never arrives, take your money and go some where else.
430	0	d	Visited for the first time tonight and loved everything! Delicious drinks, amazing Poutine, friendly and personable staff and great vibe overall. Prices are totally decent and lots of value for money. A great spot for a fun and casual night out! Looking forward to trying out more menu items.
431	1	d	Been here a couple times and enjoyed it immensely. Can't remember the exact pizza that the Mr. &  I had the first time on a lunch date, but it was vegetarian and delicioso! There is some magic in their crust, I'll tell you that much. We also love it when we see a Montepulciano on a wine menu. It's not as common as it ought to be.\n\nSaturday night around 7:30 we decided last minute to go out. We tried 3 super swanky restaurants and they all had 1-2 hour wait times. We inquired at Cafe Porta Alba and were told 10 minutes. Que buona fortuna?\n\nThere was live music and it was cheery without being too loud. How many restaurants have the owner working in the kitchen, who then stops cooking long enough to jam with the band? Cafe Porta Alba does! Other than an Italian film playing on a flat screen, there wasn't much wall decor, but that shouldn't matter because the art is on the plate.\n\nMy hubby enjoyed the Barbera and I was happy to see two Chiantis on the wine list...though I wish I would have had a glass of each instead of two of the same. Guess I'll have to go back. See how sad I am about that? We both had the Seafood Linguine and the noodles tasted like they were freshly made. Bonus! The sauce was light and fresh, and the seafood was rich; a perfect balance. The mussels were a little salty but very tender and I gobbled them up. The shrimp was cooked to perfection, and the scallops seemed carmelized and had a smokey flavor that made me want to keep eating even after I was getting full. The portion sizes were very sensible. My hungry hubby finished his dish, but I set aside some of mine to leave room for dessert...AND to have a fantastic lunch the next day (the leftovers were so good I ate them cold!).\n\nSpeaking of cold, we ordered the Chocolate Truffle for dessert, and I don't know what zabaione cream is, but it was surrounded with chocolate gelato, sprinkled with carmelized hazelnuts, and then the whole thing was dusted with cocoa powder. I took the smallest bites I could just to make it last longer. Our server Clay (I think!?) knew how to perfectly pace the entire meal, and on this busy Saturday night he was courteous, collected, and efficient. He also paused while taking our order to give applause to the live musicians, and since I'm married to one, I was tickled that he took the few seconds to show his appreciation. A++ for him!\n\nOne of the questions Yelp asks: Is this good for kids? Errrr...I'd say maybe the 6+ crowd, IF they're the well-behaved ones who can QUIETLY sit still through a meal. If they're expecting Chuck E Cheese cardboard & grease pies, don't ruin everyone else's night when they're subjected to REAL food and throw a tantrum. Not a lot of room for baby carriers either, so if that's what your packin', come by in the off hours and you'll have plenty of room.
432	0	d	Very nice staff for the most part but honestly a horrible experience.  I've unfortunately been gotten a Shellac manicure here twice and both times it has barely lasted a week (whereas it is supposed to last for a minimum of a few weeks).  Friends I was with got fake nails and it took an excessive amount of time and ended up seriously damaging and cracking their nails.  While I think this establishment means the best I do not recommend it and will not be going back.
433	1	d	Event type: Wedding Reception\n\nI found DJ Buddy Holly through Gigmasters, his price was excellent and his reviews where good.  I talked with him briefly, then paid my deposit to book him for the event.  Fast forward to less than three weeks before the wedding I receive the following email:\n\"Hi Evan,\n\nUnfortunately, I have to cancel for May 12th.  I am required to go to Texas and will be unable to provide you with DJ services.   I notified Gigmasters and you will have your $200 deposit returned.\n\nDavid\"\n\nI received that at 8:00pm on a Tuesday night and nothing more.  Things happen out of your control, I get that.  What I don't get, is that it should be obvious that a wedding is very important to the person having it.  For those of you who have gone through one, the last month is a flurry of activity making sure all the last details are set.  To then receive a cancellation, via email with no explanation, no phone call, and no assurances a replacement is ready, can be a bit of a shock.\n\nThe email itself was sent at 6:30pm, and at 8:30pm I gave Mr. Kramer a call, left a message, then another call.  No pickup.  The message I left expressed how unhappy I was, but no profanity or threats were used.  I did say \"What are you going to do about it, or How are you going to fix this?\"\n\nWith less than three weeks to go my fiancee and I decided that waiting around for a response from a person who already flaked once would be a bad idea.  So immediately we starting looking for another DJ.\n\nWhile searching for another DJ I realized I had friended DJ Buddy Holly on facebook earlier that week.  I left a snarky comment, but his response shows the extent of his customer service.\n\nFrom Facebook:\nMe:\nCanceling out on a wedding, via email, with less than three weeks to go, classy.\n\nDavid Charles Kramer:\nAw, poor baby.\n\nDavid Charles Kramer:\n Here's the thing Evan, since you are immature enough to post publicly on my page. I had a replacement DJ lined up for you and even negotiated their price with them to make sure you had a DJ. Then I got your voice messages, and now I saw your posting. I'm paying the DJ in full for that day regardless. To be honest, after seeing your immaturity.......it's well worth it.\n\nThat's fantastic if he really lined up another DJ.  What would have been even better is if he told me that when he canceled.  With posting that comment on facebook I don't actually believe he had another DJ lined up.  I could well be wrong, but nothing previous to this showed me otherwise.\n\nSo is he a good DJ?  Possibly, I won't ever know.  Is he good at customer service?  Unfortunately he doesn't seem to be.  I just laid out the facts here.  To my best recollection I left nothing out, make your own choice.\n\nOn a separate note, Gigmasters, the site I booked him through seems to be great.  By the end of the next day I went back to Gigmasters and setup a new event, and had five quotes from other DJ's interested in doing the event.  So we are not totally out of luck for the wedding.\n\n\n**Update**\nIf anyone has any doubt of my honesty and sincerity, please message me and I will send you time-stamped .pdfs as evidence for all of the above.
434	1	d	Sat at the bar on a Wednesday. Wasn't crowded. Bar tenders were horrible. Had to ask for another drink since they were messing around. Appetizer took 30 min to come out and was average at best. Calamari tasted like oil hadn't been changed in some time.  After being served our salad I asked for a side of dressing because the salad had not been tossed well. 15 min later the bartender went back and had the second bartender bring it out. 1st and last time...ps, shouldn't have to ask to have the Cavs game on either. You are in Cleveland ya goofs.. Almost forgot the best part , the $15 salmon salad had goldfish crackers in it... On purpose. Assuming Cisco miss picked them and they decided to use it . Morons
435	0	d	What I love about concept galleries like Wyland is that it brings you to an entirely different world just as you enter. On one wall were simple drawings of sea creatures like turtles and whales that may not have been so striking at first glance until you look closely and see how meticulous the artist was to details. Sculptures surrounded the gallery, one of which was of a bear. The saleslady, Yuka, pointed out that Wyland carved only 750 copies of the it and sure prices were high (a staggering $1500 for a sculpture smaller than a spalding basketball) but it seemed worth it! Other paintings felt abstract, seemingly mimicking ocean waves and tropical essences.\n\nBy now you might be wondering what the artist stands for and I'll sure as anything tell you that he's doing all his work for a good cause. To an environmental geek like me, knowing that a certain percentage of all the painting's proceeds go toward environmental conservation and protecting ocean wildlife only further magnifies my interest. I consulted Yuka about Wyland's background and she willingly talked me through his past works and experience as a deep sea scubadiver. Some of the whale sculptures were carved in such detail that even texture was emphasized - as with the whales and turtles. \n\nIt was definitely not the last of my visits. Yuka informed me about a meet and greet with Wyland on June 16-17 and till then, I will always think highly of this place and recommend it to anyone who loves art that feels refreshing and alive.
436	0	d	Very authentic food and a wide selection of it. Had the beef milanesa with eggs and mashed potatoes and loved every bite.
437	1	d	I was so looking forward to Ogden's new restaurant after years of enjoying his old place at Caesar's. The burger there was one of the best I've ever had, and for once I was ahead of a trend- I've been ordering burgers at steak houses forever, because that used to be the only place you could get a high quality hamburger.\n\n\nI loved everything at the CP location- the food, wine list, service and ambience. Every trip for the last several years, I've sat at the bar and had that sublime prix fixe burger and a bottle of wine- sometimes on more than one night.\n\n\nJohn Curtis, one of the trio of authors of the annual \"Eating Las Vegas\" (a wonderful guide if you go to Vegas with any regularity) has just written a review of H&H and called it 'the best food suburban Las Vegas has ever seen\". I usually find their reviews to be spot on.\n\n\nIn any case, H&H is a much more casual space and everything about it is was just awful. Our server was manically cheerful, and the food sucked. As in, I can't remember the last time I had such a bad meal.\n\n\nThe complimentary blue corn muffins (which I had to ask for and wouldn't have known about except from the review) tasted like sawdust. We started with the Maytag Bleu cheese soufflés and they had no flavor. Followed with a Bibb lettuce salad that was so over-salted it was inedible. \n\nBy this point, not only was I starving- but I figured at least the burger would redeem this meal. The server messed up our order and only brought out one burger, so in the meantime dropped off a passable pork belly app, took back the one burger and came back with 2 freshly cooked burgers. Wow, again so freakishly over-salted that we both could only take a couple of bites.\n\n\nI asked the server for iced tea (we'd finished our bottle of wine and needed something to get the salt-lick taste out of our mouths) and she said that the tea \"didn't come out so well today\". She was right, it was really weak. Excuse me, but it is 105 degrees out and 9 pm and no one could make a fresh batch of tea at some point during the evening?\n\n\nObviously, we skipped dessert so I don't know if the butterscotch pudding and Snickerdoodle cookies survived the transition.\n\n \nI asked when we first arrived if Bryan (Bradley's son) was cooking that night and the hostess told me he was on vacation. I realize this spot has only been open 8 weeks or so, but seasoning food is pretty basic stuff- as is making tea. \n\nThe 2 separate incidents of the clatter of trays of breaking dishes in an hour and a half, hostess over-sharing, server not asking why we weren't eating our food, etc. are all things one could expect in a new spot. But food this wretched is just unforgiveable by 2 chefs like the Ogdens.\n\n\nAt least we were able to drive out there, because if I had spent the money on a cab I would have been pissed. Instead, just disappointed and $150 poorer.
438	1	d	Wow...\nI witnessed my second Ironman yesterday and watched my brother cross the finish line with tears in my eyes.  I am so proud of him!\n\nFor those that don't know, this is the BIG ONE!  It consists of a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, and a 26.2 mile run... elite athletes like my brother train for months for this event.  It paid off too - for the feeling of crossing the finish line and hearing the announcer say your name and \"YOU ARE AN IRONMAN!\"\n\nThe race is well-organized and from what I hear, they have 3,000 volunteers for just over 2,000 participants - people volunteer and have tasks such as bodymarking (putting the athlete's # on them), sunblock rubbing, transition area guarding, guiding on the course, helping get athletes out of the water, handing out gatorade, cola, chicken broth, power gels, fruit, and more... \n\nI believe that this was the last April race and moving forward the AZ Ironman will be in November.  No matter what month or where an Ironman is completed, it's a huge accomplishment!  Congrats to all of you that have completed (and even attempted to complete) this amazing race.
439	1	d	This park is awesome! I frequent this park for about an hour at a time, a couple times a week, and I love it here.\nAside from the occasional weirdo, most folks are friendly. The weekends bring lots of activity to all areas of the park. They have recently renovated a large area, I have not been to that part yet, but plan to go very soon. I hear it looks great.\nThe desert trail portion of the park is always a favorite of mine, along with many other outdoor enthusiasts. Runners, walkers and cyclists happily share the trail with bunnies and nowadays, bumblebees. I have seen tiny snakes and hummingbirds while on the trail. Everything and everybody will leave you alone if you are into a solitary outing. If you are in the mood to greet passersby, almost everyone will oblige. Some runners are in a zone, so don't take it personally if you get ignored. \nThe park is open from dawn till dusk and the desert trail gets pretty busy when the sun comes up. Most dogs are on leashes. I have seen assorted characters arise from the bushes in the center, so it might be wise for ladies to pair up with a partner before heading into the more remote areas. \n\nEnjoy, with sunscreen on!
440	1	d	This place is so awful.... I walk in with a Droid 2 Global I had just gotten in the mail because my last 3 messed up.. This one as well did the same... It wasnt making calls 100% the time like it should... So i go in and tell the salesmen what was wrong with the phone... he looks at it and says... OHHHH I SEEE... there is lent in the head speaker... REALLLY!? LENT!? come on dude... then i said i doubt thats it... he comes back to say its a combo of the lent and holding the phone cock eyed... OMFG. I was raging pissed off. But he made a call and it worked (this time) so I couldnt say anything.. Later that night it does it again... But really for them to even say that was whats wrong? wow.
441	0	d	Well, this is my first review on a string of reviews for my recent trip to Vegas. I ate at the Grand Buffet for dinner on June 28, 2007. Got there around 7:00 PM and there was no line. Got to the table within 3 minutes after paying. To me, the price for dinner was too high. I think it was $25 per person? But my dad did have a $25 dining credit, so it was 1 free, so we gave this place a shot. I loaded up on prime rib, hot and cold split Alaskan king crab legs, and peel and eat shrimp. The prime rib was good, but a little too dry. The shrimp was good and the crab was good, although on my 3rd plate, the crab meat was dry (a disadvantage when it comes to split legs). And this buffet has a memorable mashed potato cake bar where they take a mashed potato cake and add sundried tomatoes, green onions, mushrooms, cheese, broccoli, and\/or bacon to it. It was so great, I had 3 of those. I regrettably avoided most of their other foods because I knew that $25 had to be put to good use and the crab legs and the shrimp and prime rib did the job. The dessert bar was small, although had a good selection. I had chocolate mousse that was great, an Oreo cheesecake that was creamy, and vanilla ice cream (Yes, that was too much sugar). \n\nOur waiter was always there to refill our drinks and gave us extra mints in the end. We tipped him well.\n\nOverall, the food was good, BUT I would think it's worth it to spend an extra buck or two at the Bellagio dinner buffet, although the Bellagio doesn't have that great mashed potato cake, but hey, what can you do?
442	0	d	Do not bring your poor animals here! These groomers are not animal people and they do a cheap job at an expensive price.  They don't seem to know much about cutting hair in general bc all dogs who come here get shaved down with a razor.  I witnessed them shaving a Labrador and when the poor dog yelped in pain bc they nicked him, they smacked him and it made him yelp more. It was awful to see and my sheltie was very nervous, so we left.  I will go out of town to groom my dog before I bring him to Petsmart EVER AGAIN!
443	0	d	What a great find I can't say enough nice things about this Resturant. The quality of food 5 stars, the service 5 stars, the decor and atmosphere 5 stars, the price 5 stars. Best place in Vegas for sushi
444	0	d	Made an appointment. Didn't have to wait. Private room for my friend and I. Jay was great. Hot stones and oil are a must. Thank you!
445	0	d	***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 66\/100***\n\nI have not dined in so I can't comment on customer service nor do I even know what the place looks like as I have not set foot in the restaurant. We have ordered from this place about 4 times and what I do know is I like the taste of the food I have tried so far. Their concept is likened to Baja Fresh but offers more meat variety. Also offered on the wider range menu is a fire grilled salmon for the non meat eaters and desserts like Tres leches and Flan to top off your meal. Taste is by far superior compared to the likes.\n\nI've had their enchiladas which were very tasty, with chicken and comes with rice and beans and your choice of hot, medium or mild sauce. Their fire grilled chicken tacos are superb as well. The sweet pork barbacoa is not one of my faves though, it has a certain sweetness that doesn't appeal to me.\nYesterday I had their shredded chicken breast burrito enchilada style ($1 more to get it enchilada style) and it was humongous! It was delicious and made even better by adding their creamy tomatillo sauce on top. It may not be the best Mexican food you can get but it tops my list when it comes to Mexican fast food and way better than eating McDonalds for sure! Ask for a side of their creamy tomatillo sauce and you've got a fiesta in your mouth.
446	1	d	Ladies can I tell you how excited I am to have a Dominican do my hair!! I being half Dominican have issues with my hair... And since I will be living in Charlotte come two weeks, my hair will require all the help it can get due to humidity! \n\nUpon referral from my cousins wife (who goes weekly (Dominican hair) and my mother (Dominican and loves highlights to cover the grey) I called and made an appointment with Yusi to wash and blow out my long hair... OMG can I just tell you it was the best blow job I ever got! I could not believe what she did to my hair and how BEAUTIFUL it was and lasted 5 days. \n\nShe uses the finest Italian product (as does all REAL Dominican salons) and have several different treatments to offer for your hair. \n\nI will be in Charlotte full time starting July 11--Going to go in for a highlight and humidity treatment.... I will update my review.
447	1	d	I love and hate this day club.  As a girl, you want to get into every club for free. BUT it comes with a price.  Before I was working minimum wage, my girls and I would get on a guest list to get in for free.  The catch is that you have to get in line EARLY.  Like 10-11am early.  Since you're in Vegas, you probably won't be sleeping until 4-5am. So 10-11am is hella earlyyyyyy.  The guest list line is downstairs located outside and the line is ridiculous.  I swear I waited almost 3 hours one time.  DARN YOU KASKADE!  After graduating and getting a better job, I ended up buying general admission tickets and it saves you so much time waiting.  Well.... depends on the week that you go.  I normally arrive around 1230-1pm and if I'm lucky, I only wait about 30 minutes.  There are times I waited almost 2 hours, EVEN WITH GEN ADMISSION TICKETS.\n\nThe vibe here is so energetic!  There's so many beautiful women walking around and hot men showing their 6 pack abs.  The drinks are expensive, almost $20 per drink.  The DJ line-up are usually really good.  I have seen Kygo, Alesso, Kaskade, DJ Snake, Diplo and so much more DJs here.  The pool is much bigger compared to other pool parties in Vegas.  I love to come party here, but the line to get in can be a drag...
448	0	d	Wow.  We had a lackluster dining experience at a nearby restaurant and left there feeling unsatisfied.  A nearby coffee shop owner recommended Sweet Moses to soothe our dessert cravings, and man were we glad he did.  The soda shop is awesome!  The girls were super friendly, they explained everything to us and how it works and how things were made.  I had a root-beer float with homemade ice cream and fresh-made soda, it was absolutely delicious.  We ordered coffee and were treated to our own giant french press.  The coffee was great but what was really amazing was how well it went with the sweets.  They must have picked this coffee for exactly that reason.  Taking a sip of coffee, then a bite of ice cream, back and forth, brought out the flavors in both in an almost magical way.  We all had a great time and everyone enjoyed what they'd ordered, including a sundae and a brownie with ice cream.  It really ended evening on a happy note.  \n\nSince then I pretty much take any excuse to bring new people to Sweet Moses.  I rarely allow myself sweets but if someone comes into town, well heck I just gotta show them this cool little spot, and if I happen to eat some delicious homemade ice cream while I'm there, gee darn.  :)  I've brought several friends here now and my mom and step-dad, and everybody loves it.
449	1	d	Never been more disrespected in a barber shop. Sat in the chair told the guy what I wanted. He then tells me to hold on while he goes to the John. After more than five minutes waiting for this clown to take a crap. I got up and left. I will never go here again. Any professional should take care of his business before sitting a customer in the chair. They were not busy. He was sitting on the chair prior to me arriving.
450	0	d	Friendly staff. We always have the same team leader and the other staff changes up. Sometimes we get 2, other times 3 cleaners. Always efficient and depending on staff, eucalyptus oils or nothing. Always smells fresh though! They are receptive to special requests. \n\nWe've been using them for 3 months now. We like them enough to keep using them. Always nice to come home every other week to a sparkling clean home! The time we save having not to keep up with the regular cleaning is priceless. More time to do the things we love.
451	1	d	One of my favorite places!\n\nI have a confession though... I'm a trivia addict.  So any restaurant or bar that has the Buzztime trivia automatically gets an extra start in my book... but for some reason this is where I like to play more than anywhere else.  I usually hang out in the bar\/off track betting area, playing trivia and once in a while betting on the horses or dogs (with miserable results, I hate to add.)\n\nOne of my favorite sandwiches in the Valley is here - I love their Buffalo Chicken.  It's huge and covered in a pretty hot yet flavorful buffalo sauce. Unlike most places where it's not hot enough... oh and they let me choose the heat level.  Wings are really great here as well.\n\nNow I'm wanting to get back over there for a beer, buffalo chicken and gave of trivia... Too bad it's only Thursday.  \n\nCons: If you are a young single man looking to go out and meet someone, avoid this place at all costs. Also only a few microbrews, and not a lot of choice of beers on tap.
452	0	d	This place has a very small menu; I think there's only about 9 dishes. Love their soup here. They offer different range of spiciness. It ranges from no spice, mild, medium, regular to extra spicy. I usually get Kimchi soon tofu in mild because too spicy ain't my thing. Their soups are very flavourful. They come with a bowl of rice and a bunch of side dishes. Their soup is price at a reasonable price and you can easily get a yummy and filling meal for under $10\n\nThe reason why i didn't give this place a five star is because I don't like how the bowls the side dishes come in smell like really strong dish detergent...
453	1	d	I really need to write about this place because the service was unforgettably hilariously bad (***granted it was a year ago***). \n\nPerhaps it was a particularly stressful night for our waiter, but he was generally very short with my group and curt to the point of rudeness. We felt rushed all the way through and each course wasn't coordinated to come at the same time for everyone. The best part was when I ordered the beef tartare. In the most condescending tone I imagine a human being can muster he said \"ya so you know that's raw meat then, right? It's RAW\". \n\nYUP, THANKS.\n\nI'm really not even mad, but on top of that the food was as 'meh' as it got. The whole experience was less than average. There are too many other more promising places to try in this city to warrant another go and I recommend you skip it too.
454	1	d	As much as I'd love to keep this fantastical secret to myself, I feel the need to spread the joy.  My always frugal mom was the one who put me onto this Bay outlet that is cleverly disguised as an old dingy Zellers.  The store is massive.  Imagine the average Winners, add a Home Sense and multiply by two or three.  \n\nEverything at the outlet is already heavily discounted from regular Bay retail prices.  Then, you take an additional discount depending on the colour of sticker affixed to the product's tag.  The range is something like 20-50%.  If you're lucky and show up on the right day, there's even further discounts to be had via limited time promotions.  One time it was all summer footwear that was an extra 25% off.  On another recent visit you saved 15% for paying with debit or credit and 20% for using an HBC credit card.  \n\nThe goods, they are great.  Better selection and quality than any Winners\/Marshalls\/TJ Maxx I've been to in the GTA and at heavier discounts.  Finds include items from Top Shop and Top Man, Material Girl, Buffalo, Free People, Nine West and so much more.  Yeah but what kind of prices are we talking about reallllly, you ask?  How about a BCBG dress that retailed at $152 for $26 bucks.  Yeah, you bet I scooped that gem up!  Most of the store consists of ladies clothing, footwear & accessories but there are also decent sized sections for men, kiddies and home furnishings.  The only reason I've held back on giving the place 5 stars is the lack of organization.  Be prepared to spend some time treasure hunting.  Like an entire afternoon.  It's well worth the TTC trek to Kipling + a bus ride if you don't drive.  And if you do, there's ample parking plus a smallish Winners and a few restaurants in the same complex.  But shhhhhh.....don't tell too many friends okay?
455	1	d	It's rare for my party of five to order five dishes and to like every single entree. Faced with a far-reaching menu, we turned to our server for recommendations. Each dish was unique in its own ways with no overlap in flavors -- the sign of a talented Cantonese chef. The highlight, however, was the Vietnamese Beef Ding that our server had strongly suggested. The dish comprised of simple cubes of beef with a blend of spices that sparked my taste buds. \n\nSadly, the positives to Bo Loong end at the cooking. Service was iffy at best. Aside from some guidance at the start of our meal from our server, our teapot with the askew lid went ignored until the end of our meal -- when the owner himself made note of that to one of the three servers handling the dining area. But for the deliciousness that Bo Loong shells out, I'll happily overlook the service.
456	1	d	Treated the in-laws and wife to Pier-W for on a recent evening and we very much enjoyed ourselves.  We all ordered white fish and Swiss chard, which seemed to be the special of the evening.  This night's weather was stormy, which is a stark contrast to the sunny visits I've had in the past.  The stormy weather and choppy waters of Lake Erie were still beautiful in their own way.  The restaurant was packed!  \n\nI asked the maître d' if he would take my father-in-law and I into their reputable wine cellar and he cordially agreed.  He showed us some of their most expensive bottles from France and California - $4,500 each!  They are on Wine Spectator's list of preferred restaurants too.\n\nI do not remember the wine we drank, but it was delicious and paired well with our meals.  My father in-law ordered a 30-year-old port wine at the end of the meal, which I thought tasted dull.\n\nI knew it was going to be a pricey meal, but how often do we get to enjoy a fine meal at a fine restaurant with family?  Not often enough.\n\nIt was a great night and worth every penny.
457	0	d	Our other Subway, on the south side of town in the Target Plaza. Set up backwards from the one I usually go to, same Subway fare. Always good!
458	1	d	I'll never fly Spirit again! No matter the price. I'm surprised they don't charge to use the bathroom! Nickle and dime on everything. There is a dent my knee from the seat in front of me.
459	1	d	Whenever I hear of a new deli opening somewhere, I gotta try it, especially when it's located in the South Hills. So it was off to Fredo's to pick up a pre-shift meal. \n\nI called in and ordered a Po Boy's Sandwich, which boasts crabcakes! Yum.\n\nBut they were out of crabcakes. Downer.\n\nSo I went with a corned beef sandwich. \n\nI order mine on white bread with lettuce, tomato, onion, and mayo, and if that offends you, come try me. \n\nSeriously, I'm not crazy about rye bread, and I only like mustard on certain things, corned beef not being on the list. \n\nLet me tell you, this corned beef was the tops. It goes straight to #1 on the corned beef charts. Delicate and cured, there was no gristle to be found at all, nor was it in any way gummy. Immaculate. \n\nThey were rather generous with the meat, but if you want more, you can ask for extra meat with any sandwich for an extra buck and a half. The white bread was very artisanal as well and had a crust that gave my jaws a little workout. \n\nIt's very quaint inside too, and they even have a little coffeehouse in the back. Sausages can be found in a glass deli case in the front. They also have fresh squeezed lemonade, which I didn't try.\n\nOh, ok. You wanna know about their potato salad. My readers know I have a tater salad jones. I gotta have it!\n\n I ordered a half-pint. \n\nNow they claim it's made fresh with Hellman's mayo. \n\nBut I dunno man. I'm very suspicious. I can't prove it, but I think they use...errr...the processed, mass-produced, and therefore criminal Grandma's Potato Salad. \n\nThe potatoes were cooked quite well, but that dressing had my Spider-Sense goin' haywire. \n\nGood cop\/bad cop? Will I have to interrogate someone under hot lights? Hmmmm. \n\nWell, since there's a shadow of a doubt, I'll only knock off one star. It's a neat little joint overall. \n\nI still wanna try that Po Boy, though. At least I have a reason to go back now.
460	0	d	I like the fact, as opposed to Culinary Dropout, that every dude at Olive and Ivy does NOT have a beard! Good job guys Not over the top trendy And good old fashioneds too We went for happy hour and wanted to try all the specials
461	1	d	I order A TON of awards for my events and I always use Sun Devil. They are easy to work with and always get things done on or before the deadline. I never have to worry about things getting done, you cant ask for much more.
462	0	d	Carmalized croissants are awesome!!  Just a little place but people are super friendly and welcoming. I'm hoping that they will see this review and send me their croissant recipe since I live in the Chicago area. A girl could hope.
463	1	d	I stop by here about once a month to indulge in some fine Middle Eastern\/Persian cousin.  The food is fresh and tasty.  The ground beef kabob is sensational.   I believe it is made with a mix of basil, mint and paprika and cooked to perfection.   The tandoori bread an accompanying yogurt cucumber sauce finish off the entrée nicely.\n\nI would recommend trying out the daily special - offered six days a week.  My favorite luncheon daily special is the Barberry rice and chicken.  This meal consists of chicken, barberries (not quite sure what a barberry is?) and plenty of basmati rice.  The chicken is cooked to perfection and is added to a saffron tomato sauce.  The flavor is delicious and not too strong.  \n\nThe staff is helpful when making a selection and takes quite a bit of pride in their food.  Zaytoon is a great place for a quick lunch time meal that will set you back by about $10.00.  The food is not too filling, but the portions are just right for lunch time.\n\nIf you are adventurous, you can try the doogh, a lightly flavored yogurt beverage.  The drink will compliment the meal.
464	1	d	The BF and I have been wanting to try this veggie friendly place for a bit. \n\nWe got the veggie sampler, side salad,  yemisir sambusa ( lentil puff pastry). \n\nSide salad came first and out came a huge family style platter. We barely even touched this as it wasn't needed. It was just simple salad of greens and tomatoes oddly with Italian dressing. There was a mixup though and while we wanted a side salad the lady gave us a full size. The veggie platter comes with a little salad so I don't think its needed. \n\nThen the yemisir sambusa came and for $1.50 is a large pastry filled with lentils. I was expecting a small samosa sized thing. It was pretty good and filling with all the lentils. There was a side of a horseradish-y paste to accompany it.\n\nVegetarian platter- came with lots of goodies and it was all delicious. It doesnt seem like a lot of food at first, but when you eat it with injera it hits like a brick. We had a cold lentil salad, some greens and tomato salad, cold injera salad, braised cabbage and carrots, red lentil, yellow lentil, collard greens, curry paste. With the platter and the yesmisir sambusas the BF and I were full and we would definitely order that again and skip the salad. \n\nService was just OK. There was plenty of waiting around after eating for a box and then it was a long wait for a check to come to us. It seemed usual so don't expect a speedy place. \n\nThe food here is really cheap and the quality and flavor is great so I will be back!
465	0	d	Cute diner with an interesting take on old classics. Paul got a \"chicken pesto burger\" and I got the \"tofu club sandwich\". I was super excited to see that they had many more-than-vegetarian-friendly options, meals actually designed around tofu instead of just excluding the meat!\n\nI ordered coffee and Paul got the house made peach iced tea, which was delicious. The coffee was decent but I had to ask for a refill despite being one of two tables there.\n\nWhen the food came we were stunned by the amount on the plate. Many fries! Much sandwich! The club came stacked high (or long, I guess) with well-buttered toast, sauteed mushrooms, thick tofu, mayo, and tomato. It was delicious and rich and hard to eat without loosing most of the mushrooms. Worth the challenge. The chicken burger is what Paul describes as \"unexpected, not exactly what I wanted, but good\". There was little pesto, but rather a very chicken-y flavour. The bun was crisp, but not too crisp, and the other toppings were great. The mountain of fries were thin cut, extra deep fried, and amazing. The salad ok, cute and colourful but too vinegary, especially with the pickled onions.\n\nAll and all, great and unique food at a fair price, would return.
466	0	d	This place is absolutely amazing starting with the shop itself everything is super clean and organized you feel instantly comfortable and that's before you even talk to anyone not only is the atmosphere great the people are just as fantastic I felt super relaxed everything was explained to me and all my concerns were addressed I did not feel rushed what so ever I got my nipples pierced here it was my second time and I was concerned with my scar tissue that it may cause a problem so before I even paid I was looked at before so both I and the piercer (ana) where comfortable that my piercings would heal and be okay I would definitely come back if I decided I wanted another piercing I love it here! Thank y'all so much for a great experience!
467	0	d	I love this place! I love sushi and theirs is fresh and delicious.\nThey have some premade rolls you can take to go (or eat there if you like) or you can order from their menu and they'll make it fresh. I believe their price's fair for the quality of their food and they use purple rice which is healthier than white rice.\n\nThe seating area isn't too big but they have a few tables. If you're part of a big group, though, it'll be hard for you to find seating, specially at lunch time. \n\nService is pretty fast, even at lunch time when they're the busiest and the staff's always nice and courteous.\n\nAll in all, it's a very good place to get sushi downtown Phoenix.
468	1	d	If you are going to offer gluten free pizza crust you should probably know what that is when customers ask for it!  If you are going to offer Tecate beer, again, you should probably know what that is!  If you need a specific person to put on the veggies, they should probably be working their spot in the service line and not answering phones.  We waited a good 5 minutes for our veggies.  Customer service was clueless!  Pizza was good and the restaurant was clean but I don't think I would be likely to return anytime soon.
469	1	d	I've eaten barbecue all over the country...This is by far the best! How lucky to have this awesome restaurant right here in Phoenix!   Enough has been said about this restaurant. If you haven't been here, what are you waiting for???
470	0	d	I have to give this place another 5 stars for offering the greatest beer combination known to man:\n\n\nsammy smith oatmeal stout + strongbow.\n\n\n\noh, and the first friday dj that gave me sour times. kudos, sidebar.
471	1	d	This could have been a home run.\nMy friends and I got many different things so we could share. \nLoved the oxtail fries. \nReally liked the wings - wished they had more heat.\nAlso liked the duck filled steamed buns. \nAbsolutely hated the James beard award winning lamb burger - one bite and I couldn't eat anymore. It was terrible! \nI would have given them a higher rating had it not been for that burger. \n\nOh, and my 8 and 12 year olds wanted their burgers medium. Not medium well or medium rare, just medium. \nThey made me sign a release of liability in order to have the burgers cooked that way. Apparently they require it for all kids unless you order medium well or well done. That was a first, a really bizarre first.
472	0	d	I give it 3 stars because it took almost 30 minutes to get our food once we ordered and there was one person ahead of us. Once we ordered we sat down but we were never given our drinks until all the food came out.\n\nWhile the food was delicious - we at the Carne Asada burritos - it wasn't worth waiting 30 minutes.\n\nAnd while we were waiting, the owner (a guy) came out of the kitchen to talk to the other people sitting in the dining room. I know he was an owner b\/c he mentioned it a few times. He chatted with them for about 25 minutes but never acknowledged my daughter and me. $20 for two average size burritos and a horchata isn't too bad but overall just nothing special. Probably won't go back.\n\nThe restaurant itself was OK. Some people might be freaked out by the bars on the window but they're not really a big deal. The parking is tight but it works out OK. Getting out of the place can be a bit tough with traffic though.
473	0	d	Best wings we've ever had. They have an extensive menu including baked brie app, salads, veggie Philly and many other interesting choices. Service is always good. Bartender will suggest drinks if you ask and there is a patio outside as well.\nI like that the noise level is pretty low most of the time, despite it being a sports bar. There are televisions to watch your game and it's laid back. You seat yourself. Overall, great find that's on our favorites list.\nmy one and only suggestion: ranch is always runny. Please fix the recipe. I love ranch with my wings :)
474	1	d	So  many bad reviews but I actually liked my experience here.\n\nI purchased a Groupon here for a Brazilian wax and made an appointment for 4pm. \nI arrived promptly on time but was greeted by no one. After waiting a little, a lady (I'm pretty sure she was the owner) said hello and told me to wait a little as she got everything ready. As I waited, another customer came in and told her she needed a threading so she did her first (I was not pleased). She also picked up a few phone calls and did an phone interview with a potential employee before she got to me.\n\nIt was finally my turn at 4:20pm. The waxing room seemed clean and smelled nice. The towels were a little worn but it didn't bother me much. She left me to get ready. When she came back, she assured me that the door was locked and started the wax. It was pretty typical for a brazillian. There was the usual discomfort but nothing different from other places. The wax was just the right temperature and she did everything very swiftly and professionally. As she did the waxing she talked to me about my hobbies to distract me and 10 minutes later we were done. \n\nAfter I got dressed I gave her my Groupon and she gave me a 40% off card for the next time I come because I had to wait. That was definitely nice of her. (She also mentioned that there's a student discount.)\n\nThe place looks more like a nail salon than a waxing place\/spa but it doesn't bother me. The lady was very professional and very comforting. I'm happy with the results and I will be back for sure.
475	1	d	I wasn't impressed at all with the food, the service, or the atmosphere.  The silverware was dirty, the glasses had spots on them. The plate was chipped. Had a pizza. The dough was undercooked in the center, dry and bland.  The toppings weren't fresh. Mushrooms looked like they sat around for a week. Never got a refill on my ice tea. Price was high and left me feeling like they're trying to push this place as a high-end bistro, except the food and service were more like a fast food joint. Didn't have dessert because everything in the case looked like it had been there for months. It didn't look freshly made so I stayed away from it. \n\nI won't be back. I wouldn't suggest this place if you asked.   It's not good.
476	0	d	Dr. Van Oosten is great! I seriously cannot recommend him enough! My experience working with him and his staff has been beyond anything I have ever experienced in any other doctor's office or chiropractic practice. His staff Sue and Deb are so nice. They make getting you in for an appointment so easy and stress free. The practice also is very experienced with worker's compensation and have submitted all claims perfectly. \n\nDr. Van Oosten is a wonderful chiropractor. I originally came to him after a back injury and was pretty upset about ending up in the ER, the bad pain etc. He is so encouraging and I credit him with keeping my pain manageable while recovering from multiple herniated discs in my back. Thanks to him I was still able to go and enjoy a planned vacation only 3 weeks after my injury.\n\nI highly recommend Lakewood Chiropractic!
477	1	d	Food was good \/ ok over all but one thing I have to say and the only reaspn why Im posting is to talk about the serving cart.  Whats up with the cart!!  Only 2 of us and anything we prdered, our server brought it over on a cart. Wheels on the cart were loid and obnoxious. Very disruptive having to listen to the raquet of the cart all night.  Was also used when clearing off tables.  Hard to enjoy the meal or the music when having this cart with loud noise from the  wheels.  Its too bad because its a great little place.  GET RID OF THE CART
478	0	d	Drinks, duck wings, chopped salad, & shrimp avocado salad were good. Shrimp avocado needed more shrimp! Friendly and good service, kid friendly!
479	0	d	We have 2 all you can eat Olive Garden pasta passes. We have gone to this locaction almost every night for two weeks and prefer it over the Fiesta Mall location.\n   On Oct. 12, 2017, we arrived with a special request.  Salvador was our server and immediately went to Zach, one of the managers, who promptly took care of our request. \n   We can't eat an entire full serving of the pasta and this location has given us no trouble ordering the half portions.  I love the gnocchi soup,  my spouse likes the fazolli soup.  A few times the pasta was brought out while still eating our soup but that's not the norm. All our food has been delicious, hot and other than an overcooked piece of chicken, really great.  The chicken was promptly replaced with a perfectly  cooked piece.\n  I suggest the following wonderful servers:  Tall Devan, Patrick,  Salvador, Ervin, and Lasso. We had a few others I may come back and add when I recall their names. \n    Remember,  when servers are busy, they are still doing their best for you! Also, Pasta Pass holders, leave a tip! \n  Handicapped parking, first come basis. One handicapped bathroom stall.  Half price drinks only while waiting for your table. Very busy Fri & Sat.  Evenings!
480	1	d	I've been here a few times in the past but i will never come back here anymore. \n\nThis one lady which I can't remember her name kept trying to tell me I should do things to my nails which I can't even understand. I told her I didn't want gel and she keeps insisting you to do gel because it's better. So I agreed. Than she tells you she's going to do some kind of massage and I thought it was part of the package. Short story, I ended up paying $85 on my nails for getting gel and having her fix a couple cracks on my nails and some type of massage I didn't even understand what she was saying.  I hate this place. Complained. Called to let them know my issue. Management didn't care.  Said she didn't understand me.  Whatever.  You're the one selling me!!  Guess I was the idiot for going okay.  You should say, and this will be $10 more or $15 more each time you do something. I don't know they are all an additional cost from $35. \n\nApparently they charge extra for every little thing and it seems like it was part of the package.  \n\nBy the way, they also double charged my credit card which I had to complain about to them and they told me it wasn't done.  Umm.. how was it now done when it was authorized twice? I called my credit card company to dispute and they took it back off. \n\nApologize for your own mistakes and don't try to make the customer look stupid.   Best nails is the WORST nails. \n\nBye Felicia!
481	1	d	Really great Lebanese food in a funky and up and coming neighbourhood.  Everything is super fresh with top quality ingredients.  My only complaint is that they are a little heavy handed with the salt at times.  Portions are generous, if I get the platter with two salads, I usually have enough for lunch the next day!  All the salads are good, my personal favourite is the carrot.  The pita bread and hummus is the best.\n\nThis spot is always busy, so if you don't want to wait for a table, order takeout or come early.  They are usually pretty efficient, and it's a fun, lively spot, so if you're in for a wait, grab a drink, relax and enjoy the atmosphere!
482	1	d	OK. This is it people. This is why we are here. Right? This is the time of year we phone relatives back home, donned in flip flops, board shorts and Ray Bans. We say things like, \"Ohhhh, I forgot it's 32 degrees, snowing, sleeting and you have dark dismal clouds looming overhead.\" \"I'm by the pool flipping burgers in my new swim suit I got at Marshall's\" (ok, I wouldn't reveal that, I would say Saks 5th Ave., but work with me people!). Even though we're still \"struggling\" with these unseasonal temps (a la upper 80s's), our relatives, friends and family we left behind are snuckering down (did I say snuckering?) in their moon boots and parkas. Us? We? We're still chillin' in our favorite T's, shorts and sandals. The point for this review? Hmmmm. to review us. To review the weather. And the jab at the rest of the good ole US of A. I know Phoenix is waiting for a heartbeat. I know there are newbies who don't get us yet. And that's ok.  I feel the energy of the desert. I feel the energy of a new city emerging from the ashes. I feel the uncomfortableness from this nasty ass IKEA chair on my butt. While I know it's time to sign off and find comfort elsewhere, I just had to say....I LOVE Phoenix and if you don't, go somewhere else, drop the negativity and find your mojo within yourself!
483	1	d	ever since the cosmo opened i've been wanting to go here for a nice fancy dinner! i just came back from a bachelorette party and this is where we had our dinner. we made reservations early at 5:45 [thank god!] for 12 ladies. 7 of us checked in and they said they couldn't seat us until most of the party was here. which was lame. so while we waited we continued to drink from our pink cups that we brought from our room which was a plus!\n\nfinally we got seated at about almost 6:30. the waiter was super nice and helpful and told us what he recommended and what dishes were his favorite. me and the MOH decided to share a plate since we didn't want to eat too much because we had plans to drink later on that night :)\n\nwe ended sharing the filet mignon medium rare [medium size i think and asked to cut it in half] w. a side of mac & cheese. the portion was perfect for me, don't get me wrong i wasn't completely full but i was definitely satisfied and ready to drink! lol. the filet was perrrrfect!!!! very delicious and loved the sauce it came with. the mac & cheese was also great too! we picked the best combo for dinner.\n\nour table order a bj shot for the bride to be and it came out with a plate with \"congratulations\" written in chocolate along with a small dessert. perfect way to end dinner :)\n\ndon't come here if you're not looking to spend $$$ because this place is pretty pricey. so don't be cheap! lol. i would like to come back for a romantic dinner date sometime.
484	0	d	If you ever want to feel like you're in the right place, just take one step into Power in Motion. With Devin's energy and expertise, it's easy to see why this place is on the rise in the North Scottsdale area. Devin couldn't be a more professional trainer with the skills to make anyone reach their goals. Everyone needs to know about this place!
485	1	d	Extremely pleased with our pup, Olive's, doggie daycare experience.\n\nMy initial contact through email with Tania went smoothly and she was extremely helpful and paitent with my many questions. When the day arrived for Olive to attend daycare, the wonderfully pleasant and sweet Zaneta, greeted us at the door. She verified our paperwork and walked us through a tour of the gorgeous and clean facility, and then we said our \"see you later\" to Olive. I asked if I could receive a text update letting me know how Olive was doing and Zaneta said she would gladly do so.\n\nThe day passed and it was time to pickup Olive. I was slightly saddened that I did not recieve a text update, but when we arrived, Zaneta was there to greet us at the door again, and she immediately shared 5 different pictures of Olive with me that she had taken. In fairness, I did observe many \"doggie visitors\" there that day, so I can understand that their hands were full and I appreciate that she took photos of Olive to share with me nonetheless.\n\nI am extremely pleased with the service we recieved and Olive seemed comfortable and quite happy there too. Their doggie daycare is a great value at $43 for the day and their clean and modern pet boarding rooms begin at $70\/night and INCLUDES daycare. Quite reasonably priced for the exceptional service and lovely accommodations. We will gladly book with Luxe again and highly recommend them!\n\n\n44\/100
486	1	d	No. \n\nJust ... no. \n\nThe most entertaining part of the entire show was the audience member seated to my immediate left -- who throughout the entire thing went absolutely bonkers for everything as if he were a plant (if he indeed happened to be a plant, then he might be the most enjoyable facet of the show for you too). \n\nThis show is awful. Both definitions of awful: full of awe (in how shitty it is) and the new definition synonymous with terribly bad. \n\nI normally would one-star it but I must be getting merciful with age. This is bad. \n\nJust ... bad. - E\n\nEpilogue: the extra star in the two star rating is for the remote possibility that the audience member was a plant. I wish I can take him to every shitty show I suffer through: films, concerts, et al.
487	1	d	Is it OK for a 52 year old man to say OMG. I haven't had Gelato in 30 years. This was fantastic. I had dark chocolate. My weakness. The kids loved it. Not very many places to sit. But we managed. This is the beginning of a beautiful relationship. Well worth the travel to get here. Way to go.
488	0	d	4.5 Stars! I came here mainly for the experience, and what a great experience it was. My friend got a Groupon for dinner here (apparently they always have one going on) and we went on a weeknight. \n\nOnce we were in the waiting area, we were handed menus and had our orders taken. We then were brought over to the entrance of the seating area and introduced to Nasir, our server. He is visually impaired, and led us to our table in the pitch black dining area. It was funny, I kept waiting for my eyes to adjust and to be able to see maybe a little bit, but it was so dark in that room that it never happened!\nI ordered the surprise meat appetizer (gotta love the name...), the shrimp and mushroom risotto, and the surprise dessert.\nFrom what I could tell, the app was a curry dish and was quite good! The risotto was also very nice and was a good thing that it didn't need any salt or pepper - I have no idea how I would have accomplished that. I tried my friend's filet mignon and it was tender and tasty. Dessert was chocolate cheesecake...yummy! I got the hang of eating without seeing pretty fast, using a 'guide thumb' and taking my time. Just make sure you wash your hands before you eat. ;)\nMany people have commented on the long wait times between courses, but we were in and out in less than 90mins, and that included us sitting and chatting for a bit after our meals. I guess it depends on how busy it is.\nIt was such a unique experience to eat in complete darkness. You really don't appreciate what you have until an experience like this. I was very impressed with Nasir the server, he navigated the room like a pro and was superb. \nI would definitely get another groupon and return!
489	1	d	I didn't even wait in line.  I came the two weeks before Christmas, in and out like a ninja.\n\nAnyway this is the best buffet I've ever eaten.  Surprisingly the butternut squash soup was the best dish.  The crab legs were great, if you like cold alaskan king crab legs, which I don't.  The prime rib was very respectable, about what you would get at a black angus or mid tier steakhouse.  All you can eat for those two items is already worth the thirty bucks.\n\nThe fish was fifty-fifty.  Half overcooked and half cooked correctly.\n\nA couple other things such as the veal and the freshness of the shrimp stood out.  \n\nDon't leave vegas without eating here.  You'll get a great meal, and if you like, pretend to be too good for it, if that's your thing.
490	0	d	Wow!! These guys are amazing. Carlos helped me out and had my phone ready in 45 mins! WHAT!! Everyone tried to charge an arm and a leg , but the pricing is fair and service and everything you could hope for . Thank you guys if I end up destroying my phone again I'll be back for sure !!
491	1	d	REVISION:\nFirst of all, thank you Zuzanna for offering a refund. I have bumped up the experience one star for that offer. \n\nSecond, my review was removed by Yelp. So I shall repost:\n\nI went here for about 18 months on and off. Major love that faded as good teachers went away.\n\nI adored Kat's 5:30 Fri class. But that's gone. It was also the main reason I re-upped twice with the studio.\n\n6 p Wednesdays features a 'mean girl yoga teacher,' S is not \"all welcoming\" You'd better be invited on her 4:30 Saturday or pay the interrogational price tag. \nThe class alienates anyone who is not in her posse but wants to give it a shot as it fits into the schedule. Your heart does not matter to her, only the amount of Lululemon on your bod.\n\nI took a Monday class that was an experience into the male yoga Bro-ohm-mance culture. Example the instructor, Mr T,  response of, \"that's what SHE said\" to a fellow female instructor, commenting on the hot temperature of the room, is never appropriate in a yoga studio. Perhaps a bar out with the guys on a Saturday night, but not a Yoga studio. Bonus- he was the only male there. \n\nFor the record, looming over a person in savansana (sp) so that she thinks she's in Father BadTouch's clutches again is not going to gain  a second visit to your class.  \nPerhaps the \"JESUS CHRIST\" I screamed at a blurry (my glasses were off) looming creepy face, made an impression. I hope this yoga instructor has eliminated that from his practice. \n\nAlso,the instructor had students pull every single prop out, then we didn't use all them all plus he gave a zen practice when the website promises flow. I want my $ and 90 minutes back. I'll cut the male instructor slack on the prop pull as it was his first class, but inappropriate Bro-bar talk should never be excused \n\nI also had a bad Zen practice (that I specifically went for) with another instructor but that's more me than her.
492	0	d	I ended up at Hogtown Pub & Oysters randomly on a Friday night to celebrate my birthday. The original plan was for everyone to meet at NightOwl but because of how crowded and loud it was, I decided to scout out nearby places in -30C, and stopped by this gem! \n\nThe host was very quick to set us up for a table of 15 without any problems at all. The wait staff was super friendly, patient, and professional! I seriously haven't experienced this kind of service in a while. Our waitress even split our bills in the end, which I understand can be a headache with big groups.\n\nI ordered Oysters and they were pretty great. I enjoyed the West Coast oysters more than the East Coast ones. Their fish tacos are a pretty great appetizer too.\n\nThe atmosphere is very cozy, with beautiful twinkling ceiling lights, small booths for if you're on a romantic date, and a bar in the back.\n\nIf you're in Little Italy, definitely check this place out!
493	1	d	Wheeeeee this store is a great gift store, wonderful things for kids too! Toys, bags, cards, local Jewelry or at least Canadian artist. Ceramics - tea thingy, funky computer bags, umbrellas..oooh and robots! I love robots..must have robot robots..\nThose weird stoppers that you supposed to re cork you wine with..HA! ya right like that is ever going to happens. But they do have them there..I was with my wonderful man the other night and he was mentioning he needed one for his - cool funky expensive beer that he wanted to save..Phisa he drank the whole big bottle anyways!
494	1	d	The worst dealership experience I ever had.\nThis place is an absolute joke. Went in today to test drive a Highlander. After going back and forth with the sales person for 3 times before agreeing on the price the unimaginable happened.\nThey took a $1000 deposit, they make me sign a contract, took my key for the car I was treading in, they give me all the document of the new car and  make me wait another hour for the new car to be washed and ready.\n\nWe were waiting 4 hours at the dealership, I am with my wife and my 3 yr old who is tired and wants to go home. The manager came to see me one more time with what I thought is the key of the new Highlander and instead he proceeded in telling me that they made a mistake on the trade-in value of my car and now they want more money!!!!!\nThey blamed it on the computer giving them the wrong specs on my car. Needless to say I walked off. The guy started apologizing and started blaming the used car manager for the mistake.\n\nThey said they refunded my $1000, but my bank still shows the charge and no refund.  Now I will have to call them again and have to deal with this crap after all the terrible time spent in this place.\nI will also have to dispute the hard check they made on my credit.  This place is the worst, people were rude and I will take my business back at Acura.\n\nI will make sure that everyone at Toyota's corporate office is aware of the corruption and unprofessional behavior by this dealership.
495	1	d	At first, I was reluctant to review because I wanted to keep the place to myself. Fat chance.  Get there early (or go late) for lunch because they get line-ups now. As they should.\n\nThe food they give you for $6.50 can feed an army. And it's good!\n\nSalads with heaping piles of vegetables. You can add on gyro or chicken or steak (that takes longer). The salad is so big, I sometimes go half-zies with a co-worker or save some for the next day's lunch.\n\nGood falafel too.\n\nNot much seating. More of a take-out place, but you can sit if you need to.
496	1	d	I don't get it. Why is this place famous? Because they put gross, soggy fries on their bland tasting subs? The food here just doesn't even come close to matching the hype.\n\nEven when I was drunk as hell, I found that a hot, fresh sausage sandwich right off the grill from one of the street vendors was much more satisfying than one of Primanti Bros' greasy, flavorless subs.\n\nIf you want to eat at a famous Pittsburgh institution, go get a hot dog and fries at The Original. Granted, you might get shot, but, hey, it's worth the risk.
497	0	d	In short, the Grotto was about as close as you can get to fine dining near Fremont street.  My wife and I split the Mahi and Lobster Bisque.  Both were fantastic.  \n\nI asked if there would be a plate sharing charge, the waiter says, no, we just require a smile.  They split the bisque into two smaller bowls and they did the same for the dinner.  \n\nEverything tasted great and the service was as expected.\n\nThey brought out the dessert cart, which included chocolate cake, a cheese cake, a 7 layer strawberry wedding cake and espresso with biscotti.  We had to pass because we were full.  Next time we will get you, dessert cart.  Next time.
498	1	d	Sadly, I need to update my review of Laveen Nail. What I like about Laveen Nail is the proximity to my house. The staff is very friendly, and the place is clean and has nice massage chairs that work. They also always seem to have enough staff so there isn't a wait.\n\nI chose the Deluxe pedicure today, at $40. Big mistake.\n\nNormally when I pay more for a pedicure I EXPECT to get what I paid for, especially because in addition to that I am leaving a tip (I refuse to stiff anyone, no matter what). The deluxe pedi is your basic pedicure (soak, nail\/cuticle trim, callous removal, lotion and polish) but ALSO includes a sugar scrub, hot wax, hot towel, plus an extra long massage.\n\nNow...let me digress here for a moment..... It is just me, or are all these Asian owned day spas skimping on every last little thing these days? Rushing through and not doing a good job?\n\nSo there is that. Even with a basic pedi all the pedis I've been getting are rushed and pretty terrible. So much so that I can do a better job at home (and I usually choose that--because why pay for bad service?)\n\nBut with the Deluxe I was expecting to get more. So what I got was the rushed pedicure, a 30 second sugar scrub on each leg, and some really scalding hot wax in a slippery, cheap plastic bag. I couldn't move my feet because I had to hold them *just so* so they wouldn't spill out everywhere, which prevented me from fully relaxing. Part of the massage was a few rocks rubbed over my shins for about 2 minutes. Seriously? And then The hot towel was literally 30 seconds--just long enough to wipe off the wax.\n\nThe lotion rub was woefully pitiful. Weak hands, no passion or care. Just of the crummy  run of the mill pedicure factory variety. Each leg got about 1.5 to 2 minutes.\n\nIT SUCKED.\n\nI am rich. I have the money for these things. I shouldn't have to drive 15-20 miles for better services and better care. I'd seriously do this twice a month +tips if the pedis were better.\n\nBut I won't. I will never go back for those services from those people, and in general I just won't go anywhere anymore, because all of these people are so used to us by now that they all don't seem to give a shit anymore.\n\nLook---we can all do our own at-home pedis, What we are paying for is SERVICE. \n\nSTEP UP YOUR GAME or I won't return. And if someone knows a better place in Laveen, or nearby, please drop me a line!
499	0	d	This place has some of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The new york skyhigh and the sam and emmas were soooooo amazing. Great prices and the best food we had the whole vegas trip
500	1	d	I popped in to this location for a coffee meeting today and absolutely loved it! Their patio is quaint and hip, fully equipped with misters for the warmer months! I LOVE their cold brew. It gives you the perfect caffeine buzz to kickstart a busy day! I will most definitely be back again to get some work done and \"sip\" on their delicious coffee!
501	1	d	Considering this is Vegas and it is the buffet capital of the world, I came into Yama Sushi with the bar set a little higher than usual.\n\nWe went with the AYCE dinner of course and I went straight to the good stuff on the menu. I was a little disappointed...\n\nOnly 1 uni per person...\nOnly 1 soft shell crab per person...\n\n*Sigh* Makes sense cause I would of dined on that the whole night. Oh well, I'll go with one of each then. \n\nThe waitress tells me that they are out of those items... WTF \n\nSo, I ended trying the salmon sashimi and mackerel sashimi along with a bunch of their rolls. The salmon was good, you can't really go wrong with that, but the mackerel was a little dry and not fatty at all.\n\nIf you are a fan of rolls with cream cheese or fried tempura then you will like Yama. But if you just like plain old fish then I will say no.\n\nAnd don't let the door hit your ass on the way out... seriously, the floor is slippery as f*&k for some reason, so watch your step as you walk out.
502	1	d	Tshirts and happy hours together!!!\n\nLocated in Town Square, this Business is one of those two tone or two ideas rolled into one. Retail and Restaurant rolled into one symbiotic relationship.\n\nI'll start by saying Australia does have Tommy Bahamas, but to tell the truth you would never really know they were there. Most are located in very high volume tourist areas that locals never swing by. So my general experiences have been from this location.\n\nStrolling through the retail section I would say that maybe some of the gear isn't in my age bracket just yet. That's not to say older fashion beach and boating wear isn't cool. \"Bow ties are cool\" so who am I to judge.\n\nNow for the few happy hours that I been to here. Id like to say I was impressed with the menu and range they had. Sitting out on the patio we grabbed the sliders, seafood tacos\nAnd a Mai Tai.\n\nAll were great, the sliders had a great tasting  bun which I was informed was Hawaiian bread. The tacos had a slight spice kick to them with half decent Mai tai that to be honest didn't really hit the mark.\n\nThe service wasn't too bad, seating and the server both were prompt delivering dishes and clearing tables with smile. High chairs and a kids menu are also provided but the menu is full of deep fried stuff which I'm not a huge fan of..\n\nOverall\nDrinks: 2-5\nFood: 3-5\nService: 4-5\nBack again: yeah maybe I'll stop by, but there is a few other places Id go to first in town square
503	1	d	#HotSteamyBuns It almost sells itself, right?\n\nI don't get into the whole \"Asian fusion\" thing all that much. It's not that I don't dig Asian food, I just find myself spending my calorie budget on more Euro-centric cuisine. I'm a schnitzel and gerkensalat guy, what can I say? So when the other half scored a Groupon for a pair of steam buns and a drinks at this here joint in Lakewood, it gave me an excuse to step outside of my comfort zone for just a little while.\n\nThe place has a pretty minimalist feel to it. Black and grey tables with chalkboard tops (and plenty of chalk nubs for doodling), a small bar in the front, local art on the walls. The high ceilings and big windows up front give the main dining room a nice airy and open feel to it. Great for snapping pictures, too. We arrived sometime around 5:30 on a Wednesday and we were the first customers. We eat with the \"earlybird special\" crowd and we like it that way. We were shown to a table by the front windows. Perfect. Others have complained that it's loud. Maybe later and on the weekends, but we'll never know.\n\nIn a nutshell, it's about Asian comfort food here, all done up with a slightly new-world, local bistro spin. Rice bowls loaded with fresh veggies, tender meat, and more umami than any person should shove in their face alongside familiar dishes with names like Pad Thai, Kung Pao and Ramen. They've got sushi, fried rice and interesting items like Wagyu Bibimbap, Short Ribs Gyudon, and Moo Shu duck. Everything's described in detail to help with your selection if you're not all that versed in the Asian vernacular and everything sounds yummy.\n\nOh yeah, and steam buns. You've gotta get some steam buns. These sticky, white, cloud-like, conveyances are stuffed with all sorts of tasty goodies and they're delicious. You get a pair of them for around $8 served with a side of sweet\/sour cabbage slaw. The menu reads as a treatise on Asian classics. Be forewarned, everything we had (except the dessert) had some level of heat. If you're sensitive to this ask your server before you order anything.\n\nOn the drinks side of things, don't come here expecting to be blown away by a huge beer menu. Roxu is an Asian fusion restaurant, not an American gastropub. That being said, they do have four draught selections and a well-organized bottle list that I'm sure even the snobbiest of beer snobs will find adequate. Their beer prices are also a pleasant surprise, with most coming in around $5. Of course they've got sake, wine and cocktails if that's your thing. I remember seeing a sake flight on the menu for $9. I've never had sake, so maybe on my next visit I'll give it a go. My wife had some kind of specialty drink that was purple, had blackberries and blueberries in it and a sprig of mint. I don't recall what it was, but she enjoyed it.\n\nThe service we received during our visit was very good. Our server was helpful, although I could have done without the \"let me rest my chin on your table while I talk with you\" interaction. Why do servers feel the need to kneel down like that? Just makes me feel strange. Like I'm giving my order to a 6 year old. Anyway, he did a good job. Kept our waters filled, checked in often, all the usual good server behavior. He didn't really offer much info after we told him it was our first time, but not a huge deal. The important thing in this review is really the food. So...\n\nKung Pao Steam Bun - A little bight of heaven on a plate. Perfect level of heat, the cashew brittle is pure genius.\n\nGrass-Fed Beef Steam Bun - Tender, moist unctuousness. The hint of smoke from the onions and the drippy crema. Asian-inspired drunk food.\n\nSticky Duck Wings - Get these. Slathered in a sticky, sweet, sour glaze you'll be lapping off the plate, they pack a punch. The meaty drumsticks are perfect for sharing.\n\nShort Ribs Guydon Bowl - A rice bowl with balls. Tender strips of melt-in-your-mouth short rib, freshly sliced mild and slightly sweet shoshito peppers, and that house-made dashi. An umami bomb.\n\nApple Donut Bread Pudding - They had us at donut. A trio of ridiculously delicious bread pudding bites served with whipped cream, blueberries, vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzle. I expected more apples, but damn. Just damn.\n\nI was pretty blown away by the food we had here at Roxu. It's rare that I take a bite and immediately know I'm in for an experience. Everything we had was immensely flavorful, incredibly fresh and prepared with a level of detail that's rare in restaurants at their price point. If you've got a typically dumbed down American palate it just might be too much for you. One bight of a Kung Pao steam bun and your head'll probably explode Jet style. Not to worry, though, Roxu is approachable, too. They've got dishes that'll gently lead you into their world along with dishes for the more initiated. Sure, I could have nit-picked my way down to a 4-star rating, but even I'm not that much of an asshole.
504	0	d	The setting could not be more perfect - an sweet outdoor patio with a glimpse inside of a small rustic interior, the entire operation carefully orchestrated by the chef\/owner Christopher. We had a delightful brunch, felt we could be in Provence, and ate the most wonderful and interesting food. It was a sort of quiche but lighter and taller, filled with sausage and topped with a delicate sprinkling of cheese. A beautiful green salsa sauce well placed to the side and some divine-ish asparagus, artichokes and mushrooms to the other side, made the symphony of flavors complete. Our second visit to Cafe Monarch was just as wonderful as visit #1 for a Saturday lunch.  Now, we are delightfully planning our first evening visit to enjoy the 3-course dinner and showcase this gem to our visitors from CT in late April.
505	0	d	I have been taking my dogs here for the past 4 years.  I have taken my dogs to Camp Bow Wow in Peoria, Las Vegas, San Clemente, Anaheim, Agoura Hills---I can honestly say that Avondale is by far the best.  I am crazy about my dogs and they seem to take a genuine interest in them.  My dogs seem to enjoy their time there as well.  Another thing I like about this place is a lot of people that work there have been there for years.  I think that says a lot about how the place is run.  I highly recommend.
506	1	d	Yahhoo! I found a new place for getting pedicures or pedis as we self indulgent people call them.   I was uber impressed with this nail salon . \nI wasn't able to get in right away at my usual place so I ventured in here after doing errand ..okay I wasn't doing important errands, I was shopping for fun and getting massage... okay glad I got the truth out there.  Anywho ..this place rocked !!! \nIt was super clean , low on tacky plastic decor,  in fact  they only had fake plants no strange vases or wall hangings.\nI was amazed at the very nice receptionist hostess who acted like she really cared ..wow nice touch .. she even came over to check on clients during their time there ..very unusual... \n All the nail people  wore black outfits that caused a more professional look  to the place. They had  great  massage chairs and of course current gossip mags to peruse.  \n\nPrice was reasonable too. \n\nBest reason  though ...super long enjoyable  leg massage... wow this gal went all out I about fell asleep in the chair. I noticed that all of the techs  gave very nice foot \/ leg rubs  that were deeper than some places.  \n\nYou can  count on me coming back!!
507	0	d	I moved down to the Mesa and quickly found Carl is second to none when it comes to servicing my bike. Prices beat the competition, and the work done is top notch. Also, your bike won't spend much time in the shop. Look forward to bringing my bikes in any time I need work done.
508	0	d	Got a pup and I'm completely in love !! This shelter looked a lot more cared for than others ! Beth was a rockstar and helped me out with all my questions and concerns!! Thank you all!!
509	0	d	I only give Ashley nails 2 stars because of their great prices and the convenient location. The salon is clean, but I don't like the set up - it's sad and outdated. The girls aren't very friendly - just very straightforward. They don't conversate even if you try.. When my friend and I went in to get gel manicures, they seperated us. We were supposed to sit together since we had appointments together. My friend had to sit and wait for 15 minutes before someone got to her and I felt like they rushed through my manicure. It's not my fault they got 3 random walk ins that were waiting to get their toes done - I'm a customer too and should be treated with just as much care. I have very short nails as it is and told the woman that I didn't want them cut, only filed - sure enough she cut my nails and made my thumb bleed. I probably won't be back. You get what you pay for I guess.
510	0	d	I think I'm a regular if I come in once a week & they know how spicy I want my food right? They are AWESOME! The food is so delicious & everyone is extremely friendly & hospitable! Really cute atmosphere & they're open pretty late! I love his place! \n\nFavorite things I order:\nShrimp pad Thai level 8-9 \nYellow chicken curry level 7-8 \nSeafood fried rice \nMongolian beef
511	0	d	outstanding! i loved everything about this show. it was my first cirque show and i was beyond impressed! the acrobatics, the dancing, the music, it left me loving the beatles even more than before. the stage is round so there really isn't a bad seat, no matter where you are you can see everything. the show was just fantastic!
512	1	d	Worst Cirque du Soleil show I've ever seen. I saw mixed reviews and gave it a shot hoping it'd still be a good show, but it was just very disappointing. The decor and stage were absolutely beautiful, however the story and performance fell flat. There was no story, everything seemed random and the acrobatics were of a beginner's level. The acts were so boring, I almost fell asleep. The performers made so many mistakes and it seems like they use this show as a practice show. Don't waste your money.
513	1	d	Where do i begin on this!! The deep dish pizza here is AMAZING! I haven't actually had the real thing but this pizza here.... Let me tell you its freaking amazing! The toppings.... the crust.. the sauce and the SIZE! Literally could have died and went to heaven right after eating a slice! I made the mistake of getting a small since I had eaten before, but definitely won't make that mistake again! Make the most custom pizzas and layer that bad boy up with toppings and free sauce... It's almost too good to be true! \n\nThe only downside... It's quite far :( Although I will definitely come back here! Since I LOVE pizza!
514	1	d	Ugh!!!! Terrible service!!!! An hour wait...it's not packed.. Brought the food out without any utensils...get the utensils five minutes later. They acted like we were bothering them! Messed up two of the four orders! Food is swimming in oil. Yick. I know it's Denny's and not  Ruth Chris' but dang!!!
515	1	d	My friend and I were on a mission. The plan was perfect. Grab Fat Tuesdays then meander to the Cosmopolitan, where Secret Pizza is located. It made for a wonderful almost-drunk adventure. I had been here once before (many years ago) but I think back then I was too wasted to remember where it was. Actually, it's pretty easy to find, though describing the exact location in my Yelp review seems to defy the whole point of visiting Secret Pizza, so I won't divulge.\n\nThe staff who works here are super nice for people who have to deal with drunk hungry people all the time. Well, that's my assumption, but we were here on a Monday night so perhaps the crowd was more time. I ordered two slides, one of the white pizza and the other with pepperoni and mushrooms. It was too much for me to eat, but I knew one slide would be too little. I was satisfied by the hot and fresh pizza nevertheless! So glad that my friend and I decided to come here. Such a simple meal and a must-try in Vegas.
516	0	d	I've eaten at the Keg many, many times (various locations across the country) and have never been disappointed.  Service and food are always consistent, and this is why you choose the Keg, because you know what to expect. \n\nHowever, I had a business lunch here yesterday (I've been to this location frequently as well) that far exceeded expectations. \n\nThe staff was very \"on\" that day, but our server Lynette specifically was fantastic.  She was bubbly and charming, came over the \"right\" amount of times, our orders were perfect with no mistakes, all while juggling a busy patio of customers.   \n\nWe truly did not want to go back to the office.   We left the restaurant smiling.  Job well done!
517	1	d	By far one of the best places to grace Las Vegas in a long time. I know that many people talk about the chefs on the Strip, but I purposely avoided that route for my friends bachelor party. At first, people were complaining about how we had to detour from the row of lights to go to dinner, but they quickly shut up after we began our gastronomical journey. \n\nAny special occasion can only be made better with a visit to Chef Marc's Parma. I was lucky enough to tag along with some Yelpers and have been hooked on this restaurant ever since. Call in advance and specify that you want to participate in a chef's table. For $50, a five course meal is a steal. An additional $20 more, there is an option for wine pairing. With a week notice, chef will be able to set up a marvelous spread. Long gone are the days where a chef tries to fill you up on bread and cheap ingredients. Chef even got upset that someone had given us bread. \n\nI had specified that one friend was allergic to pine nuts and melon. Another to pineapple, almonds, and does not eat pork. Chef said no problem and I was relieved. \n\nThis was my second chance to experience a meal from this creative genius. He started us off with some sliced prosciutto before our first course. We were in for a real treat when we found out that chef brought out the pizza oven on a Sunday night. Not only did we get a classic margherita but a walnut pesto pizza as well. This was a creative way around our friend's allergy. Then the second course came at us with no warning. A sampler platter of perfectly grilled octopus, shrimp, sausage, and red snapper surrounding a bed of apple salad tossed in a citrus dressing. Already, some were ready to admit that the drive was worth it. Now slowing down, Chef came out again to explain what he had in store for us. Two words: LOBSTER RAVIOLIS! That was our pasta course. The al dente stuffed goodness was filled with the crustacean and came with a marscapone cream sauce. For many, it could have ended here and we would have received a meal worthy of $50. An Italian meal without a protein? Unheard of. Stepping outside of the box to provide us with a truly unique experience, we were presented with Veal Cheek served on polenta with German red cabbage. The meat was so tender that you could cut it with a fork. The sauce was similar to an Osso Bucco sauce. Each component complimented each other so well. By this time we were all stuffed. Yet it did not end there. For dessert, chef sent out a french toast served with fresh bananas and berries topped with a Marsala wine sauce. Ambrosial! Still not enough? The groom to be and I had opted for the wine pairing. I had attended a wine tasting some time ago and came across a beautiful dessert wine that I had nearly forgot about until I took a sip here. Although our waiter prefaced that the wine didn't go with the dessert, I was happy to taste the Donald Ziraldo dessert wine again. \n\nAt this point, I could not hold it in any longer and had to gloat. BOOYAH! All of the skeptics could eat it, because this meal was sensational.
518	1	d	I'm not super impressed by this place so far from a strictly administrative perspective - I'm not going to talk about doctors, because there are so many and patient experience will vary.\n\nFirst, we were told to arrive at a certain time. We did, and registered, then waited nearly an hour. When we asked, we were told that the appointment was actually two hours later. A 1:00 pm appointment, which we were on time for, was actually scheduled for 3:00. Since we had another appointment with the doctor at 3:00, this caused a bit of stress. Turns out, the appointments were scheduled and rescheduled without letting us know what was going on. We drove more than five hours to get here - a heads up would've been nice. \n\nAfter two hours, that first appointment was taken care of and the other doctor said that he'd wait for us. We waited an additional two hours to see that doctor.  That's after we had to hunt down receptionists just to register.\n\nThis is all with an appointment, mind you. I get some delays, but keeping patients informed is an important aspect of patient care: so many decisions are taken away when you're ill; it's important to continuously communicate to reduce stress.\n\nIf it were just us, I'd write it off as a fluke, but in the four hours I've been sitting here (and counting) I've watched other patients come and go, many with the same complaint: why didn't you tell us X? Why didn't you tell is Y? Why didn't you talk to us? Why didn't you tell us what's going on?\n\nOn the plus side, they have flat rate valet parking ($5) which is one less worry! And the therapy dogs that routinely travel around the building provide some much needed stress relief.  The free WiFi is also a great touch.
519	0	d	They were awesome!!! Got a 1 hr massage and a reflexology foot massage. Best massage I have had in a losing time. Perfect way to end the trip. Don't be thrown off by location... I was sketchy for a second but the manager and staff were great and we were very comfortable. Did not seem like \"one of those\" places. Thumbs up. They even drove us to the airport after our services. Two thumbs up. Worth every penny!!!
520	0	d	Great food, great staff and a real taste of Chicago. Here you can get the real green relish and great Italian beef at realistic prices.  The place reminds me of the small hot dog shops in Chicago in the 1950's. \n\nThe hotdogs are Vienna and the Polish Sausages are of the highest quality. Service is limited, place your order and pick it up at the counter. \n\nDrive thru service is very efficient and the only problem is making a left turn onto Glendale.
521	0	d	I have never written a review before but today i feel its necessary!\n\nI scheduled an ultimate detoxifier spa treatment at Tula for $115 + Tax - expecting to leave fully relaxed after a 90 min session- i left pissed off 30 minutes EARLY. \n\n1) They didn't have me on schedule and made my treatment start 30 min LATE - even through i called two hours earlier to confirm the time. I arrived 5 mins early to be told i had to wait 30 min.\n\n2) The room was not very hygienic\n\n3) The lady rushed through the service - the sea salt scrub was fine- not a lot of coverage with the seaweed wrap - and the lymphatic drainage was uncomfortable \n\n4) i was supposed to have a scalp massage while the sea weed wrap dried - that didn't happen - the lady just left me there for 20 mins\n\n5) The shower was disgusting- not private- people coming in and out using the toilet etc\n\n6) By the end of it i looked at the clock and it had only been 60 mins NOT 90 mins. \n\n7) When i went to the front desk and ask them what happened they said it was because they were behind schedule and had an appointment after me. The owner was there and said nothing!!!! HORRIBLE customer service- not even a discount!!!! \n\n8) I am very disappointed with Tula and i DO NOT recommend going there for ANY spa services EVER. \n\nI planned to relax and now i just feel cheated.
522	0	d	I'm new to the area, and that has fast become one of my favorite places for lunch! They have salads and sandwiches, all fresh, and all gorgeous in presentation. You order at the front, and then your food is delivered to the outdoor patio. Love love live!
523	1	d	This place is awesome! It is tucked away in the Specialty Shops SouthPark. It is super easy to find, but the center has maps on site just in case. The shop appears to sell custom cakes (which I will probably be buying in the future), but my review is based on experience in the cafe. The decor is adorable and perfectly Instagrammable. It is a Francophile's dream in terms of decor and pastry selections. I got a chocolate eclair and a caramel latte. They have great espresso drinks and several milks to choose from. The chocolate eclair was AMAZING! I mean, absolutely delicious and high quality. The flavor is complex and not just your typical display case offering. I highly recommend and I will probably end up being a regular here now that my new office is next door :)
524	1	d	I'm going to try to post this review yet again. For some reason, it keeps getting deleted as a fake review. REALLY????\n\nYes, I posted that I was contacted by Dr. Caniglia's attorney when I expressed my extreme disappointment with my results and I threatened to post before and after pictures on social media. It is a FACT!!!! It is also a FACT that I felt intimidated. My family had NO IDEA I had surgery. I didn't volunteer that I was having surgery but I expected them to notice. I'm not surprised that they didn't!!!!\n\nI asked his staff member, \"Would Dr. Caniglia post my before and after pictures in an effort to gain more business?\" She hesitated and I repeated myself several times!! She finally answered, \"No.\" Damn right he won't and I don't blame him!!! He would be a fool to post MY before and after pictures!!! BIG FAIL!!!!\n\nGo ahead and delete this posting again claiming it is not a real experience despite the fact that you KNOW it is!! I'll ask you personally, Dr. Caniglia, would you post my before and after results in an attempt to get more business?? I'm certain you won't for OBVIOUS reasons!!! If you do, I want to see them prior to being posted so I know they aren't photo shopped!!\n\nYes, years later I am still VERY disgusted!! I have to look in the mirror every day, with my bank balance THOUSANDS of dollars less and know that I wasted my money!!! You advised me how risky it is to have the surgery done again, so I guess I'm stuck with YOUR results for LIFE!!!! I'm PISSED OFF!!!! I asked you for a refund since you advised me that it is too risky to do surgery again to get the results YOU FAILED to provide. You refused my request for a refund!!!! How DARE YOU do this to me and refuse to refund me for your FAIL!!!!\n\nI'll assume your attorney will contact me again and CITE ADDITIONAL CASES where people had judgments against them for EXTREME and OUTRAGEOUS amounts of money for complaining about their plastic surgery results..... I'm NOT intimidated anymore!!!
525	0	d	I posted on Facebook suggestions for lunch in the North Hills and someone recommended this place to me.  It looked like it had easy enough access for me, so I decided to check it out.  I was craving a healthy-but-salty (oxymoron, right?) salad but changed my mind when I checked out the menu.\n\nIt's an average sized place with a counter that you walk up to and order from.  You pay, sit, and they bring your food to you.  It is BYO which is nice but not traditional as the place doesn't really seem to \"fit\" a BYO restaurant in the vibe or menu (it's a deli essentially).\n\nI ordered the white cheddar mac and cheese because it had an entire section on the menu for it so I figured it would be good.  I also ordered the Motmot wrap which had turkey, bacon, some tomato aioli.   I also got a foundtain drink.  It ended up at about $15 which seemed a little high for a lunch.\n\nThe service was quick which is nice for a workday lunch.  \n\nThe (side order) of mac and cheese?  It was really good and could be a meal in itself.  The bowl was put under a broiler to make it a little crispy.  The noodles were slightly overcooked which I do not prefer in  mac and cheese but the star of the dish was, of course, the cheese.  Thick cheese sauce that I knew was hearty after three bites.  Very cheddary--not too sharp.  It was more like a glue than a sauce.\n\nThe wrap came with chips and was served warm which I was not expecting.  Too much aioli--this is common at restaurants anywhere, but I don't think a sandwhich needs to be dripping in dressing, especially since this was nothing special.  The turkey was nice and thinly sliced.  The bacon felt more like bacon bits than chopped bacon or even slices of bacon.  The turkey was fresh.  I only had a few chips.  I couldn't tell if they were house made or otherwise.  \n\nI went back after my three bites of mac and cheese for more.  Outside of the noodles being overcooked, that dish is really something special.  \n\nI would go back to try something else, just not a wrap because I think for the cost it's lacking in execution and flavor.
526	1	d	Everyone loves the 'Ho.  And why wouldnt we?  Past reviews say it all...\n\nValley Ho is a total scene.  If youre not comfortable with yourself, dont dare to venture here, youre bound to be slitting your wrists before happy hour.  Its my own insecurity that gives this place 4 of 5 stars I'm sure...  Beautiful people line this trendy pool--many Scottsdale residents in for birthday pool parties and a close-to-the-bar room to stumble home to.  \n\nRooms are spacious and modern, flat screen TVs, bold colors, very shiek.  We got food from whatever bar is at the hotel but were too drunk to remember eating or paying for it so I wont review that aspect.  Just know that munchies are available, plus drinks, although I'm not sure why you wouldnt bring your own.  A room poolside is definitely the way to go.  \n\nCrunch out a few situps and jog over to the Valley Ho...hundreds of Ho-goers each weekend cant be wrong.
527	0	d	I have purchased 3 bikes from this store from my children and they've all been great investments. The bikes are all quality - so much better than what you can get at a toy store. Their exchange program is also awesome as your kids grow - you can return a too small bike for credit towards a new one. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We will always purchase our bikes from here.
528	1	d	The food is delicious and that's the only reason I'm giving them a three star review. Once upon a time, my husband and I used to love coming here. As usual I ordered the salt and pepper fried pork, salt and pepper calamari, seafood tofu soup and shrimp fried rice. The food was just absolutely delicious. Everything seasoned just right. Now the service was just horrible. I've given them a two star review before for the same reason. But back then I thought just maybe we should give them another try. When we did ended up coming back, the service had changed. Their customer service was back on point. But after our show tonight we decided we wanted some Chinese food and  decided on here.  The staff looked tired and agitated. No greeting, no smile. When we ordered our food, the waitress seemed unhappy. We had to ask a waitress twice for my husband's drink. It was an unpleasant experience. I don't think we'll be going back again.
529	0	d	This is without a doubt the hottest show on the strip.  It is 21st century hot dance, topless and amazing.  It it the top of the line in entertainment.  Totally a must see n Las Vegas.  Never a dull moment.  Amazing dancers.  The entire show was absolutely amazing.
530	0	d	I've gone to Filiberto's for awhile since there's not much to choose from out here.  Today I experienced the absolute worst customer service and am inclined to never return.  The food itself is average at best, and not overly cheap compared to other fast food Mexican.  \nAnyway today I went in and order an Arizona burrito WITHOUT PICO DE GALLO.  I made this very clear by repeating the without pico de gallo several times because I extremely dislike the taste.  Sure enough they messed up my order anyways and I didn't discover this until I was home.  I figured it was a close enough drive to go back and ask for a new burrito.  The manager refused to remake my burrito without a receipt.  I can see some reasons why they wouldn't but I was there less then 10 minutes ago, they were the ones who messed up, and the worker recognized me.  From my experience in customer service I know when I mess up and a customer has to drive back because of it, I do whatever I can to fix the problem.  In a fit of rage (I was already having a bad day) I drove back and brought the burrito and receipt with me to get a refund.  They offered to remake my burrito, but at this point I just wanted my money back from this pitiful establishment.\nTL;DR: Average food at average prices, poor customer service, don't order something with extras or they'll mess it up (this wasn't the first time!)
531	0	d	Never had any issues here. Our vet has always had ours and the kids best interest in mind. They do get busy so plan in advance. We will continue to visit here as long as our vet is here.
532	0	d	First time to the poet cafe. I heard that they do a great sandwich during the week and recently added Sunday brunch so I decided to try it out for brunch.\nThe deco was very nice. Not a big place but not too busy probably because they just started having Sunday brunch. For brunch it is a fixed menu, 6 little starters and choice of eggs also including tea or coffee. \nThere are different kind of omelettes and egg styles to choose from but it is the starters that are the most amazing. \nComes with hot pita bread, Persian garden salad, walnut feta yogurt ball, rose jam, honey and butter, olives, cold cuts and pickles. \nI was quite full after the starters already. I didn't need the Persian sausage omelette I ordered. I heard that you can just have the starter without the eggs too. That's what I will do next time. \nDefinitely worth it for brunch and I will go back and also try the sandwiches for lunch too.
533	0	d	I took my mother for her 1st time visit. We were greeted in a friendly manner, the M.A and Dr. Banchik were great until we got to the Coordinator of the facility couldn't catch her name. When it came to having an option on how we were going to pay she told us Credit Care, which was fine; but she just logged in to the computer and not showing friendliness, customer service just walked out of the room. \nShe just said fill it out and submit it when finished and when we got the results she described in a plane manner what were our options. Im a huge person when it comes to Customer Service, just seems like she didn't want to there and have customers deal with themselves when it comes to making payment options with treatments. \n\n\nThank you for reaching out Mrs. Banchik and thank you for clarifying your concerns, privacy, among your clients appreciated.
534	1	d	I normally stop here for gas for my car and usually don't frequent their convenience store. Built on the site of the former King's restaurant that once stood here you can enter from Rt 60. However, the only way you can exit is on McKees Rocks Road which is also an entry point.\n\nThey seem to have better prices here for gas but it can become a bit of a hassle since most everyone is going for those prices. Their pumps are state of the art but it can be a headache finding a spot since you have to deal with the parked cars over by the convenience store. To top matters off part of McKees Rocks Road is under construction but it doesn't affect this location.\n\nGet go falls under the Giant Eagle umbrella so you can use your Advantage card rewards to lower the price if you have any. Otherwise they will knock $.03 off per gallon once you scan you Advantage card.\n\nAll forms of payment are accepted.
535	1	d	I would give this store ZERO stars.  I had stopped in last week to look for a new stroller.  I have a bigger heavier duty one, and needed to find a lightweight travel stroller for a trip I have next week.  \n\nLong and painful story short, when I arrived at the store (shopping with my 1yr old) There was only one other customer who had walked in at the same time.  That should have been a sign...big store and no customers.  We were both looking at strollers.  An employee came over to help me and showed me two different strollers.  I then told her she could help the other customer while I compared the strollers.  I wanted to see another stroller that also looked to fit what I was looking for, and asked the employee, and she said she would get me the other associate to help me.  The whole time the manager was sitting in his office on the computer and never offered to come and help.  \n\nThe other employee came over.  When I pointed to another lightweight stroller that I wanted to see that happened to be on the top shelf, she asked me if the other associate had told me of their policy.  No, she had not explained any policy to me or the other gentleman in the store looking also at strollers.  Well, if you want to look at, touch, or roll a stroller in this store you have to pay $25....thats right.  Put down a nonrefundable deposit on a stroller that will go towards the purchases of a stroller. Well my whole point of shopping in the store instead of on-line was to see if I liked the features of the strollers they had and if my diaper bag would fit in the bottom basket. I was not paying $25 to look at stroller.  I am not sure who came up with this policy...but  I cant imagine anyone paying to look or test drive a stroller.  I also felt discriminated against because the gentleman also looking at strollers was not told this policy...not sure if its because he was looking at more expensive models or if it was because he was a man? The associate said it was in response to people coming in and looking at strollers and then buying them online.  Here is an idea...have competitive pricing and price match...or have a warm and friendly staff who is willing to actually try to help your customers.  I was appalled and left.  The ironic thing is that you think the associates would have been eager to help one of the few customers shopping in this store.  Go to Babies R us or  Lovebug Baby.  You can look and touch and sample any stroller...
536	0	d	Well,. my boyfriend proposed to me on the gondola ride so I guess I have to give it 5 stars now!\n\nBeautiful hotel. I have been here many times but had only been on the gondola the last time.\n\nMy fiancé got us a private gondola and we enjoyed the 14 minute ride. the girl who was our gondolier sang beautifully! \n\nOverall, a bit pricey, but definitely worth it :)
537	0	d	I can't believe I was refused a glass of water here! And on a day where the temperature was 111°, no less. If I'm not mistaken, I believe Arizona has a law forbidding this. The guy behind the counter had the nerve to tell me they don't have water there. Really? I guess I'll be taking my yogurt craving business elsewhere. It didn't wow me, anyway.
538	1	d	I have avoided Raising Canes for so long. I ate at a location in Mississippi before and was severely disapponted.\n\nThis location has changed my opinion of the franchise. The portions were large and cooked well. The sauce was flavorful and the chicken was moist. The fries were crispy and salted to perfection. Only disappointment was the Texas toast, which was bland \n\nStill giving it only a 3 though, because it is pretty expensive for what you get.
539	1	d	As I drove down Detroit yesterday, I noticed some action in the old Niko's storefront.  It turns out a new restaurant has opened - Jammy Buggars.  I was reminded of the Family Guy episode where Peter rattles off a bunch of canceled Fox shows.  In this case, I was thinking \"Well good for them - that's a great location with a lot of history!  Niko's, Bar 2, Niko's, Route 6, Niko's...\"  I was actually excited to try the latest incarnation in this classic Lakewood venue, so we decided to try Jimmy Baggers for dinner.\n\nWhen we arrived at Sammy Hagars, we were first greeted at the door by two excited guests seated by the window who were raving about how the food was the best they had ever tasted.  Though caught a bit off guard, I figured that was a nice omen. We took a seat in the same booth we sat in when we tried Niko's last time, which felt suspiciously like the booth we sat in when we tried Route 6 a couple years back...  \n\nThe atmosphere hasn't changed much; It is simple, yet refined - contemporary yet classy.  If I had one suggestion it would be to turn up the music or turn down the lights - it's too clean and quiet to be a bar, but too bright and sterile to create the ambiance you would want for a romantic dinner.\n\nGiven the menu, I'm assuming the goal was to create a high-end gastropub kind of experience.  The menu is a good read; they offer all the traditional American pub fare with some interesting concepts and ingredients, along with a few house specialty entrees.  Comparisons to 56 West and Beer Engine aren't out of line - fundamentally, the restaurants are similar, sort of how Franklin sneakers are similar to Reebok Pumps or the 2011 Indians are similar to the 1991 Atlanta Braves.  But unlike those baseball teams, I didn't find much to get excited about when it came to game time. \n\nThe OMG burger (Swiss, mushrooms, onions) was gristly, underseasoned, and unevenly cooked.  The Pulled Pork Sliders were interesting, though I was underwhelmed by the potency of the pickled peppers and pineapple.  We also tried the \"Frenchy\" Fries (truffle oil, parmesan, parsley, garlic mayo).  I'm not going to comment on the French fries themselves, because I am beginning to think I might have too high of standards for this American staple, but I will say that the garlic mayo tasted like honey mustard and the chipotle ketchup tasted like French dressing.  Also, the signature chips they serve with the sandwiches could have been crispier and fresher.\n\nOverall, the service was good and the owner\/manager stopped by our table to greet us.  I would say the food was mediocre at best, and a bit pricey for the quality.  I guess I would consider giving Bruegger's Bagels another shot in the future just to see how things shake out - I mean, they did just open yesterday.  But before I go back, I would probably want to make another run at The Rocky River Brewing Company, 56 West, Beer Engine, The Pub, Pacers, Deagans...
540	1	d	My husband and I went to this place for our wedding anniversary today and we got a couples massage. The people at the front desk were very nice. The facility was clean and had a great soothing environment. The couples room had a nice setup. The therapists were also very nice and welcoming. My massage was good, except the pressure was very varied. I asked for medium pressure and sometimes I was wincing and sometimes it was very light. My husband asked for firm pressure and it wasn't firm enough so then he asked for firmer pressure but it still wasn't what he wanted. I think what bothered me the most was my husband had to use the restroom in the middle of the session and his therapist asked him if he \"couldn't just hold it?\" No! When you have to pee you have to pee. How are you supposed to enjoy the rest of your massage when your bladder is screaming at you that you need to pee. I just thought it was inconsiderate. My therapist finally told that therapist to just get him a robe so he could go. Duh. So she did and he did and the rest of the massage was okay.
541	0	d	My husband has flown Allegiant out of Minot ND 2 times this year, no problems. He has used their mobile phone app for check-in (electronic boarding pass) both times with no problem. On this 3rd flight with them, leaving tomorrow out of Billings MT, he was NOT able to check in with the app. He uninstalled it, reinstalled it, nada.  Grrrrr. Researched online and found it is extremely *buggy*. I ended up checking him in online and then emailed his boarding pass to him so he could print it at his office before leaving for the airport. This time he's using a puddle jumper to Billings, with one hour to spare between flights, so I hope that's not going to be an issue. We didn't book Allegiant for the price, but because the 3 major airlines in Billings didn't have schedules that would have worked with the puddle jumper flights to the tiny town he works in. Also, Allegiant allows you to buy super cheap insurance to change flights for any reason... something the other airlines don't offer (and which we used one time, easy-peasy).  However, if this doesn't go well this time around, I guess he'll be back to driving 2 hours in the snow to Williston, ND to fly Delta.  I'll update this review if things don't go as planned.
542	1	d	My stay at the Bellagio was nothing short of amazing. A fountain view with access to the Chairman's lounge is the only way I'll ever be able to go back to Vegas. The buffet? Not that great. Air quality in the casino? Awful. But macarons and coffee with a splash of Bailey's available when I need it, WORTH IT. Also, those slippers? Never wanted to take them off. The Chairman's lounge is so worth it, skipping the lines for registration and a limo to and from the airport. YES. \n\nThe real reason for my five stars--I started my period early. So I hadn't packed tampons. I call our VIP number:\n\nMe: Hi, I uh, have a weird question.\nLady: Yes, ma'am.\nMe: Well, I know sometimes at hotels if you forget your toothbrush or something they can bring you up one. \nLady: Yes.\nMe: Uh, you wouldn't happen to have any tampons would you?\nLady: Yes, ma'am. We can have those right up for you.\n\nAND IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES I had 6 (yes 6!!) tampons delivered to me in a cute little Bellagio gift bag. I also feel like they left me extra chocolates during turndown service that night which is always appreciated.
543	1	d	Another perspective occurred to me during my last trip to LAS. When I landed in Las Vegas, the Airport seemed bright, shiny, and timeless, similar to what I would soon experience on the Strip. Coming home, the Airport seemed worn and tired and I walked along to the Gate. The Boulevard of Broken Dreams? It's a good thing I don't gamble.....
544	1	d	Had lunch here while waiting for a tire change at Kal Tire right beside. Kal Tire customers enjoy a 10% discount here. The service was quite interesting. At first I was asked if I wanted a menu. Why, oh why would you ask me that? Do you think I have it memorized or I just came to chill? Well, the waitress passed the menu over somebody's head to me - poor girl enjoying her salad. Thirty seconds after she came up to me and asked if I was ready to order. No, I don't look like a speed reader. Obviously, I was on page one of the menu. Then the lady forgets about me for the next fifteen minutes - take your time reading slow boy.\n\nThe menu claims they have the best burgers in town. And their wraps are the best. And fish & chips too. And literally everything else. Looking at the past reviews I got myself a burger with a side of greek salad. The patty was a little burnt, and I wasn't impressed with the salad either. I finished my meal pretty quickly, and then I was waiting for the waitress to come up to me and give me the bill - I think that's what usually happens in restaurants, right? Well, after waiting for fifteen minutes I had to come up to the counter and just pay there without getting the bill. \n\nNext time I go to Kal Tire I'm taking five extra minutes to walk to McDonald's.
545	1	d	We decided to dine here on default. We wanted to try the original chopshop, but it was busy on a late Sunday afternoon.  I mean, the line was insane and I am not a patient person so we decided to go to the not-so busy Stingray.  Now, let me just tell you that I am very picky when it comes to sushi and any types of \"asian\" food since, well, i'm asian myself.  \n\nI decided to get the teriyaki beef bento box with tempura vegetables. I asked for the teriyaki to be put on the side and so without the teriyaki sauce, the beef itself was tough and bland.  But of course, if you drenched your beef and vegetables with the sauce, it would be amazing, right?\n\nThe salad and cucumber salad was pretty good, but again, it was drenched with different sauces so of course, it wasn't bad.  On to the tempura vegetables - it was good.  I like the batter that they use, but the tempura was not even warm.  What the?  It seemed like it was sitting in the kitchen for quite some time.  \n\nOur waitress was sweet, but I think that she should've been more attentive considering the fact that there was 2-4 customers in the restaurant other than our group.  We were waiting for quite some time to order, get our food, and get our bill.  I just didn't understand why the slow service with a few customers.\n\nThe bill came and it averaged about $15\/person.  Honestly, I would've been happier eating at Panda for $7\/person.
546	0	d	The first time I visited Jack's I was very impressed by the selection and quality of the food.  I had the Nova Scotia Platter, which is smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomato, onion, and a bagel.  It was awesome!\n\nHowever, the second time I visited, I had ordered the same Nova Scotia Platter online and I ended up having to wait at the restaurant (which was not very busy) while they made my order because they hadn't even started it by the time I arrived. Also, in the rush to get my order out, they left off the cream cheese in my order, which I didn't realize until I was back at home. Normally, something like that wouldn't bother me, but the cream cheese is what makes a lox and bagel so I was a little disappointed.  \n\nI'm going to chalk up my bad experience to the fact that the online ordering service is still new and they're working out the kinks still.  I'll be returning for sure... but maybe to dine in next time.
547	1	d	I heart Tim Hortons!\n\nI know they've opened a few in the States, but the ones in Canada are my favorite. The quality of their products are much better there.\n\nMy cousins and I are obsessed with the Iced Capp and Timbits. The first thing on our agenda once arriving to Toronto is to grab Tim Hortons. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but something about the Iced Capp keeps me coming back for more. That stuff is madd addicting.\n\nTheir Maple Dip donut is so flipping good. Especially when it comes out fresh. Prices are reasonable. Seating is available and employees were quick. \n\nI love this location because I can get my Iced Capp fix one more time before getting on the plane. I also appreciate that I can grab a bunch of goodies for family and friends, while waiting for my flight.
548	0	d	I lived in surprise for 10 years and that was my store. I had no issues with it, it was calm and relaxing\nThis is my first time going to another one besides the arrowhead a couple times. \n\nWow It was like black Friday on a Wednesday afternoon before dinner time. It was insane. I felt like there was nobody to help me and when they did they were so quick in and out and did not really have time to dedicate to me they were too busy talking and looking at other people. \n\nHaving extreme anxiety and panic attacks I don't think I'll be going back. I think I will drive out to surprise or even Glendale. Or even just shop online. I don't feel comfortable going into a store that is so crazy busy it's insane. I mean come on it's Wednesday at 4:30 and it looks like Christmas!!!! Not for me and I won't be back sadly cuz I love ulta :( \n\nPlus when I shop for make up I like undivided attention for me. They are very big investments and you want to make sure you're doing it right and have someone that's going to provide you with the education and help you need and not be distracted or rushy.
549	1	d	This place is awful. I called a few times to schedule an appointment and received spotty text responses from multiple numbers which was confusing. Finally made an appointment and drove the 45 mins up there (they failed to mention they moved to a new location that is very far) and no one is available to take me. I got a blank stare and was told it was silly of me to even show up because no one called me to confirm. It's been a week and no one has responded to reschedule for the package I already paid for. I reached out to the owner Kirin and have not received a response from her either. You guys suck and I'm sure the beta fish in the dirty water bottle on the counter hates you too.
550	1	d	Before I could write this review, I had to put on my pajamas with the elastic waist.I affectionately refer to these as my \"fat pants\" ,and break them out for special occasions. Truth be told, I overate tonight. I wanted to stop midway through my meal, but it was too damned good.\n\nI love all kinds of burgers! Sliders, turkey burgers, green chile burgers, and of course steak burgers. Freddy's has perfected the steak burger-sorry Steak n' Shake. I chose the Double Steakburger (California Style), which consisted of 2 patties,cheese, lettuce, tomato, and a thousand island sauce on a soft delicious bun ($7.29 for the combo). Wow! The burger was so juicy and tasty on it's own, I didn't even need anything else to go with it. \n\nHowever, the burger came with a pile of shoestring french fries that were seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly.I never eat all of my fries as I usually save my room for the burger and soft drink. Until now! I put those things down and took it as personal challenge to finish every last one. \n\nThen, my wife had to mention dessert. Hah? No way! Oh, OK! Did someone say PBC & B sundae? Vanilla custard , Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, banana, whipped cream & cherry-sounds good right? My wife and I split the mini sundae ($3.59), and it was plenty. But then again, I was full long before the sundae arrived.
551	1	d	Better than average, but nothing amazing here. The spa was tiny but the service was great. Decent gym, but no locker room. The pool area was clean and very colorful. The pool bar was lame.  3 outta 5 for me.
552	0	d	I ask my husband for one of these for my birthday every year.  The cake part comes in like 8 different flavors, but good old chocolate is my favorite.  The cake is moist and flavorful and dense, but somehow doesn't seem heavy or processed.  And it's not too sweet.  How do they manage that?\n\nBut the real kicker is the cream cheese frosting.  yes, my friends, this is what it's all about.  That thick, tangy, sweet, frosting all over that yummy, moist cake.  I think I may have to pick one up on the way home.
553	1	d	Frederick Law Olmsted designed Central Park and Prospect Park. \nHe also designed Grand Army Plaza, Fort Tryon, Morningside Park, Eastern Parkway... (heck, he coined the word \"parkway\"!) \n\nSo it was interesting to see an aesthetic I'd considered so \"New York\" pop up on my recent visit to Montreal.\n\nMontreal's namesake park is, like all the Olmsted creations I've had the pleasure of experiencing, a peaceful expanse that comes with the profound feeling that you're smack in the middle of a bustling city, but at the same time cleanly sealed off from it.  The park is basically a giant hill filled with gorgeous trees. It's a lot more interesting than any ol' tourist park, because it's an adventure in itself! You have to climb up a zigzag of stairs and mazes of roads and foresty paths to explore it (yay goal-oriented behavior).\n\nHiking up to Mont Royal's entrance on Rue Peel sucks. It's like a 40 degree incline; don't know how the McGill kids stand it. But once you enter the park, that peaceful feeling settles in. The stairs are staggered so it doesn't feel too bad.\n\nReserve 2-3 hours of your day to visit Mont Royal. All the signs on paths inside are useless, so leave yourself some time to get lost.\n \nIf you're visiting during daytime, the autumn leaves are BEAUTIFUL. If you're visiting close to evening - bring flashlights! There are barely any lights the higher up you go, and absolute darkness follows soon after dusk. We saw several intrepid Montrealers wearing headlights. \n\nNote that there isn't anything on the \"summit\" proper - you'll catch several lovely views of Montreal going up, but on the true summit there's nothing but a radio tower, plus a crown of trees obstructing any view outward.\n\nFor some reason, just below the summit, there's a gigantic lit-up Broadway-esque Christian cross, straight out of a sci-fi-horror film. It was terrifying.
554	1	d	I know, I keep doing updates for a place I said that I'm not crazy about, but as I keep saying, if I band I must see is playing at such a venue, I'll tolerate the surroundings. \n\nFair is fair; I'm adding one star to my previous review for the washroom attendant. I like having one there and don't mind throwing him a buck or two. It's a nice touch no matter what anyone says, and in this economy, if it helps someone pay their bills, so be it.  \n\nPerhaps they're trying to compete with Diesel. If so, my man needs the digital name tag. \n\nAnother star is due for the crack security team for tossing out two suspicious looking goomba\/yinzer\/caucasian-hip-hop-co-opter types who snuck in and were being obnoxious. \n\nOne does not throw hip-hop chops at a metal show. That is intolerable even if you bought a ticket. \n\nBut I gotta take one off for to the little blonde attention whore who kept jumping up and down in front of us and frantically hugging (tackling?) her friends while making sure she bumped into other attendees. She clearly had no interest in the bands aside from feeling the need to mock them and insisted on doing this stupid dance in which she shook as if she was on a Coney Island ride--again, right in front of us. She really wanted us to notice her for some reason. I guess heroin does that to people. Thankfully she left halfway through 3 Inches Of Blood's set. Her date is why I really wish guys would stop wearing hiphugger\/skinny\/girlie jeans. Not even my girlfriend wants to see male ass cleavage. Jesus. \n\nEh, I'll give 'em one back since parking was only 10 bucks tonight, which left us enough cash to get a quickie Vietnamese dinner across the street without missing the two headlining acts. \n\nAm I too kind a reviewer? \n\nP.S. Turns out  I got some more kindness in my back pocket for Altar. I REALLY appreciate how they allow you to come in and out after you present your tickets at the door as long as you let them wristband you. It's highly convenient if you arrive early and want to find some pre-gig nourishment since Altar serves no snacks inside.\n\nP.P.S. A large, green, inflatable ball kept bouncing around the crowd during Dethlehem's set. At first I thought it was a beach ball, then perhaps a faux boulder. After the set, I finally got a gander at it --it was a giant 20-sided gaming die. \"Ahhh,\" I said to myself once I caught a good glimpse of it. \n\nConsider the swords 'n axes lyrical grist of the night's bands. \n\nAhhh. You get it too. \n\nI was into D&D for a spell as a kid. Lay off.
555	0	d	I've driven by this place many many times but never went in until yesterday and I've been missing out all this time on amazing pizza! The aroma of the place screams home made and delicious and the pizza doesn't disappoint!\n\nMUST TRY THIS PLACE
556	1	d	I'm not sure if it was because I had survived a stressful week of midterms or the ambiance, but Chelsea's Kitchen was an excellent place to unwind. \n\nMy flight to LAX was delayed on a Saturday night, so my guy and I took advantage of the situation and parked ourselves here. \n\nWe shared the Chips, Salsa and Guacamole and an Oregon Pinot Noir. \n\nI'm a big fan of the original Chelsea's Kitchen and this location certainly did not disappoint - And going in, I had zero expectations given this is an airport. \n\nThe salsa was perfectly smokey, the guacamole as fresh as it could be. \n\nOur server even offered us additional chips to not leave any of that goodness behind, but we declined. \n\nGreat music, calming lighting, did not feel rushed at all, solid service all around. \n\nI'm not sure if it was the time we were there (after 7PM on a Saturday) but Chelsea's provided the right atmosphere to mellow out in between two stressful events!
557	0	d	seemingly effortless combination of upscale food with a british pub atmosphere. my first visit to liverpool house was a solo affair where i sat at the bar and made quick friends with fellow diners and the staff. i was offered good advice on wine and was made expert cocktails as well.
558	1	d	The owner Pauly is rude.  \n\nI work in an office close by and we received free delivery if over $15.00.  I ordered three lunch specials and got grief from him stating they are usually only used for large orders.  Well Pauly, don't put max of $15.00 on the delivery and be more specific.  He always rubs me the wrong way and comes off very rude.  I guess that's the New York type of guy that is RUDE!\n\nToday, my family came by my work to have lunch with me and so I called and preordered it for take out b\/c I wasn't sure if we were eating there or not or back at the office.  But after I took the order over the phone, my coworkers wanted to order out as well and I was going to pick it up for them.  So it ended up being a dine in instead of take out. So we got our food and I could hear the owner wasn't happy that I got take out and we ate in.  Saying that was a take in NOT a take out.  He is not a friendly person but obnoxious and arrogant! When I was walking out the door, I noticed that my coworkers pizza was placed in a bag with plates instead of a box to go like they always do. The owner doesn't clearly understand quality of his product. He just threw it in the bag to go.  Normally, they put the piece in a to go.  I took a picture  of it and it's my screen picture.  This is ridiculous and the owner can.......\n\nMorale of the story is Don't eat there.....  not a good person.  Never eating there again!!
559	0	d	I like the day spa feel of this salon. The technicians were really friendly and did a great job! I would definitely go back.
560	0	d	Bungalow is a great place to be on Sunday morning.  They have really cheap mimosas that are actually made with some okay sparkling wine.  You won't get the cheap mimosa hangover.  \n\nThe food is decent.  Nothing to write home about but not bad in any way.  I always end up getting the Kamikaze burger.  It comes with crusted fried avocado and a really spicy mayo.  Yum.\n\nThey have tons of outdoor seating, an outdoor bar counter, and misters.  Important in Arizona.  They also have televisions all over the place and during football season you can always catch a game on a Sunday.  If you don't like the teams on the set in front of you, you simply need to turn your head to another screen or find another seat.  Perfect.  Burgers, football, beer, and you don't have to clean up.
561	0	d	College students work here and it makes one wonder who's promoting the high ratings?  Was there the other night and was highly disappointed with the Pizza and the service.  The large pizza had maybe three small pieces of sausage and way too many grilled onions.  There was a 40 min. wait so they told us to wait at their bar next door.  It was happy hour and the menu said white wines for $5, so I ordered the house chardonnay.  When I got my bill it was $28 for two chardonnay's.  When I inquired about the price I was told that the Chardonnay was not on Happy Hour and even though the menu listed Chardonnay's from $8 to $14 they only stocked one wine which cost $14\/glass.  What trickery to make money.  They should have told me that the wines listed on their menu were not stocked.  Fraudulent practice.
562	0	d	What a great experience! I have never been anywhere like this before and loved it! We just had appetizers and they were standard appetizers our server was fantastic.
563	1	d	Came here to buy stuff for a prize at work. Staff was helpful in locating the items needed\n And they were friendly. They also have a salon on site. The shelves are well stocked, too.
564	1	d	* Sous chef needs a wake-up call *\n\nI really wanted to like this bistro.  It has all the markings of what could have been an excellent meal.  But sadly some of the little details that were not paid attention to (likely by a sous chef) left me with a less than enthusiastic reaction.\n\nThe ravioles d'agneau (lamb ravioli) with mushrooms and white truffle oil was a nice start.  The lamb filling was tender and had a good amount of lamb flavour, which balanced nicely with the mushrooms.  The truffle oil was not detectable though, and perhaps the sous chef forgot to apply it?  Overall a nice dish, even without the truffle oil.  Photo:  http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=jLu2DKP9ehtTBjaAmVvYrw\n\nThe dorade poêlée on salicorne and chanterelles was again a nice concept dish.  The salicorne were cooked perfectly, as were the chanterelles and combined to form a platform for the fish.  The fish was crisped nicely and had tender flesh.  But unfortunately that blasted sous chef forgot to remove all of the scales.  Boo.  So what could have been a really nice dish ended up having me have to descale it (I didn't have the heart to send it back - although in retrospect I probably should have).  Photo:  http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=CjvrmxiLIB-_9ZbWSY5Ijg and a soft-focus close-up of some of the scales left behind:  http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=jIGFE0-6VaFhLPUwM_Waiw Leaving scales on fish is truly sloppy and a real shame for what otherwise was a nice dish.  \n\nThey had a nice selection of cheeses on offer, and we ordered a plate with a variety of three (Photo:  http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=4eXptUoul87FaYu0ouybSg).  The Beemster Gouda (pictured on the far right) was the highlight.  It had a flavour that reminded me of salted caramel.  The plate came with a nice apricot confiture as well as some cranberry crisps (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=G0QbGoiCc9PVKAjnCX_wfg).  \n\nThe strawberry mousse was served on top of a layer of chocolate ganache with fresh strawberries on top.  The berries and the chocolate ganache were the highlight of this dish and the mousse was a bit flavourless (damn sous chef again?).  Photo:  http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=DMV2XoO3xCjswnK141b55g\n\nThe chocolate \"bouchon\" didn't strike me as a bouchon, but more of a ganache square.  It was served with a vanilla ice cream, a nice salted caramel, and topped with caramelized peanuts .  Photo:  http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=67IkWHYv20tCQZ2xj5EGGw This dish was a winner.  \n\nOverall there were some signs that this could be a great bistro.  But the lack of attention to detail was truly disappointing.  While I'm blaming the sous chef, in reality it is the head chef's fault for letting those dishes out of the kitchen, no?
565	0	d	Another great breakfast here, can't beat the service or food.  Daily specials and great comfortable seating booths
566	1	d	I'm not sure that anyone who's ever had a baby can ever fit into an Urban Outfitters shirt appropriately. Too low-cut and clingy. And the more forgiving shirts are too pricey. No thanks!\n\nI used to go to Urban Outfitters back in \"the day\"...like 10+ years ago. Back then I was sort of able to get stuff that looked okay. They had a bunch of Reality Bites-era dresses that looked cute paired with Doc Martens. Now it's sort of just like Anthropologie threw away their leftovers. Whatevs.
567	0	d	Let's say I'm a fan, but won't be back for a long time.\nAmbiance:  it's gorgeous, all the rage right now, exposed brick, cool light fixtures.  Pretty much like anywhere that's updating their interior.\n\nBar:  the craft cocktails are great, the tequila based Wandering was amazing, bartender knowledgeable\n\nDinner:  The problem I had here was it was hard to make a decision on the entree, none of the choices really popped out at me.  Maybe we are going at a weird time, April, but everything was still very winter vegetable based (squash, carrots, etc).  I wanted something more fresh.  I decided on the forest bowl which was amazing, the flavors and sauces really hit point, however it was $15 and there was no protein.  So this place is quite pricey!  My boyfriend had the trout, he commented \"it has a very earthy flavor\" which I exclaimed, of course it does, that's the whole point of this place!  Case in point, this place is what is proclaims to be:  an earthy feel, farm to table, restaurant.  Portions are not too shabby, prices are a tad high and ambiance was great!\n\nIf they change over to a summer menu, I'll be back!
568	1	d	Went in here early on a Saturday night to check out the new small location near the Aliante casino.  It is definitely more of a bakery and take out of limited classic Filipino dishes such as fresh lumpia (Filipino egg roll), dinuguan (specialty vinegar, blood, spices, and coconut with meat and innards), and pancit, a Filipino style pasta dish and others. \n\nThere are only two tables in the whole place.  Really we came in here only to get halo halo ($5) which means \"mix-mix\".  This is a crushed ice and milk dessert with preserved fruits (beans, corn, lanka, and kaong, and topped with ube (taro) ice cream. You mix it all up and use a long spoon to eat and drink.  You can go ghetto and drink it down like a soda.  It's gross that way because you'll end up slurping to get everything in your mouth. Little kids eating it this way lose some of it on their faces, some on their shirt, and some on the floor. \n\nI also bought a small pack of mini baked rice cakes ($5) - plain and ube. My brother also ordered the fresh lumpia ($4.50) which was a rice wrapper filled with sliced pork and fresh vegetables, and topped with a warm sauce.  It's made to look like a dripping burrito but unless you scrape off the sauce, use a knife and fork. Everything we ordered was good, but the other dishes in the cafeteria style eatery was really worn down by the end of the night.\n\nI like these smaller Goldilocks locations.  The large ones in CA are sit down places have terrible service.  Often, there is no host so you end up seating yourself anyway.  Here you order, then if you're lucky, you find your seat, then someone takes your order to your table. Simpler is sometimes way better.
569	0	d	5 stars!!!!  Yes!!!  I was sadden when I heard that Ruby was no longer there...and a bit skeptical of letting someone new do my pedicure but.......OMG....Ms Kim is the best!  I've been bk  twice (every 2 wks I go). I get the $35 pedi & it puts me to sleep. Relaxes me & actually it's better than what I've had before. She really takes her time. My feet are still smooth, and my polish hasn't chipped yet. \nI recommend this place!  She's such a sweet lady :)
570	1	d	Located just a few minutes from Upper Canada Mall in Newmarket is Chez Talal. Chez Talal is a great place to get delicious shawarma at a good price. The owner here seems very nice and is quite talkative with his customers. \n\nI ordered a chicken shawarma wrap ($7). The ingredients were fresh and the food was delicious. I would love to order the chicken shawarma dinner the next time I'm here since it includes a pita and a drink for just $10. Or maybe I would try the falafel. Either way I'll be returning next time I'm in the area.
571	1	d	Not so \"secret\" pizza! This place kept popping up on Yelp and after our friends were gambling in the Cosmo I suggested this joint for a quick bite. It's funny the workers mess with you and act like they really can't tell you where it is. \n\nI got a slice of the white pizza. Folded it in half. Sat by the pool tables outside. Ate a bite. Had a sip of beer. Transported to heaven. \n\nVegas baby
572	0	d	I like the variety of breakfast items. It's easy to give every one a choice of items and sizes of breakfast. I do like the protein pancakes. They're a whole grain pancake, with nuts, a little coconut?, blueberries, etc. I make them unhealthy with all the butter. They don't really need the syrup. Service is always pleasant and fast. They leave you with a carafe of coffee and a pitcher of water.
573	0	d	This is the most amazing veterinary clinic I have ever been too!!! Their biggest concern is the pets they see everyday, not the money that brings them here. My beautiful great dane ended up with an immune weakness that cause a rapid case of demodex mange, a rescue told me I only option was to put her down, I was referred here and Dr Jay Holt, has taken completely care of my baby girl. I would\/will definiely recommend this veterinary clinic to everyone! They are amazing!!!
574	1	d	Amazing!  In one word, that is how I would describe this show.  I have previously seen the Red Piano tour, but the only thing similar to that show is that famous chord, on his opening number of Benny and the Jets.  \n\nMDP is a return to music, music, music.  No inflatable boobs, no Pamela Anderson pole dancing (sorry guys), no big Bananas,  just some old gold Elton.  The highlight was when his piano and the whole stage became a screen for some really neat visual effects.  This was one pricey show but well worth the money!
575	1	d	Wow, a 24-hour White Castle!!\n\nIn hindsight, it was probably a bad time to visit during the night of the Gay Pride Parade!  It was more than packed!!  The line that night was literally out the door and it took us more than 20 minutes to reach the front of the line.  Ordering was OK, but our server was totally brand new (she was being shadowed closely) so it took her a bit to place our order in.  Waiting was another issue too, it took another 20 minutes to get two 4 White Castles with cheese combos!\n\nHonestly, I love the smell of onions simmering with beef & cheese.  But this certainly grossed the wifey out and made her a tad nauseous.  And the entire place was in onion heaven because of how many patrons were there, grills were filled to the limit!  A nice blanket of diced onions and tiny beef patties were a-cookin'.  \n\nPlace was a mess, especially the drink station which was covered in soda  everywhere.  This was mainly because all hands were on deck behind the counter, leaving no one to fend for the dining room area.  Many tables were unwiped and there was quite a bit of trash on the floor.  But ah, I came here for the fast food!  And uh...it kinda disappointed.\n\nMy White Castles with cheese were soggy & lukewarm!  Unfortunately the buns of my burgers were covered in excess grease, and I like grease!  But it left a film on the roof of my mouth that I had a hard time forgetting.  As expected, the meat was super thin, but my burgers were definitely on the overcooked side.  I got the onion flavor, but really had very little of the actual diced onions to show for it.  I love onions, pour em' on!  The cheese just added to the grease, ha ha!  Definitely had an issue with the temp of the food for sure - buns were not very hot & supple, and our fries were not fresh cooked.  I have no problem waiting 20 minutes for fast food, but it has to be hot!     \n\nWifey didn't have the greatest experience at White Castle, she only finished 2 of her burgers!  She couldn't get over the overpowering onion flavor and the cold fries. \n\nI'll hand it to White Castle though - they got it when catering to a certain crowd LOL, the line was full of hungry drunkards & stoners!  Yes, I know what excess booze & weed smells like.  Those folks were too happy to be eating tiny burgers, fries, and chicken rings!  Oh, don't even get me started on those...\n\nAm I the only one who thinks the coolest thing at White Castle are the automatic trash machines??  That was real fun to play around with.  Looks like it might have even compacted the trash too!\n\nWhite Castle, we might have to give you another try on another day.  Perhaps on a less crowded weekend?  I really wanna say that the 'fresh' ones from the restaurant beat the ones I get for the microwave at home.  But man..that is up for debate!          \n\nHarold, Kumar, Neil Patrick Harris...care to chime in???
576	0	d	Did a 60 min foot massage- just heavenly!  My feet hurt from recently moving and he turned them into butter and pain free. I highly recommend this place!!
577	1	d	Hispanics should stick to making hispanic food. Worst attempt at Medi food, ever. The girl at the counter comes off as super rude too, but I think she's just shy. I wish Shawarma Plus was still there. I just wasted 15 bucks. Oh, and I just got diarrhea from the food-
578	1	d	Absolutely terrible. Rude, dirty and poor quality. Nothing like putting a bad taste in your mouth. Today is now Sunday, September 31st. 2018. So in my post I mentioned how rude they were. I just received a private msg from them and this is what it said, \" I know who you are. Pay attention, because I know that u are very stupid\". So not only does that not make any sense, but it shows their character. Maybe next time they will not leave their dog bowls outside by the front door surrounded by bugs entering the store. GROSS. \n\nATTN: Management \/ BellaLinda \n\nPeople have different tastes and opinions is one thing, that I understand, and how not everyone is going to be 100% satisfied. That is the least of what bothered me. The rudeness was a totally different story. That is what really bothered me. Have I had better tasting gelato?, yes,,,, but right now this \"Giovani\" person is only making it worse because it is not like I know who works there or not. As far as the water bowls go, when we were there, there were roaches all around it. Anyway, Maybe.... \"GIOVANI\"...... can be \"REAL\" and understand how this site works
579	0	d	Wow, had to wait almost 20 mins for a hot sandwich and a minestrone soup to go. If I knew it would have been that long, I think I would have just gone home to make my own lunch.\n\nMy boyfriend got the hot beef sandwich. When we got home (not even 5 mins away) it was all soggy and falling apart. The sauce wasn't even on the sandwich yet. The beef was tasty, but nothing spectacular. It came with grapes, a pickle and a hot pepper. He got the sandwich on multi-grain bread which he was fairly disappointed with.\n\nI got a bowl of the minestrone soup (vegetarian). For one, I thought minestrone was supposed to have beans? I'm not crazy about beans, but I'd expect to see a few, especially it being vegetarian.. how do they expect you to get full? This soup was definitely mediocre. The noodles were extremely soggy and mushy! The bowl for $4.99 was more the size of a cup! I wonder how small the cup is..\n\nThe prices are outrageous. My boyfriend's hot sandwich, a bowl of minestrone and a iced black tea came out to $19!! Next time, I'm driving up the road to Go Raw Cafe for some better tasting\/fresh food, even if it is raw!\n\nThe interior decor looks sort of like a mediterranean restaurant. Had some cool looking paintings. But there were tons of shelves with nothing in them. The seating ranges from tiny tables for two, or couch seating for groups. There is also a bar looking area where their a worker making smoothies and drinks.\n\nOverall, not worth the wait or the price.
580	1	d	I decided to go to Circo, one of the few restaurants I hadn't been to at the Bellagio.  I had checked the menu online and was going to go with the pre-theatre prix fixe menu because I was going to see 'O' again at 7:30 and this would be perfect time wise.\n\nI was seated right after Circo opened.  The gentleman who showed me to the table brought me an iced tea and then I sat.  Shortly after, a runner brought me a nice bread basket, and then I sat.  After 15 minutes, as I watched people at other tables who came in after me looking over their menus, I turned to the woman who brought the bread and asked if there was a server for my table.  One of the servers heard me and the apologies started for thinking I already ordered because I had bread on my table.\n\nThe bread service is quite large with three varieites served with olive oil.\n\nMy server did come and brought a menu with him.  He noted some of the outstanding things on the menu.  I then asked if he had the pre-theatre menu.  Note, there was a large sign at the entrance to Circo with the menu and choices on it.  He brought me the menu and after a few minutes he came back and took my order.  He was also made aware that I had a show to get to.\n\nI ordered the fritto misto for a starter.  This is mostly calamari with a few green beans and zucchini added.  It's served with a cherry tomato sauce.  This was very good.  The sauce, not a traditional marinara, was very good.  I was surprised by the large portion for a pre-theatre menu.\n\nFor the main course, I got Mamma Egi's ravioli, ravioli filled with sheep's milk ricotta cheese, spinach, and swiss chard in a sage butter sauce.  The ravioli were topped with grated cheese and the server asked if I wanted more cheese and\/or freshly ground pepper.  I did take some ground pepper.  The ravioli were very, very good--the filling so smooth and tasty.  Again, I was surprised by the large portion size. \n\nFor dessert, I opted for the vanilla crème brûlée on the menu which wasn't the same choice as the online menu.  I had wanted to try the Nutella panna cotta but it was not to be.  With dessert, I was brought a dish with two chocolate biscotti and two mignardises, the best being a small meringue cookie.  The crème brûlée was good but nothing different than I've had before.\n\nService was off.  The check listed a team number rather than a server and the team just wasn't on that night.  Sitting for 15 minutes without a menu until I asked?  Aren't menus given to you when you're seated.  Evidently, Circo does this a different way.  \n\nWhen a restaurant advertises its pre-theatre on a large sign and on the website, it should be given to you when you get the regular menu.  Ordering from the pre-theatre menu doesn't make me less of a customer than those who order off the regular menu.  Before leaving, the main server asked me if I wanted more cookies and I politely declined.  As I was putting away my credit card and getting my charge slips together, another server came with a plate of those cookies.  I politely declined again.  \n\nFinally, I really dislike when a website has a menu and then it's different than the \"real\" one.  Crème brûlée is good, but I really wanted to experience that Nutella panna cotta.  If you're going to do an online menu, keep it up-to-date.\n\nThis would normally be a 4 star review if I was rating simply the food.  The service was off such that I can't give it the four stars.  There have been reports that Circo would be closing this spring.  If the reports are true, is the service a sign of lack of care in some respect?
581	1	d	Just going off Matthew M's review, this place is bout it bout it. There was a Master Pizza in Lakewood growing up. I always liked the logo. It is like an Italian dude in a cowboy stance popping his collar. One of my friend's thought it was great when we were kids. A friend at work said he would eat this pizza with his wife when she was going to doctor visits on the east side. We ate it for lunch today. It is Friday in lent so people didn't want to eat it because it has meat on it. So the cleaning lady just came by my cubilcle and offered the scraps! So happy about this! It is all mine! I will use this later after having a few beers so I don't get a hangover! Hooray for Master Pizza! I really think it deserves 3 stars. This is a situational review.
582	1	d	This place has sucked for years.  It was a sh!thole 20 years ago in the mid-90's but did the job for a late night slice after you've been at the bars. I haven't had this pizza in years - I have no idea how long - well over 10 years.  My current gripe with them is the constant flyers that used to appear on my gate each week.  They stopped for a while after I bitched to my Property Management that over-flyering was not necessary given that half of them would end up fallen off our front gates and blown around the grounds.  It was like the dorm with all this non-stop flyering. There's 180 units in my condo community ...they were flyering nearly EVERY WEEK, and a lot of the ground level condos have 3 gates (front patio, side patio, and back patio that's on the side of the building), and the idiot flyer guy can't figure out that a side gate, and\/or a back gate that doesn't have unit number above it, doesn't need a flyer, but some condos would often get flyers on two gates, and on some rare instances, all three gates had a flyer.  I did a rough estimate about how many flyers they were leaving in my condo community over a year ...it was well over 9,000 flyers a year.  Are you f'ing kidding me Gus' ? Finally the flyering stopped after I endlessly bitched to my HOA, but then the flyers resumed again a few months later.  Eventually, they stopped again about six months later and currently I haven't seen a Gus flyer in months.  \n\nHey Gus', we know where your crappy establishment exists if we need you, but I would NEVER order from this place based on polluting our condo community with weekly flyers ...and secondary to that, the hour+ wait time to get average pizza ...NEVER will I bother ordering from this place. It was a sh!thole in 1996 when I was in college, and it still is 20 years later.  The original location was a dump, but they moved over to the former Geno's cheesesteaks joint arond 2014, so I'm guessing the place is cleaning because that Geno's location was fairly clean and the interiors weren't the dump that Gus' old location was ...but guess what, I still will never order from this Sh!thole. Order from here if you wish, but your best bet is to grab a slice going in ...but don't waste your time waiting on a delivery when you're drunk late night ...just order from somewhere else and save yourself the aggravation.
583	0	d	I love this place! Best wings hands down, and by far the best price. It's around $15 for 24 wings..... you'll never find that anyplace else. The staff is great all of the girls work together to make sure everyone is taken care of!
584	1	d	I've never heard of this place but I've heard of the show. It's located inside the Venetian Hotel & Casino on the 2nd floor. I only came here because my wife begged to come. When I saw how long the line was, she had to do some more begging because I couldn't fathom waiting 45 minutes for a small dessert.\n\n   While standing in line I can over hear ladies conversations bragging about how much they've spent at Carlos bakery, $60, $75, $85 WOW! These things better taste pretty damn good. Some of these ladies had been here multiple times! \n\n   Once you finally get to the front of the line they will only let a few people go in at a time. Be ALERT know what you want, because you will get skipped or the person behind you is going to eat you alive. They write down your order, then at that point you wait (another 10 min) in one of 5 chairs for your name to be called so that you can pay. \n\nWTF?\n\n    Whatever happened to those bakery or panaderias where you walk up, pick what you want and some Mexican lady, with tongs, puts it in a bag and you go! This place makes you wait while they put your sweets in a fancy white box, with a ribbon tie and charge you up the wazoo! \"So that's where all the consumer money goes, into the packaging.\" \n\n    I ordered 2 small cannoli's, regular and chocolate. The large cannoli's are $4 while the mini cannoli's are $2.50. They were good, but to ME not out of this world good. Maybe it's all the anticipation built up that didn't live up to my expectations. If the line would have been way shorter and the sweets a little less expensive this rating probably would have been a 4 star.
585	0	d	Enjoyed a lazy St. Patrick's day lunch here and was not disappointed. Shared the Vegas Vices punch bowl (amazing\/dangerously delicious) and the Vegas fries (had to, huge fan of triple D show). Everything and everyone was great from the hostesses, to the music, to the bartenders, to the food.
586	0	d	Annette is AMAZING!!!! If I could give this place 10 stars I would!!!! Since I moved to Vegas I've been very skeptical of letting ANYONE touch my hair. Not only is she ridiculously reasonably priced I'm talking HALF of everyone else I called, my hair turned out BETTER than the picture I showed her!!!! She literally looked at the picture of what I wanted ONCE and gave me exactly what I wanted but even better. No one has ever been able to do that for me being that my hair is extremely extremely thick and curly. Usually when I go to a salon they have no idea how to do my hair and charge my 3x what they'd change someone with \"normal\" hair. This is the first time in my life I've been this satisfied with a hair stylist. Thank you Annette!!!!
587	0	d	Life Changing.....\n\nI have jumped around from gym to gym over the years and never really had any REAL physical success.  Probably wasted A LOT of money.  Then I was introduced to crossfit.  I had tried a local box a few years ago and hurt my back the 3rd week into it.  This crossift box has a 10 session one-on-one \"foundations\" course that teaches the basic movements and gets you up to speed on the crossfit \"lingo\".  Most importantly while working through the foundations program, technique and FORM are stressed to prevent injuries.\n\nI have been consistently attending 3x per week since March 2014 and have NEVER seen changes like I've experienced to my physique and well being in my 45 years of walking the planet.  Crossfit is INFECTIOUS and extremely effective.\n\nI have had the pleasure of dropping into a few boxes in other States and while they are all staffed with nice and qualified coaches, our box, Power In Motion, is THE NICEST, WELL EQUIPPED, SPACIOUS and WELL COACHED facility that I have seen.\n\nHats off to Josh and his team for what they've created at POWER IN MOTION.  I can't wait to see my results 6 months from now.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend that you at least look into becoming a member at POWER IN MOTION!!
588	1	d	Rustic Cosmo, predating the current wave of gentrification in the area as prompted by the Drake Nexus, has been a Parkdale fixture since the 90's.  Back in them days, as the old timers tell it, Queen Street west of Dufferin was a dangerous, untamed Killzone where newly arrived immigrants bravely eked out a perilous living amongst mutant crack babies, retired Mossad agents, roti fetishists, granola, design students and worst of all, artists.\n\nThankfully, those days are gone and a golden era of condo dwellers approaches.  However, for those who want to viscerally experience a real connection to the past, Rustic Cosmo awaits.  \n\nFirstly, the décor has not changed in years.  I have a vivid memory of eating brunch there one day around 2004 and realizing that the walls were painted with the exact same vivid purple we had just painted over in our new place.  Only took two primer coats and three more of the light buttery yellow paint before that gruesomeness was banished.  Having said that, I want to make it clear that in the Rustic, either the purple works or I'm so used to it I can no longer tell if it doesn't.  Other features from late 80s, early 90s?  Wood booths, de rigueur exposed brick and pressed tin ceiling.\n\nFor reasons like that memory, I can't really judge Rustic like I would other places.  It's a neighbourhood spot, serving faithfully for many years.  It's the default brunch spot where I could probably stroll in wearing my pj pants and not get a second look.  \n\nFood wise, they knock out their dishes with admirable consistency.  Basic menu is a collection of bagel sandwiches and various breakfast options.  Most plates come with a house mesclun mix salad with a balsamic heavy dressing.  With breakfast options you also get home fries.  Their home fries are just ok, with precooked potatoes briefly sautéed with what looks like a grainy mustard.  For the record, I prefer my homefries to be a varying mass of crisp edges and soft creamy potato.  Sunday is best for brunch, when they add a pretty decent eggs benny option to the menu.  \n\nThe all-important coffee?  Drip varies in quality (though it has been richer lately) and espresso based drinks are just \"meh\".  This despite the impressive eagle topped espresso machine.  Toronto has gone through several coffee revolutions since Rustic opened and they are now being judged by a much higher standard.\n\nService over the years has ranged from stellar to addled.  However, I'd like to stress that without fail, servers are friendly and attitude free.  I'll forgive the occasional lapse if their hearts are in the right place.\n\nIn summary, if you find yourself in the nabe, it's worth a visit.  Don't expect fireworks, but don't be surprised if you enjoy the place.   My rating reflects the warm fuzzies that live in my heart for Rustic.
589	1	d	Awwwww shoeeeeeeeeeee... t! \nYelp comes through again!\nThat's right folks, the site most known for it's rave restaurant reviews and rad recs for retails can indeed guide you to awesome services right in your backyard. \nI was packing last Thursday and realized I had some pretty scuzzy looking shoes (thanks winter) and without anytime to wash and polish them up, I decided to scour the interwebz for somewhere close to home that could spiff 'em up for me. As luck would have it this place has some solid reviews and is two minutes from my place. They have wonky hours because they have a boatload of work, but I was able to drop everything off Thursday and pick them up late on Friday... WHAT?! That's right, even as busy as they are, I told them I was getting on a plane Sunday morning and needed my kicks fast. Whelp, they were able to accommodate me and for that I'm grateful. \nI'm tramming around SF right now in my rad looking chukkas (instead of the 9 inches of snow that awaits my return) and I have to say, they look pretty damn good. Boots, leather, suede they can (and did) do it all! \nThanks folks!
590	0	d	Great friendly service.  I recommend a reservation though if you are coming with more than 2 people, even during the week.  \n\nHappy Hour is from 3 - 6.  Enjoyed my mojito - it was very strong.  Also the $5 happy hour garlic fries and the $5 brie cheese with bread and jam.  Loved the jam but not so much the walnut bread.\n\nShared two flatbreads.  Didn't like the Italian that much (though it was my two friends favorite) but the Vintage was amazing!!!  So so so good!
591	0	d	Just tried this place out this morning for the first time. It may not be the most modern up to date decor but what makes it so special is the fantastic service!! My husband and I both ordered the daily breakfast special and it was delicious- too much food for me which is always nice because you know the value is superb!! The cook is a wonderfully warm woman who took a brief moment to come out and chit chat. She's a doll!! We will definitely be back!!!
592	1	d	I'm changing my review from 1 star to 3 because of Alice. She saw my Yelp review and gave me a call to discuss my experience. She was really sweet and professional about the situation, even offering us KA tickets! The show was awesome and even though we couldn't see Atmosphere at the Brooklyn Bowl (our original plans that got delayed because of switching rooms), my boyfriend and I really appreciated it. 5 stars for Alice, 3 stars for the hotel room and 1 star for the inconvenience. Thank you again Alice!
593	0	d	Went here last night for dinner! Saturday night was\nPacked so be sure to make a ressy. We got the fried chicken, fried chicken biscuits, Mac and cheese, and fries with the absolute best buttermilk ranch dressing you will eat!
594	0	d	These guys are great! Came here for some issues with my tires and dashboard lights. \n\nService was quick and friendly. Thanks, Mark! My car was in a bay in seconds after I signed the estimate. They called to update me and give me choices on the repair, and they weren't at all offended when I decided to do some repairs elsewhere. This was only because my car is European and I'm wary of doing any major repairs anywhere but a certified Volvo shop. \n\nI did end up getting an alignment and the issue with my dashboard lights were fixed. Their prices were great. I will definitely be coming here again!
595	0	d	Congee Queen's is the new King of Congee restaurants in Mississauga! How's that for a confusing opening statement?\n\nI spotted this restaurant opening near the already busy Heartland area, beside the highly acclaimed Seafood City. We went for New Years' Eve, along with what seemed to be the rest of the Filipino and Chinese community in Mississauga. Wait time was surprisingly fast given the amount of tables ahead of us, we ended up waiting about 15 minutes to get a table for 5.\n\nI immediately noticed that the items here were pricier than your standard fare, which was kind of expected, given the higher class feel the restaurant provided.  Our family settled for an order of Softshell fried rice ($15.25), Salt and Pepper Squid ($11.50), House Super Bowl Congee ($15.99, consists of several types of seasfood), Stir Fried HK style Lobster ($28.99) and a chicken lettuce wrap (can't find the price).\n\nThe food came in quick time, which again was a surprise given how busy it was. Further, the food was definitely fresh, and not re-warmed like other places might've done.\n\nThe food in itself was great. All of the items were well seasoned, and extremely tasty. The squid stood on top of all the rest, with how light and crispy it was, while packing a strong salty and pepper punch.  The lettuce roll came in a close second; a surprisingly delicious plate with a good amount of meat on it.  The Hoisin sauce brought it to another level.  Congee was good, had decent amounts of seafood in it, though I felt the congee itself had a bit too much ginger to my liking.\n\nThe Lobster didn't meet expectations, unfortunately. Felt like it was a little bland (though the only other time I've had this dish was a a restaurant that specialized in just that, and may have skewed my benchmark). For the price we paid, it was underwhelming.\n\nAll in all, I was extremely satisfied with the experience. Service was attentive, atmosphere was pleasant, food was timely.  Would definitely come again...maybe when Seafood city has quieted down next door.
596	1	d	Hot foods are so over priced! 1 peice of chicken and one scoop of mash potatoes.. $8.81.. no kidding. .  see uploaded picture.    ok I get it., its for convenience .. and there is a hot foods button and its weighed at the cashier but this is a bit ridiculous ..never again.. \nAND.. I am not even full.
597	0	d	Good customer service with extremely fast delivery. Definitely going back. I love their vegi sub, every bite has freshness on it
598	0	d	This is a small family business that is incredibly charming.  Parking can be a nightmare, but the deserts make it worth the hassle.  The first time I went to La Piccola Cucina was for my birthday a year ago.  Walking in there's a display case filled with the different food they offer.  You get to choose your combo and they'll prep the food and bring it over to you.  The food was ok, but what I really liked about this place was the fun owner (who sang happy birthday to me and it made me blush) and the drool worthy desserts that they offer.
599	1	d	Maybe I was just crazy hungry when I came in, was actually heading to the Tim Horton's next door when I noticed the sign and came here instead. \n\nThe service was quick, friendly enough considering it is a fast food joint, and the food is fresh. Had the chicken shawarma sandwich. The chicken was seasoned nicely and the vegetables were crunchy. I was really happy I found this place since I didn't check it out on Yelp first and didn't read the other reviews until after the fact. \n\nThe prices are reasonable and well within that of the competition. I'll definitely be back for a follow up.
600	1	d	I made an appointment, showed up 6min late and there was only 2 ladies working only one customer there. The man at the front desk was very nice but the nail ladies where stuck up and rude when the male at the desk asked if they could still take my appointment. They shook their heads no turned me away!!! I've never felt so embarrassed in my entire life. They lost a good customer because I will never go again. I drove 45 min out there just to get my nails done but wasted my time and gas just to get denied. Sucks for them I usually spend $50 on my nails. Worst nail experience ever!!
601	0	d	Best pizza in Madison. The wait is always long, but it's worth it. The jalapeño assessino is possibly the best pizza I've ever had. Hopefully it gets back on the regular menu.
602	0	d	I have to say this is probably the best Fit4Less location in the GTA.. unlike the Lawrence location, this location is very open and spacious, the equipment actually works (example: the elliptical actually inclines) it's very clean and doesn't smell.. and it's overall just a better location. Even on days that are busy I still feel like I have the opportunity to use the machines and also the the massage beds are a nice touch too! I can't get over how much cleaner this location is ... the bathrooms and fitting rooms are much more spacious..
603	1	d	Not a fan at all. The only reason we ended up here was because nellos pizza had a 45 minute wait. The food service was quick and the waitress was really good, but the food was horrible. This place raves about how good the hamburgers are, but they are not. \n\nThe bun was ok, the hamburger meat reminded me of mystery meat in elementary school. I had a good amount of pickles on the burger and in my basket, so I tried one of the loose pickles and it tasted like someone dipped it in hairspray and perfume. The fries were also soggy and cold. I asked one of the guys in our group how his burger was and he commented \"I knew this place was not going to be good\". \n\nI hope someone who cares about this place reads these reviews, as the location is pretty good and it would be a great place to watch football. But, the food does need to be improved.
604	0	d	Very impressed with this veterinary center.   They are pleasant and helpful and everyone seems very relaxed and happy.   We have received wonderful care for our pets with much more time spent with them and us than we have ever experienced in the past from other vet services.\nThe place is very clean and the waiting room is so pleasant.\nOn top of it all the prices were very reasonable.\nI wouldn't hesitate to seek care for your special companions here.
605	0	d	First time at this barbershop. Erick faded me up and I am very satisfied. Definitely coming back.
606	0	d	This place is so yummy! It seems to never have enough tables available, which says a lot. I've also noticed a lot of people of Mediterranean descent eating here.  I've seen a few Mediterranean places not survive the valley, but I really hope this one does. It's far more than gyros. I've tried a couple of things and they've been done really well. Not dry, but perfectly seasoned and cooked so that it doesn't dry out.
607	1	d	This is hands down the WORST car wash I have ever been to. The entire staff, including the owner, simply don't care about the quality of their work. I would highly recommend finding another place to take your car.
608	0	d	awesome experience so far! i love vegas and the venetian is a top flight casino and hotel! there will be more to come!
609	1	d	Need a beer, a shot, a number 2 fade?... Just crow like Ru-fi-oooooo and the barbers here will work their magic. \n\nI've been coming to Roosters for the past 5 months straight and every time I leave I always feel refreshed and powerful, just like Zoolander when he drops, \"Blue Steel\" - (a lot of movie references in this review)... \n\nWhen you walk-in, you'll notice this place looks like what a woman thinks a man cave should be; clean, with comfy leather couches, and random signs on the walls regarding cliche marriage situations. It looks like stuff they found at a male version of Home Goods. \"Take my wife... no really, take her.\" - Ouch. It hurts to type that. \n\nThe ladies here are always welcoming and anyone of them can give an awesome cut. I recommend you visit here a few times and figure who your barber babe is, mine is Jennifer. She not only gives an awesome cut, but understands me when I try to babble out style directions for my hair. Plus she has great taste in music and loves to chat about it while hooking up my fade. \n\nAfter you've gotten the cut and a sipped a brew. They offer you a shampoo and massage. Yup, the relaxation levels get turned to eleven. This isn't a full on massage, but a nice little back rub to awaken from your beer\/ haircut induced zone out. \n\nPRO TIP: Always, always, always... make an appointment. This place gets packed and if you try to walk-in you'll most likely be waiting a while.
610	1	d	Went into this store with my daughter who had found a dress she wanted to try on we had an appointment but we were there early our appointment was at 3 we thought it was at 2. The owner said they would \"fit\" us in since they had no one coming in until 4. She told one of the other ladies to show us some dresses. Our appointment was for 1 hour the fitting lady had us in and out in less then 30 minutes there was 1 dress my daughter did like but she did not try to sell it to her did not sell up anything. Kinda felt rushed out of there. Felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Women we didn't belong there. I know 3 girls that got engaged this year I will not recommend this shop! Our money went elsewhere where someone took the time and made my daughter feel special and found \"her\" dress for the most important day of her life!
611	1	d	First time in a JJ. I asked the guy what he would order... It was the Gargantuan. \n\nI ordered as is no onion. it was ready before i left the register. \n\nIt was huge, good and hit the spot. Enough for two for sure. \n\nThe best part was the staff. The actually were cleaning when no one was ordering. I mean wiping every inch of the place. I appreciated that.
612	0	d	We hosted our son's rehearsal dinner here in May. Quiveys never disappoints. The meals and service were outstanding. And who doesn't love the amazing fruit crisp for dessert. We had a private room for our group of 30 and were able to give speeches, distribute gifts, and start the wedding celebration for our kids in an awesome way. Thanks for making this event wonderful.
613	0	d	Stopped by before 4th of July as we had to buy a new oven. Decided we'd get other appliances too. Had been to the other big box stores and didn't see this place until I saw the guy spinning a sign on the corner advertising for them. Boy am I glad I did. The prices here were comparable or better than other places we looked at. What sold us was the people here. Our salesman took his time, showing us how to tell if a dishwasher was sturdy or not and other little tips. As we looked at different appliances, he was very up front about pros and cons about each of them and never pushed us to the more expensive or greatest new thing items. He listened to what we needed, helped us find it, and when we told him we'd be in touch with him, there was no high pressure or guilt trip sales, just a hope to hear back from you. We went and got some ice cream while thinking about all our options and then came right back and bought them. They were able to get them delivered to us in 2 days which was amazing. The delivery crew was honest, on time, and super helpful and kind. We've loved our appliances and loved the personal experiences we had with everyone at the store and would definitely recommend them.
614	1	d	You will get the shits after eating here.... tried several times since I work close....  myself and coworkers all have the same result with different menu items.....  pass by, eat somewhere else.\n\nYou will thank me later
615	1	d	Great Staff and great doctors. I've been coming here for about 10 years now and I have never experienced anything but the best. Dr. Ginger Lane always goes above and beyond and shows tremendous compassion towards her patients. I definitely recommend this clinic if you're looking for a primary care provider. Thank you, Desert Family Medicine.
616	0	d	Interior is very beautiful and perfect for your Instagram pictures. However it is very difficult to order and speak to them if you do not speak mandarin. Aside from that, I had ordered a regular milk tea bubble tea and it was bland, flavourless, watered down and the tapioca was over cooked. \n\nFor a regular it was around $5-6. I would much rather buy from other bubble tea chains in the same plaza. \n\nGo for the pictures but not the actual tea.
617	0	d	Working with this company was the most annoying experience I have had in a very long time. Not sure all mortgage companies are royal pains in the rear, but this company went above and beyond as far as making me miserable. Asking for the same information six different ways and asking me for documents I just submitted. Not the brightest bunch. Oh ... and to top it off, they sold my email address and now I have to dump it because it has been spammed to the ends of the earth. I would never call this company ever again for a loan.
618	0	d	Been here 3 times and decided to write a review. The food is just ok, nothing special. Seems it was sitting under lamp for a while. The first 2 times they gave me a good portion but the 3rd time it was small and not worth 9 dollars. It seems it is mostly packed with construction workers.
619	0	d	So close to the five stars...  But just slightly lacking on the service side.  It was a Friday night and this place was PACKED!!!  Crazy busy.   We had an 8:00 reservation for five.  We all came early thinking we would meet for a drink but it was way too busy so we went across the street to Martini.  At 7:58 we rushed over to meet our reservation, EXCEPT they weren't ready for us....  Until nearly 8:30.  Sadly we left half full drinks that we could have finished if they had chosen to use the phone number they had solicited when we made the reservation.  \nInitially they sat us at a four top with three (not petite) gals jammed in on the sette.  They realized this and moved us to a six top, much better situation.  They also immediately poured us sparkling wine to thank us for our wait.   We received two or three glasses a piece which was needed because our server was not ready to have a table sat.  We waited about 15 minutes to order wine and he was not ready to take our appetizer orders at this point.  We finally ordered our meals at 9:15.  \nNow the food - \nAppetizers - \nyellow tail - amazing!!!!\nIberico ham - the combination of flavors on this plate are surprising and fulfilling\nnew england fry - although fabulous pales in comparison to the others above.\nEntrees -\nScallops (three of us had these) perfectly seared, cauliflower puree so yummy with the buttery flavor of the scallops.\nScottish Salmon - a bit on the salty side but flavorful, fresh and just plain yummy\nBURRATA, ROSSO BRUNO & TEARDROP TOMATOES - delicious and fresh\nSides -\nBrussel Sprouts - My personal favorite.  A bit heavy on the bacon, in fact more bacon than brussel sprouns which saddened me because they were so good.\nmac and Cheese - Plain and simply delicious\nRoasted cauliflower - Fresh, great combo of flavors\nSpinach - good but for me a bit on the salty side\nDessert\nWe all shared the bread pudding and the salted caramel ice cream..  Perfect ending to a perfect meal.  \nFood was a complete pleasure.  Once the crowds thinned a bit the service was great.  They are just beyond busy at this time.  Fresh, healthy options, etc...........
620	0	d	We stopped in for a late and small dinner.  Overwhelmed and over eatting in Montreal.  So, we ordered a burger, medium rare and fries with a side of coleslaw.  We started with the coleslaw, a vinegar based slaw, and it was great.  Reminded me of the fish fries in Milwaukee that always came with great coleslaw.  The hamburger arrived and it was darkly charred.  My husband and I didn't expect it to be medium rare inside but it was.  The charred outside kept the flavor in and the meat they use was delicious.  Speaking as someone who really enjoys a great burger - this one made it to the top.  And the service was great.  The guy outside told us that Mister Steer had been there for 60 years.  I can see why, great food and great service.
621	1	d	This Starbucks is closest to my workplace, which is the sole reason I come here. There's no parking on site, but there's a 'Green P' behind it and you can easily just park your car for a few minutes in front. \n\nI love Starbucks. \n\nI even have a Starbucks phone strap. \n\nThe staff at this location are friendly and inviting with their smiles; however, this place has to change! Perhaps the Manager is easygoing and too lenient? It has to be the slowest Starbucks I have ever been to in my life. I usually bring my BlackBerry so I have something to do while waiting for my order. Their service is so slow that I have been flirting with the idea of going to the Second Cup down the block. \n\nAnyway, come here only when you're not in a hurry... or else you will leave a frustrated, grumpy, and unpleasant person.
622	1	d	Terrible. Sloppy, sloppy  job. They painted the rear hatch on my Q7. Left overspray in the corners of the rear glass. Also left deep scratches all over the glass probably from cleaning the overspray paint. That is a shame that Glenmore Audi is using them.
623	1	d	If you are in the market to be prepared for natural disasters like Katrina definitely make Foodwise one of the places you visit. You can also find freeze-dried or dehydrated products. They carry fruits, vegetables, grains, beans and pasta. But they also carry dairy products...yes that's what I said, dairy. They have dehydrated cheese, butter, eggs, shortening, milk...you name it, they probably have it. I was blown away by the things available in their store. They also have PETE jars, water containers in all sizes, and seal-able buckets in different sizes for all your needs.\n\nFoodwise is owned and operated by Brent and Kristi Averett. Both were at the store when I came in and they were so helpful and knowledgeable about my different storage questions. It also looked like their store is all set up in the back for demonstrations. \n\nI am very impressed and will definitely be coming back as I expand my storage content. Foodwise is definitely as good as it gets!!
624	0	d	Kennedy at the front desk was nice and caught a mistake made by the dr.'s office.  Kim who did my ultrasound was nice and easy to talk to.  Kim also let me know I could sent the results to another dr. which saved me the time and hassle of having to call one dr.'s office and get them to send my results to the other one (and hope they get there).  Would recommend them.
625	1	d	After flying in to Toronto, picking up our rental car and preparing to head into the office, I decided to have a quick lunch at Thai Express in the Yorkdale Mall, near the office. BIG MISTAKE. Out of all the choices in the food court, I chose this? Why?\nThis place is insanely busy. Guess lots of people want to get their Thai on at lunch. We get up to the counter. We order fried rice and pad thai. When I attempt to pay using my credit card, I'm told they only accept debit. I give the clerk my debit card, which clearly says debit and I'm told they don't accept it. I try proving to the clerk that it is, in fact debit, before becoming frustrated. I give her cash and ask sarcastically if they accept cash. We wait for 10 minutes. Our dishes are prepared. We were never given our drinks and had to return to the same server to request our drinks. She'd forgotten if we paid for them at this point and attempted to dispute. Look. Bottom line. Whole lot of drama for very little in return. Avoid the confusion, the hassle and the lack of taste, hit up one of the other vendors at the food court. You'll leave full, satisfied and with lower blood pressure. Also- tip- they only fill fountain drinks half way, so order the bottle. At least you'll know what you're getting. Thai Express- the express train to lunch hell.
626	0	d	Food is amazing ordered the pork gyro with fries everything was tasty and large portions very affordable as well I think it was $7 including a drink. Will definitely go back dudes that work there are super friendly too!!
627	1	d	3.5 stars overall\n4 stars for the Bi Bim Bap\n2 stars for the spicy pork with kimchee\n4 stars for the service.\n\nWalked in one cold December evening and we were immediately taken in by the sizzle of the grills and the very green foliage indoors. Also, by pictures of celebrities by the front door. Sandra Oh, you rocked your CBC shirt so! Korean Village Restaurant boss lady: you're a pretty middle aged korean lady, you really don't need to pancake your face so. You looked like you were in a production of Phantom of the Opera in some of those pics!.\n\nAnyways, the bi bim bap was fantastic. Not very oily, unlike Arisu. Also a nice balance of crunchy and soft rice, also unlike Arisu. Eggy, shrimpy and vegetably. Very Nice.\n\nThe spicy pork was a disappointment. It wasn't spicy at all. It was very sour, perhaps a bit much even given the kimchi. Also, it was very, very fatty, way more than it should've been.\n\nThe banchan was great tasting and abundant: the fish cakes were stand-out awesome. They bring you refills regardless of whether you order bbq. Amazing.\n\nThe service was great. Both the waitresses had great glowing skin and were very polite. I've noticed that the Japanese and Koreans have amazing skin. I asked a Japanese friend once about this, and her secret is Vaseline. I dunno about the Vaseline, but perhaps it's something in the cuisine?
628	0	d	Today I said yes to the dress and it was a wonderful experience. Its a small boutique style shop with spacious fitting rooms. Haley was my bridal stylist and she was awesome! It was like she knew me, but we had just met. I thought without my family and friends being there (everyone is out of state) I wouldn't get the full \"Say Yes\" experience, and I had made peace with that. Somehow she and the team brought that familiar\/ good vibe and I am over joyed with my dress. Thank you Haley for all your help, expertise and attention to detail. I highly reccomend this place for your bridal dress needs!
629	1	d	We arrived to a completely packed restaurant - which was not surprising given all the hype and anticipation. Waited in like for about 5 minutes which gave us the time to look over the menu they have many traditional dishes that you can order with a choice of saffron basmati, white or brown rice. You also get a choice of garlic or regular naan. I asked for a water cup and was handed a respectable sized cup. I was pleasantly surprised when I went to get my water there they supplied tips specifically for the water cups. \n\nWe had trouble finding seats at first, but eventually found a table and sat. The food took a solid 15 - 20 minutes to arrive. I'm going to chalk that up to new restaurant kinks that will be worked out over the time. The girl who delivered our meal wasn't entirely clear about what she was putting on the table and so I accidentally ended up trying my friends paneer. The manager (I think) was quick to see an issue had occurred and even offered to get us new food. \n\nThe tikka masala had great flavor - it has a little spiciness to it, but I liked it. The rice was cooked well and the chicken pieces were cooked perfectly. The naan was pretty good, not the best I've ever had though. I tend to like it softer, this was more crispy. \n\nThe meals were portioned properly (in my opinion) however if my husband was with me he would claim it was way too small of a portion. \n\nThe restaurant was decorated with bold colors and colored lights. You can see through to the kitchen there are two beautiful ovens. And when you are filling your drinks you can see their spice closet! Pretty cool. \n\nWe tried finding trash cans when we were there... couldn't find them so we gave up and threw our trash out in an outside garbage can. This was kinda bizarre. \n\nLook forward to returning, hopefully wait times decrease!
630	1	d	Went to The Klassik to watch a packers playoff game... that they ended up losing... and met up with some friends here who lived out in Verona. The outside doesn't look like anything special, but when you walk in, it's actually quite big. To the right is a banquette room, as well as if you go straight downstairs. To the Left was the bar. Filled with TVs, love the almost horseshoe bar, and not positive if they sell food or not cause when we were there they were doing a potluck. But the drinks there were fantastic, I ended up getting two Mimosas that were so good, and huge for $4 which I thought was at a pretty awesome price. Our bartender was the sweetest, super attentive to everyone in the bar, and was just awesome. \n\nI'd definitely give Klassik another go on another game day :)
631	0	d	Where do I begin... If you are looking for a cookie cutter stylist in an obnoxious salon with loud annoying music then Deana isn't your gal. BUT if you are looking for a thoughtful consultation, amazing skills, and someone who stays self-educated and on trend then Deana is for you! Deana has done my hair for three years and she has gotten it longer than I ever imagined and given me an array of blondes to satisfy my mood. She is a doll to spend time with and gives the BEST scalp massage around! Thanks Deana!
632	1	d	This was my first time attending Yelp Goes Gatsby. However, I've been to other 1920s-themed events and they are always a lot of fun. \n\nThere were a lot of Yelpers here but there was also ample space. The ballroom would have been enough by itself but there were also several vendors in the hallway. It was great to see so many local business come together to support a great cause. I didn't get to sample everything because there was just so much. However, the bites from the Hilton, The Cellar, Verde, and the samples from the beverage vendors were all quite tasty. \n\nI loved the effort that everyone put into making this come off as a 20s party. Many of the vendors were dressed in period attire, there was a Charlie Chaplin lookalike, cigarette girls (handing out candy cigarettes), swing music, and even swing dancing lessons. Of course. we Yelpers also got in on it and rocked some gangster and flapper threads.\n\nThis event was phenomenal. I even ran into a few people that I know from outside the Yelposphere so that was an added bonus. Can't wait to do this again!
633	0	d	I've been going to Pit Stop Burger for many years and can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet!! Not only do the have friendly servers and excellent food their prices are seriously reasonable. \n\nPit Stop Burger is located right by the turn off to the dam. Just a quick detour into the Vons parking lot. It's a tiny cafe where you seat yourself. Their waitresses are always quick and friendly. I've even had them offer me to go cups for my drinks. \n\nTheir menu has something for everyone. They offer you classic sandwiches, salads and of course burgers! Some of my favorites to order from here are the Pit Burger Combo which comes with 1\/3lb burger, frys, and a soda all for $8.95! You can even add a domestic beer for  $0.70 or a import for $1.25. Sounds like the perfect combo to me. I also really like the Chef Salad. It's huge and comes loaded with ham, turkey, swiss and american cheese. If you feel like a sandwich the classic Club sandwich is always a great choice. I must mention that when ordering frys or any other fried goodies they give you a squirt bottle of Ranch and Fry Sauce!! So awesome!!!! \n\nNext time your cruising through Boulder City make sure you hit up Pit Stop Burger. You just can't go wrong with a place that serves a kick ass burger, has excellent service, doesn't brake the bank, and an amazing feature squirt bottles of Ranch and Fry Sauce.
634	0	d	A really terrible bar, with $9 miller lites and lots of people waiting around for someplace better to be.\n\nWe sat at the bar and had a couple of beers as we waited for our gang to get together. the bar staff were friendly but they gave us a dog of a recommendation to go an eat somewhere.
635	1	d	Was here on 9\/26 Saturday night. \n\nI'm not one for waiting in lines. I hate them in fact. Decided to come to this place to kill sometime while some other places' lines died down. \n\nWe ended up staying the whole night. No line and was a smaller more intimate establishment. The DJ was good enough and cocktails were $10 a piece. Not too bad.\n\nGood mix of crowd young and old and of course you have your mix of crazies who think they're still in their 20's. Entertainment can't get better than that.\n\nAfter a long night out its definitely nice to just leave and take the elevator up to your room to crash. Don't know if I could have made it any further than that.\n\nThis place did the job!
636	1	d	I get it! You're supposed to get buzzed at Westgate, then come here and feel like every store is a good idea. Genius!\n\nThis is a less cool version of the outlets in Anthem.\n\nDid you know Tanger is an outlet chain? Like, the deals you're finding are totally orchestrated nationwide? In normal outlets, businesses sell directly to consumers, which is where the groovy deals come from. In Tanger, you're dealing with a big, corporate middleman. No wonder it's lame.\n\nNot saying you won't find something you like...it's just less likely here than the real deal.
637	1	d	Ignore the glitz and glamor...this place is a waste of time.  The wait to get in is forever long.  We stood in line at 8 and didn't get to the door until 945.  Once you get in, there are 3 levels of disappointment to choose from and to get to each one, you have to walk up and down several flights of stairs.    \n\nThe bottom floor...I didn't stay on this floor long, because people were just standing around.  I didn't come to a club to stand around and people watch, so on to the next one.\n\nThe main floor was popping.  If you can't dance and want to get lucky this is the place to be.  I could barely walk to the dance floor without people brushing their sweat up against me.  When I finally got to the floor, the bouncers were telling people to move and walk the other way bc the floor was too packed.  \"That's fine,\" I thought...\"There's always the 3rd room. \"\n\nThe top floor had chairs and tables everywhere.  The room was smaller than my hotel room.  What's the point of having an area where you can barely move and to get out, you have to walk around in a circle?! \n\nAt this point I was done with Marquee.  I just wanted to get out, but it's not going to be that easy.  I felt like I had to go through a maze of 6-7 flights of stairs, to get out of this house of horror.  For anyone that is heavily intoxicated, I will pray for you.  \n\nSo why the extra star you may ask?  Well the bathroom line was real quick and I did get in the club for free.  However, I'm sure the line was short because people would rather pee on themselves before walking out in the cold and getting lost in the maze that is Marquee. \n\nI felt like Goldilocks and the three bears.  Except that I kept on hoping for the \"just right\" moment, but it never came and I would have rather been chased out by a bear.
638	0	d	I love this place! I'm so happy it's close to work. Food is a great value and has always been excellent quality. Try the Thai poutine! It sounds strange, but it's so good! Staff is always super nice so I'm happy to support them.
639	1	d	Been here for the first time this weekend. I've been to every other club, but this was pretty small, just had a \"hip hop\" dance floor and an \"house music\" on the roof. Nothing special...\n\nMy friend got VIP bottle service, and we were on the hip hop dance floor and just overlooked the dance floor which was nice. But I must admit, this place has the ugliest people in Vegas I've ever seen at a Vegas nightclub (been to Tao, Jet, Pure, Tryst, XS, The Bank, etc) and this like I said, is by far the ugliest people ever. I think since it's not one of the popular clubs that they let anyone in and don't discriminate. I'm not saying I'm hot stuff, but I'm saying for Vegas standards, the people here (especially guys, 1-10) were probably a 4 all around. I tried to drink to get beer googles, but the people weren't getting any prettier! Also it's like a low standard club or something, I saw some girls wearing JEANS and a top, and they still got in and they weren't hot...\n\nI would not come back just cause it's small and full of not good looking people. The music was good though. But it was okay. I say you go to a better night club in Vegas, so you can get that Vegas experience.
640	1	d	Love the fact that you can get filled up at one of these Burger joints and not let it break the bank. The food is always freshly made and the service is very friendly.\n\nThis particular location is in the Fiesta Mall parking lot and it can get pretty busy during peak hours. Usually get here before the lunch rush and eat quickly so I can get back to work in a hurry.\n\n3X3 with Onions, add Pickles and Chili Peppers, please. Sometime I'll treat myself to an order of their tasty and freshly sliced French Fries. Definitely can't resist a giant pile of the spicy complementary Chili Peppers. Oh Yeah!\n\nThey have several ways that you can order your burger here. Just do a quick google for their Top Secret ordering instruction and you will be amazed. Animal style is a typical favorite and you will probably see a few during your visit.\n\nSee ya there next time and remember to enjoy the moment. Life is Good. SAY CHEESE!\n\n3.75 STARS
641	1	d	Barro's has the best pizza. This is the second location I've been to, and their pizza is on point. They have some really great weekday lunch specials where you can get a couple of slices and a drink for less than $5, but I usually come here to pick up whole pizzas after work. \n\nThe BEST kind I've had is the Mega Meat (which is topped with pepperoni, bacon, ham, Italian sausage, and meatballs). You can definitely tell that it's not the most healthy option, but it is amazing. Their regular pepperoni pizzas are also a tasty and less heavy choice. I've had the wings here before too, which are pretty good, but the pizza is definitely the main star.\n\nAlso, Barro's doesn't offer table service, so you need to go up to the counter to order (not sure how that's not obvious when you see everyone else standing in line at the counter). They'll drop off the food to your table once it's done. :)
642	1	d	I recently checked this out with my mom and it wasn't bad.  My mom loves discount and dollar stores, so I see a lot of them taking her around these days.\n\nThis store is very much like Ross or Marshall's or the like.  This store had a lot of stuff, but we really only checked out the children's section.  If you are looking for kid stuff, this is a great place.  They had a decent selection of clothes, including a lot of Carter's clothing for really cheap.  The also had a ton of cute shoes.  I didn't see any big names in the shoe section, but did find some cute summer sandals for $4 for my daughter.  There was also a lot of infant\/toddler accessories like bouncers, play gyms, potty training chairs, etc., all of which were much cheaper than what I have seen them go for at Babies R Us. The toy section is where you will find the best deals.  There are a a ton of options from baby toys to action hero types, all for really good prices. One of the best deals was an entire tea party set I found.  It had the tea set, as well as a table and 2 chairs for $22.  And yes, the table and chairs were kid sized and could be sat on and played with.  That was a great deal.  \n\nMy mom told me that she had bought some shirts for herself at this store, but there weren't very good quality.  She actually said one of the shirts fell apart after she washed it, so beware on the adult clothing.\n\nOn a negative, the neighborhood and shopping center seemed a little shady.  I don't think I would want to be there after dark alone.  We went around lunch time and it was ok then.
643	0	d	AMAZING!  Great baked goods made from such a great staff that goes above expectations. I needed a sugar free cake for a surprise birthday party that we were having while camping. They were willing to come in early so we could pick up our cake slightly early.
644	1	d	Went in to check the venue out as a location to host a Bridal Party Spa Day for my bf's upcoming nuptials and was very pleasantly surprised. Was treated to Signature Pedicure for my bday by my friend and it was awesome!! The location is beautifully decorated and very clean. Harmony did a wonderful job on my little piggies and was very friendly and courteous. They offer a wide array of services at very reasonable prices. I cannot wait until the party!
645	1	d	Tommy's and My Finances:\n-Sally Mae lending, meet Tommy's Restaurant. You can thank Tommy's for a decent amount of my stipend loans.\n\nTommy's and Ethics:\n- Tommy's made being a vegan for half of college possible.\n- Tommy's made delicious and softened the guilt of the devolution into a vegetarian and then meat-eater.\n\nTommy, the Man:\n- Tommy himself dug through several bags of trash to find my retainer which I had accidentally crumpled up in a napkin (yeah, gross, I know, but I was really hung over, okay?). I bet if you asked him, he would remember this. Wouldn't you? \n\nTommy's: Supernatural\n- Their coffee is not real. Read that however you like. \n- This was my chosen first meal (BBQ Chicken Sandwich w\/fries and a peanut butter soy shake) after I spent some time in the hospital for food poisoning and hadn't eaten in days. You thought their food and shakes were good when you're NOT dehydrated and emaciated? Think again. Try the Chipotle up the street for the food poisoning part. Cleveland Clinic will take care of you after that. A cab ride from there to Tommy's is maybe $10 -- all in all (if your co-pay's good), it's a great deal.
646	1	d	This was the first time going here.\nI have to say the clam chowder is the bomb!!\nIt had big pieces of clams and was creamy. Good stuff!\n4 stars because the breakfast wasn't the best. We ordered omelets,  they weren't too bad except when you order 3 cheese I would have expected  a lot of cheese but there wasn't a lot.\nAnd it said homemade hash browns well they are far from home made. They seemed like a deydrated kind and they just don't cook enough the outside is crunchy but the inside are not the best tasting.\nService was pretty good, the waitress we had was good she was on top of everything.\nShe did tell us that the pancakes were awesome there so that maybe worth trying.\nWould we go back? I'd say maybe on a Wednesday or Friday for the clam chowder again and to try something else for sure!
647	1	d	Found out last night that they overcharged $1 for each dish, $3 for a small Indian dessert that we didn't order! The guy who seemed like an owner said \"I made this for you\" with nice smile, so thought it was on the house! Is this real?! Food was good, didn't mind their slow service (it's small family run resto), but this is unacceptable. Felt something's weird when heard the total price (had to go pay at the cashier because he never came out of the kitchen). Seriously.. Glad that we asked for the bill & the menu (he was slightly hesitant) even after payment to figure this out (at home). The menu says any order includes naan or rice, but we paid for them. Feeling aweful about having given good tip when he asked \"how much tips (would you like to add on the bill)?\" This can't happen.\nAlso, anyone wants to pay $1.50 + tax ($3 for two on a plate) for one gulab jamun? or was it another type of rip-off? Guess that's why all the tables were empty except two including ours.
648	1	d	Hotel - My husband and I both enjoy staying here.  It's clean and the air here is much fresher than at other casinos\/hotels on the strip.  The rooms are lovely and the panoramic view we had of the strip was spectacular.  I enjoyed having a good soak in the deep tub they had and the robes they provided were great.  We are looking forward to either staying there again on our next trip or their sister hotel the Encore.  \n\nCasino - the slots were a lot tighter then they were on our prior trip but the table games were still fun with plenty of other players.  \n\nBuffet - It's one of our favorites, with a great selection and atmosphere. \n\nCafe - There's a little \"cafe\" near the guest elevators that's open 24 hrs with food and drinks you can order if you're looking for a quick meal or snack.  The food isn't very good considering the cost but I really did enjoy my frozen caramel drink with the extra shot of espresso.\n\nParking - FREE.  I love that they aren't trying to charge their guests for parking like so many of the other casinos on the strip.  We love knowing that the Wynn & Encore have refused to follow suit with the likes of M-Life casinos and others who have put greed above their guest by trying to squeeze out a few extra bucks.  One of my main reasons for coming to Vegas is to get my gamble on.  I budget for my losses and know that lady luck isn't always on my side so if I'm not winning it's not great but having to pay for parking on the way out feels like rubbing salt in the wound.
649	1	d	This is the first time I have been to this Palm in LV.  I love this Ameican iconic steakhouse.  I went to my first Palm restaurant in SF when I graduated from college in 1989.    Wow.....that's a long time!\n\nBack to my reality.....\n\nI ordered the rib-eye steak and hashbrowns......The steak was perfectly cooked and super juicy.... The hash browns were shaped like a flying saucer.  Thick and crispy all aound.  I like mine shredded instead of diced, but still very good.\n\nA wonderful meal.....\n\nThis a great Palm.......after I finished my steak, I sat back with my glass of merlot and just enjoyed all the eye candy walk by.  If you eat here, you must get a table on the patio and enjoy the scene!
650	0	d	I read the reviews and decided to try this place one afternoon because most people seemed to like it.\n\nLet's just say I was pretty disappointed.  The prices are ok, portions are pretty big, but the flavor and quality of the food wasn't as great as I anticipated.  \n\nI got the lo mein (surprise, I know) and it noodles were very thick, I like the more thin ones.  It was completely dry although I even asked for extra sauce.  My sister had the Kung pao chicken and the pieces of chicken were not cut up like they normally are. The dish was mostly a sea of endless broccoli and light on the chicken.  The flavor was not like others we have tried. \n\nThey were pretty busy and there was somewhat of a wait to pick up my food.  The employees were nice.
651	0	d	Best place in Vegas to get a fade kaleb hooked it up will definelty be coming back whenever I'm im in Vegas
652	1	d	When it comes to prepping for Halloween, I am a major league procrastinator. I will spend whatever it takes to look how I want, knowing damn well it's solely for the purpose of wearing to to parties where people will be too trashed to remember how awesome it was. Regardless, it's serious business, and I need a reliable store to meet my needs. \n\nEasley's is where it's at! It's been around for quite some time, and it's not one of these pop-up little warehouses with rapidly depleting stock, but rather a mainstay in downtown. The worst outfits here are of the same quality as the best stuff you'll find in dedicated Halloween stores. They have better props. They have intricate, high-quality costumes that aren't made to be disposable, and they even rent them out. They have every freaking accessory you could ask for--countless  hats, wigs, fake weapons, you name it. They seem to never run out of anything! \n\nBest of all, the selection here is so nice I'm inspired to dress up and make a fool of myself year-round. I'm gonna get a tophat and monocle for NYE. I'm gonna get a green derby hat and a big, red beard for St. Patrick's Day...the possibilities are endless and fun, all with staff who actually seem to care and genuinely enjoy their jobs. \n\nAs long as you're willing to shell out some dough, you'll have no issues grabbing what you need. Isn't that the coolest?
653	1	d	I like these cupcakes. I've made a few purchases and tried two myself so far: Red Velvet with Cream Cheese frosting and Banana Cream. Those were both highly delicious. \n\nThe store itself may throw you when you walk it as it seems oddly like they don't sell cupcakes or anything else in there. Do not be fooled. They do, in fact, sell cupcakes. There are a few (2 or 3) little cafe tables where you can sit to enjoy your sugary treat and a small fridge with milk, iced coffees and other potables as well so you can relax for a moment and enjoy the dessert.\n\nThere is also a drive-through for easy cupcake acquisition in bad weather.
654	1	d	Piecing together the stories that I've heard about La Comida, I imagined that it was the type of establishment where the food is fine, and you don't hold back the tequila shots. Can't say much for the latter, but the food certainly is good. \n\nRESTAURANT\n\nEven during the daytime, it's difficult to miss their skeleton monkey sign that entices your curiosity and draws you into the restaurant. The wooden tables with their long benches and the folding chairs give it a homey vibe. Day of the Dead elements and rosaries that hang on the walls add touches of Mexican culture throughout the dining room. \n\nFOOD\n\nComplimentary bowls of tortilla chips with salsa are presented as a light appetizer. I say order the guacamole, too.\n\nAppetizer - Queso Fundido: Cheesy, gooey goodness served on a hot plate. \n\nEntree - Sea Bass A La Baja: When our server explained how these are the only tacos on the menu that use flour tortillas instead of corn, I had doubts. After my meal, I can't imagine corn being used for these tacos. The tempura battered sea bass was crunchy, and the chipotle mayo added a tolerable spiciness. I would never have thought that pickled radishes to complement the other flavors. This didn't disappoint.\n\nDessert - Flan: This is one of the best flans that I've had. It's solid and doesn't jiggle much. Smooth, creamy, and not super sweet.\n\nDessert - Fried Plantains with ice cream: Sweeter than the flan, the fried plantains retained their crunchiness even as the ice cream started to melt and created a pool in the bowl. Decent, but I prefer the flan. \n\nSERVICE\n\nNo complaints. Everything ran smoothly.\n\nOTHER\n\nThe fútbol channel was on during my visit. That's a plus!\n\nOVERALL\n\nI would make the trek back here, especially to try their shrimp tacos and watch more fútbol. Lunchtime seems like the ideal hour to make a visit. I wouldn't be surprised if this place becomes packed around dinnertime. Make reservations if possible.
655	0	d	I just have to say I've been with State Farm for maybe 2-3 years now and my agent Courtney is the best she's so helpful and I am very grateful for her. Any questions I gave she would answer back and gives me the information I want or need. Thank you thank you!
656	1	d	Been getting my nails done since I was 16. I'm 29 now. I know what is what and I've tried a lot of places in vegas. I always get gel.\nI have a place I've gone to for 3 years. But a gal pal called one day to say she was stressed and wanted a pedicure to relax. I decided I'd go and try out this new place with her. It was great. Clean , modern and the pedicure was awesome! It was relaxing, she took her time messaging and doing all the luxuries...Not to mention they give u all the stuff they used on you to take home as a gift. (Nail file, buffer etc)\n\nShe also had her hand color changed while she did her pedicure. She loved it. It was mood changing polish. \n\nFast forward a month later I decided I'd go back alone and get ANOTHER pedicure but also a gel fill on my hands. The girl offered me all the different types of pedicures and I decided on the second to most expensive one. A Step above the one I did last time. The pedicure lasted maybe 20 mins, it was totally rushed and not at all the experience of the first time.no massage or buffing of my ski and feet.  And I didn't get the little baggy with all my stuff they used on me... But I figured whatever she's prob superrrr busy and needs to rush for her next client. She does my fill for my nails, and I pick a color. I ask her 2x if that brand chips because I had a bad experience with one particular company and didn't want a repeat experience. She and the guy working next to her said no that brand doesn't chip. And how they agree that the brand I had a bad experience with is commonly complained about. But that I had nothing to worry about with this brand. So I went ahead with it. Nails came out nice but nothing special. Total price for that days services, $108. \nLess than 24hours later one ENTIRE nail gel peels off. In one chunk. 2 days later 2 more peel and chip off at the sides and tip. So I called and asked if they had a guarantee on their services and they said yes if it's within the 7 days time. So I asked to come in that day and they said they were completely booked. So I scheduled a touch up for the following day, (7th day since the service). I arrive on time and pick a color from a different brand and I sit down and the receptionist who has been on the phone talking to her boyfriend about what to pick up for food for 10mins ignores me. I had to get her attention and ask to be helped. I'm told to wait because the girl who serviced me last time was finishing up her other client. I wait, and then when she's free I sit on her chair. She takes the color and starts writing a ticket to charge me $35. I asked her why I'm being charged if I'm there to fix the problem, with an attitude she tells me since it's not the same brand, it's considered a \"polish change\". I said no sorry I'm not paying for it. So she smugly says so u want the same color u did last time? I said no why would I want that if it didn't last? She says well that's the policy and u are suppose to come within the 7 days. I said \"I am here within the 7days\", with an attitude she says \"well you are here on the 7th day, so it's the end of the time\". Okkkkk.. But I am here within the 7days. If that's the rule why is this an issue? I said I didn't want the same polish and I wasn't paying for a new polish. That $108 a week ago was enough. She tears up the ticket and slams her drawer shut. She says \"I guess I won't charge you since your \"throwing a fit\". Mind u I've been calm and very respectful the whole time. She proceeds to do my nails and doesn't speak a word to me for 30+mins. Fine. The receptionist 45 mins later still on the SAME loud call fighting w her boyfriend about what and where to eat. My nail girl rolls her eyes and says that's a common thing and shakes her head. Anyways...I left there feeling embarrassed and shamed. I call my gal pal who introduced me to the place and tell her my story. She then tells me SHE too had her gel polish peel off within a few days. She thought maybe she'd done something wrong. And her brand was completely different than the 2 I tried. Within days my new \"polish change\" chipped and I had to go back to my reg place with my tail between my legs and get my usual girl to fix me up.\n\nAfter coming on here I notice at least 4 or 5 reviews complaining about the nail polish peeling off as well. So I know it's not something we did. \n\nI'll never go back and I'll never recommend them.
657	0	d	This place has extremely poor service. My wife and I went in on a Saturday morning to grab a bagel sandwich. I ordered mine toasted and it was not. My wife received the wrong order and went to the barista who is the manager and he totally ignored her so she went to the cashier and she had not been trained and did not know what to do and her coworkers ignored her. After 10 minutes they straightened it out after implying it was our fault. Will not be back.
658	0	d	Just average food... In between a chipotle and zabas.. The staff is welcoming, but it's pretty pricey for an average bowl. Only white rice and cabbage style lettuce.
659	1	d	Could be the best Ribs in Canada but I haven't had many good ribs in Canada. I find it awkward when I travel back home to Montreal with American friends and Montrealers will start pushing Bar-B-Barn on the them. From My experience Bar-B-Barn can't compare to even a mediocre U.S. Rib. I'm shocked that there are some positve Yank Yelper reviews.\n\nOne thing that really pisses me off about this place is the small serving of fries and sauce that comes with most meals. What a rip.
660	0	d	The technician, Sam, was very efficient, professional and courteous. He explained everything to us in easy to understand terms. He gave us a lot of very good information. We have American Home Shield for our home warranty and they sent Advanced Home Services to fix our water heater. We are quite happy with both companies!
661	1	d	Bobby Fley, I've don't know if it's because of the crowd I run with, but each and everyone of my foodie friends all tell me the same thing when they describe to me their dinning experience at your restaurant.  They all usually start by saying something to the effect of, \"I don't care for Bobby Fley's TV shows\" or \"I'm not the biggest Fley fan..\" and then is always followed up by the same but: : \"...The meal was amazing\" or \"...You have to try it when your in Vegas\"  And if you are constantly bombarded by hearing statements like these over and over again, it's hard to avoid coming in with your expectations raised.  \n\nFor those looking for the cliff notes version:  It didn't disappoint.\n\nHere is the long version:\n\nFirst things should note is that the service here was simply exemplary, our server (Brian) was attentive and but was able to keep it from feeling stuffy and overbearing, and considering we were in the middle of dinner service and the place was buzzing with energy, for some reason things didn't feel quite that way with him taking care of us.  Talking to him about the dishes, his personal recommendations and even his check ups on us came regularly but he managed to not disrupt the mood of our dinner conversations.  Busers, were circulating constantly and kept refilling my water (I drink alot of it) without the need for me to keep asking and they kept the bread coming.  Oh man, the yellow\/blue cornbread with bits of pepper in it with the creamy honey butter was so damn tasty...  They kept that coming too, but it took my g\/f and a knife to keep my advances on the bread bowl at bay since we had a ton more food coming...\n \nStarter - Blue corn pancake with Barbecued Duck and a Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce:\n\nSuch a mixture of complex bold flavors, really bold.  The duck was moist, richly seasoned, the sauces hit every single taste bud:  heat, smokiness, the anise provided a very deep level of different flavors, the blue pancake was super thin, light and fluffy and in texture reminded me of a Chinese pancake\/roast duck dish I was familiar with, but the similarities ended there, the flavors totally scream to me what Flay is all about.  Superb.\n\nNew Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin in a Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce and a Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter\n\nMy g\/f ordered this dish, so I got to pick at it a bit, from the bites that I got in I have to say the meat was superb, well seasoned, nice char on the outside and the meat was perfectly cooked.  The sweet potato tamale with pecan butter was rich and sweet and was a nice change of pace with the rest of the dish.\n\nChipotle glazed in bone rib eye with a currant chile reduction sauce and a Pumpkin tamale + thyme butter\n\nThe two little rib eye pieces were also perfectly cooked, the sauce had a very subtle sweetness to it with a touch of heat.  The meat had a nice smokiness to it, and there was a nice char to the meat on the outside with a bloody awesome in the middle.  The pumpkin tamale provided a sweetness to the dish, personally I liked the sweet potato tamale more.\n\nA side of a Chile relleno\n\nA stuffed chile deep fried, anything tastes better when it's stuffed and deep fried.\n\nTres Leches Flan\n\nRich creamy texture, the caramel sauce and the light crisp cookie on top was just....  (I'm running out of words and synonyms to describe something as good)...  Each bite was absolutely intoxicating.  Each bite had a little bit of caramelized sauce, creamy vanilla infused flan and cookie crisp.\n\nSo to sum up, fantastic food, great drinks and amazing service.  The evening was perfect and more importantly it lived up to and surpassed my expectations, and considering Vegas is home to a number fantastic restaurant, Mesa grill is definitely a worth-while stop.  I'm pretty sure I will be making a stop off in New York sometime soon and check out Fley's other restaurant.  Because hell, Ill say it, I like Bobby Fley!!!
662	0	d	Amazing!! Great food, servers, and atmosphere.. The chicken pesto lasagna was the best!
663	1	d	My first trip the Caledonian was a bit of a mixed bag, and if Yelp had a 3.5 star rating, I'd be inclined to lean towards it.  However, I'm going to have to settle on a 3 star. \n\nOk on to the details.....\n\nOur group showed up at the Caledonian later in the evening for a night-cap and was told that on Thursday's the bar has last call at 1am. With a statutory holiday looming on the next day, a few fellow Yelpers piped up to say, \"Even on Holy Thursday!?' \n\nYes...apparently even on Holy Thursday. \n\nConsidering the bar was fairly full with patrons looking to unwind (get drunk) without the worry of an early morning the next day it certainly came as a bit of a surprise, and I'm sure the Caledonian missed out on a boatload of extra revenue. On the bright side, the waitress was more then understanding and let us nurse our beers until 2 am. (Disclaimer: After writing that last sentence, I adjusted the Yelp rating to a 4. Must give credit, where credit is due.)\n\nThe atmosphere and feel of the Caledonian is great and while I can't speak for the food they offer, they've got a great patio out back that smells like rich, new MDF board (Disclaimer 2: I once worked at a woodworking factory. When you head out back, look up under the awning. That my friend is MDF board...and yes it was brand spanking new on my visit). \n\nIf the weather had of been a few degrees warmer I'm sure our group would have enjoyed our beers a little more. I can easily see this patio being a big hit come summer time and hopefully the scent of new MDF has subsided.\n\nI'm looking forward to my next trek to the Caledonian this summer to enjoy a nice cold beer on the patio......I just hope that last call on the weekends is 2am!
664	0	d	The place is not tidy and clean. After our server took our order, he sat down and started eating his meal a couple of tables over, and never came back to check on us. We had to flag down the next waiter to bring us additional napkins. Since we sat at the table right in front of the cashier, we asked her politely for 3 glasses of water, and she said yes. Then, went got her food and sat down and started to eat. It is very unprofessional of the wait staff to complain about the retired white couple that sat in a booth across from us. I can hear the waiter complaining in cantonese that the white demons are hard to take care off. If you want better service, avoid this place. I have nothing to praise other than the duck.
665	0	d	First time here for a sun brunch. Not crowded, yet food takes a very long time to come out. Had the $35 brunch special. Everything presented well. Appetizer was the banana nut bread French toast. It was good but taste more like a dessert than breakfast. Had the burger for second course. It was good but was missing the bacon mushroom  jam that was supposed to be on it. My dessert was the chocolate cake...wasn't impressed at all. Overall not very impressed with the food but gave it 4 stars because the customer service was good. I suggest just go for the wine; not the food.
666	0	d	This would have been a 5 Star review but I was very disappointed with my food. I ordered the honey walnut glazed shrimp. They put way to much of the glaze on It. It was way too sweet to the point where It was unenjoyable. It came with a huge portion of plain white bland rice. This dish is an epic fail and should be removed from the menu. It's that bad! I ended up asking to substitute the rice for asparagus. The asparagus was cooked to perfection with a tasty garlic butter coating over It. That sauce would have gone great with some sautéed shrimp. I hope this is an option on the menu when I come back. \n\n Our server Themistocles was awesome. Thanks to him, he made sure that my husband was able to order what he wanted even after It was too late to order the breakfast item he wanted (biscuits and gravy) which he rated a 7 out of 10.\n\nOverall, the service was great which is why I will give this place another chance the next time I'm in Vegas.
667	1	d	Okay, so hard to believe I am the FTR of this Garcia's location since it has been here for eon's (and looks like it) and is still one of the staple restaurants around the Metro Center area that hasn't closed down or changed. \n\nThe food is the same as it has been for the last 15+ years. Decent, not great and sadly, the shredded beef in the taco I had tasted like it was boiled without any flavors or seasoning. \n\nFor those of you reading this review who have never been to Phoenix (Arizona at all in fact) you may not be aware of the greasy deliciousness called a cheese crisp. This is seriously where it is at pretty much all over the Valley. Garcia's does make a fine cheese crisp and for that, I am still grateful and willing to go. \n\nThe one good thing I can say is the restaurant still seems to have a hopping bar area with live music a few nights a week. Good for the happy hour crowd, but since I was there with my mom and a cousin for lunch, it didn't do anything for me knowing this. \n\nWord of warning to ladies who need to potty while in the restaurant area...The bathroom is as old as the rest of the place. One toilet so if you drink a lot, be prepared to wait your turn.
668	0	d	We had an absolutely wonderful experience here! It can get a bit pricey, but the quality of the food and the portions do not disappoint! Our bill came to around $150 (tip included) for appetizers, dinner and drinks for 4 (with leftovers to take home!).\n\nAutumn was our server and she was just splendid! She made thoughtful recommendations for both food and drinks, which was wonderful for our indecisive group! We had the margarita and the ___ which was a refreshing cucumber drink. Both were delicious!\n\nWe started with the Bean Dip and the Shrimp\/Avacado Bruschetta. The dip was great, served with crispy and seasoned house-made chips. Warning: The Bruschetta was delicious but VERY HOT. I knew there would be a hint of habnaero, but our mouths were on FIRE! \n\nOur server told us that each order comes with 3 tacos, but if we are splitting orders, they will give you 4 for no upcharge! That's a pretty amazing deal when the 3 tacos are already a very generous portion!\n\nWe heard the fish tacos were very popular, so we had to go with an order of those! I'm not normally a huge fan of fish tacos, but these were so enjoyable! It was topped with cabbage slaw and a spicy cream sauce. The fish was rich, but not overpowering.\n\nMy favorite part of the meal was the Tempura Avocado Bahn Mi Tacos! What a unique dish! The flavor was amazing and I can't wait to have them again! It was topped with carrot, radish,cilantro, yuzu mayo, & cucumber. Our server told us that they can add any type of protein to them, so we also had shrimp on them also. Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuum!\n\nThey serve their tacos on Reyna's tortillas, so I love the local aspect as well!\n\nI was very impressed with the quality of the food and the service. I'll definitely be going back!
669	1	d	$5.99 late night steak and eggs. If you can't afford that you must have gambled too hard or fell in love with a stripper.\n\nWe went around midnight and there was no wait to get seated. In fact there was almost nobody else there. It was a Sunday night though. The food came out at a reasonable time. I ordered medium rare for my steak and it came out exactly how I wanted it. And with a big bottle of A1 sauce by my side I could not have asked for a better dinner.
670	0	d	The atmosphere was good but the food was very average.  With so many Mexican restaurants on the west side I don't think I will be going back.
671	0	d	Humble Pie is the more fatty alternative compared to its rivals...Sauce, Fired Pie, etc.\n\nFor this reason, we tend to stick to the other two. All have tasty pizzas with Sauce having the thinest crust, but Humble's was too oily for us.
672	0	d	The white pizza and the Gnocci are amazing! Great customer service. Sit outside if weather permits.
673	1	d	Another doesn't-take-reservations, bourbon-soaked, cash-only haunt in Parkdale has popped up. Naturally, I'm in love, but the above qualities (aside from the bourbon cocktails) will keep them from tipping to a five star rating. But please, don't let my impatience with lines and inability to carry cash affect you getting your buns to Electric Mud and trying all of their deliciously drrrty* flavours. \n\nSeating is old school picnic tables, menus are over the cooking area on old-school boards, and you can see the staff working quickly from every seat in the house. Everything is hella cute and red tinged due to old fluorescent signs in the window. Also, they have a massive patio which will definitely be rockin' in the summer. \n\nWe sampled the entire menu, like, I'm seriously pretty sure we had at least 90% of it, and these were my faves: fried chicken, sheila salad (radishes and cream, yum!), crack buns (dinner roles served with butter whipped with meat drippings), and slaw. This fried chicken is now my favourite in the city, which is saying a lot, I heart me some Fry Fry Chicki Chick. I washed all of this down with a Clydesdale, which is bourbon and grapefruit and will now be Pepper's Drink for Summer 2013. \n\n*Remember this jam!? https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4Rg3sAb8Id8
674	1	d	I am sad to say that I've lived here since July and I had not yet been to a Malley's until this Saturday when Yelper M*$#@^% took me here to get my traditional Easter bunny that lives in the freezer until I choose to gnaw his head off.\n\nThis is some seriously good stuff!!  Managed to reel myself in and only got a few small morsels and they were gone by the next day (except for my freezer bunny because he's huge!).  Sampled the coconut haystacks, milk and dark chocolate-covered pretzels and the Malley Ohs.  Barely made it out of the parking lot before digging into them!\n\nNot the best chocolate I've ever had, but very satisfying indeed....and I consider myself a chocolate snob, yep, I'll admit to it.  ;o)  I'll be back to continue trying out a few of their other varieties....
675	0	d	They served us stale rice.  Average main dishes, not as flavorful.  Not enough meat in the lamb dishes.  Overpriced.
676	0	d	Beer is excellent, food was just ok. I really like their beer, so I go for that and just get a burger. Always crowded.
677	1	d	You're not yet finished savouring your fucking incredible baja fish tacos and fried cauliflower tacos, but your plate gets yanked from under your nose and now you're dripping pico de gallo into your delicious bourbon cocktail and the servers are giving you the general impression that as soon as you take your last precious bite of your last amazing taco, they want you to get the hell out, regardless of whether or not you plan to continue slamming bourbon cocktails in your uncomfortable miniature folding chair and awkwardly shouting with your new friends over the ridiculously loud, early 90s Ice Cube.
678	1	d	The food is great! It's the service that needs desperate attention.\n\nATTENTION OWNERS: We are not in Jerusalem. We are not in Tel Aviv. While I understand the laid back, casual, time consuming approach other cultures have,  I assure you most people will not. Neither will they yelp about it in an attempt to help you understand. They simply will not return.\n\nYou need to greet customers promptly, prepare the food in a reasonable time, and smile.  \n\nEvery time I am in your restaurant is a new adventure. There is ZERO consistency. Sometimes your service is ok, but most times it is plain aweful. What a shame, considering how delicious your food truly is.\n\nPlease fix your customer service problems so I can enjoy my experience, and find you open rather than out of business when I return. Shalom.
679	0	d	Great bar! Open late, cool vibe and delicious drinks! Went there at 2am and it just happened to be happy hour so the drinks were $5! My drink was nice and strong and the bar tender did all sorts of cool flare tricks like throwing and catching bottles! Definitely a fun place to check out in Vegas!
680	1	d	\"Burrito's are gods currency\"- Malcolm X\n\nI love Chipotle. There is never a time of it being bad.\nThe only thing you have to worry about in this location \nis them under-Meating you. There is a girl who works there\nwho assumes 1 strand of barbacoa is more than enough and 3 strands counts\nas double meat.  I haven't seen her lately so the government must have hired her to run our budgets once they figured out how stingy she was. \nMore often than not this isn't a problem with the other employees\nas everyone there seems to be aware of a decent meat situation.\n\nPros: Lovely taste, fresh ingredients, fast service and good napkins.\n\nCons: Diarrhea
681	1	d	One of the bonus features of Church St is the small-town friendly vibe that graces many of the businesses, and About Cheese is no exception. Wait, I don't think I'm raving as much as I think is necessary - About Cheese is amazing. I would live there if I could. I would get up in the morning and eat one of their earth-shattering chocolate croissants for breakfast, and then I would have a spruce beer & specialty grilled cheese sandwich for lunch. Then at about 4:30, I would snack on some buttery brie with one of the artisan (?) breads. I would have to force dinner, but the goudas and cheddars would be worth it. Don't even get me started on the cheese sticks. Cheese Nip crackers, I loved you once but now I frown upon you. It's probably a good thing I don't live here, because I'm watching my girlish figure.\n\nThe staff is amazing. They feed you like a grandmother and sometimes slip a loaf of bread your way if the place is about to close. They're highly knowledgeable about the vast selection, all of which is to die for. Imagine, I went for a year without cheese and here I am, some sort of fromage-aholic. Go in and be like, \"I would like a sassy goat cheese, please\" and they'll be all, \"why, try this and this andthisandthisandthis. This one's made by monks in silence, and this one is only made in February.\" It's the best.\n\nWell, I'm rambling. This is my cue. But before I go, let me recap the greatness:\n\n* Staff\n* Excellent bread and crisp collection\n* Unpasteurized cheeses available (ohhh-magod)\n* Grilled cheese sandwiches\n* Supposedly fantastic prosciutto, hand sliced\n\nOnly downside? Look to spend a few bucks. Once you start, you can't stop.
682	1	d	After my most recent visit, I have decided it's a 5 starrer. Actually, it's mostly because of the Mango Salad. It is prepared like a traditional papaya salad, but in the place of the thinly sliced papaya, you get to devour mango. And, I think it is far superior to papaya. The thoughtfulness, creativity and cravability of this dish is a perfect representation of Weera. I have had numerous notable Thai standards, like the green curry, but they really stand out by always having a little twist on the standards that are equally, if not more, delicious.
683	0	d	I eat here for lunch almost every single day. Just thinking about it makes me hungry. Is it lunch time yet?!
684	1	d	I went to this place once and the owner tried to sell me a large box, for shipping a guitar, for 30 dollars! My Wife has been in there before, and the Dude is really surly, terse & laconic. He has hired some youngsters who seem friendly and helpful- Had to pick up a fax from an insurance agent there recently- But, I wouldn't go out of my way to do any business there!
685	0	d	Renegade is a wonderful place to eat.  I went a few days ago and couldn't be more impressed with the food and friendly staff.  The Kobe beef sliders were incredible!  Great place to take family and friends.  You won't be disappointed!
686	1	d	My co worker talks about this place all the time so we came here for lunch. \n\nIt wasn't too busy during the day. I didn't think the customer service was that great. The girl that rang me up seemed like she didn't really want to be there. No smile or anything. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with spam and added corn. I also had a taro milk tea with boba. I thought the ramen noodles and broth were good. The downfall for me was I felt like there wasn't a lot of toppings offered. Most places the ramen will come with an egg and some sort of pork. But those were both extra. I'm also used to ordering some sort of krackling or pork belly which they also didn't have. So I felt there wasn't a lot of variety when it came to that. \n\nThe price is reasonable and it's a good portion but I wouldn't say it's the best ramen in town.
687	0	d	We have had a home warranty with National Home Warranty for 10 years!  We are truly satisfied with customer service and repair service. If something is broken that is covered in our policy they repair or replace it without any problems. It's been well worth paying our annual dues as we have used their service several times over. With a house there is something that always needs to be repaired and it's nice to have that piece of mind. Other home warranty companies we've used on past properties have they never seemed to honor their contract. I would highly recommend them!
688	1	d	I love this tanning salon! They have great beds and offer awesome products! I used the extreme bed which is a stand up bed and I can honestly say, \"there is no bed that beats that one!\" Some of my friends have tried their spray tanning and they really like the products they offer.
689	0	d	If you're somebody who's working on their anger and you are a violent person do not use them you will want to strangle everybody involved they are POS
690	1	d	Good service, but not so great food.\n\nThis was a decent place to hang out with the Hubster. We were both a little hungry, so he got the burger, which was fine, and I got the mussels, which were incredibly salty. \n\nEverything else about this place was unremarkable.
691	0	d	Kathy is a truly gifted hair stylist. You tell her you want and it happens. She cuts my curly hair to perfection. And she can also cut and style straight hair, long hair, anything you've got!  You can trust her to do right by your hair.
692	0	d	Had the short ribs, skirt steak and potatoes and octopi was exceptionally good flavor and cooked to perfection. The   was great because we utilized uber eats so it was delivered to our door by a friendly uber driver. Can't wait to head over to the physical location and check out the ambience there.
693	1	d	3.5 Stars. I normally stay at the strip but thought I tried something new. I arrived at the hotel too early around noon but the agent offered me a mountain view since these rooms were available before normal check in. The strip view rooms will be ready at 3 so I decided just wait. You can leave your luggage with the bell staff so that's exactly what I did while I explored the surroundings. This building is connected to Palms Hotel Casino via moving skywalk. There's plenty free of parking outside and indoor garage.\n\nMy room was pretty enormous. 2 LCD tvs (one in front of bed & one for the living area), nice comfy king bed, separate sitting area, writing desk, modern artsy lighting fixtures, fully equipped kitchen w\/ mini bar, 3 spacious closets, jet tub, rain shower and another small tv in bathroom vanity.\n\nThe room was clean but floors were a little dusty. One of the TVs didn't power at all and I called front desk, maintenance came but they were not able to fix it. I also called about 2 lamps fixtures in the living room that had bulbs out but they also didn't fix them. There was a decent size balcony but only permanent residents can unlock the sliding door. The front desk told me that hotel guest were not allowed on the balcony...maybe for safety reasons but that's a lame excuse. Internet was a little challenging to connect and allowed only certain amount of data access which was weird. If I wanted more data, then I have to pay extra on top of the daily resort fee. On my last day, one of the shower handles came off loose (see pic) but I didn't bother calling the front desk about it cause I was checking out.\n\nOverall, it was nice comfortable stay. This hotel was modern and had nice amenities. I just think housekeeping or maintenance should be inspecting rooms thoroughly before guest arrives. This hotel being off the strip, for the price I paid & minor kinks, I'd rather stay at the strip and pay a bit more for a smaller modern room.
694	0	d	Absolutely the best sushi roll I've ever had in my life! The \"Sean Spicer\" roll. The staff was friendly and fast and seriously the best King Crab ever!
695	0	d	I gave this place a second try after a rough start the first go round. The food was great the first time but service a bit spotty. After conversing with manager and his staff, about our first experience they went  out of their way to make the second go round flawless. Definitely worth checking out.
696	0	d	Some of the best pasta I've had. \n\nI've been here three times, and the pasta has always been cooked perfectly, not either chewy or mushy. I tried all my friends pastas as well with similar results. This place definitely knows their way around pasta. \n\nThe sauces are both innovative and delicious, a perfect complement to the pasta. The seasoning is very far from traditional; they err on the side of flavoring things more strongly than in the subtle way you might find with a more classical Italian dishes. \n\nEither way, it's great stuff.
697	0	d	Grab that dog by the ears and Wolf it down Angry kimchi dog! I think that says it all.
698	0	d	First time at new place in my neighborhood. Love the decor and 80s theme (was an 80s teenager). We had the scallops, frittes, mushrooms, and skirt steak.  All were well prepared, well presented, great portion size for sharing.   Delicious w lots of flavor.  The apple tart for dessert was huge and delicious.  Love the music and movies.  Good beer and wine selection. Excellent service, Susan (I believe that was her name) was witty and helpful with the menu.   Definitely coming back.
699	1	d	The gf booked the Signature at MGM Grand for our one day\/one night staycation.  It was my birthday weekend and yes, she spoils me.  So, when it comes down to price, I don't know if this was a great deal or not.  However, by reading other reviews, a stay here isn't bad at all.  \n\nI don't do hit up the strip as much as I use to.  But when I do, I love to play tourist.  Staying here was convenient since we also had plans to walk the strip, hit up a few tourist spots, gamble a little, and of course, eat. You get the best of both worlds with the Signature.  You're close to the strip, but you won't feel like it once your in your room.  \n\nSo here are my highlights:\n-Great staff\n-Parking\/Valet.  Valet will usually have free bottles of water in case you need some hydration. \n-Security\n-Smoke Free\n-Spacious Rooms with a kitchen\n-Huge bathroom equipped with a nice sized tub and shower\n-Free fitness room.  They have free-weights too, but only up to 50 lbs. \n-Walkways straight into the MGM.  \n-Three Towers\n-Happy Hour\n-Starbucks\n-My favorite...the rowdy \"Vegas Baby!\" crowds are non-existent\n\nI had a good time and a great weekend.  It also helps that my stay at the Signature was comfortable.  Yes, I recommend the Signature at MGM.\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (022\/366)
700	1	d	This place would have been 1 - 2 stars if my son hadn't enjoyed the unlimited rides.  We went to Fry's and got the family pack for $67 which included 2 adult passes, 2 child passes and 2 unlimited ride wrist bands.  We ended up giving one of the child passes to someone in line buying tickets since we only had 1 child.  The festival is quite large with tons of food vendors and a lot of rides.  \n\nThere is one booth there that sells their souvenir cups for $5 and then you can come back for free refills - they have about 4 different flavored lemonades (strawberry, blueberry, regular and mango) out on the table, and you can walk up and refill your cup.  If you need more ice, they'll gladly put more in for you.  The lemonades are a little bland, but for free, it's worth every penny considering the other food vendors charge $2.50 for refills.  \n\nAs the evening wore on, the lines for the adult rides got extremely long that it wasn't worth the wait.  The kiddie rides had about a 5-10 minute wait depending on what ride you wanted to go on.\n\nAs for the ostrich?  I thought this was an ostrich festival - at the VERY far end of the park, there is a fence with TWO ostrich in them.  That's it.  Just 2.  You could see more ostriches if you went to the ostrich race, but you have to get there to get a seat at least 45 min before the race or you won't be able to see a thing.  We later saw that they were selling ostrich burgers...maybe that's why there were only 2 ostrich on display.  \n\nOverall, this was basically a miniature version of the state fair.  I wouldn't drive all the way from North Phoenix to go to it again considering we thought we'd see more ostrich with more ostrich-like activities.  But like I said, our son enjoyed all the rides and the smile on his face was enough for us.
701	0	d	Really Fantastic. Not sure why the reviews only say average. Beautiful modern Mediterranean  ambiance overlooking the strip. Awesome food. Very fresh. Finely detailed. Incredible prefix for lunch, great value. More of a refined Mediterranean fish restaurant with fine Greek undertones. Not Greek. Anyway. I defiantly recommend it. I don't know how you could possibly be disappointed.
702	1	d	I like the location but this place is totally overpriced and the Customer Service SUCKS!!!! I feel is that not up to par. The guys at the cashier especially!! I feel like they're doing you a favor and are not Very Friendly at all!!!! They don't smile theirs no eye contact in fact I was waiting a few mins at the cash register while this young dude put stuff away. So annoying and didn't even look up. How rude! \nI asked when a product would be in and no one knows or even cares. How come no one smiles????  I feel little bit uncomfortable at times when I'm in there. Not like other record stores I've been in around the world when you walk in your chilled you're relaxed it's a good vibe don't feel that at this place at all! \n\nI go for the used selection now cause I don't want to spend my $ there being its so over priced. My advice if is if your job is customer service then do your job. There's a lot of other record stores I could spend my $ in. Not just yours.....We'll see how long they last. Can someone in their crack a smile please. Not a good vibe. Won't be back.
703	0	d	Sitting here eating my huge portion of steak nachos.  The nachos chips are crispy pita chips with seasoning.  Actually pretty good.  The nachos come with certain toppings, but they don't tell you what,  and you have to pay $1.00 extra if you want something else added on.  I had to pay for rice, hummus, olives, extra garlic sauce, etc.  I was not expecting this because the place I usually go to in Henderson is same price for a bowl no matter how many ingredients you add.  \nThe place is very small and they don't have a good flow.  It is Chipolte style service but very crammed.  There was a huge line but the workers were trying to fill call in and delivery orders at the same time.\nI'm only giving 2 stars for the following reasons....paying extra for toppings, serving romaine lettuce during an e-coli outbreak, and the confusing ordering process.  They earned the 2 stars for the fact that there beef and chicken are cooked and served from a spit and the portions are very generous.
704	1	d	Eversince So Good Cafe closed down, I needed a new Vietnamese sandwich Cafe joint to plop myself down in. THANK GOD this place opened up right at the same time. Everything is made fresh, onsite, and quite delicious. I love the minutia and the obscure dishes offered at this joint. I also love to support the owner\/chef because they season their food with love. The pride and customer service do make a tremendous difference in the quality of their product. Nice job, I hope you last and continue to work towards improving your quality. The rest will fall into place.
705	1	d	I am not a coffee guy but i have some co-workers who love Starbucks so I have started to visit them on occasion for social reasons or easy to find meeting spots.  I think the beverage prices are crazy but I have to admit that the quality is always high and the service is always good - except for this spot.\n\nThe guy behind the register seemed to be offended that I was taking up his time telling him what I would like to order.  Either that or by the look on his face, he was experiencing cramps.  \n\nI ordered a macha green tea latte (cuz i don't drink coffee), a choco croissannt and a new breakfast item that they were featuring that was double smoked bacon, cheddar and an egg sandwich.  \n\nMy choco pastry was ready first and it was stale and hard at 7:30AM.  I know that they want to heat it up - but that wouldn't have disguised the lack of freshness.  The sandwich had a good smoke but little salt on the bacon (that may be the first time I have ever said that in my life), the cheddar was tasteless and the bread also didn't appear to be all that fresh. \n\nMy drink assemblers created a lovely looking Mocha latte and then knocked it over as I was telling them it was  green-tea macha.  They guy picked it up and tried to give it to me anyways - and I kind of insisted it was the wrong color for a green tea.  \n\nTo give the folks credit, they did make me a new one super fast.  But as I drank it, it just tasted like milk and most of the green tea flavoring was stuck to the bottom of my cup.\n\nI won't be back.
706	0	d	Went there again for lunch.  The selection was VERY poor with huge sections of the conveyor belt being empty.  Thankfully, if you asked the chefs, they prepared whatever we wanted.  I am not sure why the selection wasn't out on the conveyor but, we still got what we wanted and it was delicious.
707	1	d	I've been to this particular Outback twice in the past week due to Scottish family in town who are OBSESSED with this place\n\nThey're Scottish, who knows....\n\nWell, at first I was skeptical.  But I thought the food was suprisingly tasty!\n\nThe second time, I'M IN LOVE!\n\nI LOVE OUTBACK\n\nSweet chain steakhouse, how I love thee.\n\nI swear their stupid horseradish crusted filet was just as good as the damned Flemings\/RuthsChris\/Mortons filets.  I was impressed.\n\nDamn good green beans too.\n\nI love.
708	1	d	I tried restaurant again and had great service and food. I understand sometimes a restaurant runs out of item. I ordered the pastrami sandwich and onion rings and it was great.
709	1	d	I usually love this pizza but the poor choice of crispy chicken ruined this meal.  The chicken was over cooked, tough and salty.  I waited over 20 minutes for this order.  \n\nThe cannoli was perfection but small for the $2.49 cost.  \n\nI was unable to separate the burnt pizza from the cheese, so into the trash it went.  What a $14 waste.  Their pizza is usually amazing, and the wait is rarely this long.
710	1	d	Yelp does a good job hiding fake Reviews (such as those written by the owner under fake names) so the 12 positive reviews that yelp determine to be FAKE speaks volumes about the ethic of your business.\n\nThe agencies you alleged to have won awards with are not \"nationally acclaimed\" but 3rd and even 4th tiered groups with ZERO CREDIBILITY. \n\nIf you don't believe me when I said that the owner is pretentious, snooty, egotistic then just read the laughable FAKE response to me by the owner.\n\nAnd Nope not the guy that called. I identify as a cisgendered female.
711	0	d	I have been coming to Khourys for the past 8 yrs And Issa and his staff have never steered me wrong. It is great to have a place that gets Toni ow you and also know wine and beer and does a great job matching beverage to occasion. If you need a beverage to take along to a party just give the staff your price pint and they will find you a great beer or wine everyone will love.  And with the additional bar area it is great to stoop n and have a great glass of beer or wine and catch up.
712	1	d	Very poor presentation, extremely dissatisfied with the product. Our company placed an order of 150 cupcakes for a major event in the Tolleson area, where Government officials would be present. The company supervisor and manager both met with the Pixy Cakes employee to specifically discuss what was expected for the event. The week before the event we find out the wrappers were out of stock that were to be the main focus of the food table, Pixy Cakes did not offer to search elsewhere for the wrappers so i had to take time out of my work day to google the wrappers, find a vendor and call to see if they have them in stock and then call Pixy Cakes to inform them of it. The day before the event we went by the bakery to see if we could get a sneak peak of the cupcakes or the 6inch top tier cake--the main focus of the food table as i said, but it was not ready yet. The morning of the event the cupcakes are delivered with the top tier. It was so embarrassing they should have not even been put out on the table. The top tier was to be bright red fondant with the edible company logo-- supposedly the machine wasn't working the day before so regular frosting with barely covering it in red frosting was used and it that were not embarrassing enough, the logo....it was a Xerox copy of paper placed on the top! it was horrible!!!! then the cupcakes....despite the great taste, the edible logo toppers were not used and the logo was put on a sticker and placed on the wrapper. now one would think if putting a sticker on the wrapper were to be done it would be done nicely. nope, Pixy Cakes just slapped on a sticker, any way they could, sideways not even straight as if a drunk person had done it. all this for a $500 order? downright, embarrassing. So all i have to say is that if you use this company......be careful! because if it is for a serious event then you might be in trouble. i would have take a picture to verify all this but it was that embarrassing that i couldn't even photograph it.
713	0	d	Honestly, the best gun store in Vegas. I finally purchased my first pistol and had no idea what I was looking for or where to start. The guys at Spartan Arms patiently walked me through all of the basics. Most gun shops would talk down to me since I was new to the whole gun thing but, not Spartan Arms. By far the best customer service I have seen in this industry. I walked out with a Sig P320 and couldn't be happier. I will be a Spartan Arms customer for life! Thank you Spartan Arms!
714	0	d	I worked at several Applebee's throughout college so I got a little burnt out on them. However, my parents love to eat there. I like to believe it reminds them of me. Yet I know the real reason is the Weight Watchers menu. I ordered the garlic steak, medium. It came with side of baked new potatoes and large mushroom cap stuffed with spinach and little bit of Parmesan cheese. Everything was bland except for the steak. The steak was tender and flavorful. Not bad for $12.49. It's barely above fast food, but I'll probably return for their Weight Watchers menu.
715	1	d	*Minus 1\/2-star because I was cheated on the fries and the sandwich didn't live up to the hype.*\n\nThe Good:  awesome tomatoes in the pickle platter; homemade grainy mustard; the font on the menu (I'm a details person); black cherry soda; our sweet-as-pie waitress \n\nThe Bad: the fries (somehow managed to be soggy AND burnt at the same time); the slaw\n\nThe Mediocre: the smoked meat; the rye\n\nMaybe it was the excess of spilt review ink, or the former mayor of Toronto gushing shamelessly about Caplansky's on TVO, or because I grew up in the Jewish neighborhoods of Brooklyn and was practically weaned on corned beef on rye...but I don't get what all the fuss is about. \n\nMy 7-oz. smoked meat sandwich with \"medium\" fattiness was fine, if a little on the dry\/shreddy side. I so wanted the meat to be transcendent, something approaching the magic of Katz's Deli in NYC. Heck, when I consume something that's gonna clog up my arteries that much, it better be pretty friggin' spectacular. Sadly, Caplansky's smoked meat was just all right, and the insipid rye that came with it was not helping matters.\n\nThe S.O. and I agreed that the fries were an abomination. After a few bites, I looked carefully at the basket of mangled ropes of tater and wondered, \"Are these regular fries or sweet potato fries?\" Shame on the fry cook; that's no way to treat a potato.\n\nWhat really made our meal was our waitress. She was exuberant without being annoying, and attentive without being effusive. If they made a movie about Caplansky's the role of our waitress would be played by Amy Adams. \n\nI dunno. Maybe my Montreal-transplant friend was right: You can't get good smoked meat in Toronto.
716	0	d	The most amazing restaurant in Summerlin.... They even have a few video poker machines.  The drinks are terrific and it's a local hotspot!
717	1	d	Dined on a Saturday evening and this place was dead with only one table occupied. Came based on the very positive reviews and location at Village Square on Sahara is near home.\n\nService was attentive but wouldn't categorize it as warm and friendly.  We didn't get water refills until the end of the meal and when we finally asked.  Food came out quickly - hot foods hot.\n\nAdults got the AYCE option. Kids opted for a chicken katsu kids meal and ala carte shrimp tempura and salmon sashimi. Sashimi was $11 and seemed spendy for the three pieces. \n\nMost of the sushi here is pretty mediocre. Not bad, but it's not knock your socks off.  The \"creative\" rolls like The Sunset were unimaginative and just alright.  We got an order of spicy tuna nachos. Guess we should've known based on the menu (see picture), but it was literally a heaping mound of spicy tuna served with something like sriracha mayo and Tostitos Scoops (yes, straight from the bag of Scoops that you would eat with jarred salsa). The spicy in the tuna wasn't even mixed evenly as the bottom of the lump was spicier than the top.\n\nThe honey toast is a poor representation of this great Japanese dessert. It was not Japanese bakery bread but a piece of King's Hawaiian sweet roll. The ice cream wasn't vanilla like described. It was more like a yuzu sorbet, but I thought it was better than vanilla ice cream. The sorbet was the best thing we had that night.\n\nOne of the tips mentioned the bench seating for each table. Not ideal but it wasn't too bad.\n\nDoubt we'll be back here despite the convenience. There are many other AYCE joints in town to choose from which you'll leave much more satisfied.
718	1	d	I never received any services from AZ Lash Lady. Her terrible customer service is what drives this review. \n\nI decided last minute to get eyelash extensions for my brother's wedding. I was happy to see the google reviews of this place and saw you can pre-pay on-line, which I did to speed up service. It had not occurred to me that there may be no available appointments. This part is definitely my fault. \n\nWhen Shawn found out she could not fit my schedule, she basically begged me to come in. Offering to move appointments around, which still would not help me. She then left a voicemail asking me to cancel or move my hair appointment, just so I could book with her. Um...that is not the way to do customer service, it's just weird and frankly off-putting. When she couldn't fit my schedule, I asked her multiple times to give me a refund for my deposit, to which she ignored and kept trying to find ways to get me to come in. So, she finally admits to defeat and says she will give me a refund. The next day, my refund is minus $2.50. When I e-mailed her about it, she explains that she was merely deducting the fee that paypal placed on her and that normally deposits are non-refundable. This does state this on the website, and I missed it, that again, is my fault. She also offered to send me a check for $2.50, as her apology. However, I declined, as this was already way too much work for a service never rendered.\n\nBottom line is that you failed to mention that the deposit was non-refundable, as you were too busy begging for my business. You cannot suggest a brand NEW client move around their own schedule, so that you can grab their business. When you tell someone you are refunding them, at least notify them that you are not refunding the entire amount. I am sure you do a great job on lashes, but customer service is always first and foremost.
719	1	d	Three times is not a charm, between dinner and lunches... it's ok and I'll keep chugging over here if someone is asking to go... but nothing memorable... I've been across the menu from duck to seafood to noodle dishes and curry.  \n\nIf you like hot and spicy, they will go the mile and this place will be for you!
720	0	d	This is such a great relaxing place to get your pedi. The ladies here are awesome! They are friendly, personable and all about making sure you get what you came for.
721	0	d	Love love love! Great produce and the best gluten free selection around! I love their produce department which is always very fresh and plentiful. I LIVE for the 25% gluten free sale offered about 3X a year.
722	1	d	Loftti has the raindrop dessert?! \n\nMy friends and I actually came here the first or second week of their opening just because I wanted to try their dessert. I've seen this dessert in a restaurant in NYC and have been wanting to try it!\n\nThe location of Loftti is where Monster Café used to be at I believe. It's kinda in a weird spot -- tucked to the side of the plaza. Once you walk in, the colors and decors give off a very vintage yet modern feel. They have a couch in the middle and an abstract bookcase by the back. \n\nAside from the raindrop dessert, I decided to try out their frozen salted caramel latti while my friend tried their coconut latti. Their salted caramel latti was actually quite good. It had tinges of saltiness at the end of the drink after the sweetness has hit you. It wasn't overly cavity causing sweet, and I appreciate that greatly. My friend was only so-so on his coconut latti. It was a huge heavy coconut flavor to it ... almost seems artificial. \n\nAs for the raindrop dessert .. well, there isn't much to say with that. It does come with roasted sesame powder and brown syrup. The dessert itself is just flavorless jelly. It's made with gelatin and agave so .. really, you're just tasting the powder and the syrup. Not that great and not something I would get again. It was fun to poke it and jiggle it around though. \n\nOverall, an okay place. I can't say that I'm in love. I also can't say that they have anything for me to keep coming back for. But I think it'd be nice to hang out here.
723	1	d	AVOID AT ALL COSTS. 3 words to describe this place: UNPROFESSIONAL, UNTRUSTWORTHY, and UNETHICAL. I went with my mom to turn her lease into a purchase and it was a horrible experience that resulted in us walking out less than 30 minutes after arriving. My mom left this place literally in tears. The staff we worked with here (management and salesmen) are absolutely deplorable and should not be trusted.\n\nWhen she originally went there in September 2013, they badgered her into leasing car that was not right for her. Hearing that they recently changed management, she wanted to give them a second shot and head back to them to see if she could turn her lease into a purchase. Being that I am in the Commercial Banking industry, she asked me to come along to help her 'wheel and deal' with the salesmen and to guard against any shady lending\/sales practices. \n\nAfter talking with the sales manager, Jeremiah D., for several minutes about the different superfluous fees that he said were associated with changing over the lease, he became rather upset that we were not budging on our position. He then asked us why we didn't trust him, to which I said that he has not done anything to earn our trust because he has already lied to us about several of the exorbitant fees (which I referenced the lease contract and several AZ state statutes that I pulled up on my phone). To that he replied, \"Well if you don't trust me, then we don't have to do business with you.\"\n\nI was in utter disbelief. He was so angry that we were not going to let him take advantage of us as they had in the past that he completely shut down and became defiant. At that point, I told him that we were going to take our business elsewhere. The reason we came in today was because we had heard that the management had changed, but obviously that was not enough to change the attitudes and customer service of the staff. He then stood up and stormed away.\n\nFeeling very uneasy about the entire situation I decided I was going to try and call him later in the day when he had a chance to cool off, so I asked the salesman we originally worked with for his business card. After about 10 minutes, the salesman came back with a business card for Ren L., the Assistant Sales Manager. I took a look at it and, because I did not recognize the name, asked if the man we were dealing with in-person earlier was the person on the card. She said it wasn't and that the person on the card no long works here. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. After being treated so abrasively here by Jeremiah D., they had the audacity to give us a card of an ex-employee in hopes that I wouldn't remember his name after I had specifically asked for the manager's card. It was enough at that point to send my mom into tears. I was in shock. Talk about a parlor trick.\n\nNeedless to say, after we grabbed the Jeremiah D.'s real card, we immediately left the dealership. But they couldn't resist following us out into the parking lot, trying to reel us back to the table to negotiate (which certainly felt like a last-ditch effort to stop my mom from crying in front of other customers).\n\nAfter we recollected emotionally and mentally, we made a quick phone call to AutoNation Nissan Tempe to make an appointment to get it changed over there. They were able to help us with no problems and with no badgering\/shameful behavior of any type.\n\nThis is the most UNPROFESSIONAL, UNTRUSTWORTHY, and UNETHICAL dealership I have ever worked with. I am still in shock with the experience we received and I would never recommend anyone ever attempt to purchase\/lease a car here, period.
724	0	d	Went to Bradshaw today and it was pretty good. I had the Barb-B-Cuban and it was really good combination.  My daughter and wife's salad were a little heavy with dressing but good.  The other daughter enjoyed the fried chicken. I would go back....
725	0	d	Had the jerk fried rice and the milder jerk chicken and it was AMAZING! By far one of the best places I've gotten food in Phoenix its a small location but very very good!
726	0	d	I love this place !!!cool people only been there twice but each time was quite memorable... Great chill good vibes at this place !!!
727	1	d	I'm the kind of woman who likes to get things done herself. \n\nDaddy didn't raise what we call a \"pretty (and) useless\" woman  - You know the type I'm talking about, right? Can't do anything mechanical on her own, and those social media pictures of a home cooked meal? Probably also fake. But hey ... She's nice to look at, right? That counts! ;)\n\nI can change my own oil and filters, and you definitely won't see me calling for help to change or rotate tires.  And yes, I also wash, wax, and clean my own vehicle.  \n\nIf you want the job done right, you'll do it yourself. \n\nYet this week, my time is at a premium and my Toyota RAV4 was looking like a filth trap both inside and out from weeks of work driving and time spent out on dusty job sites.  \n\nPlus it's scorching hot outside. Hard pass! \n\nSuper hesitant, I drove to Cobblestone Auto Spa on my lunch. My last experience with a car wash was in 2015.\n\nDrove into the lane for Full Service Washes, and was promptly greeted by a very friendly gentleman. \n\nAsked what type of wash I wanted. Decided to go with the Supreme ($21.99). \n\nThis wash includes: \n\n1. Interior Vacuum\n2. Dust Dash and Console\n3. Hand Towel and Dry \n4. Window Cleaning \n5. Soft Cloth Wash \n6. Tire Dressing \n7. Wheel Cleaner\n8. Air Freshener \n\nI opted to skip the air freshener. \n\nGot my ticket, paid inside at the register. Used a $2 off coupon I found on the Cobblestone website, and it brought the wash down to $19.99.  \n\nClean, air conditioned waiting area with the obligatory camera view of your mechanical baby going through the wash. \n\nThis is also a Chevron, so you can purchase a variety of beverages, snacks, car accessories, etc. \n\nOnce your vehicle is ready (took almost 30 minutes on this particularly busy afternoon), they'll call you out to the \"finish line\". \n\nBring your claim ticket and don't forget to tip the crew. \n\nMy whip was SPOTLESS inside and out I was super impressed at the time these guys took to get the wheels super clean. \n\nAnd vacuuming? One of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to car washes is the vacuum job is almost always half assed. \n\nNot at Cobblestone! No major dust violations to be found; they even cleaned up the small BCAA powder spill I had in the cargo area. \n\nThe only reason I'm deducting a star? Glass Repair Salesmen. Look, I understand nothing happens for a business without a sale. \n\nBut when one of these guys is hawk-eying the wash line to see if you have a tiny windshield crack like I did ... And they follow you inside? \n\nNot ok. Feels like a walking pop up ad! \n\nThanks for getting my whip sparkly clean, Cobblestone - I'll be back anytime I'm in a bind for time. And possibly throughout our relentlessly hot summers!
728	0	d	Defiantly recommend! We were able to get same day service, great price and Omar is very professional.
729	0	d	We love this place. The food is outstanding a great place to the in-laws for wine and fine food. There is not a bad thing on the menu. Service has always been on point.
730	0	d	I dream about the Earl!  Holiday Turkey is amazing!  The bread is so fresh you can watch it being baked right there. These sandwiches are like none other. Come hungry. You'll want to finish every bite.
731	0	d	I was only in town visiting and came for one workout, but they still personalized the session (with a very reasonable drop-in rate). Happy holidays and best wishes to the awesome, attentive staff :)
732	1	d	I've tried to give this McDonalds a chance but my patience has run out. The only reason why I came here as much as I did is because I like the $1 iced coffees. But it's not even worth it. This McDonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. \n\nWhenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. So most of the time I just park and go inside the restaurant. \n\nToday was a horrible day. I ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,\"Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you!\" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  I refused because I had just had enough.\n\nThere are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on!\n\nI'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore. Guess I'll be going to Starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway!
733	0	d	I have stayed with this family of resorts twice in orlando twice in weston and once in Virginia.  The property have always been top notch till the grandview it just as others have said the mirror and a lamp in room ha d been broke in many pieces and glued back toghther  we ordered a walker to be in our room on arrival a month in advance called two days before ariving and again the day of arrival and we're told we were set when we arrived at 2 30 am the front desk said it up stairs we will have security deliver it right away at 900 am I called front desk still had not arrived come to find out it wasn't even on property yet. Signs out front everywhere telling you you can only park for 15 minutes during check in. It would be great if there check in process only took 15 minutes but it doesn't so why the signs you control how long were in there the claim to be handicap friendly resort  but they have 3 handicap spots per a 500  rooms  building There as activity daily are the same three things each day trio to grocery shop pool pictures and craps lesson day after day after day no kids or adult activities as you would expect at a first rate time share
734	0	d	We found this place one Saturday afternoon while looking for somewhere to eat. When we got to the door, there were workers going in and out. We thought they weren't open and we were about to leave. The hostess who greeted us was really nice. The food was great. It was the best family style restaurant that we've ever been to. The whole restaurant looked fancy. We've been there 3 times since they've opened. You won't be disappointed.  The staff members were all awesome. Love this place so far!!!
735	1	d	There are hundreds of shows in Las Vegas but when you factor in kids, 99% of the shows come off the list. We went to the Tournament of Kings in the Excalibur Hotel.\n\n\"Use your fork, use your inside voice, don't talk when you're eating, slow down and chew your food.\" - Parents\n\nAt the Tournament of Kings , there are no forks (or spoons or knives), they ask you to (frequently) yell at the top of your lungs and pound the table, and you better eat quick because, like microwavable popcorn, if nothing happens for 2-3 seconds they'll take your food whether you're finished or not. \n\nOnce inside, keep your wallet out, because there are plenty of extras to pay for: alcohol (around $6 for a beer), light up swords for the kids ($12), and the woman who takes photos of everyone while they're eating ($35 for two pics). On the one hand it's annoying. On the other hand - I got all three. \n\nAll in all, the kids had a blast (OK, I did too), it was an entertaining show, the food was actually pretty good, and the service was excellent. And the price - $262 for four people (not including the extras) - was comparatively good, especially since that included dinner.
736	1	d	Went on a date with my hubs and for the longest time I've wanted to come here. However, at the time I had no idea how to eat hotpot so I promised myself I should just give it a go!\n\nI don't think I need to to explain the process because my fellow Yelpers did a wonderful job at that. So I'll talk about my experience and what I ordered.\n\nWhat was exceptional is the service. EVERYONE is so nice! The host even gave us a laminated card explaining how long each food item will cook for. He even took the time to explain to us how he and other customers prefer to cook their food. Over time he said you'll learn what style of hotpot eater you are. \n\nFor me, I am a dumper. I don't cook and eat as I go. I dump. And then when it's done I eat. My husband puts what add-ins he wants at the time cooks and eats. He is very neat whereas I like to get into it. Overall the experience is fun and a great way to enjoy conversation and company with friends and family.\n\nMy favorite items (in random order):  white base soup, lamb, fried tofu skin, sponge tofu, shrimp and fish balls, all the mushrooms, fatty beef, daikon radish, ramen noodles.\n\nItems I want to try:  bean curd sticks, lunch meat (I'm guess it's spam), chrysanthemum greens, potato, winter melon, fried fish cake, fried tofu, hot pot dumplings, and scallion pancake\n\nLastly, the sauces. If u have the right sauce your experience will be that much better. I like to add sesame paste, shacha, minced garlic, cilantro, soy sauce, and vinegar. \nI saw other condiments like MSG but passed. I know that's the secret ingredient in most Asian cooking. My grandma swore by it and used to put it in everything.\n\nAnyways, I definitely recommend trying out their hot pot. For $19.99 AYCE, it's a steal!
737	0	d	Terrible customer service! I stopped by before my flight to the US, and waited about 10 min at the bar before being served. While their selection of food appeared appetizing I never got to try my food! After placing my order I waited about 25 min for it before I couldn't wait anymore and had to board. When I told the waitress I had to leave I wasn't even offered an apology!\n\nThe service here is disgraceful. Do not even attempt visiting unless you've got hours to waste before your flight!
738	0	d	It was our first time on Brenden Theatres and the whole family enjoyed it we bought the $5 Movie Monday ticket online what a deal!! I must say the seats weren't comfortable though but other than that it was worth it.
739	0	d	Every time I fly out of CLT, I get a bite to eat and a glass of wine here.  The smoked salmon sandwich is really tasty and their breakfast options are solid. The service is attentive and friendly. It's not cheap, of course, but for airport food, it's pretty good!
740	1	d	My friend and I decided to try Takeda Thai  after her reading glowing reviews of this ethnic establishment.  So on a weekday lunch we decided to give it a try.  At around noon only one other table was occupied.  We both decided to order the green curry with chicken as that's one of our favorite Thai dishes.  When the dishes were brought out, we were dumbfounded at the small proportions on the plate\/bowl..(see accompanying picture- using a spoon for sauce depth reference. The vegetables in the picture look sufficient enough, but that's because I spread the mound of them out in the bowl.)  We decided not to bring this issue up but when the check arrived my friend mentioned to the waiter how SMALL the portion was for the price - $7.99 and explained that at Thai House - located very near to this establishment - portions were much more generous - take-out being in a quart container for $9.99.  The waiter (who was actually the owner, as he told us) said:  \"It's a lunch\" -although that was not denoted on the menu - which was kind of confusing in itself.  Then he said:  \"You want MORE???   I'm the owner, I can give you all you want.\"  We agreed to that.  When the entrée came out, there was only one entree instead of the expected two - and two plates were put down  - his expectation that we would SHARE the one entree!!  The portion was just as small.  When my friend examined the check, he CHARGED for the additional serving!  \nIn addition, we both had Thai tea that ratcheted up  the bill another $8.  I've usually paid around $2.50 at other Thai restaurants for Thai tea.  Needless to say, we won't be going back there - ever!  $42. (including tip - don't ask me WHY she left a tip) was way too pricey for an afternoon lunch.  I might add that 3 small bowls of soup were ordered for a child that was with us - those at only  65 cents each.  One dessert touted as \"homemade\" - coconut ice cream was $5.95.  You can see a picture of that if you type Takeda Thai into Yelp's search bar.  Looks like the serving is one scoop :(  \n\nPost Script....I thought I could add a pic to this review but turns out I can't
741	1	d	So far, so good!  I unintentionally sat on my Maui Jim sunglasses after they fell behind my head while lounging on a cruise ship in the Caribbean, and within a day both sides fell off.  So, when I returned to Nevada, my optometrist referred me to Frame Fixer after it was determined that any repair was beyond that shop's capability.  And thus far Frame Fixer has come through.  My only gripe is that I made a 1-1\/2 hour round trip for nothing before having to return the next day to retrieve my repaired frames.  A sign in the window said the store was closed for 4 days while the proprietor is attending a wedding.  Next time I will call ahead to make sure a dropped off frame is ready for pick up, and the establishment is open.\n\nI am now en route to Spain via the Atlantic Ocean on another cruise ship, and so far my repaired sunglasses frames (with new hinges) have held up nicely.  If this proves true for the whole trip and beyond, I will likely raise this rating to five stars.  Time will tell!
742	1	d	I tried Rocky's last night on recommendation from my neighbor. We were standing around the front yard, talking about life, car odors, birds as neighbor John drank a 40. If you ever want to join the conversation, drive down W 10th St on a sunny day and chances are, some of us will be out there doing things like this. I kept getting flustered because a swallow kept swooping down and trying to pick at my skull. My neighbor thought it was the funniest thing ever. Running from this bird combined with partying built up a deep hunger. He advised that I try Rocky's in Parma. I did and once again, my weekend pizza advisor John was right! He is more than a neighbor, he is a father figure. The pizza was thick and filling. They use a decent pizza oven and it develops a nice crispy crust. The sauce, cheese and toppings were all great together. This is one of my new, most exciting discoveries in life.
743	1	d	(Lyrics - Richard Marx - Satisfied)\n\nWe hiked our bodies weary for BurgerFi\nThere must be more to eatin' this family fries\n \nWhat should we Yelp for some burger time\nYou may not even have an appetite\nAin't no sense in losing your chance\nThey're gonna make it worth the ride\n\nDon't you know, I won't be happy until I'm at BurgerFi\nDon't you know, why should I stop untilm I'm at BurgerFi\n\n\nI came to BurgerFi on a whim since my buddies and I just finished hiking and happened to park next to this place.  \n\nBurgerFi has an urban modern atmosphere with and open feel; not sure if that's the case for all BurgerFi restaurants around the country.  \n\nThere's definitely nothing basic about these burgers from breakfast style, veggie style, and even serving up some hot dogs; if you're feeling for that instead.  I went for their BurgerFi Bacon Cheeseburger; double bacon, double angus beef, and American cheese.  Overall, pretty solid and greasy to the bite.  The bacon was crispy and beef patties were done medium with cheese oozing.  I'm pretty critical of my burgers and this one definitely pass the test for me.  I really love the bun and patty ratio, which was perfect, while the bun itself was like a soft Hawaiian bun.\n\nIn the end, BurgerFi delivered to this palates just fine.  I love myself a good burger every now and then, but these days I have to listen to the love handles!  Needless to say, I would definitely recommend this spot! - Enjoy!
744	1	d	Finally an izakaya in Vegas that actually serves izakaya food. They have everything you would expect, plus more. My family and I were all wide eyes and watering mouths when the menus came out, there is no place in Vegas that serves this much Japanese food. \n\nRamen burger: I've never had one and had to try it. It was interesting, but good- I don't know if I would order it again. Its a large portion of food for the price (compared to the other things on the menu) and is fun to try. The meat is tender, the ramen noodles give an interesting touch. \nTempura soba: If you're used to salty, heavily flavored American foods- skip it. Tempura soba is a very light tasting broth with buckwheat noodles and tempura on the side. Tempura was nothing special. Again, a large portion of food for the price. \nOden: Yes, yes, yes. I've yet to have good oden- or oden at all in America. For $2-4 a piece it was pricey, but the couple of pieces we had were good. Order the fish cakes and chikuwa. \nSunomono: pickled cucumber salad- YES. \nHouse fried Rice: Again, a large portion. Japanese style fried rice with a ton of bonito flakes. Make sure you're ok with that before ordering. A+++ for authenticity. \n\nMatcha icecream: True matcha icecream, none of that over sweetened sugary stuff they call \"Matcha\" at Starbucks. The ice cream is bitter AND also free with a facebook check-in! :) YAY\nMontblanc: Was HORRIBLE. It tasted like nothing but artificial chestnut. I hope that no one orders the Montblanc here and thinks its like this in Japan. It was a disappointing representation of one of my favorite desserts. The cake was only a couple of bites big. \n\nOverall, it was one of the more authentic Japanese restaurants I've been to in the states (they even have zashiki seating!) It looked and felt like Japan to me. The food was not perfect, but it was a really good attempt. I'll be back to try their other dishes!
745	1	d	A big group of my friends used to come to The Patio years back, before they all knocked up chicks, stopped drinking or whatever the case may be. There was actual patio furniture in the bar. I thought that was sweet. I think they have since abandoned that idea, but still a great place to go that is low key and no one will really bother you.
746	0	d	We ordered from here once a few months ago and it was fine. We just recently ordered a combo pizza and wing deal and it was terrible. The pizza was cold and had no flavour, the wings had no sauce even though I asked for some, and the garlic bread was missing the cheese I paid extra for. The fries were also soggy. We won't be returning.
747	1	d	I'm a fan of Value Village in general. This one looks pretty small from the street, but goes really far back when you're inside. Everything is organized well too. \nMy recent visit was purely unplanned and i ended up buying some awesome french onion soup bowls for $3. The really cool old brown kind from the 70's\/80's. \nCashing out isn't the quickest, but who can complain when you're spending so little money for wicked stuff.
748	1	d	Ok if you are the kind of person that likes authentic Thai or Lao food, this is great. If you dig street vendors in SE Asia, you're good. \n\nIf you are white washed asian, don't bother. If you think street vendors are unsafe, stick to Panda Express. \n\nThis endeth the lesson.
749	0	d	We called the Scottsdale office for a rekeying quote and spoke with Dwayne (?) who was friendly and was able to schedule a tech to come out the next evening. Jacob called to inform us of his ETA and arrived as promised and knowledgeably gave us a quote that we accepted. He was able to start and finish the job that evening, going above and beyond to find the match we wanted. He was fast and efficient and gave us useful tips. We highly recommend  Diamondback Lock And Key and Jacob in particular.
750	1	d	One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. Arrived at the place with two friends at 11:50 a.m. on a Sunday after it was recommended to us. Got put on a waiting list and told to come back after an hour or two. We come back an hour later and get told it'll be another half hour to an hour. We leave and come back almost an hour later and witness the host seat two groups of two, both of whom arrived after us, at a table for four. When we questioned him about it, he fully brushed it off and told us it'll be \"just a few more minutes!\". \n\nAt this point we've been waiting for over two hours, so we decide to look at the menu and all chose the burger, seeing as we were starving at this point and there's limited meat on the menu. When we finally get seated and are ready to order, we get told we can't have the burger cause their kitchen is undergoing reno. And then when we finally get our orders of chicken and waffles and two egg skillets, the former tastes bland and the latter taste awful. It of course all ends with me having food poisoning for the next 2 days. \n\nIncredibly long wait and hoity toity service with nothing good to fall back on cause the whole meal was disgusting. Simply not worth it. I'd give it a 0\/5 if I could.
751	0	d	Stay away. Very small selection and whatever was, tasted horrible. \nI should have paid attention to the reviews. \nA waste of 25.99$
752	1	d	Khao San Road had been on my list of places I wanted to go to eat for YEARS. But never got around to actually going to, for one reason or another. Finally I managed to make it to this restaurant. I'm going to separate the food, ambiance, and service to discuss seperately.\n\nFood - I ordered the pad gra prow. It was delicious. It had a great mix of flavours and the way that it was plated was really interesting and tasty. This place has amazing food!\n\nAmbiance - It was pretty nice for the most part. It was a bit crowded and it was hard to hear the people that I was talking to, but at the same time it gave an interesting atmosphere.\n\nService - It was AWFUL. We waited 20 minutes for a table, and the lady said we had to have everyone together to be seated. This was fair enough. However, one of my friends had to take an urgent phone call, and stepped out for a few minutes and the server came over and started yelling at us for getting seated without our entire table ready. It took my friend almost 15 minutes to order a single beer, and the servers were rude as fuck. I understand they are busy but that's not an excuse to treat your customers this way.\n\nIn summary, I had really mixed feelings about this place. The food lived up to what i expected, but the service was awful.
753	1	d	A little away from the strip, in a more local area. They have great, unique hot dog toppings here! I got the off the menu hot dog that was named me - the Gang Nam Dog (hot dog, roasted pork belly, sliced cucumber, nori flakes, green onions, sesame seeds, Korean chili sauce). It tasted fantastic! Also tried a friend's Hawaiian Dog (hot dog, pork belly, pineapple salsa, g-onions, honey Dijon mustard), which had a nice welcomed slight sweetness from the pineapple and honey mustard. The Euro Special fries (pork belly bacon, cheddar cheese, herb blend, garlic mayo, fries) and the Carne Asada fries (beef bulgogi, 5 cheese blend. pico de gallo, diced jalapeno, chipotle mayo, avocado mayo, fries) were bomb with the carne asada one being more flavorful. One of my friend is a regular here so they hooked us all up with free drinks. Checking in on Yelp gets you a 10% discount. Staff are really friendly and helpful. The food here is way better than most of the overpriced stuff that you find on the strip. A definitely good Vegas stop.
754	0	d	The ginger and wasabi are pretty fresh and delish, service is friendly and helpful. Sashimi is decent sushi is average. They are Koreans overall experience is alright.
755	0	d	Good place for drinks and bowling, not a fan of the food. Atmosphere is good and so far the demographic is pretty diverse which to me is a huge plus!
756	0	d	Super helpful and friendly staff that are great source of information for both seasoned pros and beginners. If you're new to the gun world this place provides an excellent non-intimidating experience. The range masters are super helpful, give you tips for better shooting, and personally help you out without even having to ask them.
757	1	d	This place was renovated and given a new identity a while back so everythings still looks pretty new. Check in was fast and friendly. Our room was in the tower across the street and I got lost finding the elevators the first time. But once in the room, it was really clean, modern and comfortable. \n\nOne thing to note is that there's a LOT of street noise. They do provide earplugs in the room for those who sleep lightly. But seriously, it's Vegas, if you came for peace and quiet, you probably should have stayed in Summerlin. \n\nParking sucks. If you have a car you can use valet, but if you're on a motorcycle like I often am in Vegas, you have to park across the street and then haul your crap over. At least it's free. \n\nWe spent a full day at the pool while we were there and that was really cool. The place is really nice, the service is great and the cabana pricing is WAY better than the strip. Basically you're just guaranteeing them a certain amount on the bar tab and the cabana is free. The drinks and stuff weren't terribly out of line either. Just stay away from the bottled booze, those prices will kill you. $250 for Jack is a bit steep, even if they do throw in free soda. \n\nAll in all we had a great time. Thumbs up.
758	0	d	After hearing about this place from a friend then finding it on Yelp, had to give it a try. I had the steamed dumplings and the flat tofu with green peppers. Very good and clean. I will definitely be going back since this is the best Chinese food I have had in a while. Lunch price wasn't bad either. The ladies working there were very friendly and attentive. I was with a some friends visiting from China and they said that it was some of the best Chinese food they have had in the south east valley area.\n\nGive this place a try, I don't want to see this one going away like many of the others. I will definitely be going back often.
759	1	d	We come here often because my partner's parents love this place.  Overall, I think the concept is fun but the experience and food are mediocre at best.\n\nThe food is all pretty pricey in general.  There is an upcharge for everything, including extra sauce (ranch dressing, buffalo, etc) which gets old pretty quick.  The food is good, but there is an overall smell in the restaurant of stinky feet which really interferes with even trying to enjoy your food.  If you sit outside, be prepared to deal with flies all over the place.  \n\nThe service is meh.  If a server isn't trying to prematurely take your food away from you so they can turn the table, then they are ignoring you altogether.  This has been my experience every time I've been here.  Which is even more annoying when the server forgets your $.50 extra buffalo sauce, and you cannot get their attention so that you can even start to eat your meal before it gets cold.  \n\nInside and outside, the tables are jam-packed and it's nearly impossible to avoid bumping into anyone or to avoid having someone's rear end bounce against your table as youre trying ot eat.  For the price they charge, I would expect a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't continue to come here were it not for my partner's parents, and In the 10 times about that we have come here, I've yet to have a \"good\" experience.
760	0	d	Overall very pleased. Server was friendly and easy going. If you stick w the set menu you can get 3 course lunch for great price,  $25.15. There are up charge options and additional sides if you want but not necessary. I ordered set price lunch, there were more bones than expected in the whole cooked bass I was told would be deboned but it was delicious. The Greek Meze plate had a thick yogurt, creamy hummus and a delicious mild feta. The walnut cake w ice cream was light and flavorful.\nI finished off w oysters to time out the bottle of wine I ordered (greek white, starts w an M. Very good) \nThey skipped on gulf and east coast for west coast. Much smaller but good crisp flavor. Served w mignette unless you request coctail sauce and horse radish.
761	0	d	Great burgers! Super tasty very thin onion rings were my favorite side dish. The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. The baked beans were also very good.
762	0	d	First Duckworths I visited, still a favorite even if I don't frequent this as often as I'm not on this side of town as much. Still highly recommend, though Montfort has a lot of other great offerings.
763	1	d	Not really getting all the hype here. The store is pretty and offers tons of eye candy but when you actually taste the stuff it's pretty average. \n\nWe waited in line and sampled a couple ice creams and then purchased an ice cream and a little carrot cake. The cake was mostly cream cheese frosting. It was very fancy and lovely to look at, but the frosting to cake ratio made it really hard to enjoy. The ice cream was good, but nothing spectacular. Overall everything was decent tasting and very expensive. I wouldn't bother coming back with all the other pastry shops in Vegas .
764	0	d	Amazing food and service. Check out the prime rib on Sunday
765	0	d	Casey was a great loan officer! She was very prompt on getting back to me and the loan process went very painless and quick. I highly recommend her, if you're looking for a home loan.
766	0	d	I am busy and have no idea about where to go in Vegas. I was referred to Red Carpet by a friend and Jeff was very helpful in every aspect of the planning.\n\nour first night our table had to be moved because they didn't end up opening the Ling Ling room at Hakkasan.  The pavilion table was perfect for our group and we had space to dance all night long.\nWe ended up switching our pool party reservation about 10-14 days before because the DJ at the place we were originally were going to, wasn't playing any music we would have liked. Jeff was very helpful and gracious about switching. We did Encore - we did the beach club and that was great. We could not have had a more centrally, perfectly placed table, right in the middle of everything. We had a great time.  \nWe ended up cancelling some reservations after back and forth and their host was super patient. \nCustomer service was on point, with a ton of emails from me back and forth. Would recommend for sure! Also we had to redistribute payments because one girl canceled and they were flexible about that. And also the fact that they collect the payments in advance is great - I'm not waiting for anyone to pay me back for that portion of the trip, which does make it easier!
767	0	d	Place was awesome. \nBartender named Jeff shouldn't have been bartending. Awefulllll service.
768	1	d	Came here with the family last Sunday, and for the most part, we enjoyed ourselves. Since we are season pass holders for Cowabunga Bay, we received half-off admission to SeaQuest. What a great promo! Single-day admission tickets are decently priced and they offer discounts for seniors, students, and military! The admission prices were great even if we weren't to receive any type of discount, but what made it pricey was the tokens to feed the animals. To get the full \"interactive\" experience at SeaQuest, it's recommended that you purchase tokens to feed the various animals throughout the aquarium. You can purchase tokens in different quantities for about $2 a token when you break it down. However, the amount of food you receive to feed the animals per token is very little, so that's where they get you!\n\nThe overall interactive experience was great. Each room of the aquarium had a different theme, which I thought was cool. The themes were according to where the different animals could be found in terms of living environment- The boardwalk, coast, desert, etc. I was a bit disappointed because some of the tanks looked like they haven't been cleaned in a while and there was actually a dead turtle in the very first tank we looked at... Yikes! You'd think that they would take that poor guy out of there!\n\nThere are also employees walking around with different animals that you're allowed to touch. I thought it was a bit strange that there was nobody to supervise the shark and stingray exhibit. A child could easily fall in the tank if reaching too far while feeding the animals.\n\nMy favorite part definitely had to be feeding the parakeets in the aviary. In exchange for one token, you're able to sit inside the aviary and have parakeets perch a top your hand and peck at the food in the cup! My 2 year old nephew loved it!\n\nI think this is an educational and fun family activity for locals and tourists alike. This would definitely be something to do for families who are here on vacation and looking for something kid-friendly. You can only go to M&M's World so many times, right? It's not far from the Strip either! \n\nMy family had a good experience here, but I couldn't see us purchasing the annual membership. This is more of a one and done type of place.
769	1	d	I wrote this letter to XS, who chose not to respond.  Perhaps Yelp would be a better place to post it so others can avoid making the mistake of patronizing this club.\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nI'd like to speak with someone at reservations about a recent and unsatisfactory experience at the January 19th Chainsmokers concert\/performance located in the XS Nightclub.\n\nAs a bit of backstory and to provide context, two to three times a year my close friends from law school and I head to Las Vegas and do a celebration week.  We'll get bottle service at multiple clubs, see several shows, essentially just unwind in typical Las Vegas style.  It's a chance for all of us to escape what can often be the joyless grind of practicing law and as such we all like to do the polar opposite of our what our jobs entail while in Las Vegas.  \n\nTo that end, after a morning and afternoon of treating ourselves, we returned to our rooms to get dressed up for the Chainsmokers event. Ordinarily we'd have reserved a table, but considering our schedule before and after the show, we figured it more prudent to just get the standard tickets so we could come in, dance, and enjoy the event with less to worry about.\n\nAnd that's where the experience turned sour.  Despite showing up to the event at the scheduled time of 10:30 p.m., my party of six waited in line more than an hour and a half before getting into the outer doors of the club. Once we passed the doors, we were exceptionally dismayed to find yet another long and winding line. At this point, three of our party left out of sheer frustration.  The remaining three of us waited in line for another half an hour before finally being let in to the club.\n\nFrom 12:30 a.m. to 1:30 a.m., we had some drinks and waited for the Chainsmokers, who never arrived.  I need to be clear about this: the scheduled performer for which we had paid to see had not showed even after the event had been going for three hours.  Honestly, is this how your club normally runs?  Do you book some hillbilly rube named Darryl Chainsmokers and attempt to pass him off as the real artists?  Is this all some elaborate carnival barker hoax that you run? After waiting two hours in line and an hour at the club listening to someone whom I can only assume was yanked off the street to cover for the scheduled performers, the remainder of my party was furious.\n\nHad we known of your club's level of service, which is easily the worst we've experienced in the history of our group's trips to Vegas, we never would have booked tickets.  Had we known that there was no likelihood of the scheduled and promoted artists showing to the event, we never would have stood in line for two hours.\n\nI cannot possibly express to you how much each of us believe that your practice of promoting artists who do not appear at events reeks of fraud.  At a bare minimum, your tickets should come with a notice that we can expect a TWO HOUR WAIT to see some unknown fellow play homemade remixes on his Macbook.\n\nWhile XS has been promoted as the top club in Las Vegas, our shared experiences belie that claim completely.  I cannot imagine us ever patronizing this business again, which is truly a shame as we originally intended on booking a table reservation this summer to enjoy your outdoor area.\n\nA refund of our tickets would be appropriate at a minimum.  In short, we paid to see the Chainsmokers.  Instead, we were made to wait in line for two hours to watch someone who happened to have a DJ program on his laptop.  This is unacceptable for any venue, especially one billed as the best in Las Vegas.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter.
770	0	d	First experience here, amazing!! Bomb food. Our server, Christina was absolutely amazing. Funny and very observant. I wanna take her out with us tonight! Lol
771	1	d	A Hidden Gem.\n\nToday, we went to the Lunch Lounge for a quick bite to eat, and it was absolutely delicious. I've had many sandwiches from all over the valley and the folks at Lunch Lounge are doing up sandwichs right.\n\nWe really enjoyed our first visit to Lunch Lounge.  The menu has plenty of options, fillled with high quality meats, for the meat-eaters and a large selection of vegetarian & vegan options, if meat isn't your thing\n\nWhen it comes to sandwiches, you really can't go wrong with ordering the Lunch Lounge's \"Grilled Stromboli Sub\". There's something about that combination of, Ham, Genoa Salami, Pepperoni, Melted White American Cheese, Cherry Peppers and Basil Pesto on a Sub Roll, all mixed together that makes a heavenly combination. That's exactly what you'll get at this shop.\n\nIf you're looking for a great sandwich, and her reasonable price, with the best customer service, stop by the lunch Lounge you won't be disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.
772	1	d	I had high hopes for 1OAK. You always hear about celebrity appearances and parties taking place at 1OAK. I was there with a group on a Friday night. We got there early (11pm) and most of the tables were available. The music was fine. Not terrible. When the DJ switched to more techno, we decided to take a break and grab some drinks and waters.\n\nDrinks were expensive, but that was to be expected. They were on par with other \"top\" clubs in Las Vegas (Marquee, Pure, Hakkasan). What blew my mind was that they charged $8 for water. At first I thought the bartender was just trying to sell me bottled water. I corrected her and said \"tap water is fine.\" Then she proceeded to correct me and say that $8 is the price for a glass of tap water! I shouldn't have to leave the club to get a glass of tap water. I won't argue legality, I'm sure the law will mention something about how only the venue has to provide water and the \"venue\" is the Mirage. However, this type of pricing just encourages your patrons to become sloppy drunks. This is the only bar I have EVER been to that will not provide patrons with free tap water. We left as soon as we had finished our drinks and were able to salvage the night with better music and free water at Tryst.\n\nI will never return to 1OAK and will never suggest it to friends and family.
773	1	d	This is the most beautiful, fabulous, marvelous and amazing bar\/club\/dance place I have ever been to!  \n\nThis nightclub is way beyond XS (extra small)!  It is a pool palace filled with intricate decor that is decked out from top to bottom!  \n\nAt night, it is glowing with lights, which makes the whole place quite dreamy to be in!\n\nAdd the pool outside, the multiple bars so you will not be ever thirsty and the surround music with plenty of people, then the place is just a perfect party gathering!\n\nI explicitly love \"ex-cess\"!
774	0	d	Had dinner here last night with my boyfriend for my birthday. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and we loved that it's tucked away in a hidden corner. Next time, we'll have to try the patio seating--which is beautiful! We started with the cheese and meat plate for an appetizer, and man did it deliver! The purple haze was my favorite, absolutely delicious. My boyfriend chose a flatbread for his entree, and I had the honey-mustard glazed half chicken with the \"mac and cheese.\" His flatbread was bigger than expected and he said it was delicious. My favorite food on the planet is mac and cheese, and theirs was great, but the chicken blew the mac out of the water. It practically melted in my mouth. Beyond fantastic. We ordered a salad to share in between our appetizer and entree, but it somehow got forgotten in the shuffle. We weren't worried about it since what we ordered was more than enough. However, our server was so apologetic for mistake he threw in a tiramisu for us to take home with our leftovers to make up for it. My only complaint would be that its a long dining experience, so don't come here if you are tight on time. Other than that it was a lovely experience, and I can't wait to go back and try something new!
775	1	d	Two weddings and a dinner, that's what it took for me to finally pen a review for this iconic Yorkville restaurant. The was a dinner many years ago, and while I'm sure none of the menu items (or staff for that matter) are still the same, I do remember it was memorable.\n\nFast forward to two years ago, we were invited to a friends wedding here and at first when we heard this we were puzzled. How? Well let me tell you how, their gorgeous main floor easily transforms into an event space for a group as much as 100 guests, with people sitting on long tables across the length of the main dining room. Then once dinner was over the remaining space could easily be used for enough room for dancing and drinks. Aside from the food being plentiful and easily the highest quality of any wedding we've been to save for a couple of venues (but definitely at the same level), the staff and venue transforms beautifully to accommodate any private function, even a loft space open from above next to their fantastic live wall for photographers to take amazing even shots once the party started.\n\nFast forward to last year when we were talking to those same friends whose wedding we loved about how tough (expensive) it was to find a nice venue for our own wedding reception (cocktail style with passed apps, stations and open bar). We had been to several restaurants and venues across the city each time being greeted with insane pricing with even crazier add ons for silly services. It was disheartening to say the least. Our friends said that we really should reach out to Dennette and her team at Sassafraz as not only were they a dream to work with but very reasonable. Yeah right! A top restaurant in Toronto's most exclusive neighbourhood? Come on. They insisted we reach out and so we did.\n\nDennette the main event coordinator was lovely from the very first email exchange and phone conversation. Understanding exactly what we needed and what we were looking for, and then providing us with a quote that was not only one of the lowest of any of the EIGHT we visited but also offered the most, with the fewest \"add ons\". Things like room rental fee, cake cutting costs for bringing in our own outside desserts and even set up fees were not even a consideration. The main objective was to ensure we hit an extremely reasonable minimum spend. We knew on food alone we'd hit that number so we decided to secure our date.\n\nPart of the reason why they don't charge a room rental fee is because they have a private event space on the upper floor with capacity for 200-250, so they don't need to shut down the restaurant to host your event (unless you want the main floor - then I don't know what their protocol is).\n\nThroughout the planning, our meetings and our eventual menu tasting a week prior to our big day, Dennette was always extremely helpful with suggestions, planning, and quick on response times. Despite the stress of planning any wedding, this was as stress free as you could hope for.\n\nOur cocktail wedding reception had us arriving at 3:30\/4pm for set up, have a legal wedding in the room at 4:30pm and our guests began arriving at 5pm. It was perfect! Then the food began to roll out, OMG the food, the food, the food. Everything you would expect from a Yorkville restaurant, and more! Our expertly curated menu included the following (and more as I know I'm forgetting some things:\n\nSTATIONS\n* Canadian Cheeses\/dried fruits\/honey comb\/nuts\/figs crisps\n* Cured Meats\/Pickled Veggies\/Chipotle vinaigrette\/sriracha aioli\/breads\n* Assorted Sushi (Maki, sashimi, rolls, Nigiri, etc)\n\nPASSED CANAPES (single bite)\n* Smoked Salmon\/Dill crème fraiche\/toast points\n* Poached Lobster Medallions\/Orange Zest\/Fennel\n* Tomato and avocado salad\/Chipotle vinaigrette\/tostada\n* Duck Confit Croquette\/apricot orange jam\n* Wild Mushroom tart\/ truffle essence\n\nPASSED TASTING BOWLS\n* Buttermilk fried chicken\/creamy grits\/waffle\/maple gravy\n* Potato gnocchi\/wild mushrooms\/Arugula\/Parmigianno-Reggiano\n\nPASSED CANAPES (more than a bite)\n* Grilled three cheese on sourdough bread\n* Mini S Cafe bar Burger\/ Canadian Prime Beef\/ aged cheddar\/bacon jalapeno aioli\n* Traditional Quebecois style poutine\n\nIs your mouth watering?

776	1	d	If you're not willing to wait in line for at least 20-30 minutes, this Cafe Rio location is not for you. Whenever I come here to get some dinner to-go, it's always expected that I will be waiting for a long time before I can even place my order. The way the line wraps around reminds me of the line for Space Mountain at Disneyland. I'm too afraid to order online and pick up because of previous reviews I've read and orders not being correct\/items missing. Good looking out, guys!\n\nThe only thing I've ever ordered from Cafe Rio is the salad. Cilantro lime rice and black beans on top of a fresh handmade flour tortilla with melted cheese, seasoned shredded chicken breast, lettuce, Cotija cheese, guac, tortilla strips, and dressing. I'm not much of a dressing person, but the house made Cilantro Lime vinaigrette is freaking delicious! It's so flavorful and has the right amount of cilantro in it, just to let you know that it's there. The Creamy Tomatillo dressing is great too. I usually ask for half and half and it's not a problem to get both. The salad is so filling!\n\nDuring my last visit, the one thing that turned me off was a female employee emptying the old bin of lettuce and putting it on top of the fresh lettuce that she had just replaced it with. It wasn't even the fact that she was emptying it out, it was the fact that the old lettuce was practically submerged in water and dripping everywhere when taken out of the bin. It wasn't too big of a deal, just something I observed.\n\nAs far as customer service goes, the employees are nice. It's just that when they get busy during peak hours, it seems to be a bit hectic on the line and everyone is everywhere at once... If that makes sense.\n\nP.S. Yes, the tortillas are as amazing as everyone says!
777	1	d	My name is Kate. And I am addicted to Kawa Sushi. \n\nI remember when I first moved into my apartment my landlord mentioned Kawa. \"Oh that place is good! It recently opened so it's nice to see they have business,\" he casually stated. Little did I know, this was only the beginning.  \n\nFast forward a handful of months. Kawa Sushi and I are now the best of amigos. Am I feeling lazy? Craving sushi? I can simply call and place an order and in 10 min it's ready. I have become a regular and the adorable staff laugh at my love for their salmon sushi pizza. Now and again they'll even throw in a free miso soup, because they're just that delightful. \n\nCare if I list a few more reason why I love it so?\n- The price! $4 Salmon rolls! $7 for a giant (and I mean giant) Green Dragon roll! Yummy combos! \n- The staff! They are so so nice! It's a family business, and sometimes you'll spot they're young lil son (who is basically twins with that kid in Up) playing on his game boy. When my friend Amy and I stopped by for a snack on Halloween he even shared some of his Halloween candy with us. And he was dressed up as Buzz Lightyear. And it was so cute.   \n- Did I mention the sushi pizza? Sushi pizza.\n\nKawa makes giving into my sushi cravings way too easy. And delicious. Go.
778	1	d	The cashier\/\"customer service\" rep etc was rude on the phone.  When we attempted to go try out the new place last sunday he literally was sleeping at the cash register and would not respond..We almost called 911...Keep in mind this was while there were several families already there...plus the holes are very basic..
779	0	d	Long wait for a table and an even longer wait for food which comes out cold. Then go home and feel gross the rest of the day because you probably ate food that was \"made\" somewhere else and just warmed up for you. Mass production. Yuck.
780	0	d	The beef and broccoli with mushrooms is delicious. I definitely will be back. The gentleman at the register is very friendly.
781	0	d	Where do I begin? STAY AWAY! Almost a month and my simple microwave claim cant be resolved.. First call, nice representative takes my claim, all is good... Claim gets approved and this is where the fun begins.. They schedule a delivery, Best Buy(everything still good), they call to confirm my adress and guess what? Its National Home Warranty's own corporate offices adress not my home adress. Did I forget to mention the corporate office is in Vegas and I'm located in Arizona? Okay lets reschedule,  they send out the order  to a contractor we now have a new delivery date but in the meantime Best Buy keeps calling me, ignore them the contractors will deliver & install\/microwave.. guess who shows up to my house when I'm not home? Yeap, Best buy..  Reschedule AGAIN for a Monday guess what? Contractor called me, they dont even have the microwave but I sure  have someone waiting at home specifically for the appt... Reschedule AGAIN...  Delivery will be between 1-4 guess what?? Running behind we have to reschedule until next week..   Based on the reviews, this company obviously doesn't care about customer service and its fine but if I can keep at least ONE person from going through this, then that's good for me. Customer service should not be taken for granted specially for paid services nobody is doing anyone any favors here.
782	1	d	John helped me buy my house 11 years ago. He is the best realtor in the business as far as I am concerned. He is very knowledgeable, trustworthy, and hard working. I will not use anyone else!
783	1	d	Flight landed. Got ready. And needed something quick to eat before partying at Body English.\n\nThe hostess told us food takes about 20 minutes, so down we sat. And sat. And sat. There was another table that was also waiting for our mysterious server. It wasn't until we asked another server and talked to one of the chefs that our server finally showed up to take our orders. And that was the first and last time we saw him.\n\nShared potato skins and chicken nachos. The potato skins were dry and unappetizing. The nachos, however, was bomb! BOMB! Huge plate with goodness piled on! The roasted peppers gave the nachos a spicy kick. And the mixture of nacho cheese and melted cheese, guacamole and sour cream made this dish oh-so divine!\n\nStill, the nachos did not make up the lack of service. We were wondering what that other table ordered since we were almost done and they still haven't gotten their food. And surprise surprise. Next thing we saw, a server brought out three plates of salads for that table. OMG.
784	0	d	I went to this location yesterday in an attempt to fill my 2 year old daughter's med for a double ear infection.  I usually use CVS near my house, however this was close to her Dr and my work, easy to grab on my way home after work.  I was immediately told that they didn't have that medication.  I kindly asked that she look to see if another location near by would have it.  She reponds with a location no where near this location.  I stated that I was on my lunch break and didn't have time....in a RUDE and snotty manner she said \"what do you want me to do about it?\"  Her next suggestion was that she could order it and have it in 4 days.....WHAT, my daughter could be deaf by then.  I drove away.  This confirmed why I will NOT be transferring to Walgreens any time soon.  HORRIBLE customer service.
785	1	d	This review is for the repair service department. We've brought the '05 350z in here a number times for service, and we're now regretting it. That's because it seems as though no matter what you bring your car in for, you get a huge estimate for other repairs, whether your car needs repairs or not.  But the latest trip in there takes the cake: $3300 estimate for suspension work. Well, this car only has about 40K miles on it and the car isn't driven that hard to continuously need suspension work. (Having recently had $$$$ suspension work done on it, we wondered how much more it might need?) So we decided to take the vehicle to ABC Nissan for a second opinion.  \n\nWe requested that their ultra-reputable service guy, Mark, look at it. And when the final verdict came in it revealed there was absolutely nothing wrong with the car!  Nothing. Nada. Zippo. We left with a smile, knowing that we'll go back to Mark at ABC Nissan in the future, and avoid Pinnacle at all costs. BEWARE of this dealership!
786	1	d	I love The Cupcakery!!! So many different cupcakes to choose from... Best thing about it is that I live like 10 minutes away...\nThey are always so helpful and patient when trying to figure out what cupcakes you want... It's my go to place when I'm getting cupcakes for my family and coworkers for their birthdays or just because... Cupcakes are moist and delicious! Love it!!!
787	1	d	I have a love\/hate relationship with this fast. \n\nPros:\n*Fast\n*Many Options\n*Free Vacuums\n*Strong Vacuums \n*Lot of Vacuums\n\nCons:\n*It is a drive through car wash - just never as good as a hand wash\n*If I pay $20 for their premium car wash, I expect it to be super clean with no streaks. But then I remind myself it is just never as good as a hand wash.\n\nIn the end, it gets my car clean and the job done.
788	0	d	Fail.... give this place a -5 hair in the food and the waitress with the slicked back braid smells likes designer IMPOSTSTER perfume and cigarettes! Nasty . Not coming back.
789	0	d	very average menu, borderline pub style.\nHad a toasted turkey Sandwich with cranberry and cheese. \nIt was mediocre at best.\nVery awkward seating. We sat in like a hallway space. The booth seating was the wall behind the entrance\/hostess stand. There was a table of two squeezed in up against the wall to my left, and there was a table of two that sort of had to get up to let our party of four get into our 4 top. \nVery pleased with the obscure drink variety.\nI got to try an on-tap alcoholic kombucha, which has been something I wan't to try for a while.\nAnd the waitress got the bartender to make a \"fancy\" drink for our pregnant friend, that looked pretty while all of us had alcohol. Kudos on that one. \nNot what I expected, and probably will only go back to use my mad-city tin.
790	0	d	I would be way more satisfied eating a Hot Pocket.  This little pizza window inside the Paris hotel was open late so I decided to grab a slice since I was starving.  I ordered one combo slice but was served two giant slices.  Normally, this would have made me really happy, but the pizza was super greasy and salty.   I can't complain about the price since it was only a little over $5 dollars after tax but I would definitely have to be drunk to eat here.
791	1	d	Unique!\nJust For Fun!\nWhimsical!\nAmazing!\nHang out!\nEnjoy!
792	1	d	Our garage door suddenly stopped opening and we couldn't find the info about the repair company we used in the past.  I read the reviews on Yelp for Dreikosen and we called him.  I have to concur with the great reviews on yelp for Jeff's service.  He came the next day, discovered a broken spring, made all the necessary repairs, and charged less than \"the other guys.\"\n\nOne compliment is also a nit:  we'll never again wrack our brains to remember who we used, since Jeff stapled his card right over the garage door opener.  Very helpful.  But I'm less appreciative of the fact that he didn't ask permission before doing it, since he used heavy-duty staples that will leave permanent holes in our nicely painted garage.  Not a biggie, or enough to remove a star, just a suggestion to Jeff for the future.
793	1	d	WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nTheir steaks! They offer lunch menu too so if you want a smaller meal for lunch, you can still get a smaller steak for lunch! \n\nFor appetizers we had garlic shrimp and crab cakes. I thought the garlic shrimp was okay. The menu said chilly garlic shrimp but when it came, it wasn't that chilly hot at all? The crab cakes were good and they used real crab meat instead of the cake crab. The only feedback I have for the crab cake is that it was on the slightly overfried side because it was getting a bit hard side when I was eating the fried batter of the crab cake. \n\nI ordered top sirloin steak with seasonal vegetables. The top sirloin for lunch option is 7 oz. the Steak was alright, done to my request and served with some fried onion rings too. Nothing that I wasn't expecting. \n\nThe dessert I ordered the chocolate soufflé. I thought it was made fresh to order but actually it was not. Cut from a bigger soufflé, this soufflé had whip cream in the Center of the soufflé and it was rather hard for the top layer. Soufflé was mediocre at best. \n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nMake reservations if you're coming for lunch, especially on weekdays because this restaurant fills up qguockly with patrons during work hours or holiday time. If you check in on yelp, you unlock the 10% off an entree offer you can take advantage of!
794	1	d	How can a Chinese restaurant so good be called \"Food Express\"?\nThink they WANT to sound crappy to deflect all the traffic they can barely handle? But alas, you can't keep the best Chinese food in LV under wraps, same way you can't keep a brotha down. \n\nTheir XO sauce is top secret and top notch. Anything flavored with it is awesome - such as Green Beans and Prawns. My fav dish remains the Snowfish (Halibut) Tofu Bao (Soup in Ceramic Pot) .. the fish is so tender and lightly crispy on the outside. Salt Pepper Pork Chops are perfectly battered and not too salty. I would not order the market price fish here, a 2-3 pounder will cost you upwards of $60. \n\nDefinitely worth the drive, especially if you're looking for some cheap good grubs after clubbing \/ gambling. Beats anything you can find on the Strip at 2 a.m.!
795	1	d	So I went browsing in this store on my lunch break since I work at the salon next door. I wanted to see if I could find another Louis Vuitton and the owner refused to acknowledge me and when I politely asked for help she looked at me like I was bothering her. I don't know what stick is up her butt, I just know I won't be returning. I would love to buy recycled bags but with an attitude like that I'll just drop the thousand dollars it would cost for a new Louis Vuitton and deal with employees who actually care about the customer. Good luck lady, you'll be sure to go out of business if you keep acting that way. Learn how to be nice. If you hate what you do close down the shop jerk!
796	1	d	I'm sad as I write this review because this place was one of my favorite places to get drinks in Vegas but it is not anymore. My recent visit was such a disappointment!\n\nI liked getting Thai Tea and other flavored teas here. Prices were reasonable. I guess you can say a little overpriced but most of the drinks at any cafe these days costs a bit more than franchised coffee shops like Starbucks and Coffee Bean. Nevertheless, I think I have to say goodbye to Is Sweet.\n\nMy boyfriend and I walked in after eating pho next door and there was only only 3 other people at the cafe. They took forever to order but yeah I ordered as soon as they were done. My order was simple; Thai Tea and Taro Frappe.\n\nI waited and waited. As I see the time and the time printed on my receipt, it has been 12 minutes since. Theres 2 people working but come on. Making those 2 drinks shouldnt take more than 5 minutes. We finally received out drinks after 17 minutes of ridiculous wait and my boyfriend's so called Taro Frappe was very bland and tasteless. I dont know what Taro powder they use but it tasted nothing but just milk. To add, it wasnt sweet either. I asked them to make it sweeter and they did. Did it make it sweet? Not really. Maybe a tiny bit. It wasnt the flavor he or I was looking for in a typical Taro Frappe.\n\nMy Thai Tea was just as good as before. But I'm lactose intolerant so I couldnt drink much because I didnt have any lactaid with me. Should have asked for soymilk instead but I totally forgot they carry them. If you are lactose like me, please substitute with soy. They do charge extra for it but at least it will be worth to do so.\n\nTables were somewhat dirty. It wasnt wiped completely. I dont think they ever come out and clean the tables. I always see them busy behind the bar and I dont know whats keeping them so busy. My drinks came out way too late and I wasnt too satisfied with it.\n\nCutesy interior and tables & chairs are unique. However, if they dont speed up preparing your drinks, they will irritate other customers too. Perhaps hire more workers if they take THAT long making them. \n\nParking is plenty and it is located in not-so-busy plaza so dont need to worry about that. They do have a restroom and it is clean.
797	1	d	I used to go here a lot when my friend lived at Palms Place. Convenient location and a 3-minute walk from the condo. If only great Viet food was within walking distance from my house T_T.\n\nI've tried the Pho, Bun Bo Hue, Vermicelli Bowls & Broken Rice Plates. It's still not my favorite in town for any of the aforementioned. However, it's still an excellent place to eat and one of my regular stops in the area. It's super hole-in-the-wall. To get to the bathroom, you walk through the kitchen. This is a no frills kinda place and pretty small--just good food and get out sort of joint.\n\nThe pho here is heavier on the fish sauce than most places. I've brought people here and they either love it or hate it. But they always have quality slices of meats and never overcook the noodles. They have an excellent pork chop + I'm in love with any of their vermicelli bowls. All of their meats\/seafood are tasty so you really can't go wrong here.
798	0	d	Good as it gets! Love the ambiance as well as the good, quality, local and delicious food. Portion sizes are reasonable and so are the prices. Definitely a place I want to frequent. So glad we finally tried it, just sorry it took us this long!
799	0	d	hello\n\nhad this food last weekend. i ordered over the phone and i must say i was very impressed. i ordered for maybe 20 people. the food was very good and very warm when it arrived.  they were not cheep at all about any extra sauces or pita we ask for\ni will for sure be back and think of this spot when i have big events!!
800	0	d	Best Brazilian steakhouse I've been too, including fogo de chao in Texas... Also some of the best quality food and service in the city. Highly worth a visit.
801	0	d	Family and I passed by on a whim and overheard the jazz playing. Saw that it was a full house during lunchtime, and decided we just had to come back for dinner. Service was great, and food was even better. Would highly recommend the duck leg with summer salad- this does not disappoint. Their peach rosé sangria was also good as well. \n\nThis place was so good, we dined here twice during our stay, as other nearby restaurants could not compare.
802	1	d	I will not be back...ever...unless I'm drunk or someone else pays...food...sub par...service...terrible...honestly...a waste of time...dont know how they got rated \"one of the best patios in CLeveland\" according to Scene Magazine unless you like looking at Lorain Road!
803	0	d	This is a unique dining experience.  At O Noir, you eat in the dark.  There is absolutely no light in the room whatsoever, most people have been in a dark room before, but this was my first completely dark room, no light whatsoever.  That was quite an experience in its own right.    You read the menus and order in a fully lit room, before being escorted to your seat by one of the blind waiters.  Both a fascinating and humbling experience.\n\nThe three course meal was delicious.  Salad, steak and cake.  The steak tasted perfect, I wouldn't be able to tell you if it was a little pink in the middle though.  I can say that this was definitely the most interesting dining experience I have had in Toronto.  I would heartily recommend this to any couple or group.  Just not for a first date. You can hear everything that is said by each person in the room, I was privy to something of a disastrous attempt at self conscious courtship.
804	1	d	My husband and I have been wanting to try this restaurant since we seen the trash can nachos on food network. We even had a good experience with Guy's burger bar on our last cruise so we expected excellence. We finally got a babysitter and we're excited about our dinner. However when we went to order drinks which we both wanted to try the frozen horchata colada we were told they couldn't make it ding one. I had the Austin tea which was not sweet tea flavored at all but I still drank it. The trash can nachos were on point very well orchestrated. Then my husband ordered the build your borracho platter. For $30 he got a meat (carne asada) an enchilada, and a taco along with Tex mex type rice and beans. The only good thing on this platter was the enchilada it was not $30 worth though. If we return I will only get the nachos and hopefully they have the drink I'd like to try.
805	1	d	Check in with the guard and he gives you the option of valet or park your own car. This is a courteous option but valet is the way to go if you have a date.  If you park yourself, it's an interesting adventure with the utility view of the Phoenician, along with leaking couplers, in the Phoenician basement.  It is also a easy misstep to get on the elevator, read the directions on how to get to the Steakhouse, then still do a misstep at the lobby floor. Yes, the directions are to get off the A\/B elevators and change to the C\/ D elevators.  The look about in the lobby is a TBT with a bit of 70's decor and several furniture pieces, along with the fountain, dating the hotel.\n\nJump on those elevators and the entrance to the steakhouse is impressive. The first impression is that it's a destination for drinks, and that is also my last impression.\n\nGrab the Jinga matchsticks and the hostess seats you. We have an early dinner time thus we politely haggle for a table a bit closer to the view. Hey, the place is empty! \n\nTable appears nicely set and the paper placemats appear organic. Wait until the end of the meal when the busboy crumbles the placemat like Denny's and dumps crumbs on the table.\n\nAh yes the food! Parker Rolls throw back to the hotel decor and actually are stale. The steak tartare is very good but ruined in presentation by serving in a bowl. It is suggested that a flat plate be used and flavorful dressing provided on the side or thickened up a bit and living up the plating. Steaks were underwhelming, especially compared to the competion in this town, and the smaller NY Strip was actually half the thickness of the larger order.  The smaller steak  was overdone for medium rare. Aside from salads, we cheap out with no sides for the meat entree. This option of ordering a la carte for the main dish feels like a stare down between the restaurant and your wallet (Hard to believe that veggies cannot be thrown in with the pricey steak.)\n\nService was stellar. Wine options reasonable and savagnon blanc chosen was yummy.\n\nLeft a comment card with email & phone but it still must be in a paper pile....
806	1	d	I first came in to DIAH last year. I was fostering a puppy who needed all of her vaccines and micro-chip, since I wasn't planning on keeping her, I was looking for a low cost veterinarian, a quick search pulled up DIAH. They offer a low cost clinic every Sunday and Wednesday. I walked in, let them know what I needed done, my total, close to $100.00, I was a bit taken back. My normal vet charges $70 for a checkup including vaccines, the only difference here was that I got a micro-chip which costs $25, on top of that, I didn't even get to see a vet, so comparing, it really wasn't low cost if the visit for vaccines only was around the same price.\n\nFast forward to one year, I ended up being a foster failure. I kept the puppy. DIAH sent me a courtesy card letting me know it was almost time for the 1 year checkup. The card stated I needed to give my pup the rabies vaccine and bring her in for an evaluation so I set up an appointment for a Saturday. I walked in, checked in, they quickly took us to the back. This time I actually got to see a vet, unlike last time. The vet checked out my pup, we discussed a few concerns, she then took my pup to the back for a few minutes then came back out. She said she looked good, told me she gave her two vaccines, not one, pointed out where they were given, and we were free to go. When we went to the counter to pay, my total $117.00. I didn't understand why they charged me that much, but I paid, they gave me a receipt then sent me on my merry way. Looking over the receipt, they gave my pup additional vaccines that weren't even ran by me or mentioned. They just took the liberty upon themselves and gave them to her. All she needed was a 3 year rabies vaccine, why would I want additional vaccines that she doesn't need? \n\nI was upset over the lack of communication skills so I won't be returning. Also, comparing prices, their \"low cost\" clinic isn't even that low cost.\nLow Cost Vaccine Prices per website:\nDA2PP only: $20\nBordetella only: $8\nRabies only: $10\nCanine influenza: $19\n\nIf you take a look at the receipt I posted DA2PP and canine influenza are the exact same price on their \"low cost\" days. You only save $1 on rabies and $3 on bordetella. You save a whopping $4. The Saturday that I went was not a low cost day, I find it very deceitful of them to state some are low cost when they're actually full price. The only good thing they have going on is the $25 micro-chipping.
807	1	d	way better than bertman's! the best - and i don't even like regular mustard! that's saying something. had to have my mom ship a few bottles to chicago. i heart you, SM.
808	1	d	Great venue, fun atmosphere and entertainment. The food potions however  are horribly tiny and mediocre at best. Our party of 4 was very disappointed. Not recommended unless you go for cocktails and light appetizers.
809	1	d	Round 2, switched it up n got the breakfast burrito.  The orders do still take some time to get ur order,  but it is what it is.. \n\nEverything was good,  cooked thoroughly,  but man,  beans in a bfast burrito..  just not into beans at all,  and dont lime places that put them in Everything.. \n\nneed to add requesting no beans,  acacado,  n sour cream even if it doesnt say so on menu.. \n\nthe food was good enough to try one more time in few weeks
810	1	d	BEWARE!! WEIRD TASTING BOBA!! I was a fan of this place before but recently I've noticed the quality of their boba has been terrible. It has this really bad after taste like it's been sitting in a metal container of some sort. I called the store and I believe I spoke to the owner, which is the older guy that works there and he didn't apologize at all and just said \"ok I'll taste boba, thank you\" and hung up! I won't be coming back here anymore and definitely won't be recommending to anyone!! I'll be going down the street to No. 1 Boba where the boba tastes right and the customer service is a lot better.
811	0	d	I went here today for the first time, and it was so nice! I got a brazilian, barely any pain and super quick! Loved it  go see Taelyr, she's awesome!
812	1	d	I lived by Spectrum Mall (it will always be Christown to me) for years and years and it has always had the potential to be great.  \n\nBut for some reason, this mall has never been able to live up to its potential.  Maybe it's the throngs of wannabe thugs that hang out here or the cheap, crappy clothing stores that make it one of the worst places to shop. The last time I went, one of the clothing stores had one big dressing room for everyone to change in together.  What the hell? \n\nI know they've tried to class it up by bringing in different stores, and they have to an extent.  But it still attracts the thugs and my god, whatever you do, don't go to the Walmart.  It's the dirtiest, smelliest, most god forsaken place in the mall.  Stay far away. And if you happen to park right outside of it, be prepared to be accosted by a lady selling tamales and another lady selling creepy dolls. And while I can appreciate their entrepreneurial spirit, they're also more than a little pushy and aggressive. And it's also a little disconcerting to have someone follow you to your car wielding a pan of tamales. But trust me, if you park here, it will happen. \n\nThe food court is truly lacking and personally, if I were you, I'd take a nice leisurely drive up Lincoln, turn right on Scottsdale Road and spend the day at Scottsdale Fashion Square- where the fitting rooms aren't communal and you won't be asked to buy a creepy doll.
813	1	d	This is the best dentists office. The  dentist and his staff are warm and welcoming. The office is sparkling clean. I highly recommend them.  I was a new patient so I needed the works. Watching a movie while you get your teeth cleaned is the best. My fiance went as well and was extremely pleased.
814	1	d	This is probably one of the worst Thai restaurants I've been to. Food, service, all was crap.\n\nI'll start with the food, cause that's the most important part.\nI got the red curry, with tofu. Super bland, no spice to it, even when I asked for their highest level of spicy.(they rate form 1-5) I don't know why they feel the need to \"American\"-ize it and make it gross. People go to Thai places for Thai food. If I wanted bland ass American food I'd go somewhere else. I even added in chilli (which took forever to request and get) and it didn't help.\nA friend I was with got the Pad Thai, which was just as horrible. It was way too sour and also lacked any spice. \nthe service was slow and rude, and in an almost completely empty restaurant, they felt the need to sit a family with three infant and toddler children next to us. How. Pleasant.\nWe left quickly after that, and were glad to.\nPretty bland place with bland food, won't be returning

We try to support our local businesses wherever it makes sense and we have had nothing but great experiences with the folks here. They have a pretty good price match+beat thing where if you show them a price for something wherever it may be they'll match and beat it. \n\nSo far I've had to buy parts for my Dyson vacuum and Nechhi sewing machine and have really appreciated the expertise in both these regards. I never felt pressured to buy something out of my price range and would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
816	0	d	I had a chance to stop by this place for a late lunch. I felt in love with the simplicity decoration of this place. I had pork bun for appetizer. It was phenomenon!! The pork was flavorful and so tender and juicy that the fat is melting in your mouth while you're eating it. A+ for the bun. I also ordered miso ramen and added spicy pork into it. The taste of miso was very light. My friends had fire and ice ramen and the signature one that I can't remember the name right now. All the broths are flavorful and distinct from each other. Only down side is, I'm not sure if I was full from the appetizer or there was too much ramen. I couldn't finish it. Overall this place is great ! Everyone should come check them out!
817	0	d	Our 2nd year coming to Logandale with LVRC.  Tim and Quinann do a fantastic job guiding you through the rocks! A challenging adventure for anyone from beginner to experienced crawler! If you are up for an adventurous off road experience I highly recommend a trip with LVRC!
818	0	d	I really like the Mozzarella, pesto, tomato appetizer the drinks are a bit sweet for my taste and over priced. It's a nice quiet place to hang if you are in the area.
819	1	d	Not very professional. It wants to be fine dining but the staff lacks training an the menu options are less than impressive. When I walked in there was no one greeting so me and another group stood around for a while not knowing what to do. The host then showed up and after a time of her not knowing why she was at work and why I was there I literally had to say \"I'm here to eat food\" before she clued in to seat me. Nice building. As a business, needs improvement.
820	0	d	Look, we have a LOT of experience with this place. They've always seemed fair and their front desk guys are easy to talk to and understand. We had a jeep that had all kinds of problems, and I had trusted that they were charging us for things that we actually needed. Until... \nLast summer my 4Runner was running rough on start up. I took it in, thinking it had to be something simple. They called back and said we had the worst luck in cars and that it was, at the least, a blown head gasket. OK, fine. Decade old vehicle, things are bound to break. But then they told me that the only way they could guarantee that the problem would be fixed is if we replaced the entire engine. For $9000. EXCUSE ME?! So you're telling me you think it's a head gasket, but just in case let's buy a whole engine? We went back and forth with them for 2 days on it and they maintained they couldn't guarantee a fix unless we replaced the whole engine. We informed them we were taking it elsewhere. The other shop told us they were sure it was the head, they had it fixed, and now 9 months later it's fine. I wouldn't ever trust Sun Devil Auto again after this.
821	0	d	Would have given this a 5 star if there was more seating and maybe a tad more a selection of crepes. \n\nWe came on father's day and had no problem getting a table.\n\nThe crepes were wonderful. We had the Papa-k, buckwheat honey, sobasada,Tahitian vanilla and second time. Nothing but delicious and satisfying. I also ordered the Tahitian vanilla maple latte iced. MMMMMMM.\n\nStaff has received some negative reviews, but I have nothing but praise for the staff and food.
822	1	d	Not the first time I've been here. I order the same thing every time and this time it has become difficult to order.\nMy experience this time has left me less than thrilled as a returning customer to never return. \n\nI ordered drunken noodles\nPad Thai\nBeef salad\nCrab rangoon \nCombo fried rice\nSide of Chinese broccoli tossed in a garlic sauce.\n\nApparently they want to charge you for a crispy pork but give you no pork and just the broccoli and rice with sauce for $8.50 when the steamed broccoli is $3.50?? So just so you understand the sauce costs more than the vegetable itself.. I don't want rice broccoli and sauce; simply wanted a side of veggie tossed in a sauce that's its, but that's not possible said the \"chef\".
823	1	d	They committed the Cardinal Sin in my opinion.  Their website stated that the sale closed at 2 pm.  I drove all the way over there and arrived at 1:20 and was curtly informed that they were closed.  When I protested and showed them their mistake by having them look at their own website, they just said (without apology) \"it was a mistake\".  Turning away potential $$$ because of your own mistake?  Cardinal Sin of selling anything.  Bye bye Lythcoop.  I'll never be back, and would advise others to beware.
824	0	d	Best Mexican restaurant i have eaten at in a long time.  The service was great and the food extraordinarily fresh for a mexican restaurant. Chips fresh with tasty salsa.    I got the veggie enchiladas and they were fantastic.  I will be back with family in tow.
825	1	d	Last February, my then girlfriend and I came to Vegas on a Valentine's Day excursion. Our first stop on the first night was the Foundation Room. We went into Mandalay Bay, and were directed into an elevator to the top, where this lounge is located.\nA former co-worker from Cedars Sinai told me about this place and it's spectacular view. She was not kidding, and I was impressed by what I saw. Check out the pic for the view.\nThe drinks were pretty strong, so I tipped very well in appreciation. The crowd was ok, but not as popping as other Vegas joints. No worries, however, as we were a bit tired from the five hour drive.\nThe indoor portion was ok, it had good music playing and some people dancing. The outside area was better, as I enjoyed the cool fresh air, and the spectacular view. The lighting was pretty good, too, and made for some memorable photos.\nIf you're looking for fast tempo, head elsewhere. For a chill time, come check this place out.
826	0	d	I've been here a few times and absolutely loved the atmosphere.  Today was a little different I had an encounter with a rather rude staff member.  I had a few choice words for her but I didn't want to cause a scene.  Needless to say I most likely won't return to this place. To the ignorant white female with short stacked dark hair working the drive thru today do your job correctly next time, it's called customer service!
827	0	d	Classic Gold Auto Centre is Solid Gold for any auto problems and you won't break the Bank when you need a repair!! Recommended to us by an old Brooklyn friend after being seriously ripped off by several incompetent Arizona mechanics, I feel like we are back home with people who love cars. We are told exactly what is wrong with our cars. We are told exactly what it will cost. No BS here. No hidden charges. And, if the job wasn't done right they work by the Old West tradition: A man is as good as his word!! We have sent several non-Brooklyn friends to Classic Gold and they have had the same great experience- every time. You don't need to have a Brooklyn Attitude to get Solid Gold treatment at Classic Gold Auto Centre!!
828	0	d	Ordered the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant with a caesar salad on the side. The salad was good, but a little heavy on the dressing in my opinion. And the sandwich was very tasteful. Also, I enjoyed that there was an area with bread, butter, and jam that allows guests to have an appetizer while waiting for their food. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a family friendly restaurant with good food that can be prepared and served quickly (with 10-15 minutes).
829	1	d	Maybe when they opened in 2009, they had better service but this place is pretty close to horrible.  I am pretty easy going, and would come back to most places but this place is a one time thing.\n\nToo many complains that are similar to others who have 1 or 2 stars.  Read theirs, its very similar to my experience there.  The 2 stars is purely for the decent quality of their meats and sides (except the macaroni salad which taste of pure mayo).  No stars for layout\/appearance\/settings, no star for unfriendly and rude customer service.  No stars for being cheapskates and posting signs asking for 25 cents for to go boxes, one refill each or they will charge u if they catch U.  Use the water cups for soda and they will \"catch you and charge U the full price\", and oh also no Restrooms.  Not even for customers.  I wonder who they bribed at the City of Tempe to get away with this.  \n\nMy own experience goes like this, stood at the counter after looking thru the menu at the side.  Was the only one there except for another customer who is sitting and talking with the cashier.  Cashier reluctantly comes over and take my order.  Told me to pick 4 sides, half way thru scooping my mac salad, turns away and disappears to the back.  Comes back and ignored me, went to the microwave and pulled out a plate of food.  Grab chopsticks and a napkin and brought it out for the customer she was busy chatting with (probably a regular)  Realized that I am still here (its hard to miss a 6-1 fella standing behind your damn counter)  and came back to get me the rest of my sides.\n\nWhat is wrong with that previous paragraph................Microwave.  other than bad service which I have already expected, i guess they have meat and stuff ready grilled and just popped them with the sides all on a plate into the microwave.  \n\nThe Kalbi ribs were decent, some sections had too much fat, use a better grade of meat to prevent this.  chicken terriyaki is good.  Meat Jun is disgusting.  Sorry whoever had it, might have had the fresh ones, mine is stale cold and microwaved, I know it because anything with egg when left for too long will start to leech oil and turn a darkish yellow color.  They have a lot of food, yes, but their formula for success is just that, lot of food, lot of mediocre, cafeteria, mess hall type of food.  if you are hungry and need a lot of food and have no problems handling this, well, its all good, this is your place to come to.  I would have loved this place when i was in college, but wait, I had mai island Grill back when I was in ASU and they made really good BBQ for about the same price.  Don't be impressed by the sides because all Korean places in the valley give U these sides of 6-8 dishes with your lunch or dinner.  Their sides are nothing special and same as any Korean place.  if that is all someone need to beat them, then just make medicore food like they do, don't use a microwave or better yet just hide it from the front, give 5 sides with every order, charge the same price, give free refills, free to go shit and last but not least, service with a smile.  Open your restaurant down the road from this place and yup, maybe even call yourself the Real Paradise Grill :)\n\nI think some of the people I usually see with great reviews on Yelp had probably came here in 2009 when it first opened but now, its lost its sense of pride in terms of appearance and food.  Its time for either an owner change or a restaurant change.  Last but not least, Sun Devils, come on, you need to pick with you feet and walk away from places that gives you bad food and service, I did, you can too.  get a george foreman grill, some korean bbq sauce, some beef short ribs, put them in a bag, pour in some bbq sauce and let it sit over night, next day just grill it.  Thats it, all the kalbi u like to eat.
830	1	d	Can't say much that others haven't before me- stopped in with my sweet-tooth BF. I don't really care for sodas or candy, so I'm not really part of the target audience here. Appreciated seeing the many vintage or limited-edition items and signage, though.\n\nIn addition to eatables and drinkables, there are some novelty items- picked up a few items as gifts for a friend. Would come back to get a selection of oddball treats as a white elephant gift or to look for a particular sweet for a friend.
831	1	d	I selected Parkway as my primary care for my new insurance. I called in and spoke with JC the most rude woman I've ever had the displeasure of talking too. I got a two inch piece of metal in my foot last night and needed a tetanus booster sooner than later. She was extremely rude and short letting me know new patients have to wait 1.5 weeks and to go somewhere else if I have a problem with that. I nicely explained that I can't wait that long as I need a booster asap. I asked her if that had slots for existing patients and she said yes as early as tomorrow am. I tried asking why I can't have one of those slots and she said \"because U can't alright\" and hung up on me. She is the reason I will be changing my primary care. To the Doctors,  its staff like this that is representing you that can tear a business apart. Fire that rude lady
832	1	d	Amazing customer service from the phone conversation when I called (the lady was so friendly, patient and knowledgable) to the actual service technition. \n\nI decided to utilize a radio deal for $129 chemical cleaning and tune up.  They came on time the next day and called to let me know before hand they would be on time and the name of my technician.  \n\nThere were no hidden costs, he took his time and did a great job.  Very polite and even took pictures to help point out a few things to watch for down the road.  \n\nI would definitely recommend and will be using them again in the future for annual maintenance.
833	1	d	Stayed at the resort for 2 nights over the weekend, and really enjoyed it for the most part.\n\nThe suite I stayed in was superb and had a back deck with an amazing view of the mountains. Modern, stylish furnishing and decor throughout. Plus a cozy fireplace! In the bedroom there was a king sized bed with comfy pillows and bedding and a super soft throw blanket. In the bathroom we had a large, egg-shaped bath tub, and spacious standing shower. Deluxe sized shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and epsom salts. There were even some loofahs (which I gladly took home with me)!\n\nThe mini-fridge was fully stocked with beers, sparking water, coconut water, regular water, Gatorade and more. Half way through drinking my coconut water I realized it was well beyond the expiration date!!! That's disgusting...\n\nThere was also your standard espresso\/coffee machine, and a drawer with numerous snacks (KIND bars, pringles, candy, etc..) and liquor.\n\nOn the last night I made appointments for massage and facial at their spa. I got the signature couture facial from May, and sports therapy massage (forgot the other girl's name). The facial involved extractions, vitamin c, hydroxy acids and enzyme exfoliation, plus they gave me a shot of collagen to drink afterwards! My masseuse described the sports therapy massage as kind of a mix between Swedish and deep tissue. They both did an amazing job with my services!\n\nAfter the spa we ordered room service from their restaurant, Elements. We chose the foie gras risotto, oysters, and farmers market salad. Within 30 minutes it was delivered to us. The oysters were SO FRESH and good!! But the risotto really stole the show. It was incredibly creamy and had a nice salty kick. We only picked at the salad a bit before leaving it to wilt on the table overnight.\n\nSo aside from the expired coconut water......I would say I had a really great stay. It's such a nice and peaceful place.
834	0	d	TLC Movers is awesome! They came through for us in a pinch. The moving company that we had scheduled to come out backed out on us at the last minute. It was 4 o clock in the afternoon, and we had to be out of our place by midnight, so needed someone to come out ASAP. While most movers I called were already wrapping things up for the day, these guys were willing to help, they even drove all the way up to north Phoenix\/ Glendale area from Chandler. They arrived at 6pm and finished at 10, doing the majority of the work in the dark. Very friendly group of guys, hard workers, and efficient, I have no complaints at all about them. Prices are very reasonable too, we paid $420 for everything, which ended up being considerably cheaper than what we would have paid through the other company. Would highly recommend!!
835	0	d	Was in town for business and had to take a group of 20 out for dinner. Since we were at the Hard Rock and Aria was rated pretty high, we gave it a shot. Restaurant was decent sized and the decor was simple. Met up with the lead waiter that was going to take care of us and we worked out the plans for dinner. I did not want the guests to worry about dinner choices so I have the waiter a dollar amount per person and away he went! A short while later food started coming out from the kitchen, some common and some never before ordered.  The food never stopped, appetizer after appetizer, entree after entree, side dish after side dish, the food never stopped! Delicious too! We had chicken, beef, pork and seafood. Vegetables of all types as well as noodles and rice. Customers were blown away and so was I!! Outstanding job by the wait staff and the kitchen. Had so much food left over and this was a. Group of big eaters! Will definitely be back!! Outstanding!!
836	0	d	Let me start with positives. I've never had a bad (weak) drink at Kelly's, and I feel it's very reasonably priced. The only food I've tried was the mac and cheese, which was ok given how much it cost.\n\nKelly's has two major issues: cleanliness and service. The booths are covered in crumbs, regardless of the time of night, and the tables often need wiping. Mysterious sticky stains abound.\n\nThe service would be so-so if not for this crazy policy: let's say you sit at a table. No waiter has been paying attention to you, so you go to the bar to get a drink. Are you allowed to bring that drink back to your table? No, you have to drink it at the bar! It's a kind of catch-22.\n\nFor these reasons, I have to give a 2 star rating - there are better bars around.
837	0	d	Went Monday night during a Vegas heat wave. Waited about twenty min for drinks. Really? The soup tasted very old, almost gravy consistency and the chicken tenders were sub par and very fatty. Could have done far better at Mickey D's. The waitress was very nice but seemed to check on us frequently at first and then at the end when I actually needed a refill was nowhere to be found. I frequent different locations of Chili's and it's never this bad. Will not go to this poor location again.
838	1	d	Made to order - so prepared to wait...BUT you will have  freshly fried chicken! \n\nChicken had the right amount of batter (not too much), was not greasy. \n\nThe yum yum sauce was good, not too much garlic.\nThe spicy chicken was well seasoned and was a mild spicy. \n\nPlace is small.\nFriendly staff.\n\n2 piece lunch meal with fries and drink - $7.99\nMy portion was pretty small, wish the pieces were bigger :)
839	0	d	Unusual atmosphere (in a good way).  Very eclectic menu, there has to be something that you're craving on the menu.  Good portions, healthy or a fat laden choices served by waitresses that look like they are from hooters (jus sharing a fact).
840	0	d	Great sandwich. Not cheap but it's not a skimpy sandwich. Good portion fresh meat big sandwich.
841	1	d	I gave this place a chance today with two of my friends and I have to say that I was not impressed. My friends got the \"Baked Carbonara\" and the \"Burrata\" while I got the \"Calamari  Fritti\", \"Lobster Spaghetti\" and a \"Gelato\".\n\nFirst off the Calamari. The appeal was basically non existent, basically just put into a bag and served on a board with a lemon and two different sauces - \"salsa verde aïoli\" and \"fresh tomato chili dip\". It also wasn't breaded properly where huge clumps of calamari portions were just stuck together, making the taste also poor.\n*Appeal - 2\/10\n*Taste - 3\/10\n\nNext up is the Lobster Spaghetti. I can't really say much about this dish other than it was alright. Nothing to special about it. It's not great nor bad. Just a really bland dish. In my opinion you're better off spending 30$ on something else.\n*Appeal - 5\/10\n*Taste - 5\/10\n\nThe Gelato. It had two flavours - Vanilla or Chocolate, I got the chocolate. The appeal of this was laughable at best, just three scoops of ice cream unto a square plate bowl. The taste was just average.\n*Appeal 2\/10\n*Taste 5\/10\n\nAs for what my friends got. I only took a bite out of each just out of curiosity. I would say the Burrata would be a 4\/10 for me only because it was not to my personal taste. You may like it but i just did not unfortunately. As for the Baked Carbonara I would say it was the best dish by far. It was really tasty a solid 8\/10.\n\nLastly the service. Our waitress was very kind and would check up on us often, solid service. However one of the servers which I would assume to be one of the front of house managers considering she was not in full server uniform, had the audacity to snap at me when I accidentally bumped a butter knife off my table with my elbow saying \"Wow you're just going to start throwing things around now.\" with a sassy tone. That is a great way to treat your customers considering your restaurant just opened a couple days ago. Real smart move 10\/10.\n\nOverall this place was sadly a huge waste of $60+. You would be better off spending your money on any of the other \"casual fine dining\" restaurants in the area. Definitely would not be coming back here.
842	0	d	My wife and I were starving for some good sushi and wanted to pig out on a budget. What better place then Haru Suhi, it was recommended to us by a friend thats live near there, and we were hooked. The place has a traditional REVOLVING sushi bar just like they do in Japan. ( you sit at the bar, and sushi comes around on a moving belt )\n\nThey always yell hello in japanese when you walk in and once your seated ( which sometimes you might have to wait if you wanna sit at the revolving bar)  you can sit down and start eating right a way. There is already sushi on moving belt, you just take the plate you want and start eating.  The portions are small but this way you get to try alot of different rolls and types of sushi instead of filling up on one or two rolls ( which is what I think what they wanted). \n\nThey charge you by the plate anything from $1.00-$2.00 and if you dont see anything you like they will make anything you want ( but charge you accordingly). I recommend the VEGAS roll, BAKED SCALLOP roll, HARU sushi, and SIZZILING SALMON are some of my favorites.\n\nWe were so full! (sushi coma) we had 14 plates ranging from $1-2  and our bill was $31 and some change, with tax, for the both of us. CHEAP! \n\nanywhere else we would have spent $50 at least.\n\nWe go there at least once a week or every other week just to eat there, and we live in Central Phoenix. Its worth the drive for us.
843	0	d	Love this place. The owner is so nice. She has the best selection of wigs to choose from. I tried on several wigs and she never said anything to me about the limit of wigs that I could try on. I know that she's off on Thursday's so maybe someone else was there when the people that are complaining went. I would recommend this place over and over.
844	0	d	Food was fantastic. Love the music. Curried Goat was amazing. Plate portions are good and decently priced. $12 for the curried goat. Extra gravy please!!!
845	0	d	Food came fast and everything else was great. I just wasn't too happy that the person that was going to take my order was helping an employee in front of me and they continuously laughed, joked around, and took about 10 minutes talking before she actually took her order while aware that a line has started behind them. Other than that the food was decent.
846	0	d	Loved the white peach margarita. It was the perfect mix of sweet and savory, with the candied jalapeno. The pretzels and the mustard sauce are delicious and unexpected at a Mexican restaurant. I also really loved the chipotle aioli that comes on the corn. If I could, I would put that on everything. The ambience is causal and low key, I'm looking forward to hanging out there again.
847	0	d	Great therapy and relaxing massage. Whatever aches and pains you have to injury or strain, Abbie can work them out for you.  Thanks Abbie!!
848	1	d	First time at this establishment and we are not disappointed with the customer service, most important factor to me, and the food. \nWe were greeted with a warm smile and was taken care of immediately. \nThe music and ambiance of this place is very pleasing, comforting, and classy. Delicious food. It's like I went to have dinner at Mom's house. \nThis place is a defined thumbs up in my book and I recommend it to locals and visitors alike.
849	1	d	I started hearing about this place a few months ago, and then really got intrigued when Fat Heads pulled the Lindemans off tap & switched it to Arsenal.  Last week I picked ~400lbs of pears at the family farm with the intention of making cider, but turns out I don't have much of a clue how to pull it off.  So, I stopped in with the hope that they could point me in the right direction, and they did not disappoint.\n\nBill & Michelle are great people, and I hope their business thrives. I don't have enough cider experience to really sing their praises, but it is very good and easy to drink...but be careful, it can be as strong as wine.  \nTheir establishment is in the bottom half of their house in Lawrenceville, so that alone speaks to their dedication to the craft; they literally live & breathe cider.  Bill was very helpful in giving me some cider-making pointers, so if you're looking to small-batch, stop by, get some advice, and be sure to take home a growler or two.   Come on Yelpers, stop by and buy some cider!
850	1	d	Does anyone else feel sketchy about going to new massage places that you've never been to? I do! You don't have to feel that way about this place at all.\n\nWalk-ins are welcomed but it's best to make a reservation in my opinion. The person on the phone was very nice when I was asking questions and all. There's a Groupon but the same specials are available in store. It's only worth using the groupon when groupon is having a sale. \n\nHere is the walk-through experience for the couples massage. They take you into the back room where the lights are dim. There are private little rooms, couple ones and single bed ones. I suggest wearing comfy shorts and clothes that are easy to remove. They only really required you to remove your top clothing but I think you should strip to your undies so that you're more comfortable. You put your feet in the foot bath. A guy gave me a massage and a girl massaged my boyfriend. I believe you can ask for whatever you feel comfortable with. I didn't really care. They massage your head first, then your shoulders. Right after that, they place your feet out of the bath and place a hot compress on your eyes. Those felt really nice! They work on your legs and your feet. They then bring out the hot stones and oh my gosh, they feel awesome! At first it feels like they're going to burn, but they don't. They then ask you to turn around and they massage your back, and then massage with hot stones. This then concludes your 70 minute treatment.\n\nSuggested tips range from $10 (good) - $30 (excellent). The massage was so good, I felt ashamed that I only had $28 in cash for the two of us. The massage was well worth $20 per person. They do have a special that per every 10 massages, you get a $20 credit, so we will definitely be coming back and next time with more cash.
851	0	d	We tried eating here for 6 days... place is always always busy\nThat's is a good signal \nWe finally  made today because the line wasn't that bad \nThe service was fast in and out in less that an hour( we were in a rush)\nThe food was great many options and very tasty.
852	1	d	Need to pay for a cleaning, and don't want to pay exorbitant fees? Try a dental hygiene clinic. Did you know that sometimes you're paying extra $$$, just because a dentist is on staff, even if you never see their face during the entire visit?\n\nIf all you need is a cleaning, and possibly some x-Rays, you can lower your costs by visiting a hygienist's office. Pricing is on par with the standardized province rates, and they work with you to determine what's best for your smile. Best of all, this clinic is open in the evenings and on Saturdays, leaving you zero excuses for tartar buildup. They also will give you a price quote over the phone, which was really my main sell point. \n\nI had a friendly hygienist who was as congenial as she was a perfectionist. She made sure I left with my teeth in the best shape possible, and even though she kept apologizing for pain, I honestly didn't feel any. She had the lightest touch. No pain! At a teeth cleaning! Novel. Though I was quoted an extra $28 for a fluoride rinse, I got it at no extra charge, along with complimentary teeth whitening.\n\nGlow bowling Ross Gellar style, anyone?
853	0	d	The line was approximately 15-20 minutes long. It was my sisters birthday. My server, Alfonso, was very rude. The meat and dessert were superb. Everything else was blegh. $30 for a person for that? Not coming back.
854	1	d	This is a great little second hand shop on 14 St SW. I've been here at least three times and each time I've found something that suits exactly what I'm looking for at a great price. The first time I found a last minute blue dress on Halloween (part of my Rainbow Brite costume!) that's nice enough to be worn out for non-costuming purposes for $8, and the second time I needed a more cocktail style dress for the work Christmas party, and again found a great dress for $8. Last time I needed a belt and while the good belts weren't the right size for me, I was able to get two ordinary belts for $1 and $2 each (there was some sort of half price deal that day).\nThey have a change room in there so that you can try things on, and they're always friendly and try to greet you as you walk in the door. I've never looked through their other sections in too much detail to see what their selection is like, but they have a fair amount of clothes and then some accessories like hats, shoes, clutches etc.\nPlus you can pay by cash or card which is super handy.
855	1	d	Dingy on the inside and out. I've tried time and time again to like occasions but I can't.\n\nThe food is mediocre at best. I had a french onion soup there that had no name croutons and tasted of salt and MSG.\nThe standard bar style food. The wait staff a lot of the time are busy tending to their own children that and being babysat by a plate of fries in the booth near the service station\n\nThe wait for everything is terrible, my main reason that I don't eat here anymore is the 30-40 min turnaround on a meal. Seriously if it's going to take you that long to cook it better taste of ambrosia and come with a happy ending.\n\nTo sum it up, I don't like it, but I gave it a fair try.
856	0	d	Tried both the Hake and Strip sirloin.  Both were good, not great. I felt the food was overpriced for overall quality of main dish or \"large plate\" as they are labeled. Drink menu was decent.
857	0	d	I am sure that the 4 things on the menu are well done, but to have only 4 options for dinner is very puzzling for me. The wine is $16 a glass which is pure robbery (especially for the wines they were offering) and the chairs are so uncomfortable we decided to get up and leave to go some where else. Sorry lemon but I don't understand how you could have regulars with such a limited menu!?
858	1	d	I'm not sure what planet these people are from.\n\nIt's not rocket science.\n\nI half expected to see one of them unzip their face to reveal the little alien in their head that's controlling the blank stare part of their brain.\n\nSmile for my DL photo?\n\nI'll try, but it's going to be hard to overcome the WTF look I have on there now...
859	1	d	It has been a really long time since I have been to the Elephant Bar and I was just there recently for a my friends Bachelorette \/Bridal party. They were informed weeks prior that we were coming so it you would think they would have been a little bit more prepared. Sadly they were not. Although the staff were friendly enough, there just were not enough of them to take care of our party of 18 along with the other tables they had to take care of inside. There was one lonely bartender and unfortunately this person could not keep up with all the orders that were being thrown at them from us along with any other patrons in the restaurant. Any time it takes more than 30 mins (not kidding) to get a drink that you have repeatedly asked your server about, then its a problem. Especially when it is something simple like a glass of wine. The food took a long time to receive as well, but I will say it was pretty good once it arrived. Sadly some people were missing items with their orders, but they did say they enjoyed their meal once they got all the missing items. \n\nIDK.. you let me down Elephant Bar. You knew we were coming and you were not prepared for us. Next time, try to be a little bit more prepared by having a few more servers and at least two bartenders on duty when you are expecting a big party. Better to be over-prepared instead of under-prepared.
860	0	d	Don't let the location fool you.  Some of the best bbq in town.  Get the brisket breakfast.
861	0	d	By far one of the most interesting sushi bars I've ever been to with a decent selection of sushi. Wait time is a little rough but overall a good dining experience for any time you are wanting sushi....
862	1	d	They may have renovated the outside... They may have renovated some of the casino gaming areas... But the rooms are still the same, crappy, smelly, dirty \"Imperial Palace\" of old.\n\nOur room on the 12th floor stank of mildew, the net curtains had holes them and the carpet had black spots all over. The balcony door was permanently sealed shut (presumably to stop people escaping) and the mattress was more like a hammock - a thin one. No bed bugs, as far as we could tell, but the sheets (while washed) were dingy and stained.\n\nYou pay a resort fee, but you get no amenities in the room. No fridge. No safe. No coffee pot. But you do get something extra in the bathroom... A sink that doesn't drain properly!\n\nEven the Gideons gave this room a miss.\n\nUpdate: Automatic checkout on the TV has a customer survey option... Unfortunately, it didn't work! Wonder why?
863	1	d	All Good!! It's all good here at Makai.  All of my experiences at Makai have been really good ones.  This is fast Hawaiian food at its finest.  Ordering your food is simple...choose your size (small, medium, or large), your meats (chicken, pork, steak, or Ahi tuna), your base (white or brown rice), and finally your sides (edamame, veggies, corn, mac salad, or kimchee slaw).  \n\nThe pricing is as good as it gets and I dare you to find another restaurant that sells quality Hawaiian food that even comes close.  The Ono, which is their small, is $4.99 and comes with your choice of one meat, rice, and a side.  The Ono'er, which is their medium, is $6.99 and comes with 2 meats, rice, and 2 sides.  The best value is their The Ono'est, which is their large, is $8.49 and comes with 3 meat sources, rice, and 2 sides.  Steak is an extra buck and the poke depends on their current market price.  I had their bowls and love the teri chicken.  I also like the fact that you can also order a la carte.  My most recent order was a side of 5 oz. steak and a 1\/2 lb. Spicy Ahi Poke.  Both were great and at that price, a steal.  Overall, I do recommend and wish a place like Makai would open all over Las Vegas.  \n\n2017 Yelp Review #41
864	0	d	My boyfriend rented a tuxedo from here for a black tie event. He was pressed for time and couldn't come in for a fitting before our event (I just picked up the tux on his behalf). He noticed as he was getting dressed for the event that the clasp on the pants was broken and as a result the pants were unwearable. He ended up not being able to wear the tuxedo at all because of this. What good is a tuxedo jacket if there are no pants to go with it? He instead wore a suit of his own, which was not ideal as it was not in line with the dress code for the event. We did call and let Top Hat Tuxedo know what had happened, and the man I spoke to told us he would run a full refund by his manager and make a note in the file about it. \n\nWhen I showed up to return the tux however, I was offered a $10 refund on a $90 rental (none of which he even wore). I was able to talk them into a $20 refund instead (anything more than $20 needs to be approved by a manager, meaning the man I talked to on the phone never followed through on his promise to do this). I was told that \"most of these mistakes are usually caught during the fitting.\" The implication here was that it was somehow our fault that they did not catch the defect earlier in the process. I would think that all elements of the tuxedo rental would be inspected as the tuxedo was being assembled for rental. The fact that Top Hat Tuxedo apparently needed several opportunities to catch the defect is not my problem. In the end, the rental was a disappointment, but it was how bad and inconsistent the customer service was that ensured we won't be back.
865	1	d	Rates a 1. The guy taking ATF applications was (in my opinion) a smart a#! totally lacking in any customer service skills - was insulting and acted like he was doing me a favor selling me a handgun. Needless to say I spent my $1500 purchase at another store. Not going back to this one!
866	0	d	Love it! I've been going there for years!! I wish it was near me in Gilbert!
867	1	d	I use to come here when I worked nearby. \n\nSchlotzski's wasn't my favorite place for lunch, but it was so much better than the fast food options nearby. I mean, how much Taco Bell can one eat, right?  LOL\n\nSo we decided to take a chance before grocery shopping and we're glad we did. As we finished our meal, we looked at each other and said almost in unison, \"well it's a lot better than the last time we were here.\"\n\nIf UR familiar with Schlotzsky's, it is a Austin, TX (photo) take on east coast deli. Is it like Katz's or Carnegie or 2nd Avenue, heck no!  But they do serve Tom Carvel ice cream and Cinnabon. LOL. If UR from FL, think a deli version of Miami Subs. \n\nWe've enjoyed the Roast Beef, Pastrami, BLT and a some of the other sandwiches. All were good, just don't think NYC deli and you'll do just fine. Expect to pay $8 to $12. \n\nSo Three Stars, A-Okay.
868	0	d	Enjoyed an outstanding meal at Unwined this evening.  The Surf & Turf (filet and scallops) was the perfect entree for two to share.  The mashed potatoes and asparagus were perfect sides.  We enjoyed a glass of California Cab that was a great selection!  The ambience was very welcoming and friendly.  Great service!
869	0	d	I wouldn't choose to live here again. The office has one nice, helpful person, the rest of them are not very intelligent. They are not quick at fixing things if they ever get around to it. Worst part, my apartment wasn't ready for me to move into which was a huge inconvenience. Even though I'd signed my lease and put down the deposit 3 months prior, I had to wait a week after my initial move in date. The grounds are nice, but don't let it fool you, the community washers are always broken and the spa didn't work for almost 7 months. Very unhappy here - and to top it off, they gave 48 hours notice to do major renovation on my apartment - installing a washer\/dryer hook up I declined to have. They took everything out of my closets and threw it on my bed\/floor. Also when I came home for lunch, my apartment was covered in plastic tarp - I couldn't even use my kitchen! And my front door was wide open with the air conditioner blazing. Thank GOD my cats were hiding in fear under the bed, they could have gotten out. I was so mad, they told me I should board my cats during the WEEK of construction taking place, yes, I'm unable to use my apartment from 8-5 every day and even though I'm paying rent for my pets and I they have to be somewhere else too on my dime. This place is a disaster, get my opinion, DON'T ever live here.
870	1	d	This place is seriously cute and Erin the owner is simply delightful. She makes everything pretty much from scratch gluten-free and vegetarian or vegan friendly. Everything is about $7 and includes a soup or salad.\n\nMy TOMATO MELT on RYE with avocado, havarti, and rosemary garlic mayo was absolutely superb.  I can't wait to go back and try the CHUNKY HUMMUS SANDWICH on RYE with bell peppers, green onion, cucumber, and sprouts or the GRILLED BRIE SANDWICH on OATMEAL RAISIN bread with honey baked apples. Yum!
871	0	d	We went here for a round last night.  I think the concept is very cool\/spacious\/comfortable. I'm not sure what size draft beer we received, after ordering a \"tall\" (12-16oz maybe)....but at $7 each, what a joke! We would return, but likely only with a group to play a quick yard game or something.
872	1	d	Terrible experience!! My boyfriend and I came here to spend a very special night, which is our 4th anniversary. We were greeted with so unhappy hostess, asked if we wanted to be inside or patio, we then decided to go to the patio because it's a nice and quiet ambiance. We were sat and was offered a book of their wines and drinks. We asked our server (I forgot his name because he was never around) to give us a minute to decide what to order. He came back and we were struggling what to order because I was unfamiliar of authentic Italian food. We then decided to get their appetizer combo, which are: shaved carrots with mozzarella, grilled octopus and beef tartar. After ordering, we were given pieces of bread, no utensils or napkins, I even had to get the attention of one of their bussers.. don't understand why are they not being attentive to their guests and needs.. anyway, we also ordered two drinks which are the Mediterranean mule and blood orange martini, (ALSO TOOK 15 mins to come) our food came and we were surprised that we got one of each of the appetizers because our server didn't bother explaining that it is not shareable and both guests are getting the same thing. Mozzarella with carrots was so bland, grilled octopus was just too oily and the beef tartar is just a slice of meat and some leaf... VERY DISAPPOINTED! We were so unhappy and frustrated that we couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant!! We were supposed to order an entree and dessert but we both totally lost our appetite. We asked for our check and our server asked if there was anything wrong because he can see that our food was barely touched and eaten. I then, explained to him that we did not like the food at all and all he did was shake his head and say awww... IM SORRY ABOUT THAT.... we spent 75$ for 2 combo appetizers and 2 drinks and our server didn't even try to make us feel better, because if this happened in other restaurant, the food would've been comped or we were asked if there is anything else we would like... thanks to the amazing employees for making our 4th anniversary the MOST MEMORABLE ANNIVERSARY yet!!! NEVER EVER GOING TO RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHER PEOPLE.. DONT EVEN BOTHER. I don't ever leave such bad reviews but our time spent here was a waste, money down the drain SO we are never coming back. \n\nOur dinner was at 7:30 today (MAY 22,2017) in the patio. I don't know the server's name, I hope next time you can make your guests happy and have a memorable night with great food and experience.
873	0	d	Food was very good, service needs a lot work. Not a place i would crave but they have some interesting options. I would go back just not run to it. They really need to work on the service and the time it takes to get your order. We were sitting outside on a very hot Henderson\/Vegas day and felt pretty ignored.
874	0	d	Talk about horrible customer service. The manager Ermetra H is real piece of work. I had an item that was faded and she made it a point to go all the way back to the specific department and find one. When she was unsuccessful she found one the was \"similar\" (it was not)... She stated she had nothing prices at 2.99 everything's was at 3.99.... (Seriously a $1.00) Ermetra was pushy and when I told her the price ticket showed compare to $4 that it didn't make sense it being priced at $3.99. \n \nErmetra seems to need more customer training after all I spent more money. All over a $1.00.... Good luck!
875	0	d	Great light crusted pizza  just like from Brooklyn.   They use homemade Mozarella.   Unbelievable!
876	0	d	Wonderful array of desserts! Everything is made fresh, and it is all delicious! The Oreo and Red Velvet cheesecakes are my personal favorites. The prices are a little steep, but for an every so often stop, it is worth it!
877	1	d	Chouette découverte d'une partie de l'équipe Yelp de Montréal et en plus j'ai gagné un donuts, que demander de plus ??
878	0	d	I often feel like every female my age in Calgary shops at Aritzia. There is nothing more disconcerting than realizing that you and ten of your friends all own the same sweater but in different colours and vaguely different designs. Several of my friends are on the record as saying that's because Aritzia is the only place to find nice clothes in Calgary. I disagree, and maybe that's because my tastes run a little quirkier or I just prefer to be a little unique. \n\nThey do have great clothes, though not always quality ones. I'm well endowed and am hardly a stick, but I've still found some pretty cute items. I just get frustrated when my 30 dollar tank top pills hardcore after two washes. Despite all these facts, a goodly part of my wardrobe is still made up of clothing from Aritzia. \n\nThe staff are very friendly and eager to help. They take your selections to the fitting rooms for you, and after you've made a decision take the purchases up to the register. I used to work in retail, and so when this first happened I was really offended. \"I'm not going to steal anything!\" I wanted to snap at the girl, until I realized they were doing this to all of the customers. I admit to feeling slightly smothered with all the help. I don't always like it.
879	0	d	Andrea did a fantastic job on my wedding this past weekend. She is an excellent florist and produced absolutely gorgeous bridal bouquets. She decorated our cake and tables at the reception as well with a great style and taste. \n\nWe have met with her before the wedding and she gave us tons of helpful suggestions and ideas. She also patiently worked with us on our budget. On the wedding date, she also served as our wedding coordinator. She seamlessly connected our events, reminded us the time table, guided the guests to events, and most importantly managed all of the \"crisis\" for us. It is only fair to say that we got to enjoy the wedding as much as we did because of her effort.  For what she charges, the service is better that we can could bargain for and far exceed our expectations. My wife and I are deeply grateful to her help. We recommend her with highest enthusiasm.
880	0	d	Ahhmazing cheesesteak. Was a bit of a wait but pretty much worth it. Loved the wine selection and other grocery goodies!
881	1	d	I came here a couple months back to get my haircut. I had been growing my hair out for 8 months; I wanted the top long and a clean sharp part on both sides leading to a fade down. I specifically said \"I do not want to cut any length off the top, I want it to go from short abruptly to long so I can push it to once side or the other and have a clean part.\" She seemed to listen but ended up blending the entire thing, leaving me with a huge middle length section on both sides (uneven I might add, the left side was blended much better than the right side). It looked like something out a 90's fashion catalog or off a boy-band poster. Not modern at all. After visiting 3 other barbers, we finally decided that I have to start growing it all over again cause they can't easily undo what she did without it looking horrible in the interim. So now I'm back to square one, trying to grow my hair out all over again...\n\nThe ONLY reason I'm not giving the 1-star is because she was very nice and the atmosphere was inviting. But I would not recommend going there unless you still have backstreet boys posters and think jean shorts are stylish.
882	0	d	Cannot get better. Staff is corteous . They make you feel so much at home. Prices are so less that its hard to believe how they manage. Extraordinary selection of cakes and pastries. The lunch items are simply amazing. We always hog on the Portuguese tarts, and shrimp\/ chicken patties. Just too yummy. We also tried the caramel cheesecake which is to die for. Simply an amazing shop. We try going there T least once a week... its such a charm. And yes you get a regular coffee refill.
883	1	d	There isn't so much wrong with Tahiti Joe's to give it a horrible experience. After all, the positives are pretty good:\n\n- clean environment \n- large TVs showing sports\n- mood lighting\n- right on property of Tahiti Village\n- decent selection of beers on tap\n\nThe thing is, it is the small things that really bring this place down. Things like:\n\n- strange butt smell when I visited that was even mentioned by one of the workers\n- no audio at all for the TV, so watching sports is less impactful\n- completely dead even at 8 PM\n\nIt's not a bad place, and the location itself is very convenient if you're staying at Tahiti Village. The problem is, with so much potential, the place feels fairly depressing without people.\n\nIf you like a bar that you can imagine to be your own place catered to your needs, then this place is good for you. But if you're a person who enjoys drinking with a crowd, and getting into the excitement of a football game with all the audio entact, then search elsewhere.
884	0	d	The second that Dr. Bracken starts treating humans I will be the first on line! What an amazing doctor he is.... the love, care and compassion that he has shown my \"family\" will forever be treasured deep in our hearts!
885	0	d	A classic Jewish deli. Hope you are prepared to leave full! \n\nLiverwurst sandwich was huge and tasty, but I wouldn't call it the best I've ever had. Although prepared very well, the liverwurst itself lacked flavor.
886	0	d	This is a cool place to buy craft beer. They also bring in some very cool beer on tap. The owner and the employees know a TON about beer and are most helpful. Did I mention the cool beer selection and...well...they are getting better stocking wine and spirits but ironically Khoury's is all about...THE BEER...
887	0	d	It was just ok. I was a little disappointed that the food that I ordered the chimichanga and the enchiladas we're on the Bland side. The service was outstanding the atmosphere was nice I was just a little disappointed in the food. I will give it another try and just see if I caught them on a bad day.
888	0	d	Sky is on a long list of regular lunch joints for my colleagues and I. Although I'd say it's near the top of the list. I would probably never come by for dinner here simply because I live far enough away and have plenty of options closer to me.\n\nLots of lunch dish choices and you can get most of them for less than $10. When you get anything fried (general Tso's, sesame chicken, etc.) the fried outside usually has a good crunch to it. It's not soggy like these dishes can end up being at many other Chinese places. The long-short of it though is this is otherwise just your basic Chinese food served on a nice plate in a nicer restaurant with good décor and trendy music.\n\nAt lunch time they're pretty empty and the service isn't bad as a result. The staff tend to disappear though and take some time to come back and check on you. It is at least a more relaxed experience because of there being less people in the restaurant. They could stand to update\/repair\/landscape the exterior of the building a bit. And it would be nice to maybe check them out for dinner sometime.
889	1	d	When I discovered this place, I knew I could no longer eat at the sandwhich chain that promotes healthy eating and weight loss. There's nothing healthy about having a sandwhich that has a huge chunk of cream cheese and regular cheese and mayo...and I freaking love it!!! My taste buds are happy little campers every time I leave this place.\nMy two favorites are the surfin' cow and Santa Cruz. Each sandwhich is packed full of meat and veggies, like freaking huge. I always have them add sprouts to the sandwhich, it gives it that extra kick for me. I always get the sandwhiches toasted. Super yummy, especially with the cream cheese.\n\nMy only bad experience was when they accidentally left the bacon out of my sandwhich. Instead of bringing the bacon on a small plate or a napkin, the guy just came over to my table and handed it to me with his bare hands. Ummm, can you say gross? I just didn't eat it. But I love this place and I will be back:)
890	0	d	Ok, I heard so much about Wing Stop so wanted to try. I tell you this, don't get the boneless wings it's a no go the taste, the texture...I was not impressed at all & will not get it again. Then the rolls, they made it sound good to get the rolls. Another failure the rolls are so dry and taste as if it was the frozen type you put in the oven to warm up, no butter or anything. I was so disappointed. Maybe it's just this location on Losee.
891	0	d	Good coffee but no wifi! Seriously. Had to use Peter piper's wifi next door which of course didn't work great. Truly inexplicable.
892	0	d	The best 24-hour cafe in a vegas casino on the strip. The food is pretty awesome, decently priced, and the setting is what you expect from the Wynn.\n\nThe food here is breakfast and lunch fare. I really like the Tandoori chicken wrap and the greek salad. They pull both of those off very well. Every friend I bring here ends up leaving satisfied with the food. None of it is mind-blowing, but its solid, reliable, quasi-gourmet. \n\nBut the best thing about this place is that YOU (yes...YOU!) can afford to eat at the Wynn! ...if you eat here. Granted, everything is about $3 over-priced, but you pay for the surroundings, which are Wynn-tastic.\n\nIf you sit indoors, you sit on faux-french chairs or couches, surrounded by fancy colored drapes and lighting which are familiar to the entire interior of the casino. But the real winner here is if you can eat outside on the patio. There, you sit directly beneath (and in the shade provided by)  the behemoth Wynn tower overlooking the pool area. And at the Wynn, the pool area is really worth seeing (even if you can't stay there). The table umbrellas even have misters on the corners to keep you cool when it's 108 degrees outside.
893	1	d	Acadia Shutters were wonderful to work with. We had a bad experience with a company before putting off our installation for a few weeks since we were a \"smaller\" order. Acadia got them into our house right when they said they would!! The shutters make our house look phenomenal. They are such high quality shutters.\n\nPam and her team were so great as well, they offered great suggestions on how to lay out the blinds, which really made a difference! We will DEFINITELY be getting them to do the rest of our house. \n\nThey were even so great to come back out the next day, because our wall was a little uneven & the hinge wasn't closing. They got it fixed right up too!! \n\nWe can't thank them enough. Their prices were VERY reasonable, the quality was PERFECT, and they are so nice & responsive! Definitely hire them!!
894	0	d	Food is good but the portion are getting smaller. I'm thinking ol Federico is falling on some hard times. This was my go to place when I wanted mexican food but I think I'm gonna have to find another place to get more bang for my buck
895	1	d	I hesitate to write this review, because in all fairness my first visit to the restaurant was last night and perhaps we just had bad luck. I dined with my father and my boyfriend. My father has been to Steak 44 about 4-5 times now and it had been one of his favorite steak places to go to in the Valley. Which is saying something. We also consider ourselves \"steak snobs\" as we only buy and cook prime meats and if we are going to venture out to a restaurant for a steak it is going to be top quality prime as well. All three of us ordered the bone in ribeye which is our favorite cut. My boyfriend's and mine came out as we ordered, but they were very under-seasoned. I am not a salt person, my chef brother is always complaining that i don't put enough salt in my dishes. But I actually had to ADD salt to my steak. My father chewed and spit out nearly every bite of his steak stated that there was a huge amount of sinewy gristle in his. To us, this signifies that this cut of steak is a borderline choice (not prime) cut. Which to us is completely unacceptable. To serve a steak at this caliber restaurant, the cuts of meat have to be completely prime, they shouldn't 'borderline' anything. Needless to say, he was very disappointed. \n\nBoyfriend and I shared the soft shell crab as an appetizer. Word to soft shell crab lovers: don't get this! I saw another review thought they were terrible as well and sent them back. We didn't feel quite that way, but the crabs were soggy and again, under-seasoned. My father had the crab and avocado stack and was less than impressed. \n\nOur waiter was disinterested at best. He showed no emotion on his face, didn't ask how our steaks were cooked until half way through eating them, and just didn't seem too thrilled to be there (this is one of those things that we could have just been unlucky with. I've seen others rave about the service). But I've been to same caliber steak houses elsewhere where the server asks everyone to cut into their meat immediately after it's served to ensure the cooking temperature is just right. That didn't happen here. \n\nThe lobster mac and cheese was very grainy. Tasted like easy mac with some chunks of lobster. I've had better.\n\nThe pros: we had a quite table towards the kitchen which was nice! We could actually hear ourselves talk. I liked that. The dessert was interesting, we shared the Cookies and Cream popcorn, and it was pretty good! I like unique desserts. Finally, the BREAD!! I could have eaten that bread only for dinner and been perfectly happy. It was by far the best thing I ate all night. \n\nIt seems to us that they're starting to cut corners (cheaper cuts of meat, grainy mac and cheese, etc). And that is how restaurants in this city die. We have an extremely high turnover rate for restaurants and the patrons know when a costly place is starting to cut corners and they will go somewhere else. I don't know if I'll be going back to Steak 44 any time soon, but I know my father won't.
896	0	d	Crappy food, crappy service, crappy beer, an owner with no spine, but near PNC. So there is that.
897	0	d	I have worked with Mr. O'Conner in the past. He is professional, knowledgeable, kept me in the loop and did everything possible to resolve my case. I appreciate his work and dedication and I look forward to working with him in the future.
898	1	d	This is a great apartment complex. I lived there for a year. The neighbors are polite and quiet, and the office staff is friendly and easy to deal with. The complex is pet-friendly, and the rent is reasonable. It's not in the nicest neighborhood, but the complex itself is far nicer than its surroundings. There is ample free parking, and the laundry rooms are credit card operated, so no fishing for quarters every week.\n\nWhen I moved out, I got my whole deposit back - no shenanigans or trying to rip me off. I took off one star because they don't take online rent payments or have an after-hours drop box. Since I work during normal business hours, I had to mail my rent check every month a few days before it was due to make sure it got there. Otherwise, it's a great place.
899	0	d	Good Restaurant at The Cosmopolitan Las Vegas. We come here so many time for lunch set menu and also dinner. Food is so very nice and service. When you come here don't forget order tomato salad. I recommend Coz all the time I come here I do it.
900	0	d	I loved their food. The crispy shrimp tacos and the baja fish were delicious!! Must visit but don't expect good service. I felt the server responsible for our table was not at all nice and had a stick up his ass. Will definitely go back for the food, just ask for a different server
901	1	d	Have to say out of all the circle k's I've stopped at, this is the one I've received the best service at. I've been here several times at night and all three attendants I've come across have been very helpful and accommodating!! They've been very helpful with directions an with tips on place to go in Phoenix. Prices inside are comparable to other gas stations but the service has been very consistent! This is my main gas station. The only bad thing about this spot is that I haven't won the lottery here yet... Lol!
902	0	d	Stopped by on a Tuesday evening, service and food was good, a little pricy but worth the stop.  Will stop back when wanting Mexican food and atmosphere.
903	0	d	Edited to add: every night is a different atmosphere! Thursday nights are pool tournament nights? It's a serious atmosphere but not bad! Customer Service still great.\n\nSmall, Hole in the wall but fun! Has 2 pool tables, a bar, few tables and a patio. Definitely would describe as \"intimate.\"\n\nAs someone who just moved to the area, I'm trying to find places where I can have a low key kind of night...and boy is this the place! I was a little hesitant to enter an obvious drinking establishment alone as young woman of color but Everyone at the bar was friendly (without too many creepy people in the mix) and drink specials were cheap. The food is just okay but free Karaoke on the Saturday I went made up for it.  They have bands on other Saturdays and other things during the week as well.\n\nI definitely would go again and recommend to people who aren't looking for anything fancy.
904	1	d	The former Hilton is hands down the best place to watch games, especially on Sundays for Football Central. They have a whole theater showing the games in addition to the sports book, the most reliable spreads for betting, and the cheapest beer (priorities) ;) It's the next best thing to actually being at the game (even better actually cause the beers are cheaper!) Especially when my team wins...Go Panthers ;)
905	1	d	Prime Rib.... Check\nSnow crab legs.... Check\nCountless desserts... Check\nYou will over eat here so make sure to wear stretchy pants.
906	1	d	Nice atmosphere, but the food is just ok.  Not exactly authentic Vietnamese.  We tried the pho and Thai fish cake sandwich.  We also had beef skewers - a Cambodian dish.  We didn't like the beef skewers at all, the marinade had a sour note.  The pho was salty but not really aromatic.  My sandwich had good bread and meat, but the condiments weren't right, especially the pickled vegetables.  They were too sweet and not traditional.  They also topped it off with a sweet and sour sauce, which was a bit odd.  For dessert, we shared the fried bananas.  I believe they used unripened bananas, so they were firm but not sweet at all.
907	1	d	This is your average run of the mill nursery. My wife and I are planning on redoing our backyard and they are very close to us.So we have spent a fair amount of time in here milling over their fair selection of trees,shrubs,and cacti.\n\n The staff is semi distant from there customers and it seems like 1 out of 5 visits we have someone ask if were finding everything ok. But if its not one of the times they ask be prepared to try and find one of the staff members strategically hidden throughout the store.
908	1	d	I will never come back to this location, \nThe service was terrible!\nThe cashier was nice until I presented my groupon.\n\nHe completely changed, and gave me an attitude.\n\nWhy place your restaurant on groupn if your going to give your customers an attitude.\n\nThen I heard him talk about me and was laughing about me.\n\nI dont recommend this place
909	1	d	First and foremost, I love that Baby Stacks is a family owned business. They are obviously doing well since they now have 4 locations in town. I have heard nothing but good things about this place and was finally so excited to be able to try it. I was most looking forward to the famous babystack pancakes. I do think I will be the odd man out when I say that this place was just A-OK though.\n\nThe bf and I wandered in for a late brunch around 2pm, and we were seated right away. This place is super small, so I can see how there would be a wait during peak hours which is from 9a-12p Sat and Sun. They take to-go orders, but not during peak hours so be advised. They are open 7 days a week from 7a-2p on weekdays and 7a-3p on weekends. \n\nI ordered the loco moco with garlic fried rice (+$1) and for my side I upgraded to a small baby stack and got the red velvet pancakes. My boyfriend had the piglet omelette with seasoned potatoes and toast. The loco moco is a Hawaiian dish which has 2 burger patties topped with 2 eggs and brown gravy, all sitting on a bed of rice. I loved the garlic fried rice, it was soo tasty and went well with the rest of my food. The burger patties were underseasoned, but the gravy was really flavorful and definitely made the dish come together. I tried the pancakes the minute they arrived at my table. This should be a dessert they were soo sweet. They were good though, but I didn't think they lived up to the hype. They were topped with whipped cream and cream cheese syrup which came in a little cup on the side. I did really enjoy the cream cheese syrup and found myself scraping the little cup to get the last bit of it onto my cakes. \n\nMy boyfriend's omelette was 4 eggs stuffed with bacon, sausage, ham and cheddar. He also added jalapenos for a small charge. While it was plentiful, it was nothing memorable. It was $23 for both of us which I though was very reasonable. We only ordered waters though so drinks would have been a bit more. I plan to come back and try some other yummy pancake flavors, especially the lemon ricotta and the banana cream pie.
910	0	d	I love Cantina Laredo's margarita. Best ever. What I don't like about CL is their happy hour rules. I've gone there often to meet friends for happy hour, and sometimes we have 10 or more girls, but they are so strict about happy hour deals being in the bar only. Even when the dining room is completely empty. It just doesn't seem like a good business model and makes me not want to go there.
911	1	d	This is the corner where business comes to die, but I hope this one makes it. \n\nAs soon as the pedestrian white walls of Ye Olde Donut & BBQ and, more recently, the late Derald's Diner were washed in the much richer brick red paint, the folks across the street at El Charro got off their asses and re-painted their \"Tortas - Tacos - Burritos\" signs. American capitalism at work.\n\nSeating is limited at Maize and there are no public bathrooms. It is counter service with about ten barstools.
912	1	d	So don't watch a movie you care about after work you will sleep. So that is what I did at Harkins. \n\nAMC has a cheap CHEAP matinee ticket and I thought I would check it out. I went early to see Rogue One and got a great seat! The chairs are all recliners and so comfy!  Every seat is a great seat  \n\nThey serve food and the previously sold snacks. They had beverages on tap and you can create your own experience. From family night to date night.
913	0	d	This was one of my few frustrating moments with Hertz. I'm not a fan of the Las Vegas Airport Hertz. They are expensive and as others mentioned they charge to add drivers. Never before has that happened. Additionally the lady that helped us was very difficult to work with. She couldn't care less it seemed. Not sure I'll ever rent again in Vegas from Hertz.
914	0	d	well I have been to the chandler and this place. if I lived in chandler I would stay with them, this place had way to many people, it felt like I was a cow in a slaughter house. in and out, I did not even tip. I think I will be canceling my membership if this is what I am going to expect.
915	1	d	Rina is the sweetest! I was referred to her by a friend at my gym, and I've been very pleased with her work so far. As a devoted Cherry Lash Lounge customer for years, I'd started to become a bit disillusioned with their prices and the fact that my extensions were barely lasting 2 weeks. \n\nAlthough the shop where Rina works isn't fancy or plush, it's comfortable enough. She'll play whatever music you like while you're on the table, and she even has a blanket so you can nap while she works on your lashes. She discusses what look and length you'd like before she starts to make sure you're satisfied. \n\nMy lashes always look great when she's finished, and she works quickly and efficiently. Her prices are very reasonable, and she accepts cash or credit cards. You can even schedule your appointments via text with her and she'll send you a confirmation reminder the day before.\n\nAlthough my lashes (especially one eye) starts looking like they're riding the struggle bus by the third week, I attribute that mostly to a combination of the way I sleep and the amount I exercise.\n\nIf you are looking for an affordable set of lashes by a great artist, I highly recommend Rina!
916	0	d	Downsizing after some 40 years in Virginia has been a truly daunting task.  But by doing a bit every weekend our \"stuff\" has finally found its way home.  \n\nWe rented a small unit from Dessert Storage.  I found them on-line and was caught up by their glitzy marketing materials.  To my surprise, this company more than lived up to the promises made.  The facility itself is easy to find, very accessible, bright, clean, safe and secure.   And climate controlled!!   The employees are knowledgeable, courteous and friendly.  If the need ever presents itself again, I will rent from this company again.
917	1	d	Never liked this store, granted I have only ever shopped the 1st floor...still always the same outcome. Employees usually size you up and down and can't be bothered by us peasants unless we got an Hermes bag hanging off of our shoulder. (I'm not the one behind the counter am I now, plus if I wanted to be judged I'd call my mother.) Today was no different. Come in to get some Laura Mercier moisturizer,  no one around that counter. I started looking through the testers and that's when a saleslady approached. While looking I realized that some of their testers were toddlers...3 YRS OLD, no joke expired in 2015...newer ones expired last year-2017. I mentioned this to the sales woman and she replied \"it's fine, those are just testers, our product is good\"...wtf?  What is this Wallmart? Tester means people test them on their face, sweet God!  I'm sure there's a reason for expiration dates on make up, then again who am I to question the almighty Saks sales woman.  It's like if Costco gave out expired samples...\"don't worry about our green ham, those are just samples\". \nLet's not even talk about the fact that she had no idea how much the product cost or asked me if I needed help figuring out my shade... \nThankfully they were out of stock, why wouldn't they be, plebs like me deserves no make up from fancy Saks Fifth Avenue. So, I spent my pennies at Sephora where testers are within expiration date and it doesn't smell like mothballs soaked in rosewater and judgement. \n I guess since running things this way for years, they figure us sheep will just come through the doors take their crap and feel soever grateful for a chance to waste our money there, well I'm out. Consider a name change to Sucks Fifth Avenue.
918	0	d	Had a great stay while here for Dodgers Spring Training. Room service was pretty affordable considering it is room service. Westgate Entertainment district is walking distance (it's like a ghost town though when there aren't events at Cardinals stadium or Jobing Arena) There's a trolley at Westgate that goes to Camelback Ranch every 30 minutes on game day. Cardinals stadium & Jobing Arena are also walking distance. The rooms are very spacious & love that they have Aveda products. Extra bonus is the mini toothpaste. \n\nPool area was nice, although understaffed. People are slobs & it would be nice if either guest put their dirty towels in the designated area or staff was there to clear unused cabanas & lounge chairs. I know, you're on vacation. But that doesn't mean common courtesy should go out the window. The bar & pool side service is kinda hit or miss, hence the understaffed.  \n\nOur one negative experience was at the restaurant. We were seated immediately and then it all went downhill. There were very few diners & it took FOREVER to get our order taken, get our food, and get our bill. Got the wrong food but I was starving & just ate what they brought. Had I not been staying at the hotel, I probably would have gotten up and left. \n\nWill definitely stay again but will either eat offsite or order room service instead.
919	1	d	After going to another dealership which was a nightmare we found the ninja 650 we were looking for at kelly's. The salesman we dealt with was Joey and he made it a pleasure to be there and simple to buy a bike !! We would go there again if we ever need to get another bike.
920	0	d	Love it here they are great and they do a good job for a reasonable price. Great little neighborhood nail shop
921	0	d	I've been here 3 times now. I first came because it was close to my house, but I loved it so much that I went twice more. So, it's not the cheapest place, but it is totally worth it. I've been to all different types of nails salons and this is by far my favorite in AZ. They do a great job for the price and don't cheap out on anything. You definitely leave feeling like it was worth it. Plus, everyone here is really nice. Especially the owner. He is very sweet and has a great sense of humor! I'll be back again for sure.
922	1	d	Some of their cakes are really good - if pre-ordered the whole cake.. or you are lucky to come when the cakes are freshly sliced. Otherwise we have gotten some usually really good cakes that look and taste old. For example, their Chocolate Banana cake CAN BE divine! But... if you get it few days old (like I did) - it goes straight into garbage. The cake I got was so dry, hard to cut into.. and just tasted old and hard. Their Pistachio Cheesecake did not taste like pistachios at all - another disappointment. Their Carrot Cake is tasty but more on the sweet side. My favourite so far has been Red Velvet Cheesecake- but maybe I was just lucky enough to get it fresh. Be careful. Do not get too many old cakes. Ask if they are fresh from today!
923	1	d	The White Chocolate Grill is a nice restaurant with a good sized menu. Some things are super expensive but its nice because there's a range, not everything is crazy pricey! So I had not been here in many years but I went back for lunch today. \nI love a good house-made veggie burger and was happy to see this option on the menu. Was also happy to see all of the different sides to choose from. I went the unhealthy route and got fries though haha. The veggie burger sounded really delicious, with brown rice, quinoa, walnuts, all the things I like in a veggie burger! Unfortunately I do not think I read close enough and there was pickles on it. I like pickles in general but hate them on sandwiches for some reason, and felt like the taste was still there when I took them off so that was a tad disappointing, but my own fault haha. Also the bun was a bit soggy on the bottom and there was too much spicy mayo (which was not spicy). The patty itself was very good though and the sesame bun was yummy, the other veggies on there were tasty! I think if I go back I'd just have to ask for no pickles and no mayo then I'd be happy. It was still expensive for a veggie burger though, I've had cheaper ones that are much better, but I did like it. I tried the broccoli too and enjoyed it! Our server was very nice and chatty, and the atmosphere there is awesome. Overall, not my number one fave restaurant, but not too shabby!
924	1	d	Anna is the daughter\/hostess\/server for this family owned restaurant. Very sweet and great service. \n\nWe had the gyro and veggie pizza. Both REALLY good. And great fries. \nThis place is definitely worth visiting!
925	1	d	Ordered lunch via Grubhub. Arrived ridiculously quick and stayed hot since it was way earlier than quoted. I had the Szechuan tofu and it was very good! Took a star off as there was only 4 pieces of scallion pancake, most places serve much more. \nI'll order again but skip the scallion pancake.
926	0	d	Love the Pre-tech days of Silicon valley vibe - Great Bar, Amazing activities and Great Atmosphere - Love the Diner, Ice Skate in The Winter and outdoor games in the spring - Downtown has a gem that must be experienced!
927	1	d	Saltimbocca!\n\nWhat did you call me?!\n\nHey, settle down. Saltimbocca is griddle bread known from Naples. Cibo Urban Pizzaria Cafe's saltimbocca bread is baked fresh in a wood burning oven. \n\nIt was a good call to order lunch from Cibo. Not only does the cafe make a great environment to relax from the bustle of your day, but the food is pretty good too. \n\nTwo of their vegetarian sandwiches are close to my heart. Vegetariano and the Alla Parmigiana. Both are 9.50 each and I got them with the side house salad. \n\nVegetariano has grilled zucchini, roasted red bell peppers, grilled eggplant and mozzarella. \n\nAlla Parmigiana has fried eggplant, mozzarella, tomato sauce, parmigiano, and basil.\n\nIf you know me, you know me and a lot of cheese don't get along. So in place of the mozza I used the parmigiano slices from the salad on my sandwiches. The flavor of grilled veggies came through. And I was a happy camper. Yum yum. https:\/\/youtu.be\/UoMuNARHRvk
928	0	d	I come here about twice a month. Thought I would review it. Visited not long after they were open so it wasn't that busy. Place was clean, person who took my order greeted me and was pleasant. Food wait time wasn't long, and the food was good. They generally have plenty of staff and one thing I like about five guys is that they have one person continually clean the dining hall. Wendy's did this 30 years ago but stopped the practice.
929	0	d	If you want a perfect bagel this is the place for you. Great flavors. The texture is crisp and chewy but not too thick or thin. They have an awesome selection daily of not just bagel and bagel sandwiches but muffins and other treats. Friendly staff and very clean.
930	1	d	Ok.. so that bus wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. My boyfriend and I got a bus ticket to take to Fremont because a taxi would've been around $30 each way. \nThere were a lot of tourists on the bus which made me feel a lot safer but coming back to the strip there were a few sketchy people and I will most likely just take a taxi next time so I feel more comfortable. \n\nAnother thing that made me feel a bit nervous was that they wait for awhile at stops to pack as many people as they can onto The Deuce. This results in many people standing and it gets very congested. \nThere were also many interesting smells and I hope that I will never smell those smells ever again!! \nRegardless of the potent smells and many people, it isn't THAT bad. They do keep it as clean as they possibly can and every time we were on it the AC was fully blasted.\nIf you have kids with you, I would only recommend taking the bus up and down the strip not all the way to Fremont st. \nThe experience was memorable and I am glad I tried it once!
931	0	d	Four of my friends and I went to Winchell's a few nights ago on a whim and know we'll be going back.   I have lived 2 miles from this place and just got around to giving it a try.   We all had nothing but good comments here.  \nMaureen's seafood pasta looked delicious and, according to her, was just that.  Large scallops, shrimp and other fish in a great looking creamy sauce over linguini.  She ate every bit.\n\nSandy and Jeannette loved their Reuben sandwiches although they both had to take half home because they are huge!!  The sandwich is served with a marble rye bread that they particularly liked.\n\nMy French Dip sandwich in a Ciabatta roll was one of the best.  I love this sandwich but not always good in some places.  This one was exceptional.  Very tender, juicy stacked beef, thinly sliced to perfection on a very fresh (maybe too fresh) Ciabatta roll.  Not to salty au jus for dipping made this a darn good meal. I swore I would take half home but ........:-)\n Tons of very crispy french fries, sprinkled with a zesty seasoned salt could get me to love french fries again.  Ditto on the coleslaw side.\n\nService was excellent.  We overstayed our welcome because we were enjoying the conversation as we always do and no one tried to rush us out.  \n\nThe  menu is large and the prices are very reasonable for the portions served.\nThe restaurant is divided  by an enclosed glass smoking section completely  apart from the non-smoking section.  .  We liked that.
932	1	d	I would have never chosen this place to stay when in Vegas. Since turning 21, I've only gone to Vegas with my friends so we tend to stay closer to whatever club we intended on going to. As I was with my parents and kids my brothers age (aka 16-18), clubs were definitely not what we were concerned about. \n\nThe Good: \nThe stratosphere itself is free to hotel guests. The lines aren't that long, guess it depends on when you go. You can get to the top pretty easily - 10 people to an elevator. Getting to the top was great. Stop off on floor 108 for the inside observatory and floor 109 for the outside. The inside was pretty cool. That's also where they have the bungee jumping - there was someone doing it when we were up there. Pretty awesome. The outside observation deck is cold in the winter, but the views are gorgeous up there! \n\nThe bar at the 107 floor is pretty cool too. Definitely a cheap way to get to the top and see the views without having to pay all that money for the stratosphere. \n\nThe bad: \nHonestly, the location is just far from everything. Maybe except the SLS, which is still far from all the other hotels on the strip. It's just north, much more north than I thought. Since they're building resort world, it just seems so much further from everything right now. At any time, it's just about a $20 cab ride to the strip (even more if there's a ton of traffic). Then again, you could just drive yourself, but if you plan on drinking, it's not fun. \n\nThe Ugly:\nMy mom ordered the deluxe room for the stay, but the other people ordered the premier room so my mom called the hotel to see how big of a difference it would be. They told her $15 per room per day. Not a big deal. Then, when we arrived, the price changed to $30 per room per day to upgrade and that was not what the hotel told my mom when she called. Anyways, after an hour wait and discussions with the manager (and some angry words from my dad), we got the hotel rooms as we thought. However, no strip view which is what was promised with the $30 extra dollars paid by our friends. Also, our rooms were not next to each other but close enough. Regardless, not happy by the time we made it into our rooms. \n\nOverall bad experience and probably never going to stay here again. it's not a bad hotel persay, but I like staying closer to all the fun and the amazing food!
933	0	d	Super Gross. I stopped here for lunch today and found a lovely surprise in my Black Bean Chicken Bowl:\n\n3 RANDOM PILLS! \n\nThey had been cooked with either the broccoli or rice (a black bean substitute) and had started to disintegrate so I couldn't tell what they where.\n\nThe GM wasn't there, but they gave me my money back. Lucky I didn't eat any. God knows how many other people where served rice\/broccoli from the same batch. Ugh.
934	0	d	Every time I'm in Las Vegas I have to see Heather at Humble Bee. Simply put she's the best and only one I trust! Heather provides a great experience from beginning to end. \n\nThe studio is very clean, comfortable, and relaxing. Heather educated and kindly answered all my questions regarding sugaring along with other treatment services offered. \n\nThroughout the treatment Heather was very engaging and encouraging which really made the difference for me. \n\nI've already been complimented by my girlfriend and look forward to returning in 6 weeks for another treatment. \n\nThanks again Heather and Humble Bee!
935	0	d	Steiners's staff is the most friendly. They do the best at knowing everyone's drinks AND names which is rare to find. We love coming here. Food is incredible. Best bar food in town. Bartender Maxanne makes the tastiest Bloody Mary, I strongly recommend trying one if she's working. Kimber and Tobin are a couple of our other favorites as well, always good for a nice laugh too. Going to steiners on Cheyenne is nothing short of a great experience. If you haven't been there, you should add it to your list.
936	1	d	This is pretty much a no brainer.  It's Arizona.  It gets very hot and very dry.  Your car is bound to get dirty and you just can't rely on the rain to help you clean it off.\n\nThe Clean Freak Car Wash is your basic drive through car wash.  Someone will check you in and take your money, then you drive the car through the wash yourself.  I much prefer this to the old fashioned car washes where you had to leave the car and wait around while it goes through the wash cycle.  After you exit the building you pull up to the self serve vacuum cleaners and detail the inside to your own high (or low) standards.\n\nA basic car wash at Clean Freak costs $5. A monthly pass, which allows you to wash your car as often as you wish, is only $16.  If I lived here, I would absolutely sign up for the monthly pass.  You can order fancier washes with more buttons and whistles (those are metaphorical buttons and whistles) at a slightly higher price.\n\nI may not live in Phoenix, but I DO live in Bakersfield, California, so I know a thing or two about staying cool in spite of a sizzling summer sun.  I drive a dark colored car, so during the summer the interior can be pretty hot when I first get in.  Back home I am on the unlimited wash plan, so during the hot months I leave 5 minutes early and get my car washed on my way to where I am going.  It lowers the interior and exterior temperature of my car quickly, making it much more comfortable to be in.  My air conditioner blows cooler after I have been through the wash, too.  My external temperature display will go down anywhere from 10 to 15 degrees within 5 minutes of leaving the car wash!  \n\nTake that sizzling summer heat!
937	1	d	This place was so much fun to eat at! Beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains at night- which does its fountain show every 15 minutes. Most of the seats are geared to give a good view- so already a hit with the ambiance, right off the bat.\nWe walked in on a Thursday night without a reservation, and even though they were busy, we got seated within 5 minutes.\nThe food was also really amazing. It's French (go figure), and upscale. Service was great too (I ordered a drink and didn't like it, they replaced it with a good wine instead) and very attentive. \nWe got the scallop appetizer, while admittedly it was small, it was delicious and perfectly seasoned and seared. We each got an entree- and neither disappointed. \nNext time I visit Vegas, I'll be sure to come here again!
938	0	d	This place is bananas.  I saw Avicii play here this month and it was PACKED!!!.  By the end of the day it was tough to get around but nobody seemed to mind.  If you are looking for a wild Vegas experience I don't think there is a better day club.  If you are looking for something quiet and relaxing then be advised, EBC is not the place for you.  Just make sure to bring plenty of cash, all that fun comes at a high price.
939	0	d	I got a huge nail on my front left tire and it turned flat, flats as pancake pan in just a few seconds. Luckily the accident happened near to 24 hour tire shop. I slowly drove the car to them. The filling to have a flat tire is most than disturbing. \nA mechanic removed the nail ad it was a really huge piece of metal - one of those the construction workers are using to fix the roofs. He offered me a used tire for $35.\nHowever, I decided to change all of them and after some negotiations for quantity, he agreed to sell me 4 brand new Michelin 17 inches tires for 160$. A really good deal in my eyes, considering the fact we are talking about brand new tires at 2 am. They just helped a traveler get home safely and in a good mood.
940	1	d	This review is for the hostess only;\n\nWe pull up to the parking lot and the parking attendant says it's a 4 hour wait however to check in.  He gives us a tip that we can walk around the neighborhood but to call about 30 minutes prior to the estimated seat time.  We check in, at 9:20 PM and the blond hostess says the wait is 2.5 hours.  That means we'll be seated at midnight.  She also says that we can check out the Bar next door and they can call us from there.  She states that the bar closes at 10 PM so if we want to be in the bar we need to be inside.  After thinking about it, we didn't want to spoil our appetite by ordering food and drinks so we decided to go back to the place where we were staying and change to more comfortable.  After all, the hostess wrote that we would be seated around 11:45 PM on her notepad.\n\nWe come back at 10:45,  one hour prior to when we're suppose to be seated and she's says sorry I can't seat you because you weren't here at 10 PM.  Excuse me, you said it's 2.5 hours thus equaling almost midnight.  The hostess says you have to be here at 10 PM, which we were like WTF - you said we could walk around.  So it seems like this place wants you to chill at the bar and order drinks to get more $$$, thus extending the wait time.   I then told the hostess what the parking attendant had said that we could go around and in the future for other patrons to make sure that he had his facts straight.  She already tuned out acting like a doorman at a club.  Excuse me, but this place isn't a Michelin star restaurant or anything - so don't give me your stuck up attitude.   She then tried to go off on me like I was an idiot, and I was like that's okay I don't need to eat here that bad.   Why quote 2.5 hours (midnight you'll be seated), then expect customers to wait around for 2 hours?  It seriously does not make any sense.   And does a restaurant seriously expect you to wait 2 hours waiting around?  \n\nSo note to your management, please make sure that your parking attendant and hostess are on the same page when telling customers what they can and cannot do.  I'm rating this place 1 star based on their customer service of the hostess.  The hostess was incredibly rude and snobbish.   I would not recommend this place based off the hostess who is a representative of the restaurant.
941	0	d	Pretty decent Vietnamese restaurant. \n\nClean and a cosy ambience is the first feeling you got when you walk in. Servers are coming to help you right away but are not very communicative\/friendly. Not that they are arrogant or with bad manners... They are just quiet, which is probably the only one real down side of this establishment. \n\nOrdered a mango salad that was prepared fairly quick and tasted pretty fresh and the portion was generous. \n\nAs per the pho I've chosen, tripe, tendon beef with rice noodles, the pho overall was tasty and of a good portion too. The broth was flavour but for my taste was just a bit blend. \nI wish I could have a bit more green to use but if compared to other competitors I certainly cannot complain about it. \n\nOverall food is done well, portions are good and all priced well. \n\nI would certainly consider to return to dine here.
942	1	d	Would love to give this restaurant more stars because of the AYCE crab legs which is the main reason that I visit. But after my visit last night for my dads birthday, I don't think I will be returning. The service was nothing more than terrible last night. Considering that we had a large party of about 16 people, complaints are going to happen...and how those complaints are handled by staff says a lot about the establishment. For starters we had to use a total of 2 tables for our party. At first notice the waitress seemed flustered like she wasn't expecting to be serving 2 tables or had no experience with doing it. Everything was fine in the beginning and everyone was enjoying their meals. One member of our party ordered mushrooms which she felt were burnt and sent them back. The waitresses response was \"those aren't burnt\"...not very customer service like. At one table alone we had 4 out of 8 people order the AYCE crab legs. The other table had also ordered about 2 AYCE orders. Our waitress (Deidra) kept the crab legs coming at a pretty steady pace. About 10-15 buckets of crab legs later, my dad (whose birthday it was btw) asked for another order of crab legs. The waitress then said she couldn't serve him anymore because she would lose her job because he was sharing them...huhhhh??? She also proceeded to tell another person in our party the same thing. Considering that EVERY ONE in our party ordered a full meal ($25+) including some AYCE shrimp meals etc, we had no idea that sharing would be such a big deal (The bottom of the menu clearly states that plate sharing is an extra $7. Just add on the damn money instead of denying us our orders). To downright refuse us meals that we already paid for just didn't seem right at all! WE WANT AYCE! Lol. So my dad was clearly taken aback and asked for management. EPIC FAIL. The high & mighty manager pounced over like the donkey that she is, and when trying to explain to her that my dad only shared crab legs with my step mother who couldn't eat a lot because of gastric by-pass surgery the manager says \"well that has nothing to do with it, we don't allow sharing\", everything we said she had an argumentative come-back for. No sense of customer service & problem solving skills at ALL! My step mother then made note to the manager that they were very argumentative and brought up the mushroom incident. The manager says \"well those mushrooms weren't burnt, I saw them\". The whole time she was just being an argumentative asshole so we informed that we would be contacting upper management.\n\nAfter the whole AYCE incident our party pretty much brought up more incidents. Like the fact that one person in our party ordered AYCE perch but wanted a seasoned fish to taste. He liked it and requested more. More was never brought out for him although the waitress insisted that it was (she even said she sent it out with another waiter so it wasn't her fault). Yeah ok. Lots of commotion was happening from the catastrophe that was the bad service & when overhearing a member of our party say that she wasn't going to ask for the manager again because she would end up cussing her out, the waitress threatens us and says \"well if it's a problem the police are outside\". Police? Seriously? The waitress actually called the police on us because she said she felt \"threatened\"...talk about poor service! While passing out receipts she had to redo the receipts upwards of 3x because she couldn't even get that right! The waitress then overhears my stepmother complaining about the overall staff experience and the waitress says \"well maybe it wouldn't happen if you were a better customer\". I couldn't believe my ears!!! And to top it all off, before leaving I tried to finish my salad and guess what I found? A LONG BLONDE HAIR smh. We will not be returning at all!
943	0	d	This review is not based on anything other than service. Was out in Old Town on a Wednesday for some drinks with my boyfriend. I have lived in Phoenix for 17 years and also work at a bar in Old Town. Came here because the crowd was good and music and we were just bar hopping. Went up to an open space in the bar to get a couple drinks..had my credit card out and waited. From what I could see there were 2 girl bartenders that night and it was a pretty busy night for a Wednesday. I'm in the industry so I totally understand being busy and not getting to me right away...no big deal...but what I don't understand is the bartender making drinks for another person RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME ....looks RIGHT AT ME. I smile and wait since I figured she looked at me so she knows I'm waiting. But she does no sort of ackowkedging of me or \"I'll be right with you\" or \"hey I'm so sorry I'm super slammed but I will be right back\" Nothing. I understand if other people were before me and she needs to serve others before me...great...just let me know..all I got was a bartender with a shitty attitude and look on her face...I've worked in Old Town for years and KNOW how busy it gets especially in season...but I also know how to give good service and acknowledge people even when I am busy. If you can't handle it or don't like it..then don't work there. Little did she know I'm a great tipper but after being repeatedly ignored I didn't want her getting any of my money. I can't stand people in the industry that act like that and plus its just super unattractive women who act like that. However the bartender Jordan at Dakota was AMAZING. She was sooo sweet and nice and personable. Their music and vibe was great.
944	0	d	I took my car there yesterday because it had been making a screeching sound under the hood for a couple days. Mike himself drove my car for a short while and initially thought it was something minor; like perhaps a dented dust-guard. Once up, he saw the problem was that my brake pads were dangerously thin and in need of repair. \n\nSo all in all, I paid roughly $291 for new front brake pads and new rotors. I did some research and my dealership probably would have charged around 4-$500 for the same work, on top of a $200 or so diagnostic charge.\n\nI can't speak for some others here who claimed to have had bad experiences with there; maybe they did and maybe some are just trying to give Mike a bad name. But I had a nice experience; Mike himself got me in right away and gave me a good price.
945	0	d	Enjoyed the variety of the small plates menu. Some missed the mark like the avocado toast. However, everything was seasonally fresh, great drinks, and attentive service.
946	0	d	Horrible service. We were seated within about 2 min,  but then took forever after that. We waited 20 min just for our server to come over and get our drinks order. I was trying to order our food while he was taking our drinks order and he put up his finger to stop me and told me he would be back. It took him 15 min to come get our food order, and then 50 min to get our food. The food was really good and he brought our to go boxes and check when we were finished with our food. He took the check but never returned with the change. We paid in cash and waited about 10 min for him to come back and he was no where to be found. We packed up my 2 year old and new born and were walking out the door and I saw our waiter at the bar eating. \n\nThis was our first time going to an outback and will definitely go back for the food but to a different location.
947	0	d	We had really good basic breakfasts when we went. Looking around there were other more creative dishes but we stuck to the basics for our first time. The thought was if they can't do the basics well the rest might not be real great.  Food was really good. My Denver Omelet was on point. Veggies were perfectly cooked. Tasted great.  Diner os pretty small. Service was very nice.  They are new so it wasn't perfect but we enjoyed it.
948	0	d	Nice atmosphere. I called for a short notice appointment for a friend and I and they were able to accommodate us within the hour. A basic mani and pedi is  $32 which I think is a great deal. Of course a la Carte for upgrades on your mani or pedi will cost more. I think that they did a good job and they made an effort to make us comfortable. I also made an appointment for eyelash extensions and will update my review when I get those done.
949	1	d	Meh.\n\nI speak French and came here with a French girlfriend once. We both immediately agreed that this place was simply trying too hard to be a stereotypically snobby overpriced French restaurant. Maybe we ourselves were being snobby just thinking that. Whatever the case, to satisfy her nostalgie pour la France we preferred the much less snobby but equally high quality Sophie's. \n\nChacun sa route !
950	0	d	We came here on recommendation from a friend who finds it hard to find decent Mexican food in Vegas. \n\nThe good? They have pretty good service, decent guacamole, and my friend's scallops were great, just doused in sauce. Oh, and she ordered a blood orange margarita that was delicious!\n\nThe rest of our meal? Salsas are quite bland, the steak nachos were covered in some orange sauce that made my stomach do somersaults almost immediately...Strangely enough, the carne asada on our nachos was better then the carne asada plate we ordered. Also, I specifically asked what veggies came with the meal because they said we could substitute. The waitress told me squash and zucchini. Perfect! My friend and I both ordered the veggies. When our meals were served, she got the veggies and the ones on my plate were tomatoes and cucumber--more like a tiny Greek salad. I was highly annoyed. For dessert, I just ordered my toddler berries with whipped cream. The berries came in a bowl of a side dish--maybe a dozen total. The whipped cream was a side of creme fraiche. For a toddler. Really? She's two. \"Me no like it\" is what kept coming out of her mouth. \n\nLastly, the pricing. I paid $138 for two appetizers, two main courses, a tiny bowl of fruit, one alcoholic drink and two sodas--and only ate about 65% of the meal. Huge disappointment. What I'm more confused about is the pricing of the items. I understand it's Vegas and you pay for location. Seriously. I get it. But since when do scallops and shrimp have the same price as a quesadilla or enchiladas?? I'll admit, the quesadilla looked appetizing, but my soul wouldn't let me order it. Quesadillas are what we eat when we need to throw something together quick!\n\nI would not eat here again. I would rather spend more money and indulge my taste buds. I think most of us don't enjoy their meal when it's overpriced and below satisfactory. My bf barely finished the meal and in the words of our daughter said, \"me no like it.\"
951	0	d	My son went here for a week because I found a groupon. The staff was very friendly and accommodating since he was only going for a week. His teacher was very welcoming and loving, and the entire staff was very welcoming as well. After just one week we felt like we were a part of their family. The place is clean and has a great outdoor area for kids. The classrooms are big and bright and very nice. If my son wasn't starting school I would've kept him there.
952	1	d	I finally went. It was a great time. Crowded, eclectic, food, art, people watching, free hugs. Given a chance, I would go again.
953	0	d	Fast and efficient downtown Calgary Starbucks.  Was impressed with the baristas ability to keep up with large orders, all correct and quick.  Great Job!
954	1	d	Usually, I'm very picky with boba, but Teason has definitely exceeded my expectations!\n\nTeason is located in a strip mall across the street from Green Valley High School. It's a very small shop with a few benches to sit while you wait for your drink, but no actual tables or chairs. Customer service was friendly and the shop is decorated well.\n\nThe menu consists of a varitey of slushies, \"Specialteas\", milk teas, coffee, and a few food items. All drinks are reasonably priced at $3.95 for 16 oz. (Tea Son) and come in a reusable plastic bottle. They do however offer a 32 oz. size (Tea Daddy) if you're wanting more! The word play on the sizes made me giggle.\n\nMy standard drink at every boba shop I visit is a taro milk tea with boba. Teason makes a great taro milk tea! It had the perfect amount of sweetness and it was really creamy, just how I like it.\n\nMy sister ordered the T.G.I.F- Peach, lychee, strawberry shaken black tea. It was so refreshing and not overwhelmingly sweet like most flavored teas I've tried elsewhere.\n\nI wasn't expecting the boba to be great, but it was cooked perfectly! Great taste as well as texture. The boba can either make it or break it for me and Teason has nailed it!\n\nIt makes me extremely happy that more boba places are popping up in the Henderson area! I'll be returning to Teason sooner than soon.
955	0	d	I don't really like eating at the food court in Arrowhead Mall. Luckily, this place is right next to the mall. They have great burgers! It's a little different than In & Out, but comparably tasty. My all time favorite is The Hangover Burger. I love the way the egg melts over the bacon when you bite into the burger. It's seriously worth the 774 calories! I like my burger medium. I also add on potato wedges because they're spot on delicious. My boyfriend enjoys trying the exotic burgers from the menu. His favorite is the Kobe Burger. \n\nFor your burgers, you can either get a small (1\/3 lb) or large (1\/2 lb). They have a topping bar where you can add lettuce, tomatoes, onions, condiments, etc. This place is the perfect place to bring your kids. There's plenty of space for them to roam around. They even have a little game shack for the kids.
956	1	d	Free show and the kids enjoyed it, not bad for your typical Vegas tourist trap.\n\nThe family and I arrived 25 minutes before the show began and managed to get a good view. We all enjoyed the fire plus heat, the cool lights, and the sound effects of the volcano. \n\nNext time you are walking by The Mirage with a drink in your hand and have some time to kill, check out the Mirage Volcano for a free light and fire show.
957	1	d	A word to the wise, get the pomegranate margaritas and get them in a pitcher! \n\nThey seriously serve up the best margaritas ever. \nI love the duck pond! When I first tried this place I was sitting outside with some friends enjoying a beautiful Arizona day noshing on the Mexican fare, when two crazy ducks came flapping by our table and rolling on the ground in a fight\/mating dance! \n\nThe food is amazing, I love enchiladas. Try the Seafood ones on Monday nights, YUM!
958	1	d	Was drug in here against my will last Thursday! I will admit the place looks awesome at night. Unfortunately, there was a photo shoot going on (for Maxim Mag) and the douche factor was unusually high. I'll come back on a weeknight or day-drinking on a weekend and see if my attitude improves.\n\nI hear this is the ultimate for day-drinking and people watching.
959	0	d	Its great to have seen this place become a notable destination in Phoenix. I love the atmosphere and rotating art work. While they have a creative list of signature cocktails, my go-to drinks are off their extensive beer list. My usual picks: La Fin Du Monde and Framboise Lambic.
960	1	d	If you'd like to Fiddle with this Fox, this isn't the place to come. I won't be here! I don't really drink, and when I do I don't like being overcharged, and this place does.\n\nHaving said that, it's on The Danforth so I expect it. I haven't eaten here, but our drinks were fine, service was good, cokes, Labbatts, Molson, everything went down well. Nice little atmosphere and this place really dominates The Danforth as the main pub along the Greektown street, so if you want to go drinking in these parts, this would be a good place to start.\n\nPlus it's named after me.
961	1	d	I'm a book lover! Or hoarder, depending upon your point of view. LOL. So Half Price Books is a nice place for me to browse for some used books.\n\nI also have an allergy to molds and dust that tends to limit my time in places like this. My family finds this amusing of course. But, this store isn't too bad on my sinuses and selection is pretty good. Prices are also good and the staff is very helpful. Though admitedly they get busy at times and there are only a few employees who work here. So be patient. \n\nBesides Half Priced Books, both the Phoenix and Mesa locations of Bookman's have a nice selection. They also do a big business of buying back your books. \n\nThe Book Bin over on Via Linda and 90th, though small has a good selection of paperbacks and is family run. A plus in my opinion.\n\nSo if you like to read, I would add each of these places to your list for a visit.
962	0	d	I think they have another location in Vegas which is better... this location is made to order and the other location had carts going around.  It's just ok for me.  More like something you'd get in a mall food court.  I guess when you want dim sum at 8 p.m. you can't complain too much.
963	0	d	I moved into The Wyatt in June from out of state. At first I wasn't the biggest fan on the management but absolutely loved the complex. A couple months ago they changed owners and it's been a great improvement. The office staff is always very kind and professional. I haven't had any maintenance issues since moving in but I always have pleasant in counters with the maintenance staff when I see them out and about. \n\nNow why I originally moved in here is because I fell in  LOVE with my apartment!  After taking a tour of a model and seeing the location of the available unit I was sold. I'm located close to the pool and my apartment came with a smart tv, the kitchen has new appliances, and it was so clean and welcoming. I have met several of my neighbors and they are all very nice. I enjoy the diversity of this community. There are young professionals, families, retired couples and everything in between. \n\nI would like to add one thing about the negativity in other reviews. I have never seen anything as dramatic or scary as what's being described by other reviewers. This is a nice, quiet, clean and well maintained property that I plan on staying in for awhile. My 6 month lease is up in December and I plan on renewing for another year.
964	1	d	\"We can attest, arrange\n\"We can assess, we can attain\n\"We are the intrical entities\"\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn A Sentence™\nThey have chicken (in the form of strips), they are friendly (in the form of they might get their asses fired if they are not overtly faux friendly), and their sweet tea might give you type-II (if you drink it). \n\nQuick Review™\n+ Chicken is good*. Toast is good**. Sweet tea is good***. \n(*But isn't all chicken?) (**But isn't all buttered toast?) (***But isn't all sweet tea, until you have diabetes that is.)\n\n- Caniac® Club card is practically useless. Big negative! (\/Trump)\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nIt is a chain and therefore the food offered should be the same here as everywhere else the company operates. We're not here to discuss the food ....\n\nAlthough, I must mention here [and in every Cane's review] that the coleslaw is close to inedible. You may think the truth may vary on this account; however, you will be finding that you are sorely mistaken. Coleslaw's nasty. (I bet Cane wouldn't even eat that shit!)\n\nWhat are we here to talk about then if not the food? \n\n------------------------------------------\n\nFood\nI lied. I'll discuss some food. This is Yelp® after all! There are a couple of things we can count on around here (Yelp): people who have no business belonging to the \"Elite\" fraternity will be in there, HQ is comprised of incompetent, minimum-wage earning goons who are forced to eat plain rice every day just to continue living, and there will be food (discussed). I digress. \n\nStrips and a few sides is all they have. If you don't know this already, you might have been raised in a cave, or Alaska (same difference). Strips, fries, the damn 700 calories or so toast, coleslaw that is not fit for mammal consumption, et. cetera. \n\nStrips are better than other chains. Sandwich made of strips is better than other chains. Sweet tea compels you to get up from your seat multiple times to refill. \n\nService\nThe service at this Raising Cane's is exceptional for a fast food chain. They are usually so friendly, they might even inch out In-N-Out Burger® for the crown as friendliest service in this category. They take care of you when they mess up. \n\nCustomers\nIt is so packed here at all times one would imagine that the food is free (or there is no other restaurant in all of Northtown)!\n\nFirsthand experiences: I rode in the back of a motor vehicle filled with dudes -- no, not farm hands but dudes in the colloquial sense -- and walked in through the doors. I stood in queue. I ordered a sandwich. I paid with a Chase® Credit Card. I filled a cup to the top with sweet tea. I went into the restroom (men's) to wash my hands. The restroom was clean and well serviced despite the immense busyness of the restaurant. I washed my hands. I sat back down. I waited for a short period after that (approximate one minute) to be called, retrieved the tray (with sandwich), filled two little cups with ketchup, sat down, and begin eating. I ate. Et. cetera.\n\nPro Tip: \nThey offer military\/service\/uniform discount for those uniformed. \n \n------------------------------------------\n\nTourists: none here+. (+Except when they are driving up the 15 towards Utah and decide to get off to acquire some nourishment in World Famous Northtown.)\n\nKids: good for them. \n\nDogs: good for them++. (++I think there is outside seating and I am pretty sure Cane was a fucking dog, so ....)\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nRating: Three-stars, \"A-OK.\"\n\nIn Memoriam \nCane, the dog\n(Unk. - Unk.)
965	0	d	We live next to this restaurant and decided to try it. The restaurant is clean and inviting and the staff were friendly. It has the feeling of a chipotle. We purchased two pork barbacoa burritos. The burritos unfortunately lacked flavor. The tortillas were very plain tasting, especially compared to the other places in town (eg, Faustos, Cafe Rio). The meat also lacked the flavor usually associated with pork barbacoa. The burritos were pretty large though. If you enjoy very Americanized \"Mexican\" food (I wouldn't call this Mexican food though) and are in the area, it's worth stopping and trying.
966	0	d	Great food, really enjoyed my time over. the place might be small with not much stuff on the wall but who needs that. I cam for the pizza and loved it,
967	0	d	really fun awesome place! I love the cheap drinks and awesome atmosphere! And there is so much to do! I mean come on they have tether ball and a full size volleyball court! Who wouldn't love this place. A bit dirty and grimy but all good dive bars are!
968	0	d	Erica, the concierge at The Signature at MGM Grand, recommended this amazing pizzeria for us to try.  Absolutely delicious chicken and artichoke pizza made by hand with fresh ingredients.  The chicken wings were unbelievably good, and the high quality oil they use for them provided a wonderful crispness and flavor.  Best of all they deliver!
969	1	d	I'm happy to report that I have decided to give this place 5 stars.  That's right folks...the picky, stuck up, food snob gives a NEW place 5 stars. Wow.  Shocking, I know.  I give 5 stars because number one, service was great.  And then because ALL 5 food items were delicious and I enjoyed every bite of each one. I tried the calamari-wonderful light, yet crispy breading and great kimchi butter sauce, shrimp boil-flavorful , street corn-array of seasonings, sauce and parm cheese, grilled noodles-peanut and Korean BBQ sauce was soooooo good, BBQ shrimp-YUM!!\n\nI was really happy with this visit and it's pretty rare to impress me with ALL the dishes I try.  5 out of 5 wins the gold, 5 stars!  I will most definitely be heading back to try some other menu items that I couldn't fit in my stomach this time around!
970	1	d	Ducked in with my Vegas squad for some 'Zzah and it was a fine time, here's why: \n* Big Brick Oven doin' its thing! \n* Pretty Boy service. Our waiter looked like he models. \n* Smells fabulous inside! \n* Flavors were to die for! \n* I enjoyed an expensive (relatively) Meatball Sub and House Salad (extra $) with Balsamic and they both rocked!  \n* Epic Balsamic, and I am an aficionado. I can drink that ish. \n* Decor was rock and roll cool. \n* Craft Beers make friends. \n* Music was appropriate. Rock. \n* Central Bar. \n* Pizza to go near the front door is less expensive. \n\nGood stuff, \nCabeza OUT!
971	1	d	808 tapas is wonderful. Nice simple interior....tons of options to choose from on the menu with simple descriptions. \n\nI came here for lunch with some friends starving and left happy as can be...\nStaff is great...I love Hawaiian hospitality. So friendly and bubbly. \n\nI got the following... \n\nSpicy tuna cracker \nChef suggestion...I was craving a spicy tuna with crispy rice but they didn't have that...\nAmazing. So delicious. Spicy tuna on top of a fried seaweed wasabi flavored cracker.  Probably my favorite from the entire meal.\n** liked it so much I ordered 2 :P \n\nYellowtail sashimi \nButtery.  Fresh. \nThumbs up\n\n808 ceviche \nSweeter than your average ceviche because of the mango. Served with taro chips.  Not my favorite but not bad.  I just love ceviche and this wasn't what I expected.  \n\nAdegeshi tofu \nLightly fried with Japanese mushrooms and a nice teriyaki sauce. Very good. \n\nBeef tataki\nServed with garlic ponzu. Thumbs up.  Yum. \n\nYellowtail jalapeño \nServed with a yuzu cilantro sauce with cucumber and a piece of jalapeño. Obviously I'm a fan of their yellowtail. *-*\n\nChicken katsu \nVery nicely done. Thumbs up.  \n\nButa hara sautee \nPork belly and asparagus sauteed in a garlic soy sauce.  The pork belly was cut up in cubes, personally a bit to salty for me but my friend loved it.  \n\nId come here more often of it was closer to where I live...but if ever in the area Id definitely stop in.  Try them out *-*
972	0	d	i come here just for the chinois salad and fried calamari. it's absolutely delicious and so unique. the salad is fresh and so flavorful. the calamari reminds me of the dish that we had a few times at the r&g lounge in san francisco. (a great restaurant in chinatown). i will have to visit wolfgang pucks restaurant in dallas just to have these dishes again!\n\nthe service is great and we split the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. the dish was very good, but i've had better meatloaf. i like a more southern homecooked meatloaf rather than the upscale version.
973	1	d	Ok this one of the reasons I not only live in Las Vegas but that I love Las Vegas. This has been and always will be a city of possibilities. Talk about paying it forward, Rob Roy {the genius (literally) behind the Super Nap Center} has created a space for start-ups to work and collaborate. These kids are brimming with great ideas. We are the next Silicon Valley. My advice to any tech company that was duped into moving to California, pack your bags and come to Las Vegas! No income tax! Free Trade Zone! Very little traffic (compared to California)! And you can afford to buy a house here!If that doesn't persuade you to come here, then perhaps your not as smart as you think you are. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
974	0	d	I like Maizie's...I like it a lot. I think that for what it is its a good addition to the area. \n\nI met Melissa H., Christine O. and Melissa H. for happy hour today and I was quite pleased. Their specials, which run from 4-6, feature a good selection of $5 apps, $3 beers and well drinks, and $2 off glasses of wine. There were two wines on the wine list that I am a fan of so that made for a very happy hour. (Or two) \n\nThe space is small. Intimate. Cozy. But not New York cozy where they have to pull out the table so you can slide into the booth. Its definitely more restaurant than bar. I like it because it fills a nice niche, its cute, its neighborhood-y, and its inexpensive. The menu is pretty large. Although I just sampled a few apps and soup (gauc- ok, could have used more cilantro, salsa- pretty decent, spinach artichoke dip- good, and french onion soup- very good, wished it was a larger crock) I would be willing to try their sandwiches (perhaps not the entrees) and I definitely want to try their brunch. Once the light rail is up and running I think I'll be here for brunch quite often! \n\nYou have to understand what Maizie's is....its a neighborhood restaurant. Not in the Applebee's kind of sense but in the sense its one of those places you can count on when you don't want to cook and just want to eat out. Its not a special occasion type of place. Meet friends there for happy hour or grab a bite to eat before heading out..
975	0	d	Food 4.5\/5 (not a consistent exp.)\nStaff 5\/5\nAtmosphere 2.5 \/5\n\nPlease don't cut on 'Raita', let you customers have as much raita as they want. Personally I want some sauce for BBQ and raita does it for us. But we had to ask a few times.\n\nPlease invest at the interior and washroom area.\n\nAll the best.
976	1	d	Listen, Linus Inc. is super cool. Robin did my hair and the chatty valley girl in me died and went to heaven because Robin is beyond cool and we spoke in the same language (accent). Linus also has AMAZING MUSIC. It's at the perfect volume, its eclectic, and you wont hear shit like super OOOONTZ OOONTTZZ tunes. I heard the likes of Radiohead, & Bjork, and I was like, yus, this place is the shiznit. \n\nShe asked me a lot about my hair and kinda compiled a hair history for me, which I really appreciated because she obviously cares about what she does and her clients. Despite coming in for in for a quick look change (Bettie Page bangs and a light trim), Robin communicated with me tons. I also got a wash and blow dry. I really love my bangs and she cut them exactly how I asked her to and I have been receiving so many compliments on me new look.\n\nHowever, man oh man, I was a little bummed when she rang me up for $62. She did an amazing job though! And I told myself \"ANNA, YOU ARE A GROWN WOMAN, GONE ARE THE DAYS OF PAYING 20 BUCKS FOR A BASEMENT BARGAIN SALON HAIRCUT. FORK OVER THE DOUGH AND SHUT UP WIT YO STINGEY ASS.\" But still, it hurt to pay 60 bucks for bangs, a trim and a blow out. Ah well.\n\nBut serious, they know their shit here. They don't play around.
977	1	d	I am the reigning Duke here so clearly I love Green. However, I'm writing an updated review because Green has changed. They still get 5 stars for being all vegan, having convenient locations, green practices, friendly staff, and a mostly good menu. \n\nThey recently changed their menu and removed the noodles, fettuccine Alfredo and pesto sauces and consolidated their salad, rice bowl, and sandwich options, and made a few other changes. They no longer have a small salad, just large for about $10, but what if you just want a side salad? Not an option. Sides like coleslaw are now only al la carte instead of automatically coming with the sandwiches - not a big deal, but if you're a hungry guy you'll need more food than just a sandwich. Other than the Karma Curry, their rice bowls (Thai Peanut, Singapore Orange, and Sesame Dragon) all kind of taste the same now - like a mixture of soy sauce and sriracha and the sauce is heavy. Overall there's fewer options and we miss some of our old favs. \n\nPlus, on and off for about a year (not related to menu changes) their tofu has had a funny taste. I mentioned it to them and they said they were experimenting. It hasn't gotten better. And it's not consistently bad so it makes me wonder if it's sometimes spoiled or they are miss-handling it. It tastes and smells like mothballs. I only get fresh\/steamed tofu so maybe the fried tofu loses the mothball flavor. If you get the fresh and it happens to be one of these off batches I speak of, you will know. It's so bad I spit it out and then pick out the rest and swear I'm done with these tofu defilers. But then I order it again and hope someone else has complained and they've fixed it. \n\nOur favs now are the Ranchero salad with wing sauce instead of BBQ sauce, Wendy's Pickle, Tahini Coleslaw, Dagobah Jungle (as a wrap versus salad), Chili, Thee Fighting Artichoke salad, and of course their Nami treats like Tsoynamis (dairy free blizzards), cookies, and cupcakes. The salads are fresh and the sandwiches are consistently good.\n\nLike I said in the last review, the staff seem to like their jobs and they get our take-out orders right almost EVERY time, which is amazing, and there's never any accidental cheese or meat in our food. But with fewer menu options to mix things up we definitely don't eat here as often and I expect to lose my crown.
978	0	d	This is a very long overdue review, but I wanted to share the experience I had with them. This place preys on desperate people with bad credit who wouldn't typically get approved from a traditional dealership. They will approve ANYONE in my opinion. They have very limited car options. I'm talking like 4-5 actual cars for sale. The cars are insanely overpriced and they mention how the cars are 4 times the Kelly Blue Book value, due to them selling you credit improvement services, vs just selling you a car. They film you when you sign the 2 hour long contract. They forced me into automatic payments from my checking account. I paid $1k down, plus $250 every 2 weeks for a 7 year old  vehicle that had a kbb value of $4K, but I was going to pay $24k after 4 years of payments and OUTRAGEOUS interest rates. The car broke down within the first 2 weeks of owning it, and when I went to make an appointment with the service department to get it fixed, they told me they were really busy and it would take 2-3 weeks to start working on my car. I had my boyfriend's Dad fix it for me instead. Another month later and the car broke down again. They masked the odor when it was on their lot. Once you started the ac, the car would overwhelm with the smell of urine. It was very embarrassing and impossible to remove. There is no grace period for late payments. I ended up removing the tracking device and enjoying the car for another 2 months before the piece of shit broke down again, and then I parked it out front of my house, and it was gone within an hour. I was parking it elsewhere before that. They would have fake detectives call me and my references, telling them I could get charged with grand theft auto for tampering with the gps device when I signed a contract saying not to. They never reported anything to the credit bureaus for me. Not at all for the 6 months of positive payments that I did make on the car, nor did they report negatively to the credit bureaus when they repossessed the vehicle. So, no repo on my credit. It was an interesting experience. I personally think this company is a scam. Go to Aloha Used Cars, I highly recommend them. They have nice cars there with low mileage and quick payment plans, plus cheap service fees.

We got there right as breakfast was ending so we ate breakfast and at 11am the lunch food was served so we ate most of that.  Drinks such as wine and beer were included and it was great.  This place is a must and anyone in the area looking for a buffet needs to go.
980	1	d	Popeye is taking a beating. It's not from Bluto or the Sea Hag. It is from Yelpers. Out of 53 Yelp reviews, this Popeye has a 1.5 star rating average. In the World of Yelp, stars instead of spinach will give Popeye strength. I am giving Popeye 3 stars which ought to boost up the rock bottom rating average. I am going to share the reason why I gave Popeye 3 stars. \n\n   This past Sunday evening on July 10 I had just returned from hiking up and down Cathedral Rock. Just like the Yelp ratings did to this Popeyes, the 1,000 plus elevation change gave my stamina a beating. By the time I returned to Las Vegas and exited off US 95 onto Durango Drive, my hunger had kicked in. In this hungry state I pulled into the Popeyes parking lot. \n\n  When I walked inside Popeye's,  there were only a couple of customers. I don't know if it is the bad Yelp ratings or just a slow Sunday evening that caused the lobby to be nearly empty. All I know was that I decided on the two piece chicken meal with a side, biscuit, and medium Coke beverage. The woman who took my order was pleasant. She was pleasant to the point that when the other customer decided she did not want the green beans, she exchanged it without a problem. However if the woman that took my order was rude or extraordinary nice, I was cognizant of the Popeyes signs and table brochures inviting me to take a brief survey by calling 1-800-682-0219 or visiting www.tellpopeyes.com. Likewise when I walked into the restaurant my first impression was Popeye's gives the perception of taking customer service seriously by posting a sign on the door with the store manager's name and a phone number. \n\n  Right off the bat (or in this case you could say right off the bone), I noticed that Popeye's does something different that quite a few chicken restaurants don't. This difference is that their customer can choose any two kinds of chicken from the wing, thigh, or leg. I chose the thigh and leg spicy crispy with Cajun rice. I realized that ordering the thigh was a mistake because the wing was far superior. The wing was a large size portion of white delectable chicken meat. After this mistake, I will order two chicken wings the next time I return to Popeye's. As far as the Cajun rice, I have been a fan of it going back as the 1980s when Popeye the Sailor Man was the official mascot of Popeye's Chicken. Complimenting the chicken and Cajun rice was my favorite all-time drink Fanta Strawberry soda. This post-hiking supper came out to less than $8.\n\n  Now in my car and headed toward Durango Drive, I observed that the drive-thru business was busy. Whether or not my three stars will rejuvenate Popeye, I don't know. What I do know is that eating in this Popeye's rejuvenated Me after hiking up and down Cathedral Rock.
981	0	d	I'm not sure where to start. I am new to Nevada and wanted really good Mexican food which I have yet to find. I took to Yelp and found this heaven! The first table we got we weren't too satisfied and though we aren't picky I asked if we could possibly get a booth instead of a table and boy am I glad that I asked. We were seated in Amanda's section and she was just a blast in a glass! The food was great and the service was AMAZING!  We will definitely be back and will ALWAYS request to sit in Amanda's section! 5 stars, 2 thumbs up and a thank you very much.  Oh and we stopped by the bar while we waited to be seated and the bar tenders were great. I will recommend this restaurant and bring my friends and family who visit! Oh and the fried ice cream.... Omg and I don't even like sweets. Great great GREAT!
982	1	d	I was ravenous for a juicy burger. The burger was pink and juicy with delicious mushrooms, The french fries were less awesome, but I am not much of a fry girl. Tho, now I want to be one, cause it just sounds cool - \"fry girl\".\nSomeone else described it as having the \"old Vegas\" feel. She's right. I've been here since '88 and I'm about to be 50, so I too appreciate \"old Vegas\" or was that being old in Vegas. They even have a salad bar that you can add onto your meal. There were many specials and a really nice menu.\nI appreciated that we were not rushed out as our party needed time to talk. I noticed other parties lingering at their tables as well.\nI forget about Ichabod's until someone suggests it. I will try to remember it more often.
983	0	d	Let Bruce take ya for a ride... \nIve had mixed results with these guys... 2 years ago they seemed to be on top of things (getting the work done right and in a timely manner) but this time around they were slow as %^@*! Told me it took 3 weeks to get a part shipped from CA for a late model bike. Took another 2 weeks to get the work done. When I finally got the bike back, it wasn't right. Speedo not working properly (worked when I brought in...) Kreem coat in tank was scratched?! Vent hose still pissing gas onto hot engine block while idling in bumper to bumper traffic! Took another 1.5 weeks to get these things addressed and then he charged me for 2 more hours of labor to fix his mistakes! Told me I had two options: \"Pay him for 2 more hours of labor or never come back.\" I paid him his money begrudingly...but I wont be back. (Fool me once, Bruce, shame on you. You wont get the chance to fool me twice!)
984	0	d	Excellent place!  Great craft beers on tap that Lee's and Total can't get their hands on.  Great customer service at a place that feels like home.
985	0	d	I wanted to get my nails done here but when I entered I did not feel welcome there was only one customer and there were two technicians just sitting  there and \nThey just looked at me and one of them barely said hi. They were not friendly at all they told my to pick a nail polish but I felt very  uncomfortable and just left. A business is not great if their customer service is awful. I will not be going back and I do not recommend this place to any one.
986	1	d	A few years ago I would have proudly given 'Sprouts' 5 star. I loved them. That's when they were Sunflower. Now, not so much. I love that they have Boars Head deli products, bulk bins and the selection of healthy body care (soaps, lotions, deodorants, etc).\nWhat I dont love is most of the people who slice your food in the deli are useless.I like my meat cut a certain way. I will wait for it to be sliced. I want to make sure before you slice a pound, that it's to my liking (weird since I'm paying for it). They frustrated me every time, so now I go to Smiths for that.\nMost of the cashiers tend to throw your food when they scan it and it's a HUGE pet peeve of mine. Also, I found Sunflower to be drastically cheaper. When they first made the change over to Sprouts, they said pricing would stay the same. I shopped there 3 times a week for 2 years, I KNOW the prices. They raised them quite a bit and continue to do so. \nSo, I know they sound like stupid reasons, but to me they aren't. I simply dont go here nearly as often as I used to.
987	0	d	Loved this place! The food was delicious (got the fish, beef and pork tacos) and the owner\/manager was so friendly and upbeat will definitely come back!
988	0	d	I had the Napoleon crepe...I can totally say that I love the berries and the sweetness was just right.
989	0	d	Let me start off by saying that this place is EXPENSIVE! It makes Starbucks look cheap compared to their prices. I got a SMALL iced coffee for almost $5. Even Starbucks is cheaper! The coffee was just an average ice coffee flavor like the one you can get at McDonalds for $1.49 (medium size) but they are a rip off! Plus they have horrible customer service. When I was in line there was one person in front of me and it was not busy at all, but they took forever taking his order and there was two people helping him and they weren't even helping him they kept on laughing and talking about random stuff, as if they were friends, which I truly don't care but it was an inconvenience because I had to wait 5-10 minutes for just 1 person in front of me. They didn't even greet me say \"hello, good morning, we will be with you in a minute\" NOTHING! They both saw me and I had my wallet in my hand and staring at both of the workers who were just chatting with the person in front of me who was most likely a friend. (I could tell by there conversation.) to indicate that I am ready to order, but nope I waited 5-10 minutes just for them both to acknowledge me and say \"what can I get for you?\" Not even a \"sorry for the wait\". Also it was my first time going in so I asked what she recommends and she said \"everything's good\" ok... Um thanks for your recommendation.. NOT. I then asked her what kind of iced coffee they have and she answered with a rude\/ angry \"all that you can think of\" Just no help at all. There menu is not even readable and it's just crazy that they even have semi-decent reviews on Yelp because they do NOT deserve it. Plus the tables were dirty and they had no clients! I was NOT impressed at all. Save your money!! & Pass this place it really is nothing special. I will NEVER return and will make sure my friends and family don't ever stop at this place.
990	0	d	Because of the great Customer Service and Teamwork that's provided by all staff here...this Cox Store Rocks!  As soon as you enter the doors you're welcomed by friendly associates with a great system in place to move the line along quickly and efficiently.  Came in this morning to get 2 mini boxes and left with my goods in hand and huge smile!  Thanks Everyone:)
991	0	d	This taxi service is my favourite. I have always had great drivers who are polite and sincere. They arrive fast. I'm a happy customer :)
992	0	d	Here's my order on Feb 25 2017.\nSmoked meat plate, cheeseburger,2 steamies.\nThere has been some comments regarding owner\/employee ethnicities...WHO CARES?\nThese guys just don't know what they're doing.\nFirst thing they did was put my fries and hotdogs on my tray, then put the patty on the grill for the cheeseburger. WRONG! By the time the burger and smoked meat were done, everything else was cold!\nStart the burger FIRST, then start on the sandwich, then the dogs.\nFries are the LAST to go on the tray.\nThis advice comes from a Greek who used to work in the business.\nBTW, smoked meat rubbery, rye bread stale,meat to bun ratio for cheeseburger WAY off, either more meat or less bun, figure it out, fries were dry, hot dogs...meh.\nNever going back, place is a dump.
993	0	d	This place was really good to take kids. Food is reasonably priced and tasty. Our waitress was delightful and very attentive. We are outdoors on their cute little patio area. Sauce was really good on the fried mozzarella as well as the Chicken Florentine. Garlic bread that is complimentary is awesome. Go here for comfort food. I left stuffed and with leftovers. The prices didn't break the bank either. A nice addition to Cedar Lee which can be hit or miss.
994	0	d	I always pass by here and wonder about this restaurant. Finally, one spontaneous evening I decided to drop by. To my surprise, it's a win for me!\n\nWe ordered one of the boats with sushi rolls, sashimi and tempura. The boat is beautifully laid out and plenty for two. Sashimi tasted fresh, the rolls as well. \n\n\nIt's a small place with couple of tables right when you walk in and also couple of booths with curtains for a bit more privacy. One thing is that, you'd have to make an effort to really get their attention - perhaps, it was only that day I dropped by and there was a lack of staff? \n\nNonetheless, good price point and parking outside; a good place for sushi in the neighbourhood!
995	1	d	Awesome Mac & Cheese!\n\nSITREP\n\nI have to give mad props to both my Vegas Yelp-buds Anthony and Jade since they turned me onto the GREAT CHEEESY establishment BFG Chicken Strips while I was hangin with them in Vegas for the Yelp Convention back in May 2012.\n\nTHE MAC MENU\n\nMac N' Cheese here is TRULY an ultimate \"Classic American Eats\", as a SIDE dish OR get a BUNCH like I did at just under $2 a pop, and why not? - I took them back to my hotel room at the Stratosphere one late night and make it a MAIN dish.  Mmmm, delish!\n\nSPECIAL PREPARATION!\n\nBFG Chicken Strips meets a cheesaholic's strict-standards of \"cheesification\".  They make incredible BAKED Mac N' Cheese in individual containers with a Mozzarella Crust!  (HOLY HELL.  I feel my arteries hardening with joy just thinking about this festive cheesapalooza!)\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nIf you are looking for a Mac n' Cheese fix, look no further.
996	0	d	Server was slow but you're at the airport food was decent ! But something happened after wth the server that was not very pleasant ...soooooo they only get 3 stars lol
997	1	d	LISTEN UP YOU PRIMITIVE SCREWHEADS!\n\nTHIS SHOW IS FOR HARD-CORE FANS ONLY! IF YOU DON'T WORSHIP THE GROUND SAM RAIMI AND BRUCE CAMPBELL WALK ON STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!\n\nWe went to the Dec 15, 2012 11:30 pm show. It took a while to get seated so the show really started around midnight. The foul-mouthed MC who introduced the show really set the tone well for the night. This is for ADULTS only, do not bring kids.\n\nThe theater was only about 1\/5 full, with the front row \"splatter zone\" packed with the die hard fans. They got SOAKED many times during the performance, when they walked out their hair and clothes were drenched with the fake blood (the whole theater smelled of it in the end). We were 2 rows back behind the splatter zone and emerged dry.\n\nOther reviewers have mentioned that the only way to experience this is to sit in the splatter zone and they may be right. I think being high on something may also have helped but we all entered sober.\n\nI really like the Evil Dead franchise but this show just wasn't my cup of tea; it was bearable though only because I like the movies so much. \n\nThe production simply retells Evil Dead 1\/2 with a few lines from Army of Darkness thrown in. Some of the musical numbers were entertaining but overall it wasn't a good use of 2 hours.\n\nThe four friends who came with me all fell asleep at various times. They did not enjoy themselves as none of them are fans of the franchise. This is also partly our fault; we had a long day and were feeling pretty tired going in. We should have gone to an earlier show!\n\nThis show is to musicals as Evil Dead 1 is to the \"Godfather.\" It's cheesy and low budget. If you like really campy, silly shows you'll be in heaven. It tries to be clever at times but usually fails. The actors did put in a lot of effort into their performances, though. They were not \"phoning it in.\"\n\nOther reviewers here have complained about the audio. I could understand most of it, but during musical numbers when the background music was loud and all the singers were singing it became inaudible, but that's not unique to Evil Dead 4D. Many productions crank the volume level so high it becomes deafening; I often can only hear it clearly with earplugs in.
998	0	d	You get what you get at this place. It is old school and clearly hasn't been changed in years and years. That being said it is a good place to put in a few quick bets and grab a cocktail. The woman at the bar in the mornings is a gem! I can't remember her name to save my life  don't take this place to seriously and just roll with it and you will be happy
999	0	d	She's amazing , I love to go there because feel comfortable with great service .\nAlways clean and quiet and they are super friendly and nice .
1000	0	d	I prefer this location over the location on King st.  \n\nThis is a brand new Bar Hop at Queen and Peter and has 3 floors, top floor being a nice patio. I came here thurs after work for a few drinks and they have an assortment of craft beers, specialty beers, and other alcoholic beverages.  They also have a nice menu of unique foods at very reasonable prices.  I tried the bone marrow poutine ($12), lettuce wrap with poached tuna (not canned) ($13) and pepperettes, ($9).  It was pretty busy for a thurs night, but they were able to accommodate as, as we moved between the 2nd floor and the patio.  Great place, I'd definitely come back again!
