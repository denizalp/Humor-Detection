1	Neat stop while walking down the Vegas strip. I met some very cool people from around the world while waiting for the show to start.
2	Been here before with the family. I don't know how I found it again...luck I suppose. I typed in oxtail soup and scrolled through and saw this. Good food! Oxtail soup was the bomb!!
3	Definitely agree with the horrible customer service comment.  Especially when it comes to the mortgage department.  If u were thinking about using this bank...keep searching.\n\nI should also add I have been doing normal banking with this bank for years; I would gladly leave but I guess I am just that lazy.  The only time I have a problem is when I have to actually go into a branch money orders, deposits, withdrawals, it doesn't matter....I always leave thinking the same thing 'Why do i bank here?'
4	Cool spot for kids. An indoor playground\/bounce house\/foam pit\/obstacle course\/soft air ball gun shooting seriously so much to do there. You will definitely see some adults running around too! \n\nWe went to a birthday party. If you opt for a table that's not in a private to you can stay at the table as long as you want. Private rooms are limited to 2 hours. So clearly you don't go to a place like this for the Food but the food here was really not good. The ranch dressing for the salad tasted spoiled and the pizza was a bit tough. I'm sure the kids didn't mind at all, however. \n\nWhile we were there we did experience 2 different vomit sessions by different kids. Honestly, it is very big so it did make me wonder how clean and sanitary is this place? Just a thought.\n\nOverall if you are looking for a fun spot for the kids, especially during the summer you should check out this spot
5	Going to this hospital had to be the worst experience I have ever had.  I brought my 10 year old Golden retriever in because I thought her stomach was turning but it turned out that her liver enzymes were high.  The Vet recommended a 3 day stay to monitor her and printed the estimate. It was $5000.  I gasped and she (Dr Nikki) tried to get us to do this saying we may not have to hospitalize her for that long.  Anyway she made us feel that we either hospitalize her or she will have to put her down.  My son and I were in tears.  We ended up getting the outpatient, which was never offered to us, we requested it.  This included giving her antibiotics.  I asked for fluids and they said they could not send us home with Fluids.  After I left there I went to Brush Run Vet (Very good) and they examined her.  They told us it was one of two things (which we never got from the hospital and we paid $1200 for as little as we got) and they sent us home with Fluids and we only paid $131.  My pet is doing fantastic.  The Brush Run vet, Dr Foil, is very caring, straightforward.  Brush Run really cares about your Pet.  The Vet Hospital is just trying to get your money!!
6	Every time I come to Las Vegas. I always stop here. Food is always excellent. My favorite Steakhouse.
7	I have been going to Del Pueblo Tire Shop for a few years now, my last car Buttercup (May she rest in peace) had her tires all from Del Pueblo, and never had an issue.   Well Francois (new car's name) needed a tire replaced, I couldn't believe it! \nThe steel was showing, so I had my son slap on the spare and off I went to Del Pueblo.  \n\nI bet you are asking why did I go to Guadalupe to Del Pueblo????,   EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! There it is folks!   I have always been quoted a great price, never over charged for any tires. Also they do have new & used tires for sale, its fast service; I am in and out in no time.\n\nI will be back to get another tire replaced soon!  Give them a try!
8	This store of Indian groceries is newly set and they have wide range of Indian brands filled in their racks for now.We have been going to Lotus from past 2 years and now I feel , this store is better organised and also a better version .
9	Walked in and out. I sent them an email explaining a very especific  hair style I wanted. I had the appointment at 10 am with Leo. I waited until 10:40 for him to finished a previous client. Once he started to interview me for the hair transformation he told me I can't. He explains he couldn't bleach my hair which in first moment I found very professional from him. Then I asked him for solutions.  I was extremely open to do ANYTHING but having a drastic al change in my hair which is medium long and brown and I was expecting something in the bĺack supper short range. He proposed red. I told him one more time I wanted a drastic change Brown to red isn't and on top he was offering something completely traditional when I was looking for a funky twist. He alegated is damash. If it is damaged for blue or black is damaged for red too.\n\nI got pissed at his attitude that althiugh at the beginning sounded professional he started to use the dry at the extreme of my hair for his lack ok creativity. That's it.  \n\nI tried to speak with the receptionist Sylvia trying yo find if someone else could attention me and then finally she told me that the can't attend my case.. Give me a break... all I wanted was a well done haircut. \n\nIf you have $500 or more for expending in your hair DONT go there. You deserve the good treatment for the money you'll spend
10	Very good tacos. Highly recommended. The place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's very authentic
11	Always friendly, fast service when I come to QC Nails & Spa. They do a great job with nails and waxing. I wish they'd quit telling me I need to wax my mustache though. I've kinda grown attached to it. ;)
12	I walked in and ordered a mango bowl. Take it home and there's no mango or pineapple. Bring it back and the guy says we don't have mangos. Well then why did u let me order 1? Make me something you do have. Half a*sed makes it and sends me on my way.
13	This is the first time I got to stay till the end of a Yelpoween party! Yes it was a smaller venue and it was on a Wednesday but I had lots of fun. The food was great, the music was good, the bartenders and servers were nice, and I got to see lots of Yelp Friends! It was my funnest Yelpoween party to date!\n\nShoutout to that one bartender who always knew exactly when I needed water. Each time I got close to the bar, he was ready with a glass. The best service I've ever had in my whole life.\n\nPS: Special thank you to the caterers of the evening: Burger Bar Crescent, Redpath, La Belle Tonkinoise, Hillary Salads, Kemestre, and C'Chocolat!! Thank you to Riverside for hosting!! Thanks to Norine for helping me with my makeup!!!\nand a HUGE thanks to Mariko for organizing the whole thing!!!
14	Sadly, my review of Eggstacy is not a good one. I was hoping this would be a new spot to go to since it is so close to my house and I loved the outdoor patio but I will not be returning. My son and I had breakfast here and being a server myself I'm very understanding of how a restaurant works and reasons why not everything could run smoothly, but at the same time I know bad service when I receive it. First off our server never came back to check on us, after 2 bites nor 2 minutes, yet the place was not overly busy. I ordered eggs Benedict, both my eggs were cooked completely through and I had to track a hostess down asking for a poached egg so I could eat my meal. Still, after finding her and bringing the new egg no sign of our server. As we were waiting my son is cutting his pancakes and finds a short black hair. He showed me and I said, bud you can't eat those, he was so hungry, he said no mom please it's okay I just want to eat. When I finally saw our waiter and informed him of the hair and incorrect eggs, he took my son's Mickey Mouse pancake but came back with a normal 2 stack, with whipped cream which I had told him please not to have on the first plate because my child hates, the waiter in turn blamed it on kitchen having him run out those. By this time I had picked at my meal but never ate, there was no apology, no manager precense or any partial refund or discount taken. All in all I would not come back nor would I suggest this as a place to eat in the area. Just very disappointing and as much as a love a patio US Egg is right across the street and never had I had such issues.
15	I love me some poki.. discovered this little gem in my new neighborhood, next door to the frys marketplace on Rural & Ray.. great find!\n\nThey offer the bowl & sushrittos (sushi burritos).. I always stick with the bowl.. \n\nOn today's visit I had the bowl, with spring greens & brown rice, doubled up on the tuna .. opting for the cubed tuna & spicy tuna.. seaweed salad, pineapple, cucumber, avocado, lots of jalapeño .. ginger miso sauce.. fresh and delicious..\n\nClean, cute and very friendly service! I will definitely be back
16	Sounds like I came in just after the previous reviewer. I also tried to take advantage of the TeamBuy promotion and booked an online session for my dad and myself. I never received any confirmation email so I ended up calling in and the guy who answered seemed confused and didn't know what I was talking about so I ended up having to book manually over the phone.\n\nI came in and when I told the girl I was there for the TeamBuy swing analysis package she seemed a bit nervous and said \"The owner said we're not allowed to sell that anymore.\" I said \"Excuse me?\" and she said \"Yeah, he said that people were trying to rip him off by coming in and just doing the swing analysis and not playing any golf.\" I told her that it didn't say anywhere on the TeamBuy page that I had to play golf at the regular price She looked embarrassed and said \"Yeah I know but he's getting upset that people are coming in just for that so he said we're not to sell that package to anyone anymore.\" I told her that we had driven in from Thornhill and that I couldn't believe that they weren't going to honour the advertisement that they posted. She just talked around it but said \"The owner said we're not allowed to sell that anymore. The simulators cost $50 an hour to run so he can't make money off of people spending $5\". I told her that really wasn't my problem but she resfused to budge and said the \"owner was out of town.\"\n\nMy dad and I left pretty disappointed but at least we learned never to return to Inner Golf. It's too bad the owner decided that people responding to an advertising campaign that he ran are \"trying to rip him off\" by following the guidelines of the ad.
17	I've had some pretty unfun occurences here (having a poo--a real, swear-to-god human terd, touch my leg--crashing hardcore a few years back and losing my husband for 10 minutes cause he got marooned on some island and couldnt find us, and getting sunburns so bad that i can feel it in my bones--reapply that spf 50 as often as you can) but i swear none of it takes away from the awesomeness of it all. If you can believe it...\n\nWent for the 3rd time this past weekend (did a day trip from redlands-wow loooong day!) and it was seriously hotter than hell, about 117. It was halloween on the river day, so crazy betty the busdriver was all dressed up (2nd year in a row we had her, she totally enjoys her job!) and the az republic took our pictures for the newspaper. it was so hot, that we couldnt even touch the tubes to put them in the bus, we put as many as we could on an oar because they were really burning our hands big time. so yea, there is no way you dont need a sheet for the tubes out there in that kinda heat. \"splashing\" water on the tubes will last about 2 minutes, and when you forget and you burn the living hell out of your appendages repeatedly cause you forget how hot that rubber gets, you'll wish you brought a sheet. i know from experience.\n\noars really help. you need one, and if youre paying attention to where you're going, you can get out of almost any bad situation enough in advance to avoid getting hurt. that being said, you can get away with tying your tubes together, provided you dont have a humongous group. just not too tight though, lots of people pop their tubes doing this. \n\nand another thing, you dont really know how wasted you are til you go to stand up to get your stuff out of the water, so pace yourself a bit with water--and stick to light beer. the first year i went i made a huuuge tupperware bottle full of what i like to call \"focktail\"--yeah it will get you effed up pretty fast. I could hardly walk out of the water, and my husbands friend drank so much of my focktail that he pissed himself in the parking lot. twice. \n\nyes, theres stupidity, drunken teenagers acting a fool---but ya know, i didnt really expect a MENSA meeting so i wasnt too surprised by anything.
18	If they ever called me back Id know the level of quality work they do. Unfortunately after 3 voice mails over 2 weeks to both guys I haven't been called back. Ill remove this review after I get a call back, until then, 1 star.
19	Decent food but on the pricier side of kbbq. Their side dish of mashed potatoes was really good though!
20	We just had a good happy hour experience.  We dined here just after opening and were not impressed. Years later we decided to return. It was a good thing. Since it was happy hour, my wife and I took advantage of the $5 menu. The flatbread was not very good but the lettuce wraps, calimari and potstickers definitely we're worth the order. Unfortunately, we ordered too much. These are generous portions.  I took the easy route and had wine.  My wife had water.  This is a good deal. I think we need to come back for the regular menu: prices seem reasonable and there are several interesting choices.
21	I've been coming here for about five years and today was my last day. I sat down and pulled out my e-cigarette as I have been doing for the past three years. I ordered a beer and a menu. I decided on my usual and placed my order. When the server came back, she said I was not allowed to use my e-cigarette in there. As per the owner, \"E-cigarettes are no longer allowed but cigarettes and cigars are.\" \n\nWhen I first started coming here, I was a smoker! The food is great and they have a nice draught selection. I have nothing against smoke or smokers, obviously because this place has tons of smokers who are usuals. I really liked the place too! The low ceilings combined with the chain smokers makes for a vintage Vegas experience that you really can't find much these days.\n\nDon't try to apply logic here. It really makes no sense. I honestly think someone could get away with smoking a joint in here because there is that much smoke. Make sure you don't bring your electronic cigarette though, you could fill those with cannabis! The ironic part is that there's a sign out front that says 'smoker friendly.'\n\nIf the owner banned cigarettes AND e-cigarettes, that would somewhat make sense, but I STILL wouldn't go back. At least he was being consistent.\n\nDo not go here to watch Buckeyes games either, they will yell at you for being loud when you are just cheering. I can't speak for Browns games on Sunday though. The local Buckeye bar is now Sporting Life on 7770 S Jones Blvd anyway and has been for several years now.\n\nPros: \nVery smokey, like Jazz pool-hall it has that smokey-blue tinge in the right light.\nThe usuals are all great!\nThe pizza is fantastic!\n\nCons:\nNo electronic cigarettes.
22	I'll admit, the cupcakes are excellent--we went the day before \"the incident.\" \n\nUnfortunately we arrived slightly before closing and the cupcakes they had available were quickly snagged from right under our noses.  The woman in front of us saw us (two out-of-towners) turned her nose and requested the remaining six! cupcakes.  One woman, six cupcakes!  We just wanted one for ourselves before we had to go to the airport.\n\nI wouldn't have been so upset had I been told those were the last cupcakes, and the cupcakes in the case were being \"held,\" but they waited until after the woman paid for her six! to tell us we were out-of-luck.\n\nBoo to that Cupcakery, boo times three.
23	We were looking for a restaurant for a quick bite before the airport and dude remembered a Japanese restaurant in this strip mall; however, now it is a Chinese restaurant.  So looking at the menu, we thought we'd give it a try, plus we were hungry!  Lunch specials were pretty reasonable but dude likes to share so we started off with chicken lettuce wraps and then had the combination stir-fried noodles.  Service was friendly and food was good.
24	We are staying at the Rio for the first time ever and this restaurant was at the top of our list to eat at. SURPRISE!! They are closed for the \"season\" or something like that. Even though yelp posted it was open from 5:00pm to 10:00pm. AND we were offered coupons while checking in and everything. So travellers BEWARE!! this place might not be open.
25	She's great!  The cocoa body scrub wrap is amazing and she worked on my injured shoulder too!
26	this is probably one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas...consistently good.  it has a very nice bistro atmosphere and reasonably priced.
27	When I first moved in here two years ago when P.B. Bell managed, the office staff was super friendly and I felt it was worth the price. Now that Escape is under new management, I can't say the same. The grounds used to be clean and office staff was friendly. I transferred from a one bedroom apartment to a two bedroom within the community a year ago. Upon inspection, the maintenance crew told me I would not be charged. The carpet was pulled up and frayed near a bedroom door and one wall had two large holes from a TV wall mount. Even still, I was told it was fine and that the carpet would have to be replaced anyway and touch ups are done before new residents move in. In the present, my lease just ended and an inspection had to be done by the new management crew. First off, Brenden was extremely rude to me while doing the inspection. He told me it was not normal wear and tear and would be at least 200 dollars to patch up the carpet. The \"damages\" in the second apartment are not as bad as the first. The only reason I did not fix the TV holes on wall and rug, is because I was not charged last time. Every time I tried to reason with Brandon he raised his voice at me and said there is no use talking to me I don't get it. I recently spoke to the manager Chris Carrol and it was as if I was speaking to Brendens twin. He even tried to charge me 55 for the touch up paint for the two holes on wall when Brenden said it would only be 20. He also stated that they are good friends outside of work and said that I shouldn't have made smart alec comments to Brenden. Overall, this has been a nightmare. I would not recommend these apartments to anyone and it is not worth the price. Not by a long shot. Beware the greedy management crew!!! They want to steal from residents now that everyone is moving out and no longer care to live there.
28	Frankie rocks my hair world!\n\nI travel all the way from salon-infested LA to get my hair did by this funky little fella about once every couple of months (ok, well I have friends in Chandler too, but I prob wouldn't go out there as often if there wasn't an opportunity to get hooked up with some serious color).  I don't know that I would let anyone else touch my locks, because Frankie really has treated them like his high school sweetheart and that bond is hard to break!  Every time he redoes my roots, I get a ridiculous amount of compliments on my color because people can't tell if it is real (that's an indicator of how good he is) or if I just stepped out of a salon.\n\nThere are no hot messes walking around on his watch!
29	My wife and her friend got some coupons from a stylist at an event on March 28th and they expired on May 1st. So today they called to see if they could still use them and the receptionist handed the phone to the manager. The manager instantly began to ask tons of questions like who gave them the coupons, where did they get them, why they had not used the coupons, how long there hair is and if they wanted to use them they have to schedule today.  These are ok questions to ask, but not in such a rude manner. \n\nThe manager was so rude that my wife and her friend will never use that company, EVER. It's sad when a company has a manager that treats potential clients this way.
30	hmm... it's not the best poke bowl I had in Toronto\nWe ordered the Regular size ninja. \nAlthough the fish was fresh, the overcooked rice ruined everything for me. However the spicy mayo salvaged the whole bowl lol \n\nIt's on the more pricier side comparing the portion served (kind of small even for a regular) and to other poke places I've been to. Probably best to go to other poke places for the experience.
31	This review is pretty much solely based on the karaoke experience. SO. MUCH. FUN. This is pretty much what I would imagine a night of karaoke in a senior citizen center to be like. Lots of much older folks getting down on the dance floor and singing their favorite grooves. Hilarious and awesome!\n\nThe space itself (for the karaoke) is old and right on the casino floor. Frankly, there is nothing even slightly nice about it. But that just adds to the overall awesomeness and experience. (Overall, when you walk into this property, the lobby area isn't so bad. In fact, I kinda like it.)\n\nThe best part was convincing my date to get up and sing \"Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)\". Despite assuming that the crowd would not be into it, and being prepared for the karaoke hosts to forbid it, everyone loved it. LOVED. IT. The one old-timer, cowboy host even commented about how much he loved the song. So funny and so much fun!\n\nThis is definitely, officially my fav karaoke spot in all of Vegas. You've got to come see this for yourself!
32	Everything is not as it seems in here!!\n\nI just spent almost an hour here looking at stuff. Lots and lots of stuff. \nYou walk in and i slowly made my way around the store, looking from floor to ceiling with shelves upon shelves of mostly useful but quirky things. \n\nIt's the best place to find a gift for anyone of any age.  The owner is super friendly and will always bring out his latest stash of toys.  Today it was this silicone iPhone speaker system amplifier for $15. And it actually works. \n\nProducts here include Fred, Alessi, Lug. There's a bookshelf at the back with tons of reading on both useless and relevant information. Sarcastic and hilarious cards are also found back there. In the glass cases are silver trinkets and fancy menorahs. \n\nI came in here looking for gifts for one person, but ended up finding gifts for myself and 3 other people. What I like best is that the stuff is useful - like a bottle top camera stand, or a kitty ring holder, or a mug but has a shark at the bottom. And decently priced too. I also saw something like a earbud cord wrapper, I thought was redundant, and now in everyday life finding myself needing it. Needless to say, I will be back. \n\nCheck out their updated website with online ordering. Browse through this well catelogued site without getting overwhelmed at the actual store, but the place is an experience on its own.
33	ordered a swimming top online on Dec 26 2017....but was unhappy to see that they had the same exact item listed twice, same color, everything..for  $13 cheaper...I called customer service for a $13 refund.....was told no...because the item TECHNICALLY had a different item number..even though it was the identical product...so it was a different shipment from the company I was told...the manager offered me 15% discount on another item online, but I said no thank you, why would I bother when you get 10% off your first purchase anyway, and I hadn't yet signed up for the mailing list. Moral of story.....be very careful when shopping on there website...there is no way this sort of thing would fly in a retail store.
34	I've stayed at The Rio on two Vegas trips, one time back in 2005 and on my most recent trip a few months ago.  \n\nThe first time we got to stay at a Masquerade Suite.  The suite was very roomy and had floor to ceiling windows with a wonderful view of the Strip.  Access to the Strip was pretty easy since it had a shuttle that took you to Harrah's and back.  And food-wise, both the Carnival World Buffet and Village Seafood Buffet were good enough to satisfy our hungry stomachs.  I also enjoyed the festive atmosphere in the Masquerade casino area.  It was a great experience.\n\nFast forward to 2017 the experience was just slightly underwhelming, but still okay for the most part.  This time we stayed in a Classic Suite so the room was much smaller.  Didn't matter too much to me though since I pretty much was only there to rest and sleep.  Amazingly, parking is still free in their self-parking garage.  Since I had a rental car, that was a huuuuuge convenience for me.  The Village Seafood Buffet was no longer a separate buffet and had been absorbed into the Carnival World Buffet.  The downside was that it was only open for dinner only.  Because I had made dinner plans for other places around Vegas, I didn't have time to check out the buffet.\n\nOverall, The Rio has been a good resort to stay at.  I haven't really taken advantage of its amenities because I only stayed there to rest and sleep, but I did like how it's conveniently located within close proximity to the Strip and Chinatown which made it easy to travel by car.
35	Purchased a certified Accord from here. Within 6 months had to replace all 4 tires, front brakes and the battery. Recently both the rear view and side view camera stopped working. Called the service department and of course they wouldn't do anything for me because my warranty was expired even though my car was certified and shouldn't have had to undergone all the other repairs I needed to do in the first place. $1000 in repairs to a certified vehicle in the first six months and they won't even look at my broken cameras without a fee. This place is the worst, I would give it no stars if possible. Do not buy or get service here, it will cost you a lot more money than the sticker price.
36	This was my first time to this restaurant and I walked out with a full tummy and a smile on my face. The problem with Scottsdale is that it is such a fast paced city that they have forgotten what a genuine sit down restaurant is. This is a place that you come to when you do not have any time constraints and are willing to wait for some damn good food cooked by single chef with some serious talent. Back east, people flock to restaurants like this one, waiting for hours to taste the deliciousness cooked up by one person. So if you are looking to spend sometime with a loved one and want some amazing non-chain made food with lots of different flavors on every dish, then Amys Baking Company is the place to go.
37	Everything in this truck is amazing, but I tip my hat to the Bear Dog. Peanut butter, cracker jacks, bacon, cheese, and bbq sauce on a hot dog somehow works fabulously. \n\nEach hotdog is named after a customer's dog and every week they feature a new dog of the week. Someday I'll submit one named for my dog too.  \n\nSide note, the fried pickles are pretty amazing too.
38	Went here for lunch today with a local who had never been there. Not a real good sign for me as she's also a chef that works in the nicer hotels.\n\nI called while in the car and asked if they have avgolemono soup and the guy answered me, ''Pos den exoume?'' (How can we not have?). Perfect answer.\n\nWhen you walk in the door, it's a bit dingy looking, like a NY restaurant that isn't very busy.  First impression wasn't so great. It's not that it's the worst looking place I've been to but definetly not the best. \n\nThe waiter was great. Spoke Greek and almost perfectEnglish. Was happy to have a Greek in there as I'm certain, other than the other restauranteurs, there can't be too many Greeks here.\n\nSitting down, the place was very clean, the table was very well set and they even had cloth napkins!!!!!\n\nWe started with the tzatziki and taramosalata. He was nice enough to give us a plate of half and half. The taramosalata as really good, just thick enough and creamy at the same time. The tzatziki though, even though it had a crisp, fresh taste, was much too watery for my liking.\n\nNext was avgolemono soup. It was great. Just right, not too thick, not too watery. Little pieces of breast spread out evenly.\n\nOn deck, calamari. These were some of the best I've ever had and in Vegas, of all places. Lightly breaded, soft pieces of squid, not too greasy, just perfect.\n\nI had pastichio and she had a beef kabob platter as main dishes. Mine was really good, just a little dry but that's just my taste. I like the bechamel melting everywhere but no biggie. They had green beans on the plate that were just like Mama's, soaked in oil and tomato sauce with small bits of onions and peppers mixed in. The potatoes on the plate were okay but unnecessary with all the pasta already there. The piece was quite large as well. She said the beef kabob was great and she had 3-4 pieces of large beef with the aformentioned green beans and potatoes.\n\nOverall, a great dining experience where I had very low expectations. I was glad to see that there were no slot machines in the restaurant as well. I think even the toilets have them here.\n\nWhen in Vegas, look this place up to get away from all the clang clang of everywhere you go.
39	Ooh.  Um... THE SUCK...\n\nThe few of us who somehow woke before noon walked about the Miracle Mile shops in search of some breakfast eats.  Unfortunately, we stumbled upon this joint and had too little mental acuity to give it a once over before deciding...\n\nThe decor and theme would be perfect if it were an outdoor restaurant, not so much under a faux sky in a darkened corner of a mall.\n\nService was responsive, though that probably had a lot to do with us being only the second party in the establishment.  Our server did comp me a grapefruit juice when it turned out that they weren't out...\n\nBut the menu.  Ech.  Not a one (of the four of us) were happy with our meals.  Yes, its primarily a seafood and wine bar, but REALLY?  How do you screw up AND be chintzy on breakfasts and salads?  I dare say, I've had better for cheaper at Denny's...
40	Tried this place for the first time tonight and it was amazing! Everything was flavorful and the staff was really helpful! I will definitely go again. And again.
41	I got in touch with Ryan Lanoue over internet and asked for a OTD price on a 2016 prius eco. He immediately responded with the final OTD.I'm convinced the OTD i've received is fair and good price to work with. \nI've browsed other dealers websites for colors and i found that right toyota has more inventory and color options than anyone in phoenix area. I zeroed in couple of colors.\n\nBefore setting the appointment to visit the dealer, i've  asked ryan to bring the price down, thinking that it may take few more e-mails.\nJust with one e-mail he agreed to the price.The process at the dealer was quick and great experience. Ryan took me to his office, went through few papers, showed the car and i'm out of dealership within 45min.\n\nLong story short, Ryan handled it professionally, Honoured OTD, put me through a very efficient and quick process in buying the car.I found Ryan is honest, easy to work with and most importantly he delivered on his words and very  result oriented.\n\nI'm also happy that right toyota has gave me a free package because it pre build with car at this dealership, where i found online other dealers are charging extra.\n\nOverall awesome experience from start to finish, i would highly recommend Ryan and Right Toyota.
42	I've never heard of \"Imperial Palace\" nor that \"The Quad\" took over and renovated the outside. We checked in around 2 am and right when we got into our room I was so disgusted. It looked so dirty and ghetto. The floors were stained, the bathroom looked dirty, the big tub looks moldy, the bed looks gross, and the room had a sewer\/urine smell.\n\nI told my boyfriend that there's NO WAY IN HELL that I would be sleeping in this room! It made me feel dirty just looking at the things around this room. It had a mirror attached to the ceiling; underneath the bed. Seriously?! That just shows you what type of people who would stay here. *cringes* I'm afraid to catch some kind of disease if I even sat on that bed. \n\nMy boyfriend told me we can go around to gamble and come back later to nap for a few hours and go check into another hotel. Well, it's almost 7am and I rather not sleep just to avoid coming back to that hell hole of a room. I don't care if it was a complimentary room. Free or not...you couldn't pay me enough to ever sleep there.\n\nIt sounds like I'm coming off as a \"princess\" because I'm very picky about almost everything but I assure you...no decent girl would EVER want to stay there. If you're a guy and you bring your girlfriend\/fiancè\/wife here...DON'T! No lie, they will be upset as I am.\n\nI can't wait until it's 10 am so we could check into a more cleaner place to stay!\n\nI would give this hotel 0 stars! Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting! Did I mention: DISGUSTING?!?! Ughh!
43	All the ladies in there was awesome! They are great with dogs. I am a newbie with dogs and leaving my shy chicorgi overnight is not uncomfortable for me. The reviews on here really helped me. My dog that is always scared, opened up an hour after visiting. I am shocked and happy! Thank you Poshy Paws.
44	Have I been given the opportunity to judge the city of montreal? As a property owner I've been made to feel like an asshole and a sucker in favor of a population that doesn't pull their weight. Just keep doubling my taxes every year and we'll see where it leads.
45	The brisket was all fat. The BBQ was just okay. The cornbread and pudding was gross. We won't be back.
46	Hot pot is something you don't hear to often in the Las Vegas foodie scene let alone Mongolian food. To my surprise, I was very excited about this restaurant opening especially finding out that they would have a conveyor belt full of various dishes.\n\nThe family and I decided on this place because we were pretty much Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese and even Filipino out. We have been wanting to try something new and different for a awhile. Since I'm the designated unofficial planner for my family. I pulled up my Yelp account and came across Chubby Cattle that I bookmarked.\n\nWhen we got to Chubby Cattle, the staff immediately greeted us and we were seated upon entering within 2 minutes on a Friday night. We got place with a table that was next to a conveyor belt, because not all seating arrangement have a conveyor belt. Our server Kwan, was very friendly and attentive to our needs and explained to us the concept. We decided on the Halloween Special Combo at the time since it was suggested by our server. We got a huge pumpkin carved out wit a variety of meats, shrimp & dumplings. Included was a bowl of various vegetables. I personally like the fact that the Hot Pot was built with a divider so we had the option of 2 soup base. One was tomato paste broth and the other was a mushroom flavor broth. Both were delicious and paired well with everything that came on our combo. There was a few dishes we added ala carte from the conveyor belt like quail eggs which happens to be a favorite of mine and my sisters. Overall the whole experience was amazing and definitely will be a topic for discussion with our extended family and friends. The cool thing about our dinner was how my parents actually enjoyed their meal. Even though they are biased with many Asian restaurants. \n\nThe only thing I noticed that could be improved on is their clarification of the menu. It could use more description of what is being offered and specifically how big of a portion each combo can feed. Plus the options of adjusting according to group sizes would be beneficial. However, everything was great and I would recommend everyone to try this dinning experience out!\n\nKwan, Thanks again for the awesome service! :)
47	Stopped in for dinner with my boyfriend. We got the awesome buffalo chicken salad and shared the delicious Wednesday night $5 pizza. \n\nI didn't care for the large portrait of Tina Turner at our table. In it, she was giving me disgusted side-eye, like \"You're seriously gonna have another piece of pizza?\"\n\nIt was pretty inexpensive and everything was delicious!
48	I think Panda Express is a bit overpriced in general, but the food is always fresh and tasty.  I really like the mushroom chicken and the cream cheese rangoon.\n\nParking at this location is a little tough, it always seems pretty crowded.  But other than that, everything is pretty peachy!
49	I've had better was what kept repeating through my head throughout dinner. Everything at Hana was decent, but nothing stood out as spectacular.\n\nPerhaps the Chef saves the best ingredients and extra effort for the daily specials, but he certainly didn't spend much time on the bento box, which is my go to when checking out any Japanese restaurant for the first time as if gives you a 'tasting menu' of what the restaurant has to offer. We also had a side of vegetable gyoza.\n\nThe Good:  \n- the Salmon sashimi was quite good, fresh and flavorful\n- the tempura was great, light and crisp\n- the pickled vegetables were a nice addition to the standard bento fare. \n- the white ginger was nice and refreshing, a step up from the standard pink ginger at most sushi places.\n- great neighborhood vibe - small and intimate with a modern Asian vibe than isn't overly 'faux-Japanese' or 'trendy'\n- quick, friendly service\n\nThe Not so Good\n- the tuna sashimi tuna had the telltale mushy flavorless that comes from being previously frozen) \n- the 'chef's choice' sashimi (A white fish, but we didn't get a chance to ask what it was) was flavorless (although not mushy!)\n- the California rolls were quite disappointing - imitation crab meat and over mayo-ed (why do California rolls even need mayo?)\n- the wasabi lacked kick. (I'll be sure to ask for fresh if I visit again)\n- the gyoza tasted like the came pre-made and frozen.\n\nOne comment on the BYOB.  While I usually like the idea of BYOB, (especially with no corkage fees), at a Japanese restaurant, i usually like ordering Sake or Japanese beer that can be hard to come at regular retail outlet in Phoenix).\n\nOverall, the experience wasn't memorable.  I may come back when the sushi urge hits (and order off the daily special menu), but it won't be a priority otherwise, especially with all the great other restaurants popping up in uptown Phoenix.
50	This was our second time eating at Taste of Thai. Both times we had both excellent service and food! We will absolutely be returning a third time.
51	A pretty good place to rest your legs a bit.  This location is in a basement, and there are several massage places nearby, so do check to make sure you are walking into the right place.  \n\nInstead of a big communal room, the place is partitioned into little rooms, so you get more privacy, even if the partitions don't completely block out all noises.\n\nOnce you sit down, they offer you a pot of hot tea, brewed with their blend of tea and medicinal herbs, according to the lady.  Now, I admit bottled water is more convenient and sanitary, but part of me still feel that a pot of tea is more soothing, welcoming and personal.  \n\nUnlike other foot massage parlors, over here the foot soak is just that. You just sit and soak your feet, no neck and shoulder pampering.  I guess that's how they can advertise 60 min for a low price of $30.  You get 45 min real massage time, but nonetheless it's still a good value, and the skill and pressure is there, enough to make me feel rejuvenated afterwards.   Won't mind going back.
52	Worst food ever I have tasted !! The owner  is a really stupid n rude person. Never coming again\nThis place is so fucked up that you cannot even breath inside.  \nThe ripple who manage this place are the most ill mannered people in this business\nFrustrated because paid almost 200 bucks...
53	Ugh... Instagram made me!!\n\nHad this café on my bucket list for ages after seeing all the attractive pictures all over Instagram. Being a sucker for gorgeous interiors, especially old\/historic buildings converted into modern coffee shops, Tommy was at the top of my list. \n\nFrom a distance, the coffee shop stands out with its stunning corner-elevation of beautiful Victorian Architecture. However, I was a little disappointed upon entering. The space is much smaller than I anticipated and a lot of seating has been crammed into this space. I do love the play of levels with mezzanines which works well and appreciate the relaxed atmosphere however, being popular with both tourists and locals, it can get really claustrophobic waiting in such a small space. Consider yourself extremely lucky if you get a seat during weekends\/peak times as people don't seem to want to move from there.\n\nThe décor definitely is one of its main features for those picture-perfect Instagram shots as the café is bright and flooded with natural light. The hanging foliage, chandelier and ornate mouldings on the ceiling and walls create the ideal dream backdrop. It is a shame therefore that I cannot say the same for the coffee\/snacks. I had the honey-glazed mushroom and goat cheese toast with a mocha and the raved-about 'cronut' which were all disappointing and extremely over-priced. It cost around 25$ for the 3 items - none of which were worth it.\n\nOverall, a stunning café worth visiting for the pictures but for a bite, there are plenty of better options in the area where you are sure to get more than a meagre $14 toast.
54	very bad ..food and fruit they serve not fresh..very bad quality...\nno to considerate again...\nfor 40$ couple EAT BREAKFAST for some fruit not even fresh and bad taste..\nbetter to go Tim hurton..
55	As I reflect on one of my most recent trips to Vegas, I try and contemplate on how many of the 7 deadly sins I broke...  I think I finished hitting for six of seven on that trip, I ain't gonna go into detail which ones I did and didn't commit.  That's for me, a friend and a few small animals to know...  Animal debauchery aside, (kidding) I managed to get a standard room and flight from a southwest deal for less then 70 bucks a night, during check-in the woman at the front desk inquired if I would like to pay a small upgrade to gain access to their Spa Deluxe Room, I figured I'm in Vegas, why not?  I am so glad I did in the end...  \n\nMan, the first night I was there was awesome, did some room service, caviar, a little bit of bubbly and chilled in the tub, while watching whatever movie they had to offer up on that big 'old flat screen TV!  I even ventured down to a local pawn shop to find top hat and wearing it while chillin in the tub.    Hey you gotta live it up when you come to Vegas right?  \n\nThere was so much room that I could sprawl out and unwind, with over 500 square feet and a prime view of the strip, It was an awesome view of the Las Vegas skyline.  There was a second bathtub\/shower if you didn't feel like using the jacuzzi tub, but who the heck would turn that down to begin with?\n\nI am not a super fan with the New York theme, still that aside it's a fun atmosphere and not to far from the tram which can take up and down the strip.  Ill be back for sure next time, I mean what could beat chillin in a massive tub, with my top hat, a tub full of bubbles, enjoying a cigar in one hand, a bottle of beer in the other, room service waiting for me at arms distance all while I'm watching sports center.  Ah I felt like Pacino in Scarface, only not as cool or bad ass or rich...  damn.... so I am not Pacino, still it was awesome!
56	What the heezy happened in this joint? I walked into Le Thai pumped for Penang last night but I walked out of Le Thai-me Is Money shaking my head.\n\nAfter slinging back some cocktails at the Mob Bar with a few home fries, we trekked over to Le Thai for a pad thai party. We were sat right away on the covered patio outside, at which we proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. What's a girl gotta do to get some agua around here when she's dehydrated from the drinking? Wait, I guess. Our server later came around to take drink orders, and while the same people who complained about the cold opted for ICED Thai tea, I asked for a glass of hot water. The teas came by, but lo and behold, no water - is this because we're having conservation issues? No matter - I waved down a busser who came by right away with the missing goods.\n\nOur roster consisted of Thai style wings, Thai beef noodle soup, Penang curry with brown rice, tom yum soup, and short rib fried rice. The food was actually really good, which was enhanced by the cold weather and my declining buzz. Plus, the soup was so perfect in the cold, until we realized that was it - we were sitting IN THE COLD, and only 1 of the 3 heat lamps were on. We asked a staff member if we could turn on the extra heat lamps, and we were shut down, being told that heat lamps actually weren't even really allowed, given the cover on the patio and all. As we watched the last of the heat lamps die out though, he refilled the lamp as if to do us a favor. \n\nThe curry came out with white rice which was frustrating if it hadn't been for another employee who pitched in yet again, but it wasn't anything compared to the irritation we harbored when we went to pay the check and were told they could only make four transactions total after we had calculated the payment for six people. One of us opted to pay with cash, and the change was rounded up because they did not carry change - I'm not sure if this was just the server, or the restaurant as a whole, but either way, it doesn't seem to make much business CENTS. \n\nI've never had much of an issue with the food here, but the service is just such a hit or miss ALL THE TIME, with it being more of a miss lately. I feel like I'm throwing the place under the bus, but I suppose this is the same disappointment my parents felt when I told them I wasn't going to be pre-med, and they've managed to move on.
57	Shawn is a rarity in the field of auto mechanics:  he's honest and he's great.   His prices are fair and he does what needs to be done.   \n\nI own a 2003 Chevy Venture.   When the engine started misfiring I took it to a mechanic at Canadian tire.  He told me that they needed to replace the engine.   Upon recommendation from a friend I took it to Expert Auto Mechanix.   He found that the bolts on the engine block were loose (probably from a previous dealer mechanic not tightening them enough when replacing the intake manifold... which was a recall issue).   He was able to fix the bolts, and replace the head gasket.   He saved me over $1500.   40000km and an emissions test later, it still runs great.  \n\nHe's the first mechanic I call when something goes wrong.
58	I went to brunch this morning with a group of 14 ladies. The service was great and the waitress even offered to seperate all of our checks although they told us they don't do this when we made the reservation. She got all of our orders right and there were no problems throughout the meal with getting our drinks refilled. As for the food, I got the Central Breakfast which consisted of 3 eggs, bacon or sausage and grits or fries. I had the eggs, bacon and potato fries which were done with red and green peppers. The potatoes were super salty and the bacon and eggs were what you would expect. My friends had the Breakfast Sandwich that consisted of ham, pinento cheese and a fried egg on a challah roll. It looked really good and was a really large size. This also came with grits or potatoes. I don't know if the food won me over enough to come back but it was worth the trip. I also found the restaurant to be quaint and charming due to it's location in an old craftsman style house. Good ambiance.
59	We had been to RBB before, so we were expecting bar food and a really casual atmosphere. Well, apparently they have remodeled in the last year or so, and now have a nice modern ambiance. \n\nThe menu was not at all what I remembered, and that was a plus. I ordered the Chicken-fried-chicken, and my husband had the Classic Mac'n Chicken. Let me just say, it was the best chicken fried chicken I've ever had. The meat was so light and delicious! The mashed  potatoes were good, but nothing to write about. His Mac'n \"roasted\" Chicken was perfect. He loved every bite of it. The portion looked small, but ended up being just enough to fill him up. \n\nWe were there on a Saturday for lunch. Surprisingly there were quit a few families there with small, very small children. There was ample seating all over the restaurant, but the hostess sat us right beside a high-chair, with a whinny baby in it. Of course, I immediately asked to be moved and they accommodated us with no problem. Later more small children came in, and of course the hostess sat the kids right near us rather than near the other children. \n\nMy advice for all hostess is to sit children near other children and couples near other couples. It makes for a much better meal.
60	After a long afternoon on the beach I was pretty hungry and southern food served on a patio seemed like just the thing. I ordered the fried chicken.\n\nI got a big plate with three pieces of fried chicken (it seemed to be a breast and two thighs), a dish of mac and cheese, and a helping of collard greens. The chicken was pretty good -- moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside, although in places the coating was inexplicably sweet, not really what I was expecting. The mac and cheese was creamy and mild and the collard greens were crunchy and, well, green-tasting. The patio was dark pleasant despite the giant bright tv taking up one wall. \n\nI was only able to finish about half of my food, and the server boxed up the rest for me. I spent the next morning day-dreaming about my left over chicken, mac and cheese, and collard greens. But, when I cracked open the styrofoam container, the greens where nowhere to be found! What's the deal Harlem? I want my collard greens back ...
61	Just came in and was ignored. I've tried twice to give these guys my business but it's a no go.  Before writing this I have read the other negative reviews not wanting to just go by them but it seams that it's not any better. Justin was just sitting by the cash register doing nothing and aside from the helper that was there I didn't get any do you need and help or what can I sell to you. Unfortunately most of the fish had ICH or looked lethargic. I would have purchased coral but not one hello, I think I'll keep my business with the East Side Stores.
62	Stay away from this place! Common sense and courtesy are not included with their service. They couldn't find our wheel lock which is where any sensible person would look for it....with the spare. It's incredible that something so simple couldn't be figured out within the hour they had my car. What a waste of time and the front desk guy couldn't even look at us in our face to even explain what happened or apologize at least!  Very rude and just waste of time. Absolutely unprofessional. I wouldn't trust this company if they can't even figure out one simple task. Negative star rating.
63	The owner was quick in responding to my complaint.  He was apologetic and seemed genuinely concerned about our customer experience.  We all make mistakes but the way we handle them reveals who we are.  Thank you for listening.
64	I came here in mind for one thing, and one thing only. Frozen Hot Chocolate!!\n\nOrdered the Double Frozen Hot Chocolate (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=2GqvSuIZfL0RB7_fqBGcGg). The waitress stuck so many straws in it. She obviously thought that I was going to share. Hah! All mine!! \n\nThe drink is basically a pre-made hot cocoa drink, blended with ice. In this case, 'double' has ice cream blended in also. Yummy! Except difficult to drink unless it has melted into a light slush.\n\nFood here may seem a bit pricey, but the portions are huge!!! And its Vegas anyway, so spend that moneyyyy!
65	UPDATE: To get out of my contract, it's only $1,470. They're going to send a new technician out to see if he can fix the alarm system. The earliest they can get here is in six days. The visit will be during the day, so I get to miss more work. This company should be investigated by Congress.\nUPDATE 2: I've reached out to my fire department to get their opinion on the install that I've posted a picture of. I can't imagine this is up to code.\n\nMy experience has been very negative. I'm writing this review at 3:00 AM when I should be sleeping. Instead, I am awake because the alarm system started beeping and wouldn't stop until I powered the system down. This has happened more than once this week. ADT said they would have someone out in 3.5 weeks to repair the system. Merry Christmas.\n\nI had the alarm system installed two years ago. Fortunately I never had any home security issues in that time. November 2015 they had to update my alarm system, because it was going to be out of date soon. The technician who came to our home was nice enough. He was also pushing his multilevel marketing side \"business.\" I certainly didn't appreciate that. It took about 4.5 hours to upgrade our system. A little over the time they said it would take. Very acceptable from my perspective.\n\nThe new hardware for the ADT system is a visual eyesore. The older system was smaller and vastly more subtle. The power part is hooked up to the nearest outlet. There is also some other box installed next to that. Because we don't have an outlet in our closet, it's installed on the outside of our homes closet. That assembly is composed of a medium sized surge protector that has a red light for power. Next to that is another box mounted to the wall. I am not pleased with the new larger assembly, and red light it emits. The mounting job they did with the new hardware uses zip ties for some of it. Sadly it's not tied tight, and the thickness of the zip ties is very thin. The whole thing is rather wobbly and a good bump would dismount the thing from the wall. I also wasn't aware they were going to drill mounting brackets into my wall. The size of this portion of the system is about 4\" x 8\" x 11\". Unfortunately we don't have any furniture in this part of our home that would hide this stuff.\n\nThen about a week after our system was upgraded it started beeping and turning off due to lack of power. We called ADT and they said the earliest they could get someone to our home was 3.5 weeks. As a temporary workaround, we were told to turn the power supply off and on. This temporary solution works for maybe a day. Then yet again our panel starts beeping like an alarm clock that it's running on battery power. Then a few hours later it shuts off from lack of power. Additionally for the multiple times the power went out, we intermittently received robocalls from ADT to notify us. After the first few times this happened, I started ignoring the calls. No further notifications or followup was done by ADT for these service interruptions.\n\nIn the last week, we have twice been awoken in the middle of the night from beeping.\nThe product is a visual eye sore.\nThe earliest ADT can fix it is 3.5 weeks.\nTheir contracted technician tried to sell us his multilevel marketing system.\nThe mounting installation for the power supply is inadequate.\nThe 24 hour a day alarm system that we pay for doesn't run 24 hours in a row. \nWhen our alarm system is shutting down, they use a computerized system to call us.\nWe simply can't leave the house without knowing the alarm system will shut off.\nThe phone number used to contact ADT has a computerized answering system where you press 1 for this, and two for that. For a good time, call 800-252-2029.\nThis is a joke, and the jokes on me.\n\n\nWe have decided to turn off our alarm system and cancel our service. I am looking forward to business hours when I can talk to someone about canceling our service. I'll have plenty of time to do that today because I'll be missing work due to lack of sleep. I am flabbergasted at this entire experience.\n\nGood luck.
66	Enjoyed it a lot! I've had Thai food from Thailand and obviously the authenticity isn't exact, but overall, absolutely delicious food.
67	This place is off the strip in the Palms. We made reservations, but when we arrived, it definitely wasn't needed. There was maybe 4 other tables seated when we arrived at 7p on a Saturday. It filled up a bit more while we were there, but definitely wasn't busy. \n\nWe decided to eat here because it was close to the Rio, which was where we were catching the Penn and Teller show, otherwise I definitely would have chosen a steakhouse on the strip. It had a strange ambience to it: dimly lit, nice furnishings, borderline between a modern, clubby look and an attempt to be fancy? But it was playing rock music. Did not help the vibe at all. \n\nService was ok. It started off great; our waitress was friendly and attentive, but towards the end of dinner....she disappeared for good amounts of time. We're not a needy bunch, but when I notice something like that, it means she was gone for a LONG TIME. It tooks us a while to get our bill. \n\nNow the food....and this is where the rating can also be misleading, but I look at the whole picture when rating (ambience, service, food, location, etc). \n\nThe food was delicious! Lobster potstickers are a must. The steak melted in my mouth. The sides....mac n cheese, au gratin, baked potatoes....amazing. If I was purely rating on just food, this place would definitely be 4 stars.\n\nIf it were on the strip....with better design to help it's ambience, I think N9NE would have been a 4 or 5 star place. But if you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and still want some really good food-N9NE would be a place for you.
68	This place is dark, loud, and filled with enough perfume\/cologne to make me go home with a headache. Really, its so dark that I can't get a good look at the clothing they are trying to sell me. Plus, theres a bench or couch outside (can't remember) that is a constant hangout for 13 year olds - making it hard to enter or exit the store. \n\nIt was one of those \"oh, cool, a new store, lets check it out!\" and after entering I immediately pulled a 180 and left. I'll be staying far, far away.
69	brought mama for a belated birthday present. very good show. JLo mixed in a lot of her oldies with some new tracks and even threw in a little Lee Ann Womack's \"i hope you dance\". lots of costume changes and obviously, lots of amazing choreography. light show was not too gawdy and crowd was really dialed in. overall, worth the $$$.
70	If I could rate negative stars it would be a negative five.  I NEVER leave reviews. This is actually my first time. I know I'm not perfect at my job everyday so I like to take that into consideration however, this experience was beyond un acceptable and I hope I can prevent someone else from going through it. \n**DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY** \nI had called alliance for a roach problem I was having in my house and was very flustered at the time of the call, the lady that answers the phone and schedules your appointment was very nice and very helpful at first. She made me feel comfortable and sent their president Paul over within a couple\nHours to check out the property free of charge. When Paul arrived he was VERY knowledgeable and helpful with possible solutions. He left me his card and told me to talk it over with my husband when he got home and to give him a call. As soon as my husband got home that night he told me to go ahead and make the appointment for the treatment and set up a monthly treatment plan for 3 months. That's when it all started. \nI called Paul over the next three days several different times and left two messages with no response.  Their main office finally answers and books my appointment and I pay for it over the phone. It was set for the next day between 11am-2pm. I make sure I am at home during those hours. I was sitting at the counter of a very open kitchen that can see the front courtyard and front door. Also have a dog that goes crazy anytime someone arrives. Come 2:30 pm I never hear anything from them so I call the main office where the same lady answered the phone. I told her I haven't seen her employees and it's now 2:30 pm.  She asks for my address and then screams across her store to another employee and asks if he went to that address today, she tell me that he stopped by and that I didn't answer. I told her I knew for a fact that no one rang the door bell or even knocked on the door and that I had been sitting right by it doing work all afternoon and would have heard and if not me definitely my dog. She got very very rude with me and then began talking to her employee without putting me in hold asking him where his next route was and if my address was in the way because if not she wasn't going to send him \"out of his way to do a job when the person did not answer the door\".  THAT INFURIATED me. Mind you I had already paid them for the service. I told her she needs to send someone over immediately to do the job I had already paid for. Luckily for me the man said it was only two minutes away. He shows back up with an attitude and I direct him to the guest house first. She does a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE job. I honestly could not even believe it. THEN he try's to walk back to his truck and leave without doing the main house or the outside! I stopped him and asked what about the rest of the house?!? He then says \" \"well open the door\" I was just shocked at how unprofessional and rude this was. I walked him through every room to make sure it even got done and then had to proceed to walk around the WHOLE property with him so I know that got done as well.  I was so upset about the whole experience and the job that they did I didn't even mention to him what Paul the \"president\" and the original guy that came out promised me he would do for me in my bathroom to fix a potential root problem. The whole thing was a huge waste of time money and energy. The treatment did absolutely NOTHING. I obviously cancelled the 3 month plan I had with them and called another company.  The new company I hired is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! After the first treatment I have not seen ONE insect. He was very very thorough and professional and found 4 root problems and cleared them out!! No more bugs!!!! Please please take my experience and trust me that you DO NOT want to deal with this company. I should have trusted all of the bad reviews I read previously to calling them, but wanted to give them benefit of the doubt! For someone who has been in business for 35 years this is 100 percent unacceptable.
71	Great spot that is closed on Sunday. We came on a busy Saturday morning. Service was good as was the food. Sausage and egg croissant was fresh and tasty. Brownie and chocolate mousse dome were delicious.
72	Small cozy joint.... great coffee... friendly servers....simple menu. \nAnother Triple D find worth going to...... I am finding Guy F. loves Arizona... after spending a week here I can see why.. tons of good eats super little time! Got here after the business people but before the slacker crowd (back home that means somewhere between 8:30 and 9 AM). So we had no wait....\n\nI got the five spot which totally kept me full for hours...that and the three cups of local coffee... The peppery bacon this joint uses is to die for...My five spot: The sweet onions, the bun, the bacon and the perfectly cooked eggs.... solid breakfast. I had a taste of Julie K's griddlecakes and they were yummy. \n\nI appreciate simplicity and this place has some basics on the menu but do them well. Reasonably priced menu... I highly recommend :-).\n\nFew things\n1. BRING QUARTERS ....  lots of places to park but it is metered parking\n2. come early and make sure EVERYONE in your party is there\n3. Bathroom is next door (TALK TO MIKEY.. he is a very wise and amazing person)
73	My friends wanted to come here because theyve been to Ra when they were in the east coast, so we decided to have a bite to eat here before we guzzled down large amounts of Fat Tuesdays LOL. We were staying at Trump Tower, so it was pretty easy to get to since Ra is in Fashion Show Mall. \n\nIt was slightly empty when we went in but i noticed all the cool upscale-like decor. It had a nice reddish\/dark theme. Pretty laid back. They had a bento box lunch special, but unfortunately, it was only until 3pm. Instead we ordered off the happy hour menu--\n\nSweet Onion Salmon: salmon was cut thinly, but pretty good with sauce\nLobster Spring Rolls: only 3, super crunchy, but couldnt taste much of the mango\nCalamari: not too memorable , but filling\nViva Las Vegas Roll: typical sushi roll, average, but the plating was gorgeous\n\nAll of these dishes were reasonably priced (considering vegas $$), and the food came out fast and hot. Waitress came back to check up on us a lot and gave us boxes to take things to go for our friends. \n\nWill come back to try other dishes, hopefully better ones
74	I go to this smiths because it is the closest supermarket to my house. There is an Albertson's that is across the street from the Smith's, but I prefer Smith's.\n\nFirst of all, Smith's is open 24\/7. That's great if I need some late night munchies or commodities such as toilet paper. Second, they have self checkout registers. I feel weird getting checked out by an employee, it seems as if I should be tipping them or something.\n\nIf you have a shoppers card, you can save a lot of money on certain items that are discounted. And, if you use your card, you can redeem points towards gas discounts, which really isn't that great because the discount is at Shell stations, which charge a lot more than most gas stations.\n\nI will continue to shop here because it's convenient. The prices aren't that bad either, it's better than Albertsons. I think the prices are better than Vons too.
75	I struggled with this review. Phoenix Knife House has pretty much only 5 star reviews, did I really want to be the one who bucked that trend? But in all honesty I didn't have an amazing experience, so here it is -\n\nThe location is conveniently central and there is plenty of off-street parking. The store is clean and bright. I had two Japanese knives that needed sharpening. I was told it would take an hour and they took my cell phone number and promised to call when ready. So I went across the street to Safeway to do some shopping, then on to CVS to pick up some things. An hour had passed without a call, but I figured, no big deal, so I went to JT's, a dive bar on the same strip mall as PKH. Two beers later and the time is creeping up close to 2 hours, still no phone call.\n\nSo, I decide to go back to PKH in the off chance that my knives were ready and they'd just forgotten to call me. When I went back the store's empty and the owner(?) and another employee are crouched over a computer looking at a restaurant's website discussing what's for lunch. \n\nNo, your knives are not ready yet, I'm told. In fact they haven't even started yet. The good news is I'm next in line. Ok, great, I'll just sit on one of the couches and wait. Here comes the line from the owner that really rubbed me the wrong way - \"You can wait, but just understand that if a customer comes in, they will take precedence over you and you will have to wait longer.\" A customer??? What exactly am I then? I understand that my $14 knife sharpening is not as much money as you will make from selling one Akifusa Gyuto for $810, but I'd still like to think I'm a customer!\n\nI would have been happy to come back the next day and pick up the knives if that had been communicated to me at the beginning, but to waste 2.5 hours of my time and then to insult me to boot, just isn't right, no matter how good the sharpening was.
76	Best bbq in AZ.  Parking is a nightmare and the line is always long, but it's all well worth it.
77	Dr. Kathryn Thompson was a fantastic physician for my primary care. She made me feel very comfortable during the GYN exam. That is always an awkward time, however she made me feel relaxed.\n\nI really enjoyed the fact that she spent a whole hour with me in the room. I have never had a physician spend that much time with me in my life and I work in health care! I was thoroughly impressed with the facility, cleanliness, and friendliness of the staff. From the registrars, to the medical assistant, to the nurse, to the physician, to the phlebotomist I was treated with dignity, compassion, and respect. \n\nI will definitely remain a patient for a long time to come. I felt like Dr. Thompson really listened to my concerns and found the best plan of treatment for me. She is young but extremely competent. I also had virtually no wait time. All my family attends this practice and enjoys their physicians.
78	GROSS! \n\nI chose my own toppings for my bowl because i could be a little picky.  The tuna did not look fresh as it stuck to the paper napkin in the container nor did it taste fresh.  The shrimp is not cooked fresh and split in half and then ripped into pieces.  The crab is fried and the eel was fatty, previously cooked with tons of sauce on it...no bueno for a fresh or healthy option.  The sauces are either mayo based or soy sauce based.  So either saturated fats or a mouth of salt.  I asked for very little wasabi aoli and she put so much on it was like  a fish salad without tasting the fish.  Maybe that is how they get around the \"lack of freshness\". \n\nThe toppings looked days old or canned.  It was just no good and i will never be back.
79	Il est ouvert depuis environ deux ans, il a pris la place du Mesa qui avait pris la place du Vergas. C'est à croire que les restaurants qui prennent pignon sur rue à cette adresse n'ont pas de chance. \n\nDéception total. Bon il est certain que je ne m'attends pas à grand chose sachant que c'est un restaurant du type buffet chinois. Mais tout de même... Nous avons été à l'heure du midi. Le menu est beaucoup plus restreint que celui du soir. Il est probablement préférable d'aller au Finesse d'Orient de l'autre côté de la rue. Bon, peut-être pas plus qu'un deux étoiles qu'en à lui mais c'est déjà plus q'une seule. \n\nJe n'y retournerai pas.
80	Really friendly service and the softest ribs I've ever had that desolve in your mouth. If you can't handle spice DO NOT eat the spicy sauce but if you're gown with the spice put it on everything !
81	Heavenly ice cream. Had a scoop of the strawberry a couple of weeks ago and keep finding myself thinking about it. Mmm. It actually reduced my bf and I to silence. I liked the wooden pew in the shop and the fact you can see the ice cream\/chocolate making equipment out back. I imagine the owners spend hours at night there experimenting with flavours like mad professors creating ice cream joy.
82	The first time I came here was with a bachelor party. We were sitting in the lounge area by the bar doing some drinking, and unbeknownst to us, the waitresses here are scantily clad, sporting massive jugs. I'll get to the food in a second.\n\nSo we're sitting down and the waitress is right behind my friend Zach. She says, \"Would you guys like any drinks?\" Zach swiveled around to answer and accidentally got a face full of 36 F's. Like, an unintentional motorboat. Great life moment. Also, the little hostess with the tongue ring is highly attractive in that librarian kind of way, and you know she also owns thigh high boots... na'mean? I'd shake those buns. I'd let her hold my stein. With my eyes open and the lights on. Mmmmhmmm darlin'.\n\nThe shakes. The shakes are insanity in a glass. I ordered a Compost shake and immediately wanted to vomit. I mean that in the best way possible. Think of like - an excitement induced vomit. Like when you get married or something. Actually, that's probably not the best analogy. What I'm trying to say is the shakes are incredibly rich and tasty, and I would recommend the Compost shake to anyone who was punishing themselves with tastiness.\n\nThe burgers. The burger I ate was so delicious, there are no words to describe it. The best way to describe it would be to make a series of guttural noises and then pass out face down into a pile of puppies. I hadn't had anything like the kobe burger in a long time, and it's just what I wanted. My pants also wanted it, because I came home with the bad kind of stained pants. Messy burger.\n\nTwo other things that stood out for me were the awesome art adorning the walls, and my waiter's enormous handlebar mustache. Good on you, mate!
83	The Soda Shop offers Gilbert residents (especially busy moms) a great stop in or drive thru place for the times you want to celebrate or just cope with another mom day. The local drink \"480\" is a refreshing delight. It combines freshly squeezed lime juice, cranberry juice and diet coke. Divine. With an addition of a cookie, it provides this mom with enough fuel (sugar and caffeine) to make it through another day.
84	Had the lunch buffet. Everything was delicious. The waiters\/waitresses were very gracious and pleasant. Nice atmosphere.
85	Avery's is your friendly neighborhood family owned and operated coffee house and I must say that I think I found my new favorite coffee joint! \n\nAs soon as I walked in with my friend we were greeted with a warm smile from the owner and the staff behind the counter. We placed our orders in detail and they were made exactly the way we asked for.\n\nMy friend ordered an Espresso Macchiato, which he enjoyed very much and I ordered a Latte with almond milk extra hot and I gotta say that it was one of the hardiest and tastiest lattes I've ever had.\n\nThe coffee has no bitter after taste and it was very smooth yet bold. I also like the fact that their alternative milks don't have vanilla sweetener, which is very smart of them to consider.\n\nI was told by the owner that the added sweeteners in the alternative milks alters the taste of the coffee and thats why they don't offer it, but they do offer syrups and a variety of sugars that you can add to your drink.\n\nAnother thing that I love about Avery's is that they play easy listening radio in the background and makes for a very relaxing and down to earth atmosphere. And they also provide free wifi and a nice selection of books you can read while enjoying your drink.\n\nAnother plus to this coffee joint is that their prices are very reasonable and I like the fact that the vibage here is not pretentious at all compared to other establishments in the area. \n\nIf you haven't tried Avery's I highly recommend you do. I'm positive you won't regret it!
86	Great show!  If you're a fan this is an easy way to see this legend.  He played all of the hits.  He had a ton of energy.  The staging and sound were perfect.  It was easy to get in and out of the venue.\n\nGo see him while you still can.
87	Dr. Fulcher and his staff were very friendly and knowledgable. Not only was Dr Fulcher good with adults but my kids loved him! I would definitely recommend him and am glad to find a dentist who really cares and knows what he's doing.
88	1\/2 price apps and happy hour all day on Monday. SUCH a good deal.\n\nI came here yesterday for a quick early dinner with my boyfriend. We collectively decided that this was our new place.\n\nI love the atmosphere. Everything is clean and open. There are even a few arcade games in the back to play. It has the ambience of a sports bar without being as grimy as a typical sports bar. \n\nOur server, Sara, was attentive and friendly. I ordered the carnivore tots. Have you ever put something in your mouth and thought \"Wow, this is brilliant.\"? Yeah... this was that experience. Those tots are amazing. My boyfriend got pretzel sticks and cheese as well as buffalo dip. Both were amazing. Our food came quickly and was delicious. Our drinks were cold and refilled quickly! \n\nOn top of the above average service and delicious food, the Monday deal was unbeatable. The price is amazing and this is definitely going to need to be one of my go-to spots!
89	All L&Ls are pretty much the same. The food is consistent no matter what location you go to. The only difference that I noticed was that some locations put way to much rice in the Spam Musubis. Although it's not the best Hawaiian food in the city, they have many locations and the food is good enough. \n\nThings I like about this location:\n-Quick and convenient: I usually call in my to go order and my food is already ready when promised.\n-Friendly staff: The two employees that I have seen working in the front have always been very nice and don't mind giving you extra sauce when requested. They also promote their stamp card: buy 9 regular plate lunches and get the 10th plate free! I know that other locations have this as well, but they don't care to tell you about it. \n-The restaurant is very clean.\n\nWhat I hate about this location:\n- The area is kind of ghetto. I have seen homeless and some weird people hanging out at this plaza so be careful!\n-The parking: the parking stalls right in front of the restaurant are tiny. If someone else parks next to you, good luck trying to get in and out of your car!\n\nOverall I like this location, but its too bad that the area doesn't seem very safe.
90	I took my 10 year old there yesterday. I fully anticipated just walking around and looking. I already told my daughter we were not going for the tour because we weren't there at the tour time (I thought) and the listed price was $80. \n\nAs soon as we walk in, a guy at the front desk asks if we are there for the tour. I said we were not. He said \"I can do both for $45\" but he's whispering it. He then whispers to me that the guy behind me \"just paid $60.\"  He was telling me what a deal I was getting. \n\nI didn't want to pay, but my kid loves the show and she was excited. I said ok and go give my credit card. The guy said \"cash only.\"  I didn't have cash and he tells me to go to the ATM \"across the street\". \n\nThis is a commercial area and nothing is right across the street.  And it was 104 degrees out. They can take credit cards for everything else but not the tour?  And how fair was this to the guy who paid $60?\n\nALL VERY SHADY.  Even if I went the the ATM, we would have missed most of the tour. My kid was very bummed and disappointed. \n\nI gave it one star because it is cool to see that back area.  And there was a nice young boy who offered to get my daughter an autograph, but only if we bought something. \n\nThe guy didn't even apologize to my kid and she left in tears. Cried all the way home.
91	Really nice old school hardware store. On one occasion I needed a part for my very old bathroom faucet. After getting nowhere fast at the big hardware stores I came here and the gentleman not only knew what part I needed he had it in stock... I was in and out in 5 minutes.
92	Enjoyed a wonderful meal at Yardbird last evening.  Had a really good time.  The food and the service clearly were exceptional.  Having eaten at almost every restaurant in The Venetian it's clear Yardbird is No. 1.\n\nDinner began with a killer watermelon cocktail with whiskey.  I should of only had one; however, chose to have 3, maybe 4?  We then split the bone marrow appetizer.  It was an interesting presentation, very Fred Flintstonesque.  It may have been a tad too rich for me but was tasty.  They also lacked marrow spoons to facilitate eating the meat.\n\nI then had the best iceberg wedge salad of my life.  The dressing was yogurt based and the bacon was cut into cubes fried and served hot.  It was a massive portion clearly enough for 2.  It was yummy.\n\nEntrée was shrimp with grits.  It was exceptional once again and something I will eat again.\n\nYes folks, Yardbird is a winner.  I will be back.
93	I have stayed here once before and loved it. In fact, staying again this week and hope to golf if possible. \n\nRooms are great, nice lobby and bar area when you walk in and the service was truly top notch. We did have dinner my last visit and will plan on it again.
94	The food here was so good. I had lunch and I really enjoyed my food. Everyone was so friendly here from the host to the waitress. I will be back.
95	Once Again a contender with Subway and Quiznos. In my eyes this place beats them hands down. You can't get much fresher than this, they make to order and they slice the meat right in front of you, its great ! I had a 8\" smoked turkey sandwich with lettuce, onions and jalepenos, bag of port of sub chips jalepeno flavor and a Mountain Dew. \nNot much seating inside but very well cooled down, a great place to escape the heat. Two places to order from so the line never got too long. I would like to try one of the hot sandwiches next time.
96	This place is beautiful! The salmon sandwich was the best I have ever had, and the meatball appetizer has me making plans to be back for the sandwich. We will be back very soon!
97	After hearing some really good things about Kaya, my wife decided to take me here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Several people have raved to me about their chicken and waffles and I wanted the chance to indulge!  \n\nMy wife ended up ordering the chicken and waffles, promising me a few bites so that I was able to order the tropical paella.  Last year I was first introduced to paella and loved it.  Needless to say, Kaya's paella was excellent. The scallops, mussels, and shrimp were blended beautifully with chicken and chorizo with not one element overtaking the dish.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the sampling of chicken and waffles I had from my wife's plate. For some reason, fried chicken always taste so much better with waffles and maple syrup! We ended up ordering some coffee and tea to go with our meals.  A little pricey for each, but we both needed a nice pickup after our filling meal.\n\nKaya definitely lived up to my expectations.  I really enjoyed our brunch here and was pleased to see the prices on the menu were reasonable for a nicer brunch place with good food. I saw a few things on the men that I would like to come back to try, especially the rainbow salad. Kaya is a solid choice for taste and price and I imagine this will be one of my default go to places in the strip when I'm in the area.
98	This is my neighborhood bar. It is dependable and predictable. My favorite dish is the chicken breast plate with the Asian noodles. The chicken is moist and flavorful every time. I love their homemade chips with blue cheese but I try to steer clear. I always pray that someone else at the table will order them and I can sneak a few . Stolen food has no calories... Really.
99	I brought my 2014 ML350 in for service B. A few hours later I received a call from my \nadviser Eric that my car was ready and they found nothing wrong with it. When I went to \npick it up I was presented with a bill in amount of $ 785.00. After reviewing the bill I \nsaw where my oil was changed, air filter, dust filter changed. Although there was a large area \nfor pick up in the shade that was empty my car was in the blazing sun in 117 degrees. I am\nvery disappointed in Schumacher and feel their customer service has gone down and\ncharge outrageous prices. I feel rather stupid for trusting this company to be fair with \ncustomers.
100	No brown sauce out of a can here--as found in too many Asian restaurants.  Homemade meals with sauces that taste like they are made from the juices of the ingredients. I've had the Pho w\/shrimp(the stock is delicious), the Curry Seafood w\/rice, the Crispy Eggrolls and the Mango Chicken. Thumbs way up for all four. The Spring rolls are good but have too much lettuce.   Best Asian food in Phoenix for the price.
101	Walked over here after a delightful meal next door at the Noodle Place. B-Day Girl wanted something sweet and tasty. I have never seen a place like this before. Simple menu and some interesting ingredients. Hmmm?\n\nI have always liked Ice Cream, Frozen Yogurt or just a smidgen of that Midwest delicious Custard. This place is a bit different and at the same time a one of a kind experience. More of an Asian twist if I can say so. Nice!\n\nEveryone ordered something different. You pick the size, flavors of the base ingredient, and then what toppings you like. Then you choose a glaze to finish it off. They also sell milk tea and ice teas.\n\nI order a Regular sized Original with Mochi Balls, Almond Pudding covered with Black Sesame Topping. One of the family members ordered something with a Mango and Chocolate combo kinda of thingy going on. I did not ask what the B-Day Girl got but the Granddaughter liked it so much she shot a spoonful across the room onto the wall. Napkin Please.\n\nAll around COOL concept with some interesting flavor combinations. I like the game playing area as well. Just kick back and chill if time permits. Game On!\n\n3.5 Stars
102	Three mother-effing listings for the same place...really people....\n\nAlright came with a group of friends and fellow yelpers for the legendary ShowFlake Shaved Ice. Honestly i didnt really want to come here. I wanted to hit up Perfect Scoop instead as they have amazing home made ice cream and the flavored teas are friggin awesome. \n\nWhy did i not care for shaved ice? Well another shaved ice place on Spring Mountain closer to the i15 which upon grand opening spreaded A LOT of hype about how super awesome shaved ice was, how superior to ice cream or shaved ice is, and how it'll cure ACNE and enlarge your penis by 16% per serving. Overall i found them over priced, unbalanced, and nothing really that spectacular. \n\nEnter SnowFlake Shavery\nSo i ordered the Mucho Mango. Mango is a fragrant fruit. Unless most of the flavor is coming from an artificial source it's not easy to completely screw up anything mango flavored especially when it comes with chunks of fresh mango. I did modify it a bit by getting the strawberry sauce which turned out to be strawberry infused condensed milk instead of regular milk flavored condensed milk. \n\nSo how was it? Friggin awesome! Kind of like shaved ice cream. The texture, which is what i wasnt too impressed with when it comes to the other place, was perfect damn close to shaved ice cream. The taste was amazing. What's even better? The Cantaloupe. \n\nToo bad it's so late into summer. Their cantaloupe is nice and perfectly refreshing. The exact thing you need to help cool off on a hot as hell summer day. \n\nImproves...well the owners already know their deficiencies. One being they are in dire need of swapping out the A\/C unit the plaza manager is too cheap to replace, and maybe some kind of underground or build a 2nd story to improve on parking.\n\n\nYelp 100 - 041 of 100
103	Zero stars is not an option. You feel like your headed somewhere special with the Drais Backdrop when you arrive. You're led down an attractive hall and elevator. Then once in you realize that unless you paid for bottle service you cannot sit down. Clubs seem to do this to sell the tables but don't realize that someone will not continue to pay $12.00 for a beer or $15.00 for a mixed drink if they are uncomfortable. (Bring sandals) the security are rude and if you stop at certain sections to take a look they waive their  hands to herd you like cattle. It's awkward because since you're only standing there all you can pretend to be doing is watching the dancers which are doing some repetitive continuous movements over and over. After my one and only beer I left. Not a good time. I'd suggest the Marquee at the Cosmo.
104	Reasonable prices for good Mexican food...\nThe service is good and with a great atmosphere to hang out. The waiter Sachin was amazing
105	Absolutely LOVE my classic set of lashes from here.\nTaylor Lyda did an amazing job and they look beautiful. I roll out of bed throw some foundation on and I'm ready to go, no mascara needed!  I highly recommend this place!
106	Oh man, do I have memories of this Denny's, which was a regular stop for my family in the low 1980's. I must have eaten here 100 times during my early childhood between trips to and from Century III Mall. I loved it then, but I barely tolerate it now. However...\n\nThe Salted Caramel Bacon Brownie Sundae that is currently being offered as part of their pork-centric Baconalia (sounds perverted, don't it?) promotion. The brownie is bakery-quality, warm, and butter-smooth, and becomes almost magical when topped with the brackish caramel and bacon bits, not to mention the vanilla ice cream. \n\nYou'd never think Denny's would sell something like this, eh? \n\nConversely, the Bacon Cheeseburger, something I had no business ordering, was an overcooked, crumbly, flavorless debacle.\n\nBut the service was very good. \n\nAnd that's about all the musing Denny's deserves.
107	I needed to look for a place and I have been exhausted from looking on days on end. I had my first exchange with Paramount Properties with Leah, she was very knowledgeable and personable. She made me feel welcomed and assured me that they would find something for my fiancé and I. She was patient and regularly keep me informed. Leah communicated and set expectations all with positive attitude. I'm so glad we got to meet her and made our process smooth. I've worked with other property management companies in the past and none of them compare to Paramount Properties. I highly recommend them and will use them again in the future. Ask for Leah super attentive.
108	It's now been over a year that we have been members , and i still love it just as much! the produce is fresh and delicious, and as always, if anything goes wrong they rectify it quickly!\n\nI feel very valued as a customer, it always makes my day when the packers write a little note on my packing slip or throw in something extra. This is not just a company that cares about making money, they really do care about their customers! i used to get my delivery at a pickup hub, but a couple of months back they stopped being a pickup hub, so i was switched to home delivery. I can't lie, i wish i had always had home delivery! The only part that could use some improvement is the possibility of guaranteed evening delivery, or smaller time windows. Since i live in an apartment building, i have to buzz them in, so it stresses me out a bit making sure my phone is with me constantly from 12pm on, while i'm at work, that's even harder! but it's worked out so far!
109	Undeniable that Valentine is very charming while dating and up to and including the sales transaction.\n\nWait till you meet their service team, which seemingly is the most important part in maintaining and adjusting a mechanical being.\n\nJust picked my '11 XC70 up from its oil change and asked that an estimated mm of brake pad remaining be noted.....oh yes, Valentine did take the measure and chiseled me for $40 to do so. Toyota has never done this to me in 12 years AND Hyatt Infiniti did not stoop this low.\n\nThe Valentine service team is and will continue to kill the front end sales. Whilst I was being skinned for $40 my fantastic salesperson Patrick was asking for new business as my lease will expire in Q1\/14.\n\nSorry Valentine - we are breaking up in April because of poor service and short sighted thinking....take my $40 now as it is the last money you will receive from me. Volvo is a good product, but suffers from a monopolistic set up for dealers. Word is that Volvo might be the next brand ceasing sales in Canada due to depressed volumes
110	Liked the lunch specials, only wish I had time and appetite for the late happy hour!  Friendly service. Plenty of food at fair price. Sit at the sushi bar to watch him make the rolls!
111	\"A Night at the Roxbury\" of Japanese restaurants.  The music is so loud, unfortunately it's the main take-away.  Perhaps it's not as bad on any night other than Friday or Saturday for dinner. It's a beautiful space and the food is pretty good.  I would give them another try if it weren't for fear of leaving deaf and hoarse again.
112	Janet's is absolutely adorable. The inside ambiance is hip, fresh, and somewhat rustic. There is a patio where you can sit outside and enjoy views of Black Mountain and a flush of cacti. Every weekend there is live music. \n\nI tried the loaded oatmeal-it was divine. You can choose what you want on it. This selection includes fruit, berries, nuts, granola, and a number of sweeteners. I would highly recommend coming here!
113	On Thursday, Aug. 18th, I had the pleasure of visiting Alexander Michael's for dinner.  This was probably the fifth or sixth time I have eaten at this local neighborhood gem, and I can assuredly tell you, this Alexander Michael's experience was just as good as the first.\n\nMy date and I walked in pleasantly surprised that despite the warm, quiet, lazy, summer evening outside, Alexander Michael's was cool, dark, and very lively on the inside.  We were directly escorted to a table in the cozy restaurant, just behind the bar.  \n\nMy date ordered the chicken pita with fries (I've taken a picture of it), I ordered the craw fish bake (see pic).  The bake was a cross between a shrimp pasta and a seafood casserole.  It was perfectly gooey and cheesy - but not heartstoppingly so.  As for my date's pita; she loved it.  I had a few bites and can attest to its legitimacy.  Both OUR MEALS WERE EXCELLENT!!  \n\nI am truly of fan of this elegant and intimate Charlotte jewel. To me, Alexander Michael's is a place where you can get elegant, all-american bar food, but with an upscale twist.  If you haven't been to Alexander Michael's - GO!  If you've already been, GO AGAIN!!
114	Best Mexican food in Vegas! Fajitas were amazing- homemade tortillas- delish sopapillas- stellar service. 5 stars all the way
115	I'd already eaten and can only comment on what I saw.\n\nThinking now of the faults of Nyood's decor, it has everything to do with lighting, which is actually done really well and helps to connect the \"restaurant\/lounge\" together in theme. Unfortunately, this also exposes its budgetary flaws.\n\n- The chandelier, though copied, is a good example of saving and DIY. Downstairs, a large mass of cords - all spray painted black - is jumbled in a messy knot at the top and untangled at the ends to spread light. Upstairs, smaller, single corded versions provide enough light for the setting.\n\nNyood is a newish combo restaurant (downstairs) and lounge (upstairs). The decor is DIY in a monochromatic black-to-white theme that appears to aim toward crisp class, but fails in the details. I'm not a decorator by any means, but even to an untrained eye the aesthetics appear as a meek effort to save. It's so close, but no cigar. \nHere's why:  \n- The exposed bricks along one wall have been haphazardly painted white and fronted by cheap, white bookshelves. Their asymmetric, horizontal separators display false, white, book props and small, brown, wicker baskets that presumably hold nothing and look to be purchased en mass from the dollar store. This wall alone reminds me of when a friend was on a reality show to makeover her room on a budget. The TV version was nice, but a useless and fragile farce from up-close. The wall is pretty from a diner's standpoint, I guess? But for me, I just saw aesthetics on a budget.\n- The Twitter feeds projected on two different walls could also be more useful. This reminds me of bars in japan or iraq where bluetooth devices are set to detect single persons. So a tweeter tweets about a cute 30-something across the room, that is not so large to begin with since obviously the tweeter can see said cute tweetee? Then there's the table of two I watched not speak and only text on their respective devices, maybe to that cutie? There's potential in technology + decor, but it's missed when a tweet communicating the need to re-light a candle around the same time ours went out, didn't result in ours being set aflame again. \n\n- By far the best budget DIY design of Nyood was upstairs. Twice, yarn (!) is used to create create texture. Behind the bar a quote is written with yarn, and when it gets tired can probably, easily be changed. On the opposing wall, in front of the DJ booth, criss-crossed yarn creates a nice effect to detract from another cheaply executed, yet, nice-from- the-other-side-of-the-room, mosaic of 2x2 scraps painted white.\n\n- Sure, the food looked pleasant but I'm glad I ate before I went to Nyood. Call me a pessimist, but something usually has to give. \n\nChristine \"just a note\"-ed me that Roger Mooking is head chef. Good for you, dude I just googled. I virtually always side with the kitchen. \n\nI'm much more interested in investor relations, since that's where support does or doesn't happen for the kitchen. Even with the most creative leveraging, the givens are: slow table turnover, too many paid  staff, rent, equipment, and decor... decor, food, crop crop crop. \n\nI won't go back to try the food despite good reviews on Yelp because decor was also positively rated. No offense to the BOH. \n\nAnd, I got a weak pour of wine.
116	My car was filthy. I don't think I had washed it in over a year, it had a second skin of tree droppings and bird poop. Waiting to get into the bay, the 3 cars ahead of me in line were utterly spotless, but I think that speaks more to the car washing mentality of Calgary.\n\nI like how you can pay for use of the machine with your credit card, but after leaving I have no idea how much it cost me as I was in there awhile power washing the artistic musings of birds off my roof.\nAlso, the foam brush was really messy, It started oozing everywhere and ran down the handle dying my hands and white t-shirt a shade of iridescent blue. \nI also didn't notice any mechanisms for drying the car, but it is very possible I just overlooked it, or you have to pull out and sham wow the hell out of your paint job.\n\nPerhaps the drive through car washes attached to Esso or Shell may be a better bet for one less inclined to work for their clean car, and it does get blown dry. I wish I could compare the cost to work ratio, but that will have to wait until my credit card statement arrives next month.\n\nHighlights were that my dog did enjoy the water being blasted at his face from behind the glass and the employee at the office stared at me weird as I drove out of the bay making me think for a moment that I forgot to pay or perhaps had hooked the foam hose through my rear axle.\n\nSure got that bird poop off my car though.
117	We have been members close to a year. There are plenty of cardio machines available and the sauna is great after a workout. I wish they had wifi available. We have have also made use of the child care services and my daughter seems to enjoy her time in there. I do wish they would have two staff members in the child care center, but I guess it's hard for them to gauge how many kids they will have each week. Overall, we are happy that we've switched out membership to this gym.
118	Solid brunch place, but fellas, make sure you dress read the dress code before coming in here! We had reservations to take our friend out for her birthday, and since it was still in the 100s during the summer, my fiance wore a tank top. There's a clear sign on the door that gentleman are not allowed to wear tank tops and we were crossing our fingers hoping that we wouldn't be kicked out. Luckily the hostess let us know that we could keep our reservation, he would just have to work an oversized tall and long white tee. In my opinion, he looked ridiculous in it and much more inappropriate, but at least we got in and had a good laugh. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here for brunch, whether its Eggs Benedict or French Toast or Croque Madame. I would recommend trying to make reservations through Open Table and eating outside on a nice summer morning.
119	I think my first visit to Mickies' was in 1992. Was the founder of Yelp even born yet?! We didn't have much of a wait on UW Spring Break Saturday morning. And Monroe Street was torn up for construction, so it was a task just getting there, perhaps keeping away the less than hearty trekkers. \n\nSome might call Mickies a greasy spoon, except for it's impeccably clean! It's a classic diner, and breakfast is their specialty. Go for breakfast and amuse yourself- it's worth the wait. \n\n- Banana Nut pancakes- a huge order and very yummy\n- Corned Beef Hash scrambler- my dining partner loved her dish!\n- Coffee was nice and bold, and refilled often by our server and others\n\nService is great, and breakfast was affordable, and afforded me two meals. I'll have to come back just for a milkshake. \n\nWhat a Madison institution, thanks for not changing a bit, Mickies Dairy Bar!
120	try the pho is super good!! i feel like a food critic but im qualified because i was a chef :) this place is a legit vietnamese food restaurant! for that reason reason they get 5stars from me Alex P
121	Worst experience in scottsdale. \nThings I'd rather do than go to the Apple Store\n1. Go vegan\n2. Ride a honey badger\n3. Lay on asphalt in august\n4. Spend a day in a scottsdale jail\n5. Go to the dentist\n6. Walk to Tucson. \n7. Eat ghost peppers \n8. Poop a Buick \n\nThe store manager is a joke. Not fit to run a lemonade stand despite his alleged 11 years with Apple. \nIt's amazing how rude a manager can be when on the phone instead of face-to-face. \n\nI won't EVER step foot in that place again. \nBuy Samsung.
122	I'm totally crushin' on Yogurty's. Like, to the point where I want to send it secret notes that read AVITANIA + YOGURTY'S = LOVE 4 EVA. \n\nOf the FroYo joints that have popped up in Toronto as of late, Yogurty's is the only one that comes close to competing with the chain that's nearest n' dearest to my heart, Yogurtland in California. The consistency of the FroYo at Yogurty's is consistently silky smooth and light (but still being substantial). This is in contrast to Toronto's other popular FroYo stops like Menchie's (large ice crystals in the yogurt), and Yogurt Spoon (slightly runny). The selection of flavors is large, and includes Tart (my favorite; it's a little milder than most \"tart\" FroYos), Honey, Chocolate, etc. The Vanilla is rather cloying, though. \n\nI also like the huge topping bar at Yogurty's, which includes the usual staples: fresh fruit, sprinkles, fruity popping boba, chocolate chips, cereal, etc. However, they also have options I haven't seen anywhere else, like River Rock candy (which I think is a little gross, but hey, it's your sundae), chocolate-covered pretzels and Cookie Dough. You got that right. COOKIE M'FING DOUGH. Nom, nom, nom. They also have a \"cheesecake\" topping that you put on to your FroYo with a scoop, but to me it looks like egg salad, so I pass on it. \n\nThe bins for the dry goods at the topping bar (cereal, candy chips, etc) are rather small -- which is good since they have to be replaced\/replenished often, but also bad because they get a little difficult to maneuver around, and as a result the floor around them always seems a bit sticky. \n\nThe price is a little bit higher than similar shops, but it's worth it for the bacchanalian selection of yogurty deliciousness at your fingertips.
123	Sorry but I have to defend this place and no I don't work here.  I am a Scottsdale business owner who has been eating here for about a year regularly.  The manager and owner is the nicest woman on the planet and remembers her customers names every time they come in.  They are also the only Chinese restaurant I know of that is moderately priced that uses all white meat chicken.  Some of their items like their orange chicken I am not crazy about but their chow mein is awesome and most of their dishes are pretty darn good.  I can only imagine that most of your story is fabricated around the fact that she asked you to pay the difference and your too cheap to pay it.  To say their food is bad because you can't afford a dollar more to upgrade to the next dish is pretty low.  Maybe you should try running your own business and offer low prices in tough economic times and then have cheapskates ask for a free meal.  Don't let this homer fool you the manager is as nice as can be and this is a good Chinese place with very reasonable prices.
124	Easy parking near the theater.  Seats are adequately comfortable.   Air is kept at a good temp.  Overall this theater offers a very good movie experience.
125	Every Christmas marks the time that I venture over to Great Harvest for gifts of baked goods.  I usually go to the location on Marks in Henderson because it's near my job, but this store is actually closer to where I live.  The best thing about Great Harvest?  The free slice of bread you can get when you step inside a store, with butter if you want it; of course I want the butter!  I love bread, but I can't come here as much as I'd like or I wouldn't fit through their door before too long.  I like their products as gifts because everyone I've ever gifted their goods to has loved them, as well.  The cinnamon crunch bread is one of my favorites, but I also love the pumpkin chocolate chip loaf.  The cookies that they sell are a nice, big size with the snickerdoodle ones a fave, too.  If you ever need a carb fix, stop here and get yours.
126	I love the calm and relaxing vibe. This place has very helpful staff. They are friendly and take great care in making your drink exactly the way you or I want it. They have the best chi tea. Its a great place. The new owner is always around and she makes sure everyone is getting the best possible service.
127	Even though they've moved, the food hasn't changed and that is a good thing (seco de res and lomo a caballo - mmmmmmm).  I like the new space with its booths and non-stop futbol.  More than one server is also a plus.
128	Does anyone remember the oscar taylors upper crust bakery cake named Sussex \nI'm sure I'm spelling this incorrectly.
129	We visited this joint.  He ambiance was nice.  The food is good but not great. Service was excellent.  We had a burger that was charred , my wife complained even though we had eaten most of it. Next thing we know the manager is over and asking how they can fix it.  We said it was fine since we had eaten most of it. They gave us a free desert because of the charred meat patty.
130	Pad Thai with shrimp no spice and Mongolian beef was delicious.  The hostess\/server was friendly and comforting.
131	Oh, no \n\n\nOh, no no no no no. \n\n\nYou know those rare occurences when you go to a restaurant, sit down, peruse the menu and settle for something, even though it wasn't what you really wanted?\n\nYou know those odd times when you get the food put in front of you and from the first bite you know immediately something is tasting wrong, doesn't taste very good at all actually, but yet you keep eating anyway?\n\nEver had it happen where an hour after you finish the meal you know you had no business eating you feel like your insides are fighting back from the absolute toxic nastiness you have forced upon your body?\n\nYeah....you know exactly what I am talking about.  Ghostly bile is forming in your throat now as you remember a meal just like this. \n\nPizza Palace may have turned me off of calzones for life. \n\n...other than that the service was decent and the decor was expected Vegas-themery.  The prices seemed a little high for the horrid sludge they put in front of you but then again I don't usually like to pay to be sick to my stomach.
132	This Cost Plus location seems more spacious and spread out than the Tempe Marketplace location which is nice. Selection is similar and their clearance holiday items were very tempting. If you sign up to be on their frequent customer list you always seem to get some kind of coupon or discount you are able to use, plus you get a special discount on your birthday month! The selection in general is great for home goods, food and wine, and decorations. Where else can you get Spanish chorizo, a can of mushy peas, and decide between 3 different types of harissa all in one spot? :)
133	My wife and I went there for dinner and was it was quite dissappointing. We were seated by the hostess when we arrived and was told our server would be right over. 10 minutes later I had to go back to the hostess and asked if anyone was going to take our order. Our waitress finally showed up to our table apologizing. My wife had the eggplant parmigiana and I had the chicken parmigiana. My dish was ok but nothing to write home about. My wife's dish consisted of a lot of breading and little or no eggplant. A very tasteless dish. We've been to Nello's before and had their pizza. It was excellent. I'll give them a mulligan on the no waitress. It could have easily been a miscommunication. We'll definitely go back but will stick with pizza but stay away from their entrees.
134	Love love love this amazing baby boutique. They have many organic products and items made in the U.S.A. Plus the cutest and hippest kids clothes in town. The owner was the sweetest lady who loves what she does. I've never had so much fun shopping for a baby gift. :-) I will be back and will recommend this great store to friends and family.
135	Absolutely the best frozen yogurt in the valley. I have been to every single froyo joint in town and Yogurtland is by far my favorite! I would recommend it to all!
136	Hey toi! Oui toi! Tu n'est jamais venu a St-Hubert? Alors il faut que tu esseye le Benny! Super poulet le meilleur du coin, leur secret; la sauce. Pas la sauce de benny co. qui goûte l'eau de vaisselle. La VRAI sauce benny. Tu file pas pour du chicken ben pogne la poutine c'est sa coche. Tu file santé, un go pour la salade full mayo avec des pti poid.\nCheers!!!
137	Sure you're pushing $7 a slice after tax on a piece of pepperoni pizza, but guess what? You're totally getting 2.5 slices in one. \n\nNot only that, but it's a damn good crust and requires far less of a hike than Secret Pizza if you are just wandering the strip! Located right outside of Planet Hollywood. Extra easy if you're intoxicated and feel the challenge of distance is too great to overcome. \n\nThey serve Diet Pepsi products and of course, Red Bull and beer. Not sure what type of Vegas establishment this would be otherwise...
138	A+ for location and accessibility. Always a good. Bartenders are the coolest. Can't go wrong with dollar games!!
139	My mom and I canvassed \"downtown\" for all of 5 minutes early Saturday evening for a new favorite eatery to share some Christmas cheer, but it would have to be divine food ... nothing less.  We didn't notice it was a restaurant at first but stopped in to check.  Mom requested to see the menu while still in the car ... we are quite serious about good food and accept no substitutes.  Well ... WE FOUND IT AT 157!  We are sure that you will, too.\n\nENJOY!  (And please provide a review )
140	Today's two star review is based on the location not the food, however I'll give the franchise a quick little intro. I first heard of this place in Toronto, so as myself, for those of you who did not know of their previous locations on the west coast, this restaurant kind of popped up out of nowhere and created a huge hype increasingly fast! \n\nTo briefly describe it, I would call Captain Boils an elevated version of the Red Lobster. The restaurant is Louisiana inspired serving options of seafood favourites in different options of flavours and heat! You sit at a table covered in plastic, provided gloves and plastic bibs and your food comes out in plastic bags which you can order by the pound. I would recommend this place for the seafood lovers who are looking for a fun and casual place to eat seafood at a decent cost!\n\nMontreal recently opened two new locations, one here and one in Chinatown on St-Laurent. I had originally reserved dinner of 12 for my Sister in-laws birthday. The day of, I happened to pass the new location on St-Catherines which appeared more bright and spacious compared to the smaller, darker location in Chinatown.\n\nI walked into an empty restaurant and was quickly greeted by the excited employees who instantly passed me a menu explaining that they had just opened 3 days ago. I advised them of my reservation at the first location and told them I'd be interested in bringing the dinner there instead. The waiter suggested a few tables and then told me he had something better, \"The VIP room\" at the back! Intriguing as it had sound considering the celebration, I took a quick look.\n\nIt was all the way at the back of the restaurant and was a private, intimate room surrounded by glass! I thought it was beautiful, but was a bit curious as to how the sound of conversation would be in a glass room. Nevertheless I took it! Excited to show my girlfriend what was planned for her sister, we get there and the groups reaction definitely wasn't what I imagined it would be. \n\nThe floors were dirty with debris from the renovations (Which my sister in laws best friend mentioned earlier to the staff to clean up!) and the back room had a slight scent of garbage which I assume was behind the door that was in the room. The speaker in the room had also stopped working from when I was there earlier so there was absolutely no sound. In addition to this, each of us were echoing every time we spoke. So we end up choosing a table out in the restaurant instead.\n\nWe are seated at a new table and my girlfriend decides to order two bottles of wine to start (between 7 of us) as we waited for the others to get there. The waitress comes over and we order two bottles of \"Kim Crawford\", the waitress replies \"I just want to let you know that the price of that bottle is incorrect. It should say $39!\" (Shown on the menu as $22). My girlfriend educates her that by law and also proper customer service etiquette, that whatever price a product is published at should be honoured at that price. After 10 minutes of a blank stare off, she asked the manager and advised us that they will sell the bottles at the price on the menu.\n\nWe proceed with the two bottles we ordered, followed by ordering pretty much two of everything on the menu. Once the rest of our guests arrive we attempted to order another 4 bottles and was told by staff that they were \"sold out\" mind you they opened two days ago and haven't had much traffic at all (Said by the employee earlier that day). We then question how they could be sold out already and the waiter explained that's what he was told.\n\nThe waitress who had told us the price was incorrect to begin with came over to confirm that they were indeed sold out. Followed by a smart remark from the first waiter \"Look guys we're NOT lying\". Finally the \"manager\" comes to the table (I assume not communicating with the first two) and openly admitted to us that they did have bottles but didn't want to sell anymore to us at the price they honoured earlier.\n\nEnd of the story food was good, staff need to be educated on customer service and properly trained. With service like this, can definitely ruin a good establishment!
141	Worst service ever!!!! Drinks stayed empty, server ignored us and one person in our party got the wrong order.
142	Great service! Great quality! Amazing prices! I've never had a bad experience here. I've been to every shop that he's ever opened for the last couple years. Always get treated with the best customer service anyone could ask for.  This shop has everything you need to get the job done.  He can set you up with competition system or just a minor system, just all depends what you want.  I will always come back to this shop!
143	Went here for lunch today and I'm so happy that I did!\n\nThink this restaurant is fairly new so there were not a lot of people there.  Besides us, there were two other tables, both spanish speaking.  Good sign!\n\nWe sat down and they bought out fried dough.  It's equivalent to funnel cakes without the powder sugar.  Was delicious and freshly fried.\n\nI ordered the beef steak that came with rice, two over easy eggs, sweet plantains, french fries, lettuce and tomato.  That was $12.  It was very tasty.  Love the seasoning.\n\nMy partner had the 1\/2 rotisserie chicken with french fries and a side salad.  That was $9.  He wasn't even hungry when I dragged him in there but he ate like he was ravished.... meaning... it was very delicious.  I had a few pieces and wished I had ordered two entrees instead of just one.  They also bought out a home made hot sauce for dipping.  Chicken was great with it.\n\nThe menu is pretty diverse.  There was a huge soup and seafood sections.  While there I saw a guy ordered some type of soup with noodles and it came out in a huge bowl.  Looked really good especially for such a cool day.  I will definitely try the soup next time I'm there.  Menu was reasonably priced.  \n\nAtmosphere was OK and food was GREAT.  This will go into one of our regular restaurant rotation.  So excited that I found this place and can't wait to go back with friends.
144	Typical HK tea cafe restaurant with a rather large number of menu items.  I had the tomato sauce baked seafood rice set lunch, which included a drink (HK lemon iced tea was my pick) and a borscht soup (the HK tomatoey variety, not to be confused with the Russian borscht soup which is made with beets), for $7.95.  It was ok - good but not overwhelmingly good.  My aunt had the Singapore (? - looks like it was stir-fried with curry powder) kwai teow and it was pretty good - tasty but not overly oily and the texture of the kwai teow was just right: not too dry and not too overdone\/soggy.  I should have had the fish ball noodle soup ($3.95 for a bowl) - just a feeling that the Chinese menu items are probably better than the \"western\" style stuff (baked rice, pasta, etc.).  The HK lemon iced tea was very good though (good tea flavor, not over sweetened, with good amount of fresh slices of lemon).  This place is great for afternoon tea (light snack) and for late night bites - reliable HK food on a budget.  I wouldn't mind coming back to try other items on the menu.
145	Fun  and festive is how I'd describe the atmosphere inside Sabai Sabai on Song Kran day.  It was like being at home in Thailand.  Traditional music really set the tone of what was to come that evening.\n\nThe eight course dinner was out of this world.  I cannot imagine the amount of preparation that went into this.  Spicy Lao Beef Jerky, Green Mango Salad, Sweet and Sour Crispy Noodle, Lettuce Wrapped Grilled Mackerel, Hot and Sour Beef Soup, Chicken Salad (Laap Gai), Grilled Northern Thai Sausage, and Crispy Snapper Panang Curry.  Each dish was bursting with flavor.  I could taste the freshness of the herbs and the care that Chef Nuit put into it.  I enjoyed everything, but the Spicy Lao Beef Jerky, Hot and Sour Beef Soup and Grilled Northern Thai Sausage stood out the most.  \n\nThe Grilled Northern Thai Sausage, especially, was superb.  The aroma from the lemongrass and kaffir leaves sent me back to night market in Chiang Mai.  I wonder if Chef Nui takes special orders, because I have a Significant Other who is obsessed with this particular style of sausage.\n\nThen ... there was a Thai Dessert Buffet that fit for a King.  Thong Yot, Foi Thong, Thai Egg Custards and many more.  This course will probably add couple of inches to my waist, but who cares ... I'll just have to work harder at the gym.  It was worth it.\n\nThe entire Sabai Sabai Team had really outdone themselves.  Awesome feast, casual and fun atmosphere, it was the perfect place to ring in the New Year.
146	What I knew: beer. Pilsner, ales, stouts. Brewed here. Cocktails.\nWhat I assumed: upper scale bar snacks like olives and almonds.\nWhat I guessed: dinner menu, on the chalkboard.\nWhat surprised me: the second floor terrasse. \n\nLate night noshing meant that some of the main entrees were fini. But the fish and chips were calling my hangry tummy. Arriving 10 or so minutes later, presented on a wooden board with a spread of tarter sauce, mayo and ketchup -- I shut up and stuffed my face full. \n\nA lively feel upstairs, we were surrounded by folks doing Irish Car Bombs (although, this is not that kind of place), mixed with giggles and laughter brought on by a mixed crowd. Hipster aloof is what I was expecting from the service, but what we found was friendly guys who were on the ball and whipping up some pretty stellar drinks. \n\nWould I go back for beers and brunch? Uh, is my name Crystal H?
147	While on vacation, we stopped in for breakfast and had a fantastic experience!  The food was fresh, and the service was friendly and attentive.  My breakfast sandwich ingredients were high quality and of the same prices you would pay for fast food.  The coffee bar was extensive with different flavors, spices, and additions.  Excellent!
148	The fact this restaurant has 4 stars boggles my mind. The service and atmosphere is great but the food, unfortunately was a let down. \n\nWe were recommended this place by a friend because of how much my bf loves french dips. We figured for $19 and the rave reviews it would be a great sandwich. If you love bread, not a lot of meat and sub par au jus, then this would be the sandwich for you. I've had plenty of better french dips at local bars, for half the price. We also requested extra crispy french fries, which came out pretty soggy.\n\nI ordered the thai steak salad. I LOVE thai everything, but this salad was just a smorgasbord  of clashing flavors. The filet in my salad was also very salty. Not a very well thought out dish, was only able to eat half of it. \n\nAll in all, not worth the price. Disappointing.  Won't be back.
149	There are but a few things I can eat over and over and never get sick of, and one of them is the Broiled Chicken Salad from Pita Jungle. Ohh...my....GOD it is the best thing ever!!!!! I want to give it an award! It's the most simple salad I've ever seen but every ingredient is fresh, the chicken is marinated in what I can only assume to be GOLD, and the lemon vinigarette is incredible. Plus, it's an actual \"healthy\" salad, not typical these days where the caloric content of a restaurant salad reaches into the 1000s. \n\nI've tried other dishes here, too, but when I find something I love, i stick to it. It's not that I'm a picky eater. I eat pretty much everything. But I'm just loyal to what I love.  The Lavosh Shwarma wrap is great, too, and big enough to share or keep one half for your next meal. And their hummus is the best I've has anywhere - creamy and totally delish. \n\nPita Jungle is my idea of culinary perfection - healthy, tasty, and affordable. When I've indulged (Read: Delux\/DQ Blizzard\/Z Tejas Frusions) Pita Jungle comes to me and my body's rescue.
150	From the front staff ~ to the doctors, I always feel comforted in knowing I'm receiving very good medical care. And when you go to UC ~ comfort is important as you already feel terrible. My favorite place to go in a pinch.
151	I love love love this place!!!! The food is always fresh and delicuous. The waiters\/waitresses are also friendly and attentive. We always come here a few times during our Vegas trip!
152	2nd time here this week for dinner.   Thought maybe the first time was just an off night, and it's the casinos only option for late night dining.  Staff here is EXTREMELY SLOW!!!   Don't expect to see a waiter for at least 20 minutes after being seated, and don't expect a refill of your beverage. No matter how busy they are no one moves faster than a snails pace.
153	This salon will blow you away!  Not only are they a fun, hip and visually inviting place, but their knowledge of hair and customer service will leave you speechless.  I have not had my hair cut in far too long because after 11 years in Charlotte I could not find a place I looked forward to going to.  Well, now I have!  When I arrived I was greeted by Tayler and Kyle (salon owners) and offered a beverage and a tour - I expected a bottle of water.  Nope - local beer on tap or a mimosa drink of the day... um, yes please! :)  They are so thorough in the education of their clients about hair and are obviously passionate about what they do.  They give you a menu of the wash house experience you prefer and are escorted to a dimly lit and relaxing room for a shampoo and awesome scalp massage.  My haircut and style were great and Ashley was fun to talk with.  On the way out Kyle walked me to my car covered with an umbrella because it was drizzling.  He literally wouldn't leave until my door was closed so I didn't get a raindrop on my hair.  I can not say enough about this place and the wonderful people who work there.  They just celebrated their 1 year anniversary - I will certainly be back and will send everyone I know there!!
154	After having their service for about a year, we sold our home. We never would have signed a three year contract knowing we were selling in a year. They scammed me into it and when I told them I sold it they said too bad, pay! I talked to Ken, who understood and said \"I would not pay either if I did not own it, I'll take care of it\". He took care of it by sending me to collections. I told him I am a disable;ed veteran on a fixed income from the VA. He apparently did not care. Their service is nothing to talk about either. We changed modems and ended up with a new phone number and had no connection for six weeks, shouldn't they have known we had no connection? I only knew because the alarm went off from opening a window and got no call. Good luck if you use them. Thank goodness none broke in during this time. I understand if I knowingly signed a contract I would be obligated to finish it,  but I did not knowingly. Scammers! DO NOT TELL ME YOU WILL TAKE CARE OF IT AND SEND ME TO COLLECTIONS! I did everything I could including getting the new owners to sign with them. DO NOT TRUST THEM!  RUN.
155	We have been going to El Chorro for over 10 years we are from Chicago.  So when our friends came to visit that was the place we wanted to take them for the beautiful restaurant and view.  Well our\/their experience was not very pleasant.  First we were the first person to walk in the door at 4:00 and we were told we could only sit inside or at the one table outside that seats 18 people, so needless to say we sat at that table.  I explained to hostess that we were just having cocktails and appetizers but she stated all tables were reserved.  Ok so after sitting in the sun on the most uncomfortable seats and after appetizers and cocktails we decided we would like to have more food so we wanted dinner.  I went to the hostess and was told we could not get a table.  So mind you the restaurant had many many tables empty all the while we were there (3 hours). So we asked to speak to manager (my husband would not eat dinner at that uncomfortable table\/chair) the manager came over and could care less, he stated they had reservations and there is nothing he could do and walked away.  My friends hated the attitude of staff and we were very embarrassed, all these empty tables and we could not enjoy a meal.  So not sure if I can get my friends back there, not a good experience.  Very disappointed.
156	Came in here with a friend interested in buying a dog.\n\nThey were busy, like usual.\n\nFirst thing i noticed was that the dogs all were asleep or sad looking. it didnt look as if they were getting out of the cages. There was poop all over the cages and most of them had not been cleaned, about 65% were filthy. It made me sad for them. I hate dirty cages and would hate to have to sit on my own poop. \n\nWe asked to take out a dog. The lady employee couldnt even tell us what type of dog it was, she had to go look twice. Then she brought us the wrong dog and we had to correct her. Finally, she brought the correct dog..  it was very excited and then was super loving and calm. It was a weenie dog, priced at 1200. Not bad, had its first round of shots and pure breed papers. It had gorgeous coloring, grey and black.\n\nAs we continued to look there were two employees in their early twenties running around the store smacking each others butts with towels. Very unprofessional. It really upset me and its the main reason why we left\n\nHow about cleaning the animal cages instead of acting like children?! Will never buy a dog from here. I'd rather go to the shelter.
157	Just tried it for the first time. Got the breakfast sampler, which could be enough for 2, and food was very good. Everything was cooked the way I had ask. Didn't like that I was charged 1.35 for the one small cup of coffee I had. I just figured it would come with the meal.\nBut that is my only complaint. I recommend trying it out.
158	之前一直在肖医生这里做按摩，这次脖子扭到的了，本来不想做针灸的，结果做了，没想到效果出奇的好，本来脖子很痛的，现在舒缓了很好。还是很开心的。店里的环境也很好，工作人员也很细心耐心，非常好的体验。
159	This place has the worst customer service! I went there recently to buy several pounds of salmon. I asked if they had any that was not \"color enhanced\" and the fishmonger kept switching up which of the two types was not color enhanced. He did it four times before I started to suspect he was either clueless, super confused, or having an inside joke at my expense. Either way he clearly did not care about my business.  While he was playing \"eenie meenie miny moe\" with the fish, his co-worker walked right in front of me and stood there between me and the fish display (which was only about 6 inches) to weigh a tomato. She did not say excuse me or apologize but her aggressive action forced me to step back or get hit. I promptly left. I will not be back. And it won't be just because of the smell of sick fish that knocks you over when you first walk in.
160	These retail  ass clowns get no stars as far as I am concerned. They advertise computer repair services so I lug my desktop up there. At store Im told that they are not doing repairs until further notice. They dont offer any alternatives they the store manager and the repair manager just stand there like dolts with mouth open. They dont even offer to take my name so customer service can call me. No wonder they are closing those stores a dozen a day. Go to best buy.
161	I stayed here for the first time during my recent visit.\nMy friend that I came with is actually a regular.\n\nThe hotel is spacious, bright, clean, welcoming and pretty to look at.\nGood place for those of you who don't like casinos, cause this is a hotel only.\n\nPrices are fair and reasonable.\nRooms are spacious.\nBeds, pillows and blankets are super comfortable.\nBathrooms are huge, love the walk in shower and hot tub.\nThey offer complimentary hygiene kit if requested. Comes with toothbrush, toothpaste, and comb.\nOur room came with a mini fridge.\nAnd a kitchenette stocked with cooking supplies and utensils and cups if you wanted to cook.\nComplimentary coffee and water! Always need water!\n\nNot to mention that we learned that Trump Hotel has their OWN DRIVERS!\nBut there's not too many available, but if you can get one, they'll take you anywhere you choose, and you pay them depending on how much you think you should, not by mileage, which is awesome as well.\n\nOverall, I had an enjoyable stay.\nNot the fanciest place, but very very nice accommodations.
162	Excellent Ethiopean Cuisine!  By far, the best we've found in the Valley!  If you've never had the extreme pleasure of enjoying a traditional Ethiopean meal, then this by far is the restaurant to begin your journey into the cuisine... it is astounding.  I would venture to say, that the Zegeye Family's offerings should be the level at which Valley of the Sun Ethiopean restaurants should be measured by.  We thoroughly enjoyed everything we had.  We started with Asmara Beer and fabulous Ethiopean Honey Wine.  As appetizer, we enjoyed a wonderful rendition of the Sambussa, a green lentil, green peppers stuffed pastry.  I started with their tasty Green Lentil Soup of green lentils, onions, carrots and spices.  To best avail ourselves of multiple tastes, we dined with the Abyssinia Signature Platter sampler with Doro Wat, lamb tibs, spicy beef, white peas, lentils, tickle gomen, chickpeas and fosolia (green beans).  I cannot but express how tastefully done and the tenderness of each of the incredible servings offered on this platter.  This is a must eatery for Ethiopean food lovers, or if you've never had Ethiopean, the place to try it out for the first time!  By far our place to return to.  Congratulations to the Zegeye Family for both sharing their heritage and their kitchen to those of us in the Valley.
163	Since the food in Vegas is marked up a gazillion percent, we decided that one nice meal out was all we could afford while in town. Le Cirque in the Bellagio was a wise choice. It was a perfect blend of fine dining and fun. \n\nI started with the lobster salad which was phe-nom. We were told that people come here from all over JUST for this salad and I could see why. The beef tip that I ordered was good but a little dry... I had mistakenly approved medium well thinking that he had said medium, so that was probably more my fault than anything else. The best part of the meal was the dessert. I am a chocolate lava cake connoisseur and I have to say that the one I had here was the best I've had yet, even surpassing Shadowbrook's in Capitola (which is very hard to do)! \n\nI will also note that I tried my friends truffle risotto, wow....if I had to do it over again I might have passed up the lobster salad and gone for this dish. It seemed almost impossible for something to taste so damn good. \n\nThe decor is festive and fun with a colorful circus theme. The service was impeccable and well timed the way it should be. My only complaint was that the server pulled out all the stops to sell this seasonal champagne cocktail that didn't do much for me; it tasted like any other effervescent drink and since he raved about it I expected greatness. \n\nIf you're in Vegas and have some money to spend on a nice dinner, this is a great choice.
164	The team of sales reps at KLAS are the best. Very knowledgable. They know the Vegas marketplace. Thank you for the great exposure KLAS!!!
165	HORRIBLES services. N'ont aucun sense de service à clientèle , serveuse hostile et pas aimable du tout . Bonne chance si vous y allez !
166	Absolutely love this place!!!! They have reasonable prices with great offers to save you money. Amy is such a sweetheart and helped us out with making our moving experience less stressful! She showed us where our unit was, gave us a dolly to use and told us if we needed any help to let her know. I would recommend life storage to anyone.
167	Food is absolutely delicious and also well priced considering the fresh homemade ingredients and the certainly ample portions! Went with my mom and we each started with the soup of the day - lentil - which was creamy and flavorful. It came to the tank at the proper temperature which is important to me with soup. I HAD to try their tzatziki so I ordered a gyro plate (boring, I know) but the lamb was absolutely amazing and very flavorful. The fresh pita was warm and fluffy and I also loved the taboule on the side. The tzatziki, while fresh tasting, is not the best I've ever had. It was good though. My dish also had rice pilaf on the side which I found to be a bit bland but my mom enjoyed it. \n\nMy mom got the special of the day - slow cooked lamb shank. It literally fell off of the bone. She loved it and also enjoyed her fresh pita and grilled veggie medley that came with the dinner. She did not like her rice, but I loved it so we traded. Hers was a mixture of rice, pine nuts, and ground beef. Great!\n\nWould go here again if I was in the area. Place is very cute inside. Only negative for me for the waiter\/possibly owner who stood next to the table while we counted our money for the bill and discussed the tip. Very rude and not appreciated. Otherwise a good experience.
168	I actually had a really great experience with these guys.  I'd been thinking about getting my \"new\" car from Hertz for a while and had been looking at their selection online for a few weeks.  I knew I wanted a Chevy Impala, and I knew I didn't want to spend TOO much money.  The site was easy to work with, and I had plenty of options.\n\nFinally, I called in to make sure they had the car(s) I wanted to see since I didn't want to get there the next day and find no Impala.  Jeffrey assured me that he would have them here, and when we got there, he was available to greet us and show us the cars.  He was great: the situation wasn't ideal, so we (my mom and I) actually had to bring my two kids in with us.  Have you ever gone to buy a car or open a bank account with a two- and five-year-old?  He (along with everyone else there) was very patient with us.  He even offered a marker and paper for my daughter to draw and talked to my son about the game he was playing.\n\nHis patience went beyond the kids, too.  He took us out to see the cars, and he explained to us the differences between the Impalas they had on the lot.  I picked the one I liked, and since this was the first car I was putting under my own insurance, Jeff called my insurance company and told me exactly what I needed to set up and what they needed to fax over to him.  For some reason, the company was having issues with the electronic signing system, and some other complications actually made getting insurance more taxing than getting the actual car.  Go figure!\n\nTo make things more fun (read: complicated), I have a Virginia license, I was buying a car in North Carolina, and I was going to register it in Maryland (where I'd only recently moved).  He and another agent there (whose name eludes me at the moment) worked things out to make it easy on me.\n\nI give it five stars: their goal was to make the entire process as smooth and easy as possible for me.  Mission accomplished!
169	I've been here 3 times, and it seems to get worse with each visit. They never have enough people to make salads and the ones they do have are unhappy to be there, don't speak English, or don't know the items on the salad bar (artichokes & beets look nothing alike and when asking for quinoa - I had to tell them which container it was in). This place has a long way to go!!!
170	These guys should be called Absolute Best People to work with! Super professional group of people who know what their doing and how to get it done with no bull in between.  I highly recommend them to anyone in need of ventilation or flood work. They certainly have a repeat customer in me.
171	Came here with the wife to grab a couple drinks.  I tried their white ale brews, which were decent. Wife had some type of sangria which she said was good.\nWe opted for some appetizers instead of a meal.  I tried the 5 layer nacho dip, which was freakin huge.  The chips and melted cheese came out on what looked like a pizza pie tin. The toppings came on the side,  so it was nice to add what you wanted to the dish.\nWife tried the edamame, which she said was delicious. Our server was friendly enough, and the service was decent.  We were seated right away,  which was a plus.
172	It was my first time at Frilly Lilly and my first time at a salon in Calgary. I came from Ottawa where I had one esthetician of choice so I was nervous for something new. But the girls there made it a wonderful experience,\n\nFelicia was who I had my appointment with and she was just wonderful. She made me feel welcome and relaxed and she is very skilled at what she does. I got the Brazilian wax, which is never pleasant, but I can say for sure she made the experience the best one that I've had. I recommend her to anyone.\n\nThank you Frilly Lilly for making a normally unpleasant experience very enjoyable!
173	Love this beer festival!!\n\nIt was very very hot this year, otherwise I would have had Thor in tow. This is a great, well organized festival, and they have a sister wine festival! How fun! There was a good variety of breweries\/games\/food trucks. Jon B is right, it seems a little small but it really is a fantastic size - small enough not to miss any of the goodies, but big enough that you notice growth and have lots of options! There was a VIP section that had a little more shade and tables to sit down. Having a festival like this in an open lot is great, but tough on people who easily sunburn. Lots of people hiding under beer tents! \n\nI met Yoli at this festival, the bowtie wearing Great Dane and totally fell in love with him. Beer, food trucks, games, Yoli (true love), what more could you need?!
174	So we were in Phoenix for the day and had a lot of plans. Thanks to all the places I've read up on here, I thought we'd have a full day of activities and lots of places to go to. I had plans to pop into IKEA for a little while and we ended up spending the bulk of our time there. \n\nHere's the scenario . . . \n1. we have a house that we've lived in for a few months\n2. we have about a million plans for the house\n3. we don't have a lot of left-over money to do it with\n\nIKEA for us is a life saver. True, you won't buy any sort of heirloom furniture here. If you're looking for that, definitely go elsewhere. But if you want to have a stylishly decorated place, IKEA is a must. Even if you don't buy anything, you get a lot of ideas. I was practically drooling over all their organization choices.\nIf you have them, bring the kids. There is a play area where you can check them into, but I have to tell you that my kiddies had a blast playing in the second floor. They were pretending that each \"room\" was theirs and having make-believe dinners, meetings and parties. \nI also love that the restaurant charges less on account that people have to clear their own table. I'd like that to be the case everywhere else. I'd happily clear my (and everyone else's) table at other restaurants for a lower price. $.99 kids plate, $.50 coffee? Sign me up! \nOverall, I LOVED it. My husband said he felt like sheeple for a while there, but I don't care. I'll take inexpensive, simple and stylish anytime. I also like the whole idea of paying for the plastic bags. I'm writing to the candidates convinced this should be some sort of law.\n\n\nYesterday . . . \n\nmy son: Can we go back to IKEA today?\nme: uh, no.\nmy son: but I need to\nme: you NEED to? why? \nmy son: I want you to make meatballs but we don't have any flags for them\nme: oh. uh, some other day, ok?\nmy son: ok, but we need them ok, that's what makes meatballs taste good. \nme: (laughing) ok
175	Consumer Reports shows American Standard heatpumps as #1.  Air for Less installs American Standard so I went with them.   All work was completed in 4hours and on budget.  I couldn't be happier.  Any negative comments I attribute to competitors that are sore losers.
176	We love this place! We have gone twice.  The first time was for a school family night out,  the second time was for a birthday party. Both times we had a great experience. \nThere is lots to do; wall to wall trampolines,  rock climbing,  Lazer tag, bouncy houses\/ slides, and an arcade area. They charge by the hour for jumping. The first time I went I was skeptical about that being enough time,  but even the kids tired out fast. It's a great work out.\nThe Lazer tag is awesome, with a 2 level playing arena. Fun for kids and kids at heart.\nWhen we went for the school's night out,  they gave discounts for students and their families and donated a portion of their profits to the school. (The school will definitely do this again!)\nThe party set up is great. You get a table right by the trampolines. For an extra fee you can have a party host, but it is not required.\nThe snack bar has pretty standard pricing and a decent selection. The pizza was pretty good, better than bar pizza or Chuck E Cheese. Kinda greasy, but that's just motivation to jump. They also have hot dogs, candy, soda, juice and Gatorade. \nThe little kid area is outstanding. I was pleasantly surprised that it was safe for my 19 month old. She LOVES it! She jumped more than anyone, and they don't charge parents who are just supervising little ones.\nThey also offer military discounts.
177	You know all those \"FREE\" tickets that you see advertising this show? They're not true!\n\nWe had to pay $10 per person to see this show because we were told that the free tickets were sold out. You and I know it wasn't. They just wanted you to pay for tickets.\n\nWe got in right before they were letting people in. The usher directed us to a table but we opted to not have one and just seat closer in front. Good choice. We could see the magic upclose and we didn't have to seat sideways like the people in the tables.\n\nNathan is a good entertainer. He just doesn't focus on his magic, he interacts with his audience as well. It's not a serious show and he doesn't show up in a tuxedo or suit like other magicians do.\n\nWas it worth the $10? Of course! Would I pay more than that? Probably not. A good and cheap Vegas show!
178	Amazing foot massage!!! Can't wait to go back. The place is quiet and dimly lit. Very good customer service. Best bang foe your buck.
179	Along the stretch of road that we Charlotteans call \"Burrito Way\" is of course, the Burrito Factory (which shall be referenced as BF). A shining star in a desert of Central American \"burrito special with rice and beans for $5.95\" restaurants.\n\nA bit like the Californian burrito joints that have gone mainstream like Chipotle and Moe's, BF has a menu board of various meats and recipes already put together, but this is America and if you want to add or remove, you go right ahead.\n\nI opted for the Curry Chicken Burrito and asked for extra tomatoes and onions. It was extremely tasty. For my wife, I got their veggie burrito with extra cilantro and she absolutely loved it.\n\nChips were great - maybe a little thicker than I like. Salsa bar was decent. The pico de gallo was really great - not hot at all. Yum.\n\nI wish this place every success!
180	Manager sucked!!! Bad, skunky and over priced wine. Food ok. Took way too long to come.  Place has a cool set up though. Off the list. Wouldn't go back, wouldn't recommend. Too many other pricey but great steakhouses exist to ever stop again.
181	Since i've moved to Tempe, I decided that I needed to find a new nail place. Taking a short ride around my new place, I found Plesant Nails which is down the road from where i now live. That's pretty cool - I can just walk there. \n\nI have been going there since Mid-August. I feel I have a very good idea of how this place is. \n\nPros \n-Ahn is awesome! She's been doing nails for over 10 years. She's very good at drawing designs. Even the crazy ones that I found online. I get tons of compliments everywhere I go. \n-Chad gives a good pedicure, but sometimes I want to just relax and unwhind and read magazines or the occasional text book, but he talks to me throughout the entire pedicure. I guess its okay, atleast he's funny!\n-They have relaxing music playing in the background and large plasmas playing movies on mute with subtitles. They are more than fine with stopping the music and turning up the sound on the tv if u want them to. \n-Their massaging chairs are awesome! If I had the room, I'd totally buy one!\n-Their lifegel uv gel product is the BEST overlay that I have every ever EVER used. I've had a couple of cracks but Anh has always been able to fix them. They are expen$ive but if you have weak nails like me, its worth it.\n\nCONS\n-After years of traditional dancing from my tribe, I've developed some serious calluses on my feet, especially my heels after my pedicure, I still find myself watching tv while taking a ped egg to my heels on week nights. And that's AFTER the sugar scrub and the callus removal treatment. It often makes me want to skip the pedi entirely.\n-My appointments can last HOURS!! Its not unusal for me to spend 2 hours at the nail shop. Once, I was there for 4 hours! I have to schedule my appointments for days when I don't have class. \n-My average bill is from $80-$120 depending on how elaborate my designs are. I've never spent this much on fills, designs, pedi w\/sugar scrub & designs on the big toes!\n-And finally the ultimate con. They nickel and dimed me. What i mean is, they DO have a menu (its under the clipboard u sign when u walk in) however, when I first went in, they didn't tell me about it. They just said for me to tell them what i wanted and they'd make it happen. Me, not knowing any better said a gel overlay with polish and designs and also a pedicure with polish and designs on the big toes. At the end of the day, I spent over $140. I am always explained my charges at the end of the appointment, however - I'm charged for every single service. I didn't mind - per se until I saw the menu. Everything that i got comprises into two bundles that are significantly cheaper (about $20 less) than what I've been charged for for months now. They never told me about the bundles and have discouraged me from reading the menu this entire time. I finally figured out why! \n\nWith everything added up, i don't know what to think. I love their work - I can TALK to them and we've shared laughs and I love that they are a family business. Its a clean store front and I get nothing but compliments on the quality of my nails.  However, the marathon appointments are hard to make time for in my schedule and the fact that they overcharged me is hard to deal with. \n\nI am a fan, that's why I gave the 4 stars. However, they are NOT as good as it gets! I say, if you decide to go READ the menu and be sure you're not over charged for your services. Know that they take their time and you should plan accordingly or perhaps tell them how much time you have to spend there. But know that your nails are going to be more than pleasant, they are going to be beautiful!
182	I would give this a vote in negatives if it was possible.  The food is absolutely appalling.  For an Indian restaurant where do I begin.  I've had food at road side stalls in my travels through India that were of higher savoury value.  \n\nStart at the beginning, wait time 30 min.  Not bad. Expected for a friday night.  Phone in reservations not possible, walk in only.  Looked around, looked very very clean.  Many servers busting around, which is a good thing.  \n\nGot a seat in the far corner, still not an issue.  Started with the Pani Puri (possibly made in house or outside the servers didn't know).  was pretty good, besides the Pani Puri water being bland.  The vada's were hard enough to be thrown around as balls.  The dhokla was akin to a hard cake.  Dosa on the menu absolutely fab, considering it was made in front of you, but the sambhar that was made prior was inedible.  Too sour, too many spices.  \n\nThe appetizers of fries (in an Indian restaurant, they had fries and pizza...), soggy, the paneer (cottage cheese) tasteless, mushrooms decent and edible, spring rolls were terrible, cottage cheese manchurian were hard pieces that reminded me of dog turd. \n\nSalad...in an Indian restaurant, I had 3 varieties of Pasta incl. macaroni.  \n\nNow the mainstays of food.  The absolutely basics of Indian Vegetarian cuisine were completely destroyed.  Dal Makhani, was watered down, sweet, no kidney beans in it.  The malai kofta...should again be served with the dog turd manchurian as they belonged together. The cottage cheese Shahi Paneer was uncooked.  I left the food on the plate.  It was uneatable. Hell they even messed up the papadam.  It was so thick and hard that I had to use two fingers to break it and had to actually use force to try an bite a piece. Needless to say it was left uneaten.\n\nDesserts. How can one mess up IceCream, i've no idea, but I've had $0.10 mango ice creams at a roadside vendor that was better and creamier.  The butterscotch ice-cream was just butter and no scotch.  How can one mess up Ice Cream...again...I'm flabbergasted.  \n\nThe Rice Pudding was par boiled (over done) rice, just thrown in milk...it was liquid.  An flavourless. \n\nI'd asked the cook what's good \/ special...he laughed and pointed to the raw cut onions and said those are fresh and awesome.  \n\nDid I mention the coke had no fizz?  No co2? They mess up Ice Cream and Coke...\n\nI'd rather go have the appalling burgers at McDonald's rather than this place.  I'd rather stay a tad hungry for a night, than go here again. \n\nWhat a disgrace to one of the largest cuisines in the world.
183	I came here on the recommendation from a resident at my work. I warned him that if I went- I'd write a review. An honest review. Well lets just say 3 stars is being nice because I was undecided between 2 and 3. The outstanding service from our waitress is why it's 3. And because I'd return alone for the chicken wings. A place with wings this good doesn't deserve 2 stars. Go for the garlic parmesan. Although there are a bunch of unique flavors like pineapple curry. (Not that brave) \nWe ordered a meat pie style dish and chicken piccata. \nI'm sorry friend if you're reading this but it was the absolute worst chicken piccata I've ever tasted. The meat pie was decent, but there was not enough meat for the potatoes and veggies.   \nOn a positive note, another thing I'd return for is the Bloody Mary! Oh yeah she hooked it up nice and spicy with olives n all! Well done cute waitress in the 49ers shirt. I won't hold your team against you with bar skills like that! \nIll see you again for wings & drinks!
184	Really enjoyed this place. Got the pad thia and it was very good. Best food at the best price in the Rio.
185	This place is amazing!!!  We tried a little bit of everything and I was not disappointed with anything that we ordered.  The lemonade is sooo good its ridiculous.  And the owner Amer is so nice and friendly.  He checked on us a couple times to make sure that everything was great.  Definetly going to be going back often!!
186	When I think of Ramen, I think of Instant Cup O Noodles or the Pre Packaged ones that you pay like 5 bucks for a big bulk box at Wal Mart.\n\nNot until a friend of my wife mentioned this place that we stopped by to check it out. That's when I found out that this is not your ordinary dollar store ramen. \n\nTheir menu is pretty simple. You pick which noodle bowl you want, choose whatever you want to add to it (like a hard boiled egg for example) for an extra charge of course.\n\nThey also have other items like gyoza (pot stickers) and fried rice.\n\nService is above average and it should be because you can only fit so many people in this tiny place. So slow service with an excuse of \"Sorry, we are really busy today\"  will not fly with me. Memo to those that eat here: Once you're done eating, please pay and move on with your life! I have seen people finish their meal and proceed to just shoot the breeze for another 15 to 20 minutes while you have 6 to 10 people waiting for a spot.\n\nSome random info. Make sure to sign in to your right as soon as you come in so they know who got next. Don't just stand there and expect for them to remember if you came in before somebody else. If you see lots of people outside just standing there, chances are you will be waiting for a bit before getting a table. For those that are chopstick challenged like me, they will not give you a fork unless you ask because you are already given chopsticks by default. All the condiments you need like sesame seeds, soy sauce, etc are right there on your table.\n\nSo you see their operation is simple. It's just that their space might seem constricting especially if you have claustrophobia.
187	CANNOT GIVE ZERO STARS! Man where do I start?!! I decided to move here because I work on the strip and the location was pretty good compared to most places I looked at. The neighborhood is OK, but the gates are broken half the time and sometimes get homeless people jumping out of the dumpsters. The parking is the worst ever! They are so close to each other ur pretty much guaranteed to get ur car door dinged...if u park in the back by the angled parking, most of the time u can't back out because the spots next to you are so close u can't go at an angle, if you go straight back u hit the angled parking, you can't go forward because people park in front of you and it always leaks something...either it's from the pool or the sewage pipes I don't know. Sometimes it smells like dirty diapers and vomit, other days it smells like dog shit and dirt. Never know what ur going to get. Then we get to the main service elevator (which I was lied to about when I moved in and they said they only had the main elevators in the super nice lobby that has ac and heat and a couch) Those elevators don't stay open long enough for u to walk in..they shut on u and sometimes they don't pop back. my foot got stuck and had to pry the doors to open! Back to the service elevator on the west side of the complex. (I just found out that there's a service elevator on the east side of the complex) U get into the doorway it has a completely different smell then the parking garage, the elevator takes FOREVER, then u get on and wait a good 30-45 seconds for it to finally shut! U get in the elevator and yet again it's a different nasty smell. Which btw this elevator breaks all the time! my boyfriend and I actually got stuck in the elevator for 2.5 hours before someone finally got us out! We actually ended up falling asleep in there! We tried pressing the emergency help button for the fire department and the button didn't work!!! Finally u reach ur floor and have to wait another 30-45 seconds for the doors to open. Wow we are in the hallway now and there's...yup! You guessed it! ANOTHER FOUL ASS SMELL! U get to ur apartment and they seem pretty nice at first. It was actually really clean when u first move in. I liked the 24 hour pool & hot tub. it's a pretty spacious place with a cute mini bar with a sink, a washer and dryer in unit and a jetted tub in one of the bedrooms. Carpet is really cheap and patched together by cutting small sections out & replacing it. they don't heat or ac the hallways. Just in the main office! The balcony is pretty cool..I decided to face the pool bc I didn't want to stare at the apartment complex walls next door, face desert inn where the fire department is directly across the street and sirens go off 5 times per day plus there is about 3-10 car accidents directly in front of crystal court apartments per week-so didn't want to listen to that from my balcony. Then there's the view of the power lines and power plant on the other side. Last but not least there's the beautiful view of what they call the golf course hahaha it's houses, a few trees and a street of a gated community next door and the golf course is NOWHERE IN SIGHT! So I chose the pool. The first day I was woken up from kids and people screaming at the pool and I could hear everything! Also, people in the hall can hear anything and everything that goes on in ur apt! inside your apt is sound proof and can't hear a thing from the bathroom to the kitchen! Soooo, the lights in this place. The bathroom they are dim and half of them weren't working, the light in the washer dryer stack closet doesn't work..just keeps flickering and we couldn't find the light switch for the kitchen for 3 weeks...turns out it's underneath the bar counter outside of the kitchen--we call it the midget light! The mirrored closet doors in both bedrooms were off track and don't slide very well. The slider to the balcony doesn't really slide at all...u have to use some force and lots of muscle to open it. The bedroom door doesn't even shut. The bathroom door drags against the tile and the front double doors doesn't even open-just the main door to get in. The jetted tub sucked my foot in and cut it open. It took us a month to find the timer to turn on the jets for the tub. it was outside of the bathroom hidden in the closet on the side wall! The sink in the kitchen started leaking and water went everywhere..turns out the pipe wasn't even long enough to reach from the garbage disposal to the other side. Everything breaks in this place and falls apart constantly! The hot tub outside always gurgles and broken and the light no longer works. The dog park next door- we have access to is always full of dog shit because the tenants are too lazy to pick up their shit. The whole place is a rotting shit hole! There was a leak in the ceiling on my floor. I told them about it and they said they already knew. It's been 4 months now and nothing has been done about it..its just creating mold and sagging down
188	For noodle places, this one is amazing because all of their soups taste different. I like it.
189	I got the green pozole and the chicken poblano enchiladas. The pozole was flavorful and hearty. The enchiladas were rich and creamy stuffed with tender chicken and topped with corn and roasted poblano peppers. I would order again. Absolutely delightful.
190	I am seriously kicking myself for not reading reviews beforehand.  I blame the drinks.  I would've done the gyro in a heartbeat!!!  That's not to say my dish wasn't good.  \n\nI got the beef kabob which was fine but not memorable.  I figured the place was called Kabob Korner so I should get kabobs!  Right?  I guess not.  $7.99 is a fair price for what you get (2 kabobs, rice, salad, pita).  I will be back for everything else they offer.
191	Found this little place by accident. The customer service is outstanding. Phil was our server and he is awesome. Super helpful, friendly and patient. We ordered the shrimp, potatoes, corn and sausage. We tried the smoking cajun, lemon pepper and garlic flavors. The garlic was DELICIOUS. The lemon pepper was fantastic. The smoking cajun was good but not as tasty as the others. Everything was fresh and hot. We will definitely be coming back to try the alligator and the clams. Thanks guys for giving us a new palatable adventure.
192	Awesome awesome awesome place owned by a very sweet couple.  Laura is simply incredible and the best at pedicures.
193	I liked their chicken corn soup and chicken fried rice. Chicken pakora not bad. Definitely will go back. First time when went there, I liked that the waitresses walk across the room time to time in case you need anything else.
194	Best prices and fast!\n\nI walked in without an appointment and needed a tube replaced for my 450 and 5 min after dropping it off I was looking around and he told me that if I stuck around another 15 min they would have it done!
195	Service when you need and want it.  That is one special thing about this new salon open in the heart of downtown Tempe.  Service is by appointment but you can have an appointment almost anytime!  You think that you have difficult hair issues or need special treatment? This Salon has expertise in European hair, African American hair types and techniques  and all will look amazing!\nOffering discounts to students, senior citizens, and regulars, something will be able to be worked out for you here.  I am rating a five star based on flexibility, expertise, awesome listening skills, and cleanliness.  \n\nNow let me tell you, I suffer from having dry hair that must ALWAYS be conditioned in this heat of the dessert.\nI don't wear weaves usually and I relax my tresses as needed. My service provider was Crystal and she handled me with care and we are working out a regiment that should help with the moisture issues I have sometimes.  I am writing this the day after a service here and my hair feels amazing and looks wonderful.  I will keep you all updated on the progress... Really...\n\nYou're gonna love that this salon offers a  lot of services at reasonable prices. They don't yet do manicures or pedicures just yet but they will soon.  They wax, offer paraphin treatments, color service and for a fraction of the price down the road off Mill.\n*************There is an available discount if you mention that you saw this business on YELP..... $10 off services of $40 or more and $50 off sew in weave service********.\nYou can make appointments by calling 602.545.1007!!
196	I've heard this is the best steak house in town, and since I've never been, it seemed to be the place to try. \n\nReservations were easy via Opentable and I made it 15 minutes prior to arrival. Granted this was an earlier reservation at about 6pm, when I checked in to the hostess stand, they said they were ready for me. Nice. \n\nThere were a couple of servers who assisted with taking our order and they were both very friendly and informative. Before diving into the menu, wait for the specials of the day. They also have off menu items too. \n\nWe shared: \n\nDel's salad which was a mixed green salad with tomatoes, and a couple of thick bacon strips. For $10, it was not worth it. I could have bought a pack of greens, box of tomatoes and a pack of bacon. \n\nSeafood Soup: It was a light bisque with fish and shrimp. It was ok but it was only a cup for $11. \n\nBone in Prime Rib: Since this was a large hunk of meat at 22 oz, we split it and they split it in front of us. I had a bit of each side; filet and ribeye. Between the two, I liked the ribeye more, as usual. It was tasty and just enough fat. \n\nPotatoes au Gratin: Usually this dish is with sliced potatoes but this dish was quartered red potatoes. What made this dish was the creamy buttery sauce with the baked cheese on top. Weird but this was my favorite dish... but maybe because I love carbs. \n\nIt's true, there is a weird sewer smell at the entrance. It's not appetizing walking in or out of the restaurant.
197	Bright, cheery & welcoming atmosphere.  Loved the heatlthy options on the menu but today was a cheat day so we opted for the omeletes.  I had the bacon mushroom and the better half tried the California.  Both were fantastic!  Also tried the jalapeno cornbread it was good.  The GM, Lauren, took our order...her cheerful demeanor set the tone for our whole morning experience and Stacy our server capped the morning with fantastic and informative service.  Would definitely recommend Scramble for great service and great food.
198	So. Good. The food was incredible! I got the pizza, which was my favorite entree. The cashew cheese is outta this world. The roasted cauliflower Rosemary soup is the best soup I've ever had. I also got to try the Mint to Be smoothie and it was great! I got the BBQ sliders bc why not and they were very tasty. Absolutely perfect overall. \n\nThe service was quick and fantastic! I ate alone and my bartender made the whole meal enjoyable from start to finish.
199	This rating is for their tea only. I have yet to taste the ice cream.\nOrdered a black iced tea and a matcha milk tea. Both were way too sweet! The milk in the matcha was almost as if they poured sugar straight into the bottle, then added more flavoring with more sugar! The black tea was practically like McDonald's sweet tea.
200	So, to tell an old story here......I was married.....then I got divorced.......then I paid alimony......then my ex got remarried and I didn't have to pay alimony....yea!   So then I put that money to good use.....I spent it on a luxury car.  \n\nBut with a luxury car one must have a dealership capable to service such a vehicle when needed without making one feel ripped off.  Hendrick Porsche is one of several Porsche dealerships I've done business with that is very capable.  \n\nHaving moved from the Chicago area, I found myself once again having to find a dealership that would want to earn my business and treat me fair.  This probably resonates with some\/many\/all of the ladies as it pertains to hair stylist.  A good mechanic\/service department is a cherished mechanic\/service department. \n\nAnyway, the folks at Hendrick Porsche were great from the moment I stepped through their showroom floor.  Professional, attentive, and looking to answer any and all questions I had for them about my car and their service....as well as providing a few tips and hints on the care and maintenance of my little car.  \n\nThis particular visit was boring as service goes....needed new tires in the back, had big scratches on the hood from a not so friendly SUV and needed an insurance estimate to file a claim and to check the brakes.....they looked at the car, quoted the tires (which were as good a deal as the independent Tire dealer I bought from last year) and noted they thought they could buff out the scratches on the hood if possible...and if not, provide the estimate.  So I left the car one morning to be repaired, poked, and prodded.\n\nThey also provide shuttle service or loaner cars, the shuttle service was a brand new BMW 750 which was VERY nice to be driven in and the loaner was a basic car from Enterprise which I decided being driven around in a luxury car was more desired. \n\nI got a call back on the car and they checked on a few other items...some of which were new discoveries others were looked at but were fine.  In the end I did have a nice sized repair bill (it is a luxury car mind you and just a fact of ownership), but for things that were needed and the scratches on the hood........buffed out and \"free of charge?\"  Wow...nice little treat.\n\nSo if you drive the vehicles they sell and service, give them a look the next time you either need service or perhaps are shopping for a new or pre-owned vehicle as I don't think you'll be disappointed......I know I'm not and am looking forward to a long and happy service relationship with Hendrick Porsche
201	If you have a child under 6 years old go to Defy Gravity. This place (Skyzone) is awful for them. The foam pit is connected to the trampoline. There are no plain foam pits. You can't jump with your child because they separate you by age. You have to wear socks where as there is an option at Defy Gravity. You wear a sticker on your shirt which my child didn't like. Everyone (even people not jumping) stands on the path way and it's not an open floor plan so they are in the way when you have to walk through to go to the other areas. Defy Gravity is definitely a better place. We only went here because they were open on Sunday but they aren't worth the trouble.
202	Good price. Not so good quality.\n\nMy boyfriend and I excitedly ordered the medium sized assorted sushi, sashimi, and maki platter (40 pieces for $30) for dinner last week, hoping we had found a new hidden gem for sushi.. but we were fairly disappointed. \n\nThe maki rolls were fine but the sashimi wasn't fresh. It had a fishy odour to it and the texture was mushy (the underside of the surf clam was browning and the ??? fish that was seared at the edges tasted like it had gone bad). Nowadays with all the food safety concerns around raw fish and their potentially harmful bacteria\/viruses, I think I'd rather pay a few more dollars for better quality sashimi that I can trust and eat without worrying.
203	Best lunch I've had in a long time.  If you are ever downtown, The Arrogant Butcher will not dissappoint.  \n\nJonathon was an excellent server and was very knowledgeable and hospitible.  He made great suggestions and was amazing at his job.\n\nOrder the Charcuterie platter.  It featured a great mix of their specialties.  The green goddess ceasar was to die for as were the fish n chips.\n\nTreat yo' self and dine at the Arrogant Butcher.
204	Came here one day just looking for something decent to eat away from the strip. We were right next door the other night for tea so didn't want to go  back to the same place, so we tried this place seeing there was a good amount of people in here compared to other places.\n\nSo sitting down, I ordered the Roasted Pork and Roast Duck combination. I these are 2 things I like to only eat once in awhile so I can truly enjoy the flavors. Our plates took a little longer than usual to come but it did. \n\nWhen it did, it was a disappointment. The roasted pork was very dry, must had been stuff from the other day that they decided to reheat and sell. The roast duck was all bone, giving me all the lower sections of the duck where little or no meat is found.
205	I always got my chicken BBQ pizza or the golden wings but this time I decided to order something different. I ordered all veggies pizza \"LAWRENCE ORIGINAL' which have spinach, mushrooms and garlic. It was great!! Definitely feel so much lighter without eating meat.. yeah definitely..
206	Went thru the drive-thru with my wife and daughter. Had to repeat back every item that we ordered. I guess they were done taking my order because they gave me my total before I was done telling them what I wanted. Oh well. Then got my drink wrong even after I had to repeat it 3x. I'm not even gonna go thru my disappointment with the ketchup.
207	It was so terrible place. The pin ball machine so dirty. The service so bad and impolite to customer. I will not go there and I will tell to my friend not to go this place too.\nI went to the pin ball hall of fame yesterday. I changed money with 30 USD. I played pinball, Game, Bowling. When I finished I still have a lot of coins. I went to the exchange machine. I put all my left coins in it. But the bill not go out . I walked to ask some help from a service person.I saw 2 persons in the service place.One old woman she BAWL on me. And said  to the other my speak was not understand . \nAfter that the other man told me to go to the exchange machine,He said to me how much money that I want.I said I could not remember how much coins that I put.\nHe will give me 2USD. I denied I want them open the exchange machine. but he said he cannot open.\nAfter that the old woman come again with a tape .She sticked the tape to the coin channel and said to me it cannot used why I put the coins.\nIt was not my false .She just come to sticked the tape and said to me.\nSEE!!!!!!! HOW CHEATING she was!.\nIn Finally the handy man come and open he gave me 2 USD. and told me all children come to his shop and cheating them. \nI refused that money because I am not cheating and I just want my money back.\nDo not be the victim to scam of this shop\nFor me, this place so terrible. I will not go there .
208	I feel bad about giving this place two stars... really.\n\nLast sunday, my mom and I were out on a power shopping spree at the pavillions when she said she wanted to go to Souper Salad, not wanting to i begruggingly agreed. We even dug through our back seat looking for their coupon in the sunday paper for a discount! We walked up and sat down and saw their DIRTY patio furniture... wtf?! Don't these people own a hose?! That was so dirty, I couldn't imagine trying to have a nice al fresco dining experience there! Luckily for me, it was the dirtiest part of the resturant.\n\nWe approached the door when a very loud man came and opened the door and exchanged pleasantries over and over again and was very happy to see us. Ummm... thanks? but can we atleast order our drinks first? He was a little happy. I unno - I was in a good mood, but I sorta just wanted to be left alone to eat. We got our salads and the greens were semi wilted and the cesar salad needed to be refilled but didn't :( and so I was left with some odd franken salad I threw together on my own. It wasn't that great - but that's my own doing. \n\nTheir pasta salads and cole slaw and some of their fixin's looked very old and unappetizing! I couldn't even imagine eating them! I wished they had potato salad or carrot slaw (is that the word?) and macaroni salad... it wasn't good. But things did lighten up when I came across the soups.\n\nI loooove soups!! They are my salvation after a hard day. I cozied up to a lil bowl of tomato based soup with mini shell pasta and veggies, it was delish! So was the Veggie Beef soup. I wish it didn't have so much onion,but I'm not a big fan of onions. and their tacos were GOOOOOD... not write home and tell everyone about it good... but very good. They remind me of the kind of tacos you make at home, out of a box but not all craptastic like how they come out when I do it. I honestly liked it. \n\nThe cornbread was dry and my mom said her baked potato was too. The pizza looked too old to touch, so I unno about that one. \n\nThe service was another thing... the same man, who I'm assuming is the owner always kept talking. Even when my mom said something along the lines of just wanting to enjoy our meals and we thanked him for his hospitatlity. But damn... SHUT UP! I felt like he wanted to sit down and talk shop with us... but we weren't there to meet with him... we were there to talk with one another. But he always refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly. So he got to keeep a star. \n\nTo my fellow yelpers: if you're in the area and want fresh salads, this might not be the place for you... especially if you want to eat outside cafe style on nice clean patio furniture... but if you want a nice cozy bowl (or several like me) of soup and decent bread sticks then this place will hit the spot. You might need to shoo away the owner though in order to get some privacy and enjoy the people you arrive there with.
209	This is my review of 'Beijing Chinese Cuisine' (as other yelper mentioned before),,,the one right next to Sin City Sushi :P \nI am very pleased to write this review(even though it's past my bed time-.-;;;;) I FINALLY found a great place to taste Korean-Chinese cuisine in town. I've been tried so many different places in the past but I couldn't find the one that has the genuine taste of Korean-Chinese dishes in Las Vegas. \nI was highly recommended this place by good friend of mine to try some Jjamppong, Jjajangmyun, and Mandu! \n\nGrowing up in Korea, I have early memories of eating Jjamppong, Jjajangmyun, & Mandu all the tme. It was a ubiquitous dish, not to mention cheap. Occassionally, my family had ordered it for delivery, the delivery man would carry the food in a big tin box with handles, on a motorcycle :P The noodles came in actual bowls, so after finish eating our delicious meal, we'd have to put the dirty dishes outside by the door(usually don't need to wash the bowls for them), so that the delivery man could come back for it later to pick up. I assume this is no longer the case in the State, haha :D \n\nSome people might ask,\"What is Korean-Chinese Cuisine?\" Well, it is originated from traditional Chinese dishes but has been influenced by local ingredients in Korea. Because of the closeness in place, most Korean-Chinese dishes are traced from Northern styles of Chinese cuisine such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shandong cuisine and these three are the best known regional cuisines of Northern China. Korean-chinese cuisine was born when Chinese immigrants settled in Korea in the 19th century, and 2005 marked the 100th anniversary of this popular dishes, according to wikipedia :) \n\nOk,, now the highlights of K-C dishes~ \n---Jjamppong(a spice noodle soup flavored with all the vegetables, Seafood, meat, & chilly oil): You can ask a server how spice you want from mild to very spicy :) It was a perfect right amount of spiciness and rich flavor of the broth. OMG!! \n---Jjajangmyun(a steamed noodle in black bean sauce, with diced pork, onion, potato, & garlic,,serves with cucumber pieces on top): not salty at all, all the ingredients were blended well together and gave a perfect taste of Jjajangmyun! \n---Mandu(home made pork dumpling or goyza :P, either boiled-Mul-Mandu, steamed-Jjin-Mandu, grilled or fried-Gun-Mandu): I recommend these dishes to try with a dipping sauce of soysauce and vinegar that you can easily find on the table. I tried their Jjin-Mandu. I really loved their Mandu!!!  It was a real homemade dumpling that my mom and grandma would make it back home. It seemed like they put right amount of pork, cabbage, onion, garlic, scallion, Korean leek, clear noodle, tofu, & etc,. \nAs might be expected, it came with pickled radish (with a splash of vinegar) and kimchi, yay \n\nThe people next to me, they were looking at my Jjajangmyun and asked what I was having...All of a sudden, they put aside their menus and ended up getting the same dishes as mine. I was glad that they also loved their dishes admitting first time trying out Korean-Chinese Cuisine for them. The owner came by the table a couple of times and was very friendly. According to her story, she is a main chef and now she has been teaching her son to be a good chef of Korean-Chinese cuisine :) If you eager to have K-C cuisine that you usually tried back home or simply you are craving for some good K-C cuisine, go for it!
210	When it comes to sushi, I've eaten at the best of the best from NY to LA, SF to Chicago and it simply doesn't get any better than Kaiyo for sushi.  An endless array of fresh sushi, sashimi, creative rolls, crab legs, shrimp, oysters and now they've added about 10 delicious hot food offerings.  All for under $20 per person.  And it really is all you can eat - - and I can eat a LOT of this wonderful food.  They now serve a number of lovely sakes too and are adding even more to the restaurant side.  \n\nThe buffet side is clean, crisp and friendly.  You can watch the chefs prepare their signature rolls.  Everything is very FRESH - the buffet platters change every 10 or 15 minutes.  If you don't know what something is, there is a chef right there to answer your questions. \n \nThe restaurant side is beautifully decorated and comfortable.  Service is fast and the staff is professional and helpful.   \n\nPrices are well below every other sushi \/ japanese place in town and no other restaurant comes close to the quality.   \n\nThis place is the best deal in town.  Great food, excellent service, lovely ambiance and prices too low to believe.
211	I really don't like giving reviews below 4 stars. Staff and cleanliness of the place would get a 5 from me! It's just my food I was unhappy with. First I went to get a sample of blue raspberry it came out like burst of liquid at first and it looked a little weird so I didn't eat it. I probably should've sampled the others first but I just decided to get cake batter and smores since I typically like those flavors. They came out of the machine really weird. Like liquid-y at first and then really hard and icy looking. I figured the consistency might just be a little off but thought it would still taste fine. Unfortunately it was really watery. Like it tasted like a smores flavored icee. It was not creamy at all like froyo from other places, when it melted it looked like muddy water. I just ate the toppings off which were good but also kind of ruined by the froyo underneath. I'd totally come back and try a different dessert, but the froyo wasn't for me.
212	Came for breakfast and got seated immediately. It was around 8:30 on a Sunday. \n\nThe staff were attentive and quick. Enjoyed the atmosphere as well. \n\nI ordered the chicken farm scramble and my sister ordered the meatloaf hash. The biscuit was my favorite part! They give you blueberry preserves to spread on the biscuit - a very pleasant, delicious surprise. There was a lot of tender, well seasoned chicken in my scramble, along with cheese and peppers. I got the grilled mashed potatoes on the side. This almost felt like dinner for breakfast, but I'm the type who loves that! There are more traditional breakfast options if that's your thing. Tried a bite of the meatloaf. It was ok. However, my sister was a fan and really enjoyed it. Again, more like dinner than breakfast. \n\nI'm going with four stars because the large portions are not worth it in Vegas. Like, I'm on vacation and not taking leftovers. I'm on the move too much. Plus, we ate here right before checking out. Taking leftovers weren't even an option. I wish there was an option to get the same menu option but in a smaller size for a little less.
213	I don't even yelp often but after staying here I thought to myself \"PEOPLE MUST BE WARNED\"!! Worst place I have stayed so far!!! First of all we arrive at about 11:00pm on a Friday night and literally stood in line for over 45min to check in. There were 6+ registers and only 3 employees, again its a Friday... Hello!!! Its a weekend maybe you should have more people on the clock! As if this wasn't enough, excited to finally be out of the line we go up to our room and when we walked in... It was as if we were walking to a current guests room. The beds were undone.. Soda and beer cans everywhere,Towels on the floor it was a complete mess. We double checked the room number thinking we accidentally walked into the wrong room but sure enough we were right. We called house keeping from the room and got transfered to front desk. When we expressed our concerns the person on the phone mocked me and hung up. Extremely angry we walked down stairs and spoke to management they apologized and offered a buffet for two... Yet they didn't have another room with two beds available so they offered a  room with one king bed... At this point it was nearly 3am. We had no choice but to take it... And there went our Friday night dealing with this shitty hotel service!!! Very disappointing
214	Good dogs, didn't blow me away but solid.
215	I have been coming to Haps for a couple of years now.  I will say the food is always really good.  I had the pulled pork sandwhich and it was good.  I got a side of mashed potatoes and they were yummy.  The ribs were okay this trip.  \nThis place is really good.
216	This is my new favorite place. I love the atmosphere and the creative decor with the schoolhouse theme. The outside patio will be fantastic in the spring. It's very roomy and has a gorgeous view. They have fun drinks and good prices and their buffalo cauliflower appetizer was fantastic. I had the tortilla soup and one of their salads, both of which were very very good. We had a great server and a super fun time enjoying the bottomless drink brunch. I'm really excited to go back and eat and drink again very soon.
217	The food was great! But man the WAIT! (Rhyme was intentional) Please only come here if you have some time to spare in your day, i tried to squeeze this place in for a quick work lunch break, so my irritation took over a bit because they took soooooo loooooongggg on everyyyythinggggg theyyyy diiiiiidddd.\n\nThankfully when we finally got our food it was very good or you may have saw a forced 1-starER up there. I got the biscuit sliders with a side of gravy the biscuits were made of their Green chili and cheddar \"biscuit of the day\" it was real down home comfort food, super tasty. The side of potatoes were very delicious as well, crispy on the outside and soft on the in while perfectly salted. Side of gravy was also better than most places. All in all great food but is it worth the WAIT? I'm undecided.
218	Hands down my favorite men's clothing boutique in Toronto.\n\nWhile most women dream of a super-sized closet full of Manolo Blanik and Christian Louboutin, a guy like me fantasizes about having a closet like Sydney's showroom.  A wardrobe filled with beautifully designed, top quality and classic styling.\n\nI'm crazy about the design concept of the store.  The simple white walls, copper ceiling and rustic display furniture allow the merchandise to speak for itself .  Obviously the owner had carefully selected designer pieces that would amalgamate well with the in-store label, Kin. \n\nThe store collections are all about simplicity and minimalism.  Each design is like a piece of art with high craftsmanship.  They look amazing on their own, and even better when injected with your individuality.  Sydney's also has great selection of denim, like Naked and Famous, Them Altelier and Rick Owens.  Along with a small selection of awesome looking shoes, bags and small leather goods.\n\nI bought a great looking in-house label suit.  The owner\/designer was terrific and helpful.  He took the time to explain his design, the fabric, as well as the overall construction of the suit.  He didn't stop there, he showed me how great the suit would look after alterations. \"Look at that, I had no idea that a suit could make my backside looks this good.\"  Sold!  Wrap that baby up!
219	Quick. Fast. Healthy.  I like their wraps and power smoothies.  It is quite expensive as a large smoothie and wrap will cost you over $10.  However, trying to be healthy usually has its associated costs.  Go here for post workout drinks. Always a nice reward.
220	*ATTENTIONS**\n\nFirst let me ask \"WHAT CAN U GET WITH $ 4.95 In Toronto?\"\none large espresso from Starbucks? But u probably need more than one cup to make yourself high enough for work! Two TTC tickets? F*** them, they always let u wait forever! Maybe two cheese burger from McDonalds? Oh no, please, they just taste like freezer......\nPeople, please just stop! let me tell you, with $4.95, you ain't get a shit here! u even cannot get in a cab! u even cannot get into Dance Cave without your student ID!\nBut now, there's place called El Furniture Warehouse is coming to your city, and your guys are damn lucky, because they sell all the food for $4.95! and they are f*** delicious!!!!! not just \"ok food\", I mean \" F*** Delicious!!!! If u don't know what \"delicious\" means, please don't comment or write review here! whatever you're vegan or a meat lover, you all can find your dish here, because they have tons of options on the food menu for your all. At this point, have to mention the burger there, swiss mushroom, veggie are the kill!!!! juicy and tasty! u even don't need dip source for fries, because when u eat your juicy burger, all the juice from the burger will dump onto fries, and please make sure u get extra napkin before you eat them, anyway, I can guarantee they will be best $5 burgers in your life! also the place get wicked in the night! great choice of music, no radio stations or top 50, DJ comes every night to turn the place on!\nNice environment, nice people and amazing food with great value.\nSo Torontonian, what are u still waiting for?\nThe legend is happening now, don't you want to be part of it?
221	I'm not saying this to be mean but what my inexperienced waitress did to me was comical and not excusable. I DO NOTE I am NOT basing my review on what she did and only the food but I feel it needs to be told so you see the whole picture.\n\nShe took our order and soon came to deliver the drinks . Her tray had three beverages a water an iced tea and a soda. Somehow she sorts of looses her balance and almost lost the water and it spills ON ME with Iced cubes hitting me but she manages to save it before it all splashes me. She said she was sorry but she suggested to ME TO CLEAN THE TABLE WITH THE PAPER TOWEL MYSELF! It's bad enough that she couldn't be bothered to clean that up but what really made it WORST was she left the wet napkin on the table the whole time we were dining. I do note she was very youthful and might have been only 15 or 16 years old so I have to chalk it up to that but I also note the cooks on the night I was here were also very youthful looking and I might not have experienced the food as it was meant to be prepared.\n\nWe started out with very average house salads and fried pickles appetizer. The salads seemed fresh and the dressing seemed bottled tasting and not so good. I thought the pickle appetizer was inedible not because of them being wet laden with oil but because of how overly salted they were. My husband who tolerates more salt than me didn't think inedible but he felt too that they were over salted and he ate only a few.\n\nOur two plates arrive and my husband got nearly everything they make on his plate and asked me to try stuff I didn't have. I only tried his short rib and had to stop there because it was DRY and almost cold. (YUK!) so then I moved on to my plate. I tried the BBQ'd Turkey first. It was almost good with good flavors and not too much sauce. I also liked that the sauce wasn't too sweet but like the Rib it was dry and almost cold. (YUK! again) So I figure maybe the chicken is good but I was WRONG again. (YUK!) Another almost COLD and VERY DRY. I really hate dry chicken. I had a nice looking side of vegetables but sadly they were ruined by a generous hand of BUDGET SEASONING SALT that tasted awful. Lastly I was hoping the corn bread would be ok but I WAS WRONG AGAIN and SADLY it was so dry and so from the box tasting even soaking it in honey butter couldn't fix it.\n\nI do note my husband said the store purchased hot link wasn't as dry as the BBQ'd other items. He also said the pork ribs were better than the beef rib. I also need to say  I hope that the day time crew prepares the food in the way the owner meant it to be. I say that because of the numerous BBQ awards they've earned that I saw here while dining. But.......\n\n\nOnly one word.......... \n\nPITIFUL
222	Well, I was gonna write a review of this DUMP but then I saw Aaron A's review and think it'd be better just to re-post his horrible review!!!  (how's that for a first line of a review, Aaron A?)\n\n\"... I would not step back in this place for a taco.  Fatty pork is fine, if its cooked nicely, but this was not. Green beef was ok, as long as I piled the pretty good tomatillo salsa over it.  The fish...let's leave it at ugh.  If this is their specialty, it's over already.  (no more lines waiting, I see that much...)\n\n\"This is Sunnyslope, and with the authentic delicious taco and burrito choices around here, this place is only competing with the tacos across the street at Jack in the Box, and I would probably eat those before I'd touch another one of these, it was that bad for me.\n\n\"SORRY HIPPIES.  THIS WASN'T GOOD.  IF YOU ARE GOING TO COME INTO A MEXICAN PART OF TOWN YOU'D BETTER BRING THE MEAT TO COMPETE.  YOU ARE FAR OUTCLASSED IN TACOLAND.\"  (Bold mine)\n\n\"So, after some thought I decided rather than just pan the place, I'm giving suggestions:  \n1. use a paper or wax paper between the aluminum and taco, or you have a mess.\n2. do something with that too cold cabbage\/cheese\/tomato\n3.  grill the fish and don't smother it \/ chop it up.  make sure its fresh.\n4.  get a better cut of pork, go organic (maybe it is), season it better\n5.  keep the happy people in front, they were nice\n6.  don't blend your lemonade with ice, it was awful and too sweet\n7.  quit buying your chips at Costco, those round ones suck\n8.  do something with the guacamole, it was ok just being avocado and lime, but it was pureed.  keep it chunky.\n9.  get more input from your mexican chefs, they probably know what is wrong\n10. Both the red and green salsas were good, just need a taco to go with it\"\n\n------------\n\nBE SURE TO LOOK FOR ALL THE FLIES THEY HAVE IN THE KITCHEN DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.  Ugh.\n\nHORRIBLE FOOD.
223	Jillian Batchelor and her Group's performance was amazing! She sat down and told us the facts on what it would take to sell our house. And then SHE SOLD IT! For the price we wanted! All I can say is if you are looking to sell or buy a home this is the group you want to talk to. Very aggressive program that got us the results we needed. The open houses she puts on are great! Ya have to see the signs! She was available to us any time we had a question. (sorry about the weekend and late night calls James) The office staff was also on top of everything.  Just a great group all around. Jillian, I promise if anyone I know wants to buy or sell a home I will send them your way! Thank you so much guys!\n Steve
224	Great spot to grab a bite to eat. This is the epitome of a dive bar. It's grungy and not the most attractive place, but the food and drinks are super affordable and delicious. The only light in the place is from the 2-19\" screen tvs, a neon signs, and a jukebox in the corner.\n\nWe stop in here every time we're in Sun Prairie. I prefer the wings tossed in their original sauce. They've got a house-made blue cheese dressing to die for. I don't even like bleu cheese, but you've got to try it!
225	Tokyo Cafe is a win!\n\nI'm not usually on this side of town, but I was out here visiting a friend and wanted to pick up food on my way home. With the help of the Yelp app, I found Tokyo Cafe.\n\nLocated in a small shopping center, Tokyo Cafe can be difficult to find at first. Once you park, you might try to rethink your decision if this was a good find or not. This place looks nondescript for a place called \"Tokyo Cafe\". Decor is not fancy by any means, but sometimes those are the most delicious places and in this case, it is true!\n\nThe menu is simple and straight forward. I ordered the steamed gyoza, the tonkotsu ramen, and the chicken katsu curry. The person who took my order was quick and friendly. I only waited about 10 minutes for my order. While I was waiting at one of the tables, I saw someone eating their order of fried rice. My mouth started to water so I jumped back in line and ordered a chicken fried rice to go. Don't judge me.\n\nThe gyoza was good. They come either steamed or fried to your liking. The ramen was really good despite some of the questionable pictures that I found on yelp. The broth was delicious and the toppings were generous. The chicken katsu curry was huge! The katsu was crunchy and the serving of rice was heavy. The curry came on the side, which I appreciated since my food was to go. The fried rice was flavorful and also a very generous serving. \n\nThe food alone was tasty which would be a solid four stars from me. The extra start comes from the price. All of this food for under $30 was a steal. Even the two of us couldn't even make a dent with these crazy portions. Talk about leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I can dig that.
226	Winter I Wonder how I got roped in to this complete waste Fest is more like it.\n\nIt's dirty, poorly lit, super expensive to get in the gate and absolutely NOTHING is included in the price of admission.\n\n$12 hot dogs still taste good, but NOTHING is included.  There are no carnival games, the bounce hoses are closed, it's just bad.\n\nNothing like Santa's Village (same location years ago) so don't expect much, if anything.
227	Yummerz. Was dying to try this place and finally got to last summer. I basically can't wait 'till it's summer again to go back. The possibilities are endless and the toppings are so much fun. I tried the maple dipped ice cream with pistachios and the milk chocolate dipped ice cream with pretzels. Mmmm so good. The mini size is good if you're not crazy for ice cream.
228	We decided to go here on New Year's Eve. It was a big mistake. I reserved a table a month early for 6 pm, thinking we would beat the crowd and have a celebratory meal. It was pretty bad. We got there... the table was ready... and we were seated. Before my chair was pushed in, a menu was thrust at me. Our server rattled off specials and we could hardly hear her over the weirdly odd music. My daughter and I ordered champagne. It was brought promptly and was good. However, we were never asked during the rest of the meal if we wanted more. We felt pressured to order very quickly. We ordered salads, sides, and entrees, and were even asked about dessert. They were in a mission to get us out of there in a hurry. One course after another was pushed at us. The food was good, but we literally had our salad plates taken before we finished. I think my fork was in the air! Another funny event: two servers came out with our entrees. They put them down in front of the wrong people. They then proceeded to argue over who put the food down incorrectly. The bread came out with the entrees which was late. Things got even funnier when I heard a woman behind me say: \"I'm not ready for you to box it up! I am still eating it!\" I guess we weren't the only ones rushed. We did have carrot cake which was mediocre. Not bad not good. I used to work near Morton's and went there for happy hour. Wow! Was it ever a bad idea for a special meal. Our bill came to $300. Seriously, I expect better for that price. Disappointing and bordering on rude. PS... The horseradish potatoes were great!
229	Food was good but our waiter took to long to take our order. Other than that everything was amazing
230	What a great experience! We were seated at the large wood table, tucked between the whiskey wall and wine staircase and it felt so regal! We started with the hummus board and it was beautiful in presentation and beyond delicious, so flavorful! For my entree I had the French Dip sandwich, also delicious and flavorful! I will definitely order again! The wine menu is perfection and I love all the by the glass options. I'm excited to try more items on the menu.  The decor is beautiful, you can tell there was a lot of attention to detail. I can see lots of nights and Sunday brunches at the Covenant in my future!
231	As a bride I was VERY disappointed with the services!  They ran more than a half hour past my appointment making me late to my own wedding and because the hair dresser was rushing the curls all fell out and my hair looked horrible; I would have been better off doing it myself!
232	If you don't get that sea bass you're an idiot. Seriously, one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had! I miss it....
233	Great atmosphere and a great deal for a ribeye steak!  I recommend to get a side of their buffalo sauce to complement the steak!
234	This is a first class place with great atmosphere I am definitely coming back here food was awesome.  All you can eat sushi at lunch for $14 is an incredible deal.
235	Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  I can't say enough about Mizu Sushi.  I've been there 3 times now and thus far everything is just fantastic.
236	Wow. Lights is definitely an impressive nightclub. Yes the strobe lights may make you feel dizzy and cause you to get an headache, but you should check it out. The lights and decorations are amazing. I walked in very impressed. Haha. Yes the place is smaller than some clubs on the strip (XS, Marquee, etc).\n\nThe club is located right  next to the valet\/taxi drop off and parking lot. So the traffic of people walking in and out is kind of inconvenient when you are trying to look for friends. Worse when a concert just ended and you see tons of people passing by. But it's in a convenient spot. \n\nAnyways my party and I were lucky on the night we went. Even ratio of ladies and gents meant free admission before 12, plus two free drink tickets (fail because they gave us dates that were long past and they stopped those at midnight). The line moved relatively fast considering I got into line at 11:20 (which was pretty far back) and made it in before midnight. \n\nAs you walk in, there is a small ramp leading up to the club, yes ladies there aren't a lot of stairs if you are in heels. Immediately you'll see the bar. Yes and the line is long, but pretty fast in my opinion. \n\nMusic was good - honestly as long as I can dance to it, I think it's good. If I remember correctly, it was like EDC music. Rave. No Hip-hop, no top 40's. So if that's your style, you're better off going elsewhere.
237	Just stopped by this Hawaiian-style shaved ice place while on a trip to Las Vegas. For those who aren't familiar with shaved ice, it is very different from a snow cone. The shaving of the ice makes the ice very fine, much like freshly fallen snow. A number of shaved ice places have opened up recently in the Los Angeles area, and it looks like Avalanche uses the Swan-style shaved ice machine that is popular with most of them.\n\nAvalanche is unique in that it has a self-serve syrup station with 36 syrups to choose from. When you place your order, you first pick your size (small, medium, or large), whether you want ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry, 50 cents per scoop), and whether you want an additional topping (condensed milk for 50 cents or pixy stix, 3 for 25 cents). Once you get your shaved ice, you take it over to the syrup station and put whatever combination of flavors you'd like. If you order condensed milk, it comes in a separate plastic sauce cup that you can pour on after you've added your syrup.\n\nIt is apparent that Avalanche has recently opened. There are still a few hand-written signs, and the overflow plastic chairs were stacked in a couple of areas of the dining section. Some of the toppings that other Hawaiian shaved ice places offer, like azuki beans, mochi, li hing mui powder, aren't available; maybe they will be in the future. The consistency in the amount of ice can also vary by quite a bit: both my wife & oldest daughter ordered a small, but there was a pretty significant difference between the two (one was about 50% larger than the other). But the dining area is clean and comfortable, and Avalanche offers a refreshing way to cool off from the desert heat.\n\nAvalanche is located in a strip mall just east of the UNLV campus, on Harmon Ave., one driveway east of Maryland Parkway on the north side of the street. We had lunch at a near-by In-N-Out before coming over here for dessert. I could see this turning into a favorite hang-out for Runnin' Rebels when school is in session.
238	no thanks.... and here's why...\n\ni ordered from mas amigos online for pick up.  the address was listed on springfield... my husband went to pick it up.   20 minutes later, he returns to tell me the building is empty.  he has no idea where to go.  i called the number and asked if they had moved, and the woman on the phone said, \"yes.  to university ave.\"  i tell her my husband is coming to pick up an order.  he will be there in 20 minutes.  she says, \"no problem.\"\n\nhe gets back in the car... and away he goes.  across town.  again.\n\nhe has been gone for about 20 minutes when the phone rings.  a man tells me he is delivering my food from mas amigos, and he can't seem to find my address.  i tell him i've ordered online for pick up, not delivery.  he tells me that \"pick up\" is no longer an option.  no longer an option?!  as of when?!  20 minutes ago?  \n\ni direct the man to my door who hands me the food, i've already paid for online.  i tell him my husband is sitting in his restaurant right now, waiting to pick this food up.  he shrugs his shoulders at me, and sort of walks off, telling me to apologize to my husband for him.  (yep.  that ought to do it.  i'm sure he will be supremely less pissed now.)\n\nmy husband comes in the door 20 minutes later with no food.  he tells me that he was charged for our food again at the restaurant because the woman at the counter (who ironically was reading \"things fall apart\") didn't know that there was any order for pick up.  she re-rung the entire order and charged him for it.  she then received a call from the delivery guy explaining what had happened.  she said she couldn't void the transaction, and that the manager would do it when he came in the next day.  \n\nguess what?  he didn't, and it took me two days of calling him to get it done.  guess what?  my food was cold when i got it and it was so not worth paying for it once.  guess what?  i'll never eat at mas amigos again.  their customer service was crap.  \n\ntheir website information was wrong -- the address, the pick up vs. delivery information, even their phone number was incorrect.\n\nthe employees seemed to not even know what was going on or what the policies were.  the manager was unapologetic and they didn't handle this situation very well at all.  \n\nif their food is good, i have no idea, and i probably won't know because i won't order from them again.
239	Waffle Houses are bomb but this one is my favorite.  Not only is it 24 hours but it is super clean and well lit.  There are totally some seedy people who go here but their conversations just make for very interesting background noise.  \n\nAs far as the food, the prices are cheap, the menu is semi-a-la-carte and the the waffles are amazingly crisp and perfect.  This is THE Waffle House to visit.  Go now, do it.  How good does a waffle sound right now anyways?  That's right, Pretty Damn Good.
240	I always get salt and pepper chicken wings  and the shrimp egg foo young.  It's  always great no matter if it's delivered or a pick up order.
241	Got to watch John Caparulo in the Showroom at this hotel. What a fun and intimate time we had here!\n\nStaff at this hotel seems more friendly and helpful. \nRestaurants are obviously less bougie and wallet-friendly.\nPenny slots were fun cuz I won $20! :D\nPlenty of parking in the huge garage.\n\nI wonder how nice the rooms are here? Might have to stay here next time.
242	Horrible quality furniture, incredibly bad customer \"service\" and they do not stand by their warranty.  To put the icing on the cake, they are now inundating my mailbox with offensive quantities of their catalogs.  They are clearly grasping at straws to sell their sub-par furniture. \n\nFor the record, I boycott any company that chooses to violate my time and space by clogging up my mailbox as well as killing trees to have catalogs printed on thick paper.  this company is outrageously unethical.\n\nIn case someone from Arhaus is reading this, I would appreciate it if you would STOP sending these IMMEDIATELY.  The code number on one of the catalogs is PCK-4936 PLT-43
243	As I see it there are two kinds of people that review Jab Fitness; the first is the people that want to be pushed to get the best workout they possible can get, the second is someone who needs a little more cuddling and soft spoken, suggestive incitement. \n\nSo I do believe this place is not for everybody.. only for everybody that wants to workout hard, really hard and don't need a cute greeter at check in. (Because that my friends, they sure do not have!)\n\nPros.\nThey have classes every day, and every class I have been to has been tough, really tough.. but if you are NOT in tip top shape you aren't the only one. Everybody can do this in their own pace - you can do this workout to your own comfort level, even if the trainer will have you push that limit. Also it's mentioned before, but this place is clean. \n\nCons.\nThis place could be more personable, but then again if you are going to the gym to socialize - thats on you, and this might not be your kind of gym.  Another thing is sometimes I feel that I am not sure exactly how to do a move (usually a kick), and the setting isn't inviting for too much one-on-one correction. \n\nSummary.\nCould the staff including the trainers be a little more personable; sure, I will give that to you but I came to Jab to workout and only to workout. I get an outstanding, well rounded workout here and in one hour I am done.. \n\nAlso, the price is right. I am happy I went for it.
244	This place is really cool for children and older, retired people.  The food is awful.  Nothing on the menu is interesting- they serve meatloaf for crying out loud!  WHO SERVES MEATLOAF IN SCOTTSDALE??!!
245	I love this place. Drinks are the best with reasonable price. The best thing is that they dont cheat on the shots. I just want to keep going and try the whole menu
246	I just needed a snap fixed on a hand-me-down leather jacket, and the guy in the store fixed it while I waited, in probably 5 minutes.  $3.50 - I spent more in gas driving out there.  I know this is a trifling repair, and not much to base a review on, but I did want to acknowledge the good experience I had.
247	I made an order to go and it was awful. I ordered 2 toasted bagel sandwiches which they forgot to toast and they were cold, 2 extra hot lattes which were not at all hot, and the sandwiches came with a fruit cup each and they forgot one. The one they did give was pathetic. See the pic. Lazy. Do not go to this place if you want quality food and service.
248	AMAZING FOOD!  This is the best place for Sunday Brunch in Vegas.  Forget about the boring buffets with their lukewarm and dried out offerings.  Every plate at BG is made fresh to order.  For the price of the average brunch buffet you can eat the menu--fresh and delicious--for only $35.99.  You can add $8.00 all you can drink mimosas (they have about 6 different ones).  Our favorite dishes were the Maple Pork Belly and waffle, the Short-Rib Hash, Papas Rajas Taco and the French Toast Bread Pudding. You will not be disappointed.
249	Excellent patio here. Plenty of shade and nice decor. Dog-friendly of course. Good thing our pup loves snacking on tortilla chips as much as we do. \n\nWe dined at Cantina 1511 after a long day of hiking and were famished. They have $5 signature cocktails on Mondays. I got a pear mojito that was very refreshing. \n\nThe tableside guac was amazing! I also really liked their salsa and chips. it's a little pricey so bf and I split mixed fajitas. They were tasty, but I missed the beans and rice fajitas typically come with. We also got a side of the elote, which was underwhelming. Just needed a little more seasoning. It was well enough food for both of us to share, but this is not like a typical authentic mexican restaurant where you get way too much food for barely any money. \n\nKatelyn was an excellent server! She took great care of us, and her tableside guac skills were pretty  impressive.
250	I've been here several times and I always get a bowl of soup.  The soup has never disappointed, but I would like to try a salad or sandwich too, however at Kneaders you can only get a combo like that if you get a soda with it. I don't like soda.  Anyway if you want a good bowl of soup, this is your place.
251	Why do grown adults kick my seat and do it through out the entire movie.  To be polite because I'm anti-drama, I lean back hoping to pop one of their toes off and then they move their feet again on my seat.  I don't get it.  This isn't your house and my head is not a ottoman.  Keep this in mind the next time you see my smiling starry face.  LOL\n\nThe theater is clean and has some great posters.  I like the sound and the seats are nice.  The AC could be turned up some more since it's over 100 outside.  The customer service is good, but the managers there are a little unprofessional.  I've been to this location many times with my husband.  We like the late night movies they have.  Gives us time to get dinner then go see a movie and not have to rush.
252	Pan Asian. Which means go spicy or go home!\n\nMe and the wifey wanted to try this place out finally after driving by it so many times. The one time I actually stopped by to try them was when they went on vacation for almost 2 months. I guess everybody deserves some time off especially if you have your own restaurant. \n\nAfter looking over the menu I decided to go with the Chicken in Spicy Garlic Sauce. The wifey was not all that hungry so she went with the Spicy Tom Yum Soup. Now back to my very first statement. Our server asked us how spicy we wanted the soup. He said choose from 1 to 3. Now from what I remember skimming on some of the reviews, their spiciness is hotter than the norm. So when my wife wanted 3 I politely interrupted her and said to go for a 1. Im glad we did because after tasting the soup, (which was awesome btw) my lips were burning. Combine that with the Chicken in Garlic sauce, wow! That in itself was spicy. Im glad my dish came with a bowl of white steamed rice because if it didn't, I would literally have steam coming from my head!\n\nNow im assuming not all they have on their menu is burn a hole in your stomach spicy but once I was done with my meal, my clothes were all soggy with sweat, like I just came from the gym. Now if I can actually lose weight while eating here, then I am set! Who said multi tasking was hard?\n\nAs for service, we got our order pretty quick. But then again there were only two other tables being served. So next time the real test is when they are packed. Which means more trips to try other awesome food on their menu!\n\nThe only thing I thought that stuck out were the prices. We only ordered two items, but with tax and tip it was about 21 bucks. I think that's why lunch time is a hit here with the lunch specials.  Im kind of glad it was spicy because I probably would have ordered more food. Needless to say, we left satisfied.
253	After all the great Yelpviews about the LOL wifey and I had to make the trip. Consider us  major fans after one visit. \n\nAs has been written, if you didn't know it was there you wouldn't know it was there, which makes NO sense...but you know what I mean.  There's an old beer joint exterior which turns into a modern beer joint interior simply but tastefully decorated. And while once I lamented damn TV's everywhere, it IS fun to sit at the bar and see what's going on in the world. \n\nBut what captured our interest more than the TVs was the menu; what a boatload of creativity is happening here. While it was enchilada night we went another direction. I got the Sturgess Burger which had pulled pork and bacon (pig fest--Symon would have loved it) on top of one damn good burger. Wifey had the Reuben which probably could have fed a small Somali village. Damn, they're generous with the goodies.  And while I didn't have any, she said the sweet potato tots are as yummy as yelpists claim.  Add a beer and the whole thing plus tip was $30.00. And it was VERY VERY well spent and worth every penny. \n\nWe are really looking forward to going back and trying many of the other fun things on the menu. \n\nFolks, this is another CCG (Cool Cleveland Gem) that you're going to love once you get there. We LUV supporting the brave and creative locals who make wonderfully fun places like this happen, so GO SUPPORT the LOL! \n\nCool.
254	Trying to put on airs in Cleveland.\n\nWe went here on the advice of a local friend who described it as a \"speak easy\".  First of all it's not.  It's just a regular, way overpriced, rather non-descript bar with couches.  The only thing of character is their fabulous drink menu -- which is fabulous.  However, they charge $18 per drink.  That is just stupid.  More than anywhere in Manhattan, more than anywhere South Beach, more than anywhere on the planet.  And I'm at some dopey little place in Cleveland?  This place is stupid.
255	Oh KB, why must you be another sushi AYCE spot to disappoint?!\n \nAt first this was a jewel Oh my gosh! I had just moved to the area and was on the hunt for another go to AYCE sushi spot for those nights I binge watched an anime and had a sudden craving for sushi.  The sushi was fresh and the rice was just right. The menu selection was impressive too. The décor is modern and comfortable. Suitable for date night or even a family gathering. The customer service was also fast, but not very friendly- I do not like the way they just drop your order on the table and run away.\n \nDon't get me wrong all these attributes about the restaurant is still the same. The only changes that has come to disappoint me is they raised the prices and the quality is noticeable lower. I guess this happens sometimes when a restaurant gets popular.  \n \nI'm a regular here and I always kept forgetting to review KB Sushi. A month ago I'd give this place an easy 4 star. After my last two visits my decision changed.\n \nAt my last visit I found a long black hair in my Rainbow maki roll. EW!\nI told the server and she just laughed about it LOL yikes!\n \nMy AYCE sushi hunt continues. Anyone have any recommendation in the Etobicoke area?
256	Loved the atmosphere here! My friend and I can in for ice cream and we were in for a treat. She got a sandwich and said it was amazing and a ice cream drink. I had the Thai tea macaroon ice cream sandwich. It was delicious and a refreshing take on an ice cream sandwich. It was decently busy when we arrived, the staff was great at moving people through the line!
257	I came back to Wild Rose again for a Yelp Wrap up party which really, was just a reason for all of us to get drunk and stuff our faces with jummy food once again.\n\nI've had Wild Roses' popular beers like the Raspberry and the India Pale so this time around I settled for their seasonal Cherry Porter which was soo good I had it thrice. Great, Wildrose brewery you made me say \"thrice\" and I abhor saying that word.\n\nWe all shared Wild Rose's appetizers. I like their nacho platter which had beans, salsa and  cheesy dip neatly placed in a bowl which was a nice alternative to the usual \"dump everything on the nacho\" goodness other pubs strive for. We also shared several of their fresh pretzels which, when I made a blasphemous joke about \"breaking bread\" was divinely punished when I underestimated the hot mustard and it crawled up my sinuses. Finally, I had their \"craft\" mac and cheese. It was delicious. I'll leave at that and leave out the part that it was cheesy goodness finished off with an amazing baked crust permeating a tasty smell that interrupted Carol K mid-speech several times.\n\nLately, I've been closely observing the service in these places I've been going past the surface level of their pleasantness, but in how they seem to enjoy their job. Everyone at Wild Rose seemed to love what they were doing and wouldn't shut up about the food and beer. Our waitresses were lovely and witty, and Andrew was cool enough to ring the massive bell and buy the house a round of drinks.\n\nAlso a side note: I ran into a co-worker of mine whose family was allowed to celebrate at the Wild Rose, who appears to allow minors only before 7pm :)
258	I visit this place every time I'm in Vegas! A lot of people frown at the idea of paying $10 just to look at a whole bunch of cars that they can't afford but, C'mon, most of us go to our local yearly car shows. Same difference. Make sure to go down to the bottom level of the dealership. There are a lot more cars down there. And you can get your picture taken in a Ferrari.\n\nAt least if you take your ticket into the Ferrari Store they will take $10 off a purchase of $100 or more so it's basically free if your going to buy something in the store.\n\nI saw some great deals when I was there. Hooded jackets that retail for $200 on sale for $60. Key chains that retail for $150 for $25. Cologne gift sets with 3.4 oz bottles of cologne and model Ferrari's for $65 . \n\nExotic cars are like beautiful women, I could look at them all day without getting bored. If you love cars as much as I do I highly recommend it!
259	On a Monday afternoon we ordered Pho (well done beef) and Combination Vermicelli for $3 (Used the $8 Groupon for $16)\n\n- Da Lat is a city in the southern part of Vietnam\n- Dirty tables but friendly service. Go to place for the drunk. Advertised! haha. \n- Lots of beef with pho! Although, not enough veggies. \n- Coming from OC, i enjoy seeing diversity in viet restaurants in vegas! lol\n- Combination special came with eggrolls, pork, and shrimp. \n- Egg rolls uncooked. Fried at high temperature and raw inside. \n- Average taste and portion for LV! The deal make it better than some Viet restaurants in OC.
260	Can I give this location 0 stars? That'd be dope. This was last night on 12-5-14. I'm in the GAP outlet shopping for a coat and a sweater for my girlfriend.  Nobody asked if I needed help. Then I suddenly hear a series of F bombs and MuthaF this and that. It was an employee. She was cursing a storm and talking about the GAP F'd up her check. Complaining and cursing out some guy for her $90 check and F this and F the GAP.... I left and spent $240 at Tommy Hilfiger and Express. I didn't hear one curse word at any of those stores. I don't know if I'll ever shop at the GAP again after that experience. Not one employee tried to help me and I was in there for 15 minutes. Maybe they were too busy rooting on the employee that was cursing out the manager.
261	I've only ordered one dish here, but I can't stray from it because it is so amazing.\n\nMOCK DUCK BASIL. Order it, eat it, love it. One of the best vegetarian dishes ever.
262	I HATE THIS PLACE...\n\nbecause I can't resist it. It's bad enough that I f-ing love coffee, they go and make it taste super good - wtf. Every single damn time I pull up to this place every one is smiling and happy and always asking you how you're doing...unheard of! Seriously though these kids are awesome and always make me leave in a happier mood (plus having the coffee in hand).\n\nI swear to you, one time they gave me the wrong drink (unbeknownst to me) and I got all the way to the stoplight to see one of the baristas full on running to my car like he was getting chased by a bear just to give me the correct drink. Ah-maz-ing. \n\nThey have a ton of specials, great customer service, fantastic drinks, and if you don't know what to get they'll be more than happy to find one you'll be sure to like. 5 stars hands down.
263	The food is good and the price is right.  This restaurant is pretty casual and gives out a diner vibe, nothing fancy.  Don't let that fool you, though, cuz the food is fantastic.  I came here for dinner on a week night and it was pretty empty.  We got a nice seat by the window that overlooked Church St.  The waitress was nice and friendly.\n\nThere were many options on the menu, including scallops!  Here's what I tried:\n\nSeaweed Salad $4 - Pretty good and nice size.\n\nDeep fried beef dumplings $4 - I would order these again.\n\nFire Cracker Dream  $5 - Scallop, tempura flakes, spicy mayo.  This was good, especially since I was in the mood for scallops. \n\nMoscow Roll - $8\/5pcs - Salmon, tuna, hamachi, green onion, cream cheese deep fried w\/special house sauce.  MAN, this was DELICIOUS!  The cream cheese thing is not for everyone, but I LOVE IT!  The texture was great (crunchy and creamy) and the sauce was fantastic bursting with flavor.  I would come back for these in a heartbeat.  Just for this, 5 stars.\n\nLarge Hot Sake - $7 - Drinkable :)\n\nMy vegetarian friend was happy because there were more vegetarian options than just salad and edamame.  They have several vegetarian sushi rolls on the menu (e.g. Asparagus Roll, Deep Fried Sweet Potato Roll, Shiitake Mushroom Roll, etc.).
264	I called them at 11:00am on a Thursday and asked if I could order lunch for 10 to go, which is not something they normally do.  The waiter checked with the chef and they were able to accommodate me and it was ready by noon.  I left a huge tip and was so thankful that they were able to help me out.  I ordered saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, naan, and rice.  The people who ate the food said it was the best Indian they have had in the city.  I will defiantly be back.
265	BERLIN!!! OMG!!! most fun personality ever. Love this bar and love the bartenders. Always a fun time!!!
266	Now that I know this place is owned by Robert De Niro, I will NEVER eat there again.
267	I brought my son in as a walk-in this afternoon. There was one customer ahead of us and we were quoted 10-15 min wait. 35 minutes later, we were told our hairdresser, Josie, was just finishing up and would be right with us. After she left for a while in the back, she came up to the receptionist to whisper why she would not be seeing us, the only customer in the waiting room. Josie left and a few minutes later the receptionist told us it would be 20 min more of a wait as Josie was taking her lunch break. I was unable to wait any longer as I had to pick up my other son from practice. We were offered a $5 credit towards a haircut, but will not be returning.
268	Razzleberriez is definitely a yogurt shop worth checking out! Be careful though...you might face the possibilities of becoming addicted, but at least it is a lot healthier than ice cream (;. Not only is this place super clean but the environment is so fresh and the yogurt is soooo delicious. There is such a variety of options from the yogurt to the toppings. If I can't decide what to get I just go for the salted caramel! I've had salted caramel at other places and nothing compares to razzleberriez. I would definitely recommend this place! It is surely one of a kind (:.
269	Overpriced ...sorry guys you did good but double the cost of what I have spent in the past for the same move ..even with the Yelp deal way overpriced..
270	This place had been on my radar for several Vegas trips, but we finally managed to check it out this time around. After a rainy (and snowy!) drive, our stomachs were grumbling for something real good to warm the belly. No offense to any Palace Station fans, but the Oyster Bar just might be the only reason we ever visit this hotel\/casino.\n\nAfter reading about all the long lines, we were glad that a couple of seats just opened up for us when we arrived around 4:30pm on a Friday night. Everything on the menu just looked fabulous, as anything seafood related just makes us start salivating uncontrollably. We looked around at our neighbors, everyone face down in their steaming bowls of deliciousness. \n\nWe started off with a couple of appetizers, calamari and the clams casino (fitting enough). The calamari tasted fresh, very tender, and not overly breaded or oily at all. The clams were juicy with that bit of breaded crust on top, taking a bit of caution scooping them out from their still piping-hot outer shells. A squeeze of lemon and a few splashes of hot sauce on top, and we were in clam heaven.\n\nAs for the main course, we wanted to share the pan roast, but which kind? It seems like you can add any type of seafood inside. We go for the special, which also adds chicken and sausage along with the shrimp and crab. I loved watching it being made on those old school metal steamers right in front of us. I'd gladly take a steam facial for a whiff of that seafood, garlic, and butter aroma.\n\nUpon our first bite, or slurp, of the pan roast, you could tell this stuff was rich, heavy, yet utterly satisfying. Thick in consistency, as opposed to something lighter like cioppino, it was almost like eating heavily concentrated \"seafood sauce.\" Flavors were complex and bold, although we did start searching around for the crab meat inside. Did they forget? Maybe it just got mixed into everything. Ah well.\n\nNo doubt, the pan roast is something I had never tried before. It's definitely smart to share a bowl, leaving room to try other things. But on my next visit, I want to try other dishes like the bouillabaisse or etouffee. Prices are somewhat reasonable, considering it is Vegas. If you're not in the buffet mood and want some soul-satisfying seafood stew dishes, Oyster Bar is a nice alternative.
271	Such an amazing experience! Highly recommend! Ken made our night, with his witty repartee and very descriptive instructions as to our selections, we were much more at ease. The food was really good too...a new take on traditional favs, keeping the menu secret till the very end...so it's a true mystery and adding to the experience. And they ask about any allergies or objections beforehand so they can make adjustments for each guest's preferences!! Not everything will be to everyone's liking, but with six courses (yes, LOTS of food) and a menu that changes every three months, you're bound to come away happy. I know I did.
272	Looking around the Farm at South Mountain, one could easily forget you were in Arizona.  With the large grassy field and mature pecan trees offering ample shade, it feels a bit more like the Midwest!  It offers a great backdrop for 3 great restaurants.  We have eaten at the Farm Kitchen twice in the last 2 weeks!  The soups are usually good.  Loved their turkey vegetable and black bean, but the enchilada soup was a bit greasy and one dimensional.  Desserts are very good.  My favorite is the chocolate cake! Da bomb!  However, the coconut cake is ho hum with little flavor.  The sandwiches are good.  The turkey was probably the best, and a recent special Grinder was good as well.  Good selection of chips and small sides to complete your meal! All served in adorable wicker baskets.\n\nGreat place to take kids!  Plenty of room to run and play and dogs are welcome too!  Great place to walk around or roll in the grass!
273	bumpin this place up to 4 stars since i always seem to come back here lol\n\nthis morning (more like noon) i had the la vaquera breakfast omelette. it has chorizo, salsa, green chiles, and it's topped with sour cream. it comes out looking like a pizza. it was very heavy (as expected) but realllly delicious! \n\ni tried a bit of my friends chicken fried steak and it was delicious. i kinda wished i had ordered that instead! \n\nso i figured out that the apple coffee cake is the one i like. you can always ask which type they have at the moment since it changes as diners order. the apple coffee cake was as warm and delicious as the first time i ever had it and i can't wait to go back and have it again.
274	Can I give less than 1 star? This place is a total scam. I asked for a deep clean of my home and paid extra for baseboards and blinds to be cleaned. They came for an hour and barely surfaced cleaned. They did not touch my baseboards or blinds. My shower was the same way it was when they came, there was dust on my bathroom sink and crumbs on my kitchen counters. I asked for them to make it right and they refused. Instead they insulted me because my house was not clean. But that is why I hired them. Very unprofessional.
275	On the right track....\n\nAre you new to Charlotte? Maybe you are from the Buffalo, NY area or just a Michigan grad a little home sick for the M Go Blue. Well Tavern on the Tracks has got your back. This bar is kind of a home away from home for the aforementioned areas. I really dig the decor of this place. It really screams: Look at me I am a great old school bar. \n\nI stopped by to watch the NBA Finals game seven between the Lakers\/Celtics. Just moving from Boston, I was rooting for the old home team. It was not meant to be as Lakers lead by their lead punk Kobe took out the Celtics as payback. This was a great spot to catch the game. The beers where cold and the food was pretty good. I really wanted the wings, which looked awesome, but decided to try the Steak in the Grass sandwich, basically steak with melted cheese and spinach on top. It was might tasty. The staff was top notch.\n\nSo if you are in the mood to catch the big game or cold one jump on the train and check out TT!
276	We were referred to Dr. Budd after having an orthodontist who was removed for serious issues relating to incompetency. My son had to start his treatment all over again and it was a nightmare. Fortunately, Dr. Budd knows what he is doing and was able to get my son on a good path and fix the poor work that had been completed previously. Dr. Budd and his staff are professional, fun, and kind. He also does a family movie day, which is great!!!  I never win any of the monthly contests that they have, but I will not hold that against them (:
277	I am totally a potato chip-loving girl. My teen years (prior to learning about weight gain and child-bearing hips) were spent eating a bag of chips in one sitting. But when my brother brought home a bag of Dilly Pickle popcorn from Popped, euphoria struck. Deliciousness without all the calories and fat? WIN!\n\nI've visited the store two times now. Both times, I've been barraged by constant offers of this sample or that sample - an instant thumbs-up in my book. The variety is what gets me: oh, Choke Me Jalapeno...but there's the Chocolate Piggy...wait, there's the Marilyn Monroe! Dirty Vegas remedies all of this - sharing the top spot in my heart with the Dilly Pickle. I can eat bags of this within minutes - a bite of Caramel, a kernel of Salty, a tad bit Chocolatey. Another win in my book would be the constant circulation of novel flavors, which are easily found through some Facebook creeping. \n\nAs for prices, a large bag of Dirty Vegas set me back six dollars. But the real value lies in those pretty tins. Ranging in the mid to high twenty dollar range, Popped offers a ten dollar discount for refills. Thank goodness I'm leaving Vegas or else my waistline might have to be on guard.\n\nPersonally, I am easily a culinary harlot: I like novelty. But when my friend who begrudgingly accompanied me the first visit fell in love with Popped, I knew it must be a testament to their greatness.
278	Most \"normal\" people keep photos of their kids on their person and show them off every chance they get. I however keep photos of pizza from Pizzeria Bianco saved in my phone and am happy to show them like a proud daddy. \n\nEveryone already knows that next door at Pizzeria Bianco, Paul is baking the absolutely best thin crush pizza in the country. The problem is takes three hours of anxious and painful waiting to get inside and sink your teeth into one of those delicious pies. \n\nSo what to do while waiting for the experience of a pizza lifetime? \n\nGrab a seat on the porch in front of Bar Bianco and tell stories and drink up. On a early spring day I can think of nothing better sitting outside drinking a cold pilsner with the faint smell of pizza making it was over to your nose. \n\nCome here in the summer and you will die from the intense heat. \n\nMinus 1 star for potential death from heatstroke
279	The place was really nice, clean and quiet. Even during lunch time. \n\nI got the shrimp and broccoli lunch special. It was really good! The vegetables were fresh and crunchy. The shrimp was very plentiful and well seasoned. The fried rice was good, not dry. \n\nThe people were very nice as well.
280	Great spot! The dishes are packed with flavor and love. Made with fresh ingredients.  Atmosphere is chill, awesome music playing overhead! Not loud but enough to bounce to.
281	Late last year I switched to Triumph when my previous company decided to raiser certain fees yet again. At that point, it made no sense to stay with them since the rents had declined tremendously. Triumph was more than wiling to charge a flat fee (half of my previous management fee) in order to get my business. There are always hurdles when changing companies and I needed to put my place back up for rent. They were able to get my apt. rented within an acceptable time frame and little by little we overcame all of the hurdles. Everything is running smoothly now, the employees are always very pleasant on the phone, and I am one satisfied customer. If after a full year of being with them, everything ends up status quo, I will upgrade this review to 5 starts without hesitation.
282	We found this restaurant by watching DDD, and while it is a bit of a trip, we planned it one day to go for a mid-day lunch, best time with a 2 year old after her nap.  Well, not here it is not.  Found out that they often close mid-day to re-supply.  Wish I knew that before showing up with a hungry wife and daughter.  We waited around downtown for an hour with some cranky family, but once we got the food, it was well worth it.\n\nWe got the Italian Stallion Pizza, which was good, but if you don't really like lots of meat, I would stay away from it, it's quite loaded with meat, but still very tasty.\n\nWe also got a really good Pasta dish, nice combination of broccoli, chicken and penne with a light sauce.\n\nThe staff did as much as they could with the first rush (which we were part of) and often making sure my 2 year old got plenty of bread to keep her happy.\n\nSince I have business meetings in downtown Glendale from time to time, I'm betting you will see me return, just well planned out on the timing next time.
283	AYCE Sushi, AYCT Service  (All You Can Tolerate)\n\nA lot of the sashimi I ordered was chewy, which is a horrible adjective to use for raw fish.  The usual mayonaisse bathed, over-riced rolls were present too, but what makes this place go from average to sub-par is the service.\n\nOur waitress looked very irritated each time she came by our table.  She dropped off our food at the table next to us, and then attempted to bring it to us after the diners had been poking at it in confusion.  Items were forgotten and never brought out, and no apologies were ever offered.  \n\nMy biggest issue here is that it says all over the menu, \"We charge for leftover food, including rice, 45 minute time limit.\"  If you're going to impose strict eating guidelines on your customers, at least present them with a pleasant experience and decent food.  \n\nThere are many AYCE places in town, I wouldn't return to this one.
284	My family has been here 3 different time.  Same Customer service every time.   They suck!!!!!    This last time I was giving it one last chance.  It was for my mom's birthday.  To remind y'all this casino isn't on the strip so the customer service should be better.   It was funny We asked for the manager and the manager tried to send the waitress to speak with us...... ah no I'm sorry We asked for the manager not for the waitress that ignored us the whole time.    We spoken to the manager on duty.  Didn't get her name but she was the older, skinny , Burnett.  She was no help at all.    She said that she trained her staff to have fantastic customer service........   yeah right.     I'm not sorry to say this but that Manager can't cut it as a cashier at McDonald's
285	I've been going to Vegas for years (being a CA native) and have always gone to the OG.  And in the years, you always want to wear sweatshorts because it just makes the dances that much better.  However, this time around, the OG said I didn't meet the dress code.  Weird because the other two dozen times, my money was good there.  Oh well, no more.  The girls were always in your face asking you for a dance.  If I wanted a dance, I woulda made eye contact and waved my Jackson.  F*ck OG.
286	Macaplines.. Go here for nostalgia, and a swell soda, float, or sundae. *Don't* go here for food. I've been to this place several times, I really enjoy the deserts and sodas. I've ordered food here a few times, and it just tastes so blah. I would really love it if they bought local and had more \"live\" food options. Everything just tastes \"dead\" and flavor less. The tomatoes and other veggies that I had were green and as tasteless as anything I'd get at a fast food joint. There are *very* limited vegetarian options, and maybe 1? vegan option.\n\nThey have a neat shop for clothing, jewlery, furniture, and bric a brac from days gone by. Sometimes I just stop by the shop.
287	I've been going to Ashlee for over three years now and I love my lashes so much! I get compliments on them all the time and I've never had a problem with them falling out or getting clumpy like I've had happen with other lash ladies I've went to in the past. She's always punctual and I can depend on her and she's always willing to work with my schedule when I need to get in for an unexpected visit. Her salon is spotless and she always has aromatherapy oils burning for a relaxed atmosphere. Oh and she gives a mean facial! Love her!
288	Tasty breakfast sandwich.\n\nI stopped by on a Friday morning and had to wait about 20 minutes in a line that wrapped down a hallway, while I waited another 15 minutes for the sandwich to be made; it's generally pretty busy, so allot the appropriate amount of time to get a sandwich. Luckily, it's worth the wait, as the ingredients are all top notch (especially the bread, which is hefty enough to hold the ingredients), and the cheese and sauce all go well together. I'd definitely come back to have a breakfast sandwich on the go.
289	I was at the Venetian and the Sands Convention Center for my work conference and I stopped here many times for snacks and meals.  They have some stuff in their refrigerated area - salads, sandwiches, drinks, as well as snacks like bars and chips.  I had their salads several times.  They were fresh, good toppings and dressing.  They also do coffees and have breakfast pastries.  The pastries were fresh and tasty.  The lines can be long sometimes but they go quickly and they usually have several cashiers working, plus the baristas.  Great place for a quick snack or coffee when you are between activities.
290	Great work on all my windows. They came in at 7am and finished at 1pm with all the windows protected by 12mil thick security film. Although, there was some damage when they removed my blinds and put it back. A couple blinds had broken pieces laying around that I did not notice until they were gone. Also, some of the windows have bubbles in them due to debris. But overall great service. Thanks Las Vegas Window Tinting!
291	Two words:  Claim Denied.\n\nEmbrace Pet Insurance I don't think ever covered my dog and she was insured since she was a puppy and has no health issues.  Guess what, they will find health issues.  They fill find ways not to cover you.  What I got was a head ache.  My dog has a bug, I brought her to the vet.  This adjuster, Christine W., came up with most insane and obscure reasons why my dog was not covered.  Pleasant as could be, she would protect her company from payouts like an Olympic champion!  Mine was only $300!  Honestly, at one point they told me my puppy had a degenerative back disease because they did not process the orthopedic report.  When that was cleared up she came up with a laundry list a mile long of illness my dogs must have that they can not cover!  This is when I cancelled the policy.  ENJOY YOUR TIME WITH YOUR DOG, it's PRECIOUS.  Save you money, put it in a Health Savings Account for your beloved BEST FRIEND!  Don't give your money to this scam.  Guess what, my dog is bred for health!  She and all her relatives are very very healthy!  What they say couldn't be further from the truth.  The people who respond to to these Yelp reviews are just trying to do damage control for those who haven't yet had the rude awakening that you are being taken for a ride.  Shame on them for marketing themselves as animal lover.  It takes a real heartless person to do what these claims adjustors do.
292	Worth the experience. They offer unique combination of flavors (and cultures). The black beans are addictive and are what link all of the other items together. I am a fan of jerk fried rice, emerald chicken quesadilla, and jade chicken. During the meal, I always think, this isn't that special, but by the end, the tin is clean and within a week later, I am craving it again. Enjoy.
293	Love love love Boaz Cafe!  I would eat here everyday if I could!  Boaz is located in my favorite part of Cleveland, Ohio City.  Walking in you kinda get a chipotle vibe, except it's Mediterranean food instead of Mexican.  My go to meal is the BYOB build your own bowl.   The BYOB is so great because you get so much healthy, flavorful and fresh food for only $7.00  You start off by choosing your base, greens or lentils and rice.  Then you choose your protein, beef or chicken.  Next, you top it off with hummus or baba, and then add some color by adding all the topping you like.  You also get to choose a dressing, and my favorite is the hot sauce.  Their hot sauce dressing is bomb!  One of the best dressings I've ever had!\nBesides the amazing food I love the feel of this place.  It's very casual and the space is big, bright and clean.  The staff is always super friendly and I just really enjoy coming here.  If you haven't been, drop what you're doing right now and go!  You'll thank me later :)
294	The food here is very over priced for what you are getting. It is very bland and basic. Save your money and go some other burger place, you'll get the same food for cheap. The serves is very rushed and slow. Good luck
295	I wanted to have a reason to fall in love with Mr.3's. I have a few reasons to like it but I don't think we can date. \n\nLet's not belabor the inevitable...\n\n3 STARS BECAUSE:\n- Great renovation of an older building; decor is nicely done with a rear bar, patio and stage for live music\n- Amazing, AMAZING food! Loved the crab legs, peel and eat shrimp and corn. \n- Decent customer service that is within the realm of their training\n- Decent location with fairly adequate parking\n\nNEEDS IMPROVEMENT:\n- New is not an excuse for inadequacy. During our visit they were operating on a late night REDUCED menu. We were told, by the staff, that this was due to low stock of food towards the end of the day. While this may be true, a restaurant should not communicate this to the customer. If you are running out of food, my assumption is that business is going well. Figure out a way to use your revenue to increase your food order. \n\n- Order packaging... my guest and I order the same thing. One order was packaged in one container. The other is two. \n\n- No crab crackers or seafood picks on the table...or even in the building. The staff mentioned that people steal the crab crackers. I'm not sure what's more sad...the fact that people steal them or the fact that I had to use another crab claw to crab my crab legs. \n\nI plan to visit again when I'm in the Gastonia area. Perhaps, our second date will be one of redemption.
296	This was my first In-N-Out Burger experience and I loved it. Their menu is simple and their prices are cheap. Their menu is so simplified that there's no small, medium, or large. It's just one size. There was a long line and the restaurant was almost packed. This was around 1pm on a Thursday.\n\nWe ordered a cheeseburger, fries, and a vanilla\/chocolate mixed shake. The burgers are huge. I could barely fit it in my mouth. It comes with lettuce and tomato for only $2.45. It was delicious with their house sauce that they put on it, kind of like Thousand Island. They gave a generous portion of fries for $1.65. Their fries are crispy and not greasy at all. I seen them fry it in the fryer, but it's as if it was air fried. It's one of the best tasting fries out there. Their shakes are thick and creamy, not overly sweet for $2.20. The hubby and I were fighting over the fries and the shake the whole time we were in the rental car. We should have just gotten our own but I didn't know how good it was going to be. I thought that it was going to be your average fast food.\n\nI saw people ordering fries topped with their house dressing, cheese, and grilled onions. I didn't see it on their menu. I asked around and come to find out that it's called Animal Fries. In-N-Out Burger has this secret menu where you get extra stuff on your food because their menu is so basic.\n\nI wish they'd open a location in Hawaii. The prices would be more, I'm certain. I'd pay it though, because their food is really good.
297	Nice bar, but otherwise gringo slop. This is amateur hour people. Their food  is a colossal failure. It's no wonder Bush likes to eat here when he is in town. No self respecting Arizonan or Mexican would ever return here for a second gastronomic beating. The beans were crap. The enchiladas were crap. The tacos were ok at best. The salsa wasn't great. There should be a helpline.
298	Loved Al's Deli! We came here during the weekend of the Cleveland marathon and, being as with many Midwestern cities, the downtown was totally DEAD on that Saturday, we found comfort at Al's Deli which was open and ready to serve its customers.\n\nAl was very friendly and accommodating. I had ordered the Mediterranean dish with hummus, tabbouleh, falafel and pita. He informed me they were out of that dish so I just decided to skip lunch since I wasn't that hungry anyway. But, he must have seen the disappointment in my face and he later let me know that they had found enough parsley to make the tabbouleh and they could in fact serve me this dish!\n\nAnd it was excellent. They also had a good selection of sandwiches and breakfast items to choose from. They are conveniently located downtown and the service was fast and friendly.\n\nI would definitely recommend Al's.
299	This is as authentic as you're going to get.\n\nI'll be straight up when I say that places like this can make me nervous.  The mall itself is sketchy...and it's in a sketchy part of town.  I make it this way every few weeks for some bánh mì at Le's, but came on a day that Le's was closed.  Dim sum?...or the place with ducks hanging in the window?  We opted for the ducks in the window and chose Hong Kong BBQ.\n\nWhen you enter Hong Kong BBQ...you can tell there's going to be a communication issue.  There is literally...not a single thing resembling \"American\" in this restaurant.  I knew I was going to like this place.  I did my best not to look back at the kitchen.  We all know what that is going to look like...and I'd rather play dumb.  Dangit!  I looked.\n\nThe service was quick and the food was great!  We were even entertained with Chinese soccer on their small TV.\n\nI'd recommend coming here if you're an adventurous person...otherwise...you'll never make it as far as the door...much less the table.
300	In a word... Fantastic!\n\nLike a Phoenix from the flames, The Diamond has resurrected, reopened and is sparkling brighter than she has in many a year!   Given a chance I predict that this little iconic jewel will be a big hit in Plaza Midwood neighborhood. I was there for lunch on 2\/18 and what a joyous sight to see the place packed and a line out the door!  I ordered the fried catfish sandwich, which came with a vinegar based slaw, hush puppies and French fries.  I was quite pleased with the food, but what was even more delicious was the nourishment for my soul.  I was a huge fan of the original hole-in-the-wall Diamond, and it made me so happy to see her all polished up and back in action.  Everything new, fresh and lovingly put together.  I couldn't help but take a peek at the men's room while I was there.  Low and behold if it's not all gussied up too. (Previous Diamond die-hard fans will no doubt remember how truly disgusting the original restrooms were.)\n\nJimmy, I can't give you 5 stars today, because obviously you guys were overwhelmed by all the positive energy returned to you on the official grand opening day, but you can bet I'll be back to give you lots more practice time!\n\nBravo!
301	It's my favorite bar on Mill. Period.\n\nBut...before you run over there I need to ask you a couple questions: Do you actually like beer, and Are you a douchebag? I just don't want anyone spoiling my happy place. Please go to Firehouse or something...I beg of you.\n\nAnyway - They have a perfectly planned, concise menu. Decide what you feel like and they will have the most fruity, dry, hoppy, chocolatey, malty (anything) draughts and\/or bottles to fulfill your desires. White Chocolate Ale? Oh, they have it. A rare Belgian Framboise? Drink it up.\n\nIf you're hesitant about beer, but still not trainwrecky enough to hang out at the other Mill spots, you can get a \"beer cocktail\". Promise you can't go wrong here.\n\nLastly (but definitely not least)...there's the food - Comforting, simple, child-hood memory evoking, local deliciousness. \n\nThe patio is perfect, the food is divine, and the beer is everything you'd want on your wishlist.\n\nI post this with hesitation. Don't ruin my joint!
302	Called today looking for a corned beef brisket. The man who answered the phone clarified that it was NOT lunchmeat I was looking for, but a brisket to cook. He said they have several and to come on down. I did. Waited 45 min in line. When I asked for a corned beef brisket the guy behind the counter looked at me like I was crazy. I explained that I called... And he told me... Yeah... Not. These geniuses couldn't find their pork butt with both hands. Won't be wasting my time going back.
303	I had lunch here again the other day and I realize I was either very high or absolutely starving last time I ate here. This visit I pretty much had the opposite experience. The food was horrible. The salsa had chunks of tomatoes as big as my fist, the burrito was dry and bland. They sat us in a room under a TV and it was so loud we could barely talk. I'll have to go back though... At least give them one more shot..
304	So normally I can brag about Apple's customer service but unfortunately this visit I can't brag about. I go in with my service dog, spend $40 on a new screen protector, I go to the Apple Store because I'm used to them installing it for me,  they honestly do a lot better of a job then I can I get kind of shaky and mess it up quite a lot, And I get told that he actually is not able to install a screen protector for me and that it's brand-new policy, so I guess don't go to this Apple Store expecting them to install your screen protector for you. I got told to go to the AT&T Store if I want someone to install it, so now I am driving over there. I would've bought the screen protector from AT&T if I would've known that I would've had to deal with an apple employee that's so rude he can't help someone that has epilepsy and their service dog with them and saw a screen protector. So now I'm driving to AT&T. Thank you for wasting my gas and time Apple!
305	I've stayed in a lot of nice hotels and the Wynn Tower Suites are up there with the best of the best. The room was complete with all the bells and whistles you could want and the service was amazing. From arrival to check out everyone at the Wynn was super friendly. I will stay there again except next time I'll leave the toddler at home so that my husband and I can truly enjoy our self.
306	I LOVE this place. I hadn't touched my brows since I last wrote a review and they looked like fuzzy caterpillars until I strolled on in.\n\nOn their website they have daily deals and on Wednesday they have an eyebrows and upper lip combo for $11. The woman that serviced me thought it was funny that I referred to it as a \"deal\" but it totally was! Forget deal, it's a steal! (It's also a combo - you can kind of mix and match, but I'll stick with the original combo.)\n\nAgain, absolutely painless (how do they do it?) and absolutely perfect brows. They're not out there to shape them, just clean them up, and for that, I can relax the moment I lie down in the chair.\n\nI also noticed that they have henna for $5 (I plan on going one day just for that) and massages that are $1 a minute, for 15 or 30 minutes\/dollars. To date, that is the best deal I have seen in the city, but no sign of RMT license. \n\nThe ladies who work here are as nice as can be and smile so much. On my way out I was wished \"a GREAT day\" at least four times. Thanks!\n\nBollywood and aloe cream still reign supreme at this place. I am fiercely loyal to Perfect Threading.
307	Always a friendly staff and a great place to come to watch a game or two. Bar is set up perfectly for sports. Boneless buffalo wings are great.  I could eat a pound of them. Spicy and hot, go perfect with an ice cold beer. Had the sirloin, which was my first steak in about 6 months. Couldn't finish it. Wasn't great, but wasn't bad. Just average and didn't leave me wanting more like other steaks I had locally at Long Horn. Overall, stick to the simple stuff and you can't lose. Leslie is a great bartender and always greets you with a smile.
308	This place does really really good sandwiches and salads, and it's super cheap to boot!\n\nA small sandwich and a large salad is probably more than enough for most people, and costs less than $7. Their egg rolls are home-made, and are a good fast (but not too unhealthy) option. The large sandwiches are 2x the small ones, and are more than enough to fill me at lunch time.\n\nThis place can get pretty busy around lunch time, so try to come just before\/after if possible. Even if you come at peak hour the service is good, so you won't be waiting too long. You can get some sandwiches\/other lunch options from the fridge (if you're in a rush), but I like mine freshly made.\n\nMy favourite is their salami sandwich, but they have a lot of other toppings to choose from (including vego options), and you can make your own. \n\nThey also have a range of sweets (chocolate muffins, banana bread, etc) which I think are mostly from Costco, but I still buy them regularly ('cause they're good).
309	First time i went, it was amazing & fun. I came at 10:30 so i got in free and people dont show up until like 1 so at first i was just like oh this shit is boring but when it hit ! or 2 a.m. it was sooo fun. They dont close til 5 or 6 a.m. So before 11 it's $10 and after 2 it's $20. Soo i decided to go back the weekend after and it was a shit load of old people, and another thing that i dont like its that a few guys cant take no for an answer but i will definitely go again in the future.
310	Didn't realize how expensive this restaurant is! The quality of food wasn't worth the price; it was like something you can get at a food court.\n\nWhen we got there, we were given menus to order in the lobby before going to the dining area. We were then escorted into the dark by our waiter my holding their shoulder.\n\nI was surprised at the ambiance of the restaurant. The place is underground and the entrance looks like a dungeon lol. The lobby is dark and has a medieval feel. Of course the actual eating area was pitch black so I couldn't comment on the look, but I can feel the tables were wooden and the chairs were the metal banquet chairs. \n\nTo begin, we were given bread and butter (the bread was warm and soft with a crispy crust). There was a metal fork and knife (feels cheap) on the right of the table, a polycarbonate plastic cup of cold water on the right, a small ceramic plate with a napkin and a small whipped butter pod on top, in the middle.\n\nThe surprise appetizer was calamari! I had four pieces and they were really nice and crispy. It had tartar sauce and some sweet plum-like sauce.\n\nI chose cajun fish as my entree. It was served on a bed of plain rice and boiled beans on the side. The fish was seasoned very generously, crispy crust and soft. Eating in the dark was challenging! I ended up using my hands to eat.\n\nI chose the chocolate mousse as my dessert and it was very decadent and rich. After a few spoons, it was too sweet for me. Lots of layers between mousse and cake.\n\nI felt that we were there for a long time--1.5 hours! There was too much waiting time between each meal. Our seating was 6:30 and was there until 8pm.\n\nThe room was also very loud! Most of the time, we had to shout across the table.\n\nThe staff was great though, friendly.\n\nGlad we had a Groupon. I was shocked when our bill came to $100 before tax and tip. That entree was not worth $30. Note that even for a table of 2, the minimum tip is 18%.\n\nThis is a one-time experience kind of thing; cool to do but I wouldn't go again.
311	I feel very conflicted writing the review, but at this point, I can say I won't be returning here.\n\nPros: Brussel sprout Nachos are to die for. Atmosphere\/decor is nice too.\n\nCons: Service. it was disappointing having to valet on a weeknight during the summer. My friends and I walked in behind another group. There was already a large group in the entrance waiting as well. We stood for 5 mins and none of the staff members even looked our way. \n\nEventually, we approached a waiter near the bar who was rude and told us to wait to be seated, and we said there had been no host and we'd been waiting for quite some time. He said our name would get put down on the list and that there was a 15 minute wait even though a majority of the patio tables were open. We head back to the entrance the hostess comes up to us saying \"I thought you were with the big group\", so in that case she didn't have a good sense of her surroundings. She immediately seated us, so that other waiter was misinformed as well and lacked empathy.\n\nOverall the staff seemed very unapologetic and unhappy. Not a lot of smiling going around, and it was awkward being on the patio with the male waiter we'd spoken to helping every other tables but ours, since we were assigned a different female waitress. You could tell he was trying to avoid us and it was blatantly obvious.\n\nThe nachos are so good but there are so many other good restaurants in town, so I won't be returning.
312	Unfair and heavy handed business practices. Remember its only about $$ for this company. I had Contract for six months to rent or sell property in Sun City, no renters until I went to cancel their contract and go with another realtor. Love new realtor, Debra Pollard.
313	I know this place; because, I spent well over 13 hours here recently.  The US Airways Club was the only reason I didn't completely lose it that day.\n\nThe club is small, very small, but it did the trick.  It provided me with a quiet, safe, clean place I could call my \"home\".  I was able to leave my bag without the fear of some d-bag stealing it.  I was able to watch TV without having announcement after announcement blaring in my ear.\n\nSnacks were gross, but I wasn't expecting anything, so the mere fact they had something to pick from was a plus.\n\nThe staff was SUPER accommodating, always making light of the shitty situation and doing whatever they could to make my stay a pleasant one.  After visiting, I quickly pick up a membership.\n\nThank you US Airways for preventing me from going Ape $hit that day.  It served as my own little Oasis in the PHX Airport.
314	Coming into Mazda I was greeted by Sam who made my car buying process great. He's been helpful with getting me a good deal and is super informative about the cars on the lot. \nThis is my first Mazda and I love it. Great on gas, sleek exterior and nice upgraded interior. Definitely recommend this location and having Sam as your guy to get your deal!
315	My roommate and I dropped in here for a quick sandwich. I had the Hawaiian bread pulled pork and slaw, and he had the brisket sandwich. The food here is always pretty good and these were no exception.\n\nWe did manage to sit with an angle into where they did the prep. The floor was covered in food, and my roommate saw a girl take a wet rag and squeeze it all over the floor and some food containers.....ewww. All the workers were teenagers, no manager around. This is not good. 4 stars for the sandwich, -1 star for the scene behind the counter.
316	I'm thrilled with the work Do My Resume did for me, especially the writer Lindsay who was the creator of my new resume packet.  Her work is high quality, spot on, and she completed the job quickly.  \n\nHighly recommend this company, and would\/will use them again in a heartbeat.
317	Open your mouth and let me shove this killer breakfast joint's food in your face! Ya...that good. The date was Mothers day and it was packed! My Wife made reservations well in advance and when we arrived we had to wait. We waited 30+ minutes. Big fucking deal. Put your snappy chat, instagram and twitter down and spend some time....you know, talking and hugging it out with your Family. The Restaurant brought out Mimosa's to the hungry and thirsty. I thought they handled themselves well considering the mob and the special day! All that aside, yelp is not about your rude waitress, the slow cook time. We want to know about the food. Every Chef, cook, hostess and waiter\/waitress is bound to have a bad day. Please stop bitching about that stuff. Get down to the food. We had a large group and here is a list of everything I actually tasted.\n\nLemon Ricotta Pancakes - Awesome. Buttery, Lemony, Crisp and Soft edges with moist middle. Almost my favorite ever. Served with a delicious Lemon ricotta topping.\n\nCanolli Donut - Excellent. I would expect canolli creme to be fantastic coming from a Tomasso. \n\nCarne Asada Hash Skillet - Perfectly marinated flat iron with two perfectly poached eggs. Very flavorful on a bed of hash brown cubes potatoes, they could have been crispier and green chilis.\n\nOreo Pancakes - Delicious in their own right, did not taste much like an OREO. That being said, they were still cream worthy. ya, know...OREO cream worthy.\n\nCarrot Cake Pancakes - Damn good. Like if Upper crust bakery from the long ago Timothy's decided to make pancakes. The crispy fried carrots on top was spot on, different and texturally tasty.\n\nLamb Hash - Bomb. Period. If you love lamb don't miss this. Juicy seasoned lamb with poached eggs and browns. Good Shit!!\n\nSmoked salmon Benedict. Really, should I go on. Excellent!!\n\nLastly.... Fruity Pebble Yogurt Breakfast Popcicles. Holy Shit Fred. What a fun and tasty way to start a breakfast. Not filling and full of flavor. I never thought it would work but those pops blew me away. Like a palleta pop thats creamy, a bit tangy from the yogurt and sweet and crispy. Yah, it's good.\n\nThat's it. I did not taste one thing that was meh. All food exceeded my expectations. The owner was out and he was very accomodating considering how busy he was. He was funny, relaxed and a small part of why my Family will be back. Can't wait. Fortunate they are right down the road from my house. My waiter. who my Wife said was a manager...I don't know how...was really good. He actually came back and thanked me for my tip. I think he was stunned, I was hoping that if I made him happy, since he made me and my Family happy, that mood would transcend to other diners waiting in the mad house. \n\nCheers
318	Food was okay, I am not waiting all day for it though.  If I could go in and get a table right away I'd eat here again, but waiting more than 10 minutes, no thank you!  I would rather walk to Matadors or First Watch....\n\nP.S. Go for the rosemary potatoes not the hash browns, unless, of course, you would like some hash browns with your grease.
319	Sad and confusing lunch experience. I mistakenly went to Sakura as I thought it was Teriyaki Madness which I'd bookmarked as a place to escape for lunch. Teriyaki Madness is somewhere down the road and because I'd already parked and walked up to the door, it wasn't worth another 15 minutes for me to hop down to Teriyaki Madness. What a tragic mistake.\n\nCalling Sakura a restaurant is generous. Service was terrible-the girl who was playing cashier was rude and was having conversation with the other two guys behind the counter while I was ordering. Ramen isn't a complicated order, but at least give me the courtesy of your full attention when I'm ordering my food. I got the tonkatsu ramen and my Maruchan packet of noodles was served with a questionably cloudy broth (too much miso?) and three thin and DEEPLY unsatisfying pieces of pork. Yes I counted them. I kept hoping that my wandering chopsticks would bump into another piece of pork but kept coming up empty. I am embarrassed to say I finished most of the bowl because I was so hungry. \n\nI am also embarrassed to admit that I tipped $1 because this is one of those fast food establishments that presumptuously adds a tip line on their receipts. The only service I got here was someone dumping a pack of noodles into a plastic bowl, stirring up the ingredients and serving it to me when the noodles were soft. This does not constitute a tip of any sort and based on the uncomfortable 30 seconds at the register, watching the sushi chef roll sushi, ordering sushi does not warrant a tip either. He made one of the sloppiest rolls I've ever seen. If someone served me that roll, I'd send it back...and I don't send anything back. \n\nYes, along with shamefully terrible ramen, they dare to serve eat-at-your-own-risk sushi. I imagine the rest of the menu is unauthentic Americanized Japanese dishes.  I'd rather go lick the floor of the Chipotle next door than eat here again. But I'll probably just get a burrito instead.
320	Grand opening today! I'm so happy Will and Mike now have a permanent place...in Chinatown. They are good peeps.\n \nI finally got to try their cantaloupe snow and it's delicious with mochi. I've tried all their flavors and my favorite is mango because it's made with real mangoes...all their snow flavors are made with natural ingredients this is why I love this place. Dessert sans guilt!\n\nThe now have combos such as Cookie Dream (vanilla snow, Oreos, chocolate sauce), Smooth Green Tea (green tea snow, red bean and condensed milk), Black Sesame Sensation (black sesame snow, mochi and condensed milk), etc.\n\nI got to try the Black Sesame Sensation and added egg pudding to it. Liked it a lot. They have 3 sizes now. Kid's size went kaput.\n\nGreat way to beat the heat. There's no reason for anyone not to go here. After a great meal at neighboring restaurants such at Kabuto, Japanese Curry Zen, Raku, Monta and Trattoria Nakamura-Ya...you should get dessert here.
321	DO NOT - I REPEAT - DO NOT take your loved one here. This facility needs to be shut down. Kindred is no better. I know that Select and Kindred are pretty much the only two Long-Term Acute Care (LTAC) hospitals around, so there are not many choices. I wound up taking my mother home on a ventilator and hiring 24-hour respiratory therapists and CNAs so that she would not have to suffer through Select or Kindred. There is a loophole for doing this. Most hospitals will not discharge a patient home on a ventilator. If possible, sign your loved one out under hospice, which relieves the hospital from liabilities (then simply do not use all the hospice services, such as illegal morphine assisted suicide). Sign up with a hospice provider who will allow you to pay for the ventilator ($1500\/mo), vent supplies ($500\/mo) and respiratory equipment at home. In some cases you can do the respiratory therapy yourself as a family member after some training. Once you are home, you can switch from hospice to palliative care, if you like. I realize that not everyone can afford to do this, but the state may assist with some of the costs. Bottom line, I would never, ever, ever ever put a loved one in Select or Kindred. The doctors gave my mother just three months to live with stage 4 lung cancer three years ago. This hospital nearly killed her by overdosing her with oxycodone (I have proof of this on a video and the charge nurse admitted to it). My mother would have died in Select had we kept her there much longer, I really think.
322	Loved this place!  The food was awesome and the Sangria was fantastic!  Everyone was friendly. We went back the next day for dessert and more sangria because we were too full for it after our dinner.
323	One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. It helps to know your middle eastern foods before you arrive as there's not much in the way of descriptions, but they do a great job. Grill and prepared stuff is all excellent, but the chicken shawarma platter with chick peas is where it's at
324	Excellent, Brazilian flavoured meats. Prepared fresh and juicy. The side dishes are more than just afterthoughts, they are excellent examples of real cooking. A nice selection of sweet desserts, good salad bar and overall nice ambiance. All this would rate 4.5 stars by itself, but the service is what really makes it 5 stars. Friendly and informal, yet attentive and quick. We are very pleased with our first visit. Looking forward to our next visit.
325	Menoum menoum. If you are craving Quebec's comfort food, there you have it.  Do not expect to have your fresh veggies nor salad.  At Mâche, it is meant to fill you up with some loooooveee and loads of carbs.  They have a meanass pâté chinois in a variety of different types such as pulled pork, spicy, three meats... the mashed potatoes are creamy, the ratio of ground meat and corn is perfect and the seasoning on point.  The spicy pâté chinois will light a spark in your mouth for sure! Their poutine is heary as well with good greasy fries and a delicious gravy.  And if you are a fan of onion rings, make sure to taste them! They are oh so crunchy and HUGE! Ahhhhhh, i LOVE that place!
326	Walking the strip and the guy said two for one which caught my attention. Service was actually really good, The drink was a little watered down. I love the steak fries and the burger was actually good. The one negative was my friend said no tomato on her burger as she is allergic to tomatoes and they still added it so we had to send it back. Over all decent place for a burger and fries.
327	WTF. this is a COMPLETE knockoff of Father's Office in LA!\n\nCheaters!!!! \n\nHOW UN-ORIGINAL and TYPICAL OF PHOENIX.\n\nIsn't this illigal?\n\nhttp:\/\/www.fathersoffice.com\/html\/fathersOffice.html
328	Server we very polite and attentive. She described the special of the day and I went for it. The chorizo omelet was pretty good, portions are great, service was great, no complaints. My husband and I really had a great experience.
329	Attended a networking lunch with a selection of 6 or 8 items to choose from.  I selected the Mediterranean salad for $12. I found the salad to be overly dressed with a thick,  creamy dressing.  Surprising choice when a red wine or balsamic vinaigrette would have been both more authentic to the Mediterranean cuisine and would not have weighted the salad down so much.  The large wedges of tomato in the salad were not cored and not very ripe or flavorful. The chicken on the salad was seasoned well.  There was a generous portion of artichoke hearts and kalamata olives which help provide acid and flavor to better balance the creamy dressing. Service was friendly and efficient given the size of the business crowd. Bottom line, although not in love with the selected dish, ready to give it another try with a different selection due to the service and convenient business meeting space.
330	Oodle Noodle doesn't scream authentic Japanese udon but lesson learned, never judge a book by its cover.\n\nWe arrived, just after noon on a Sunday, to a restaurant that was basically empty; I was gripping my seat the entire car ride there to the possibility of a long, arduous wait. We were greeted with much enthusiasm and taken immediately to a comfortable table towards the back. Our waitress was incredibly attentive and it was fun watching the chef, through the glass, working his magic.\n\nJapanese Style Rich Uni Udon ($15.80) -- Chilled dashi broth with udon noodles, julienne shiso leaves and seaweed topped with Santa Barbara uni. The udon noodles were firm with just a hint of sweetness. Santa Barbara uni is my favorite, so sweet and creamy. It was like it dissipated in my mouth which was incredibly heartbreaking! I was a little surprised that the soup  was chilled but it worked out in its favor. The combination of chilled soup and perfect noodle portion left me full but not stuffed. \n\nThe restaurant menu is filled with oodles of noodles so if you enjoy udon, this place should be at the top of your Vegas list!
331	This was my first visit to Topgolf. The security guard outside wouldn't let me in with my water bottle. It's Arizona in May. You should be able to go everywhere with water bottles, this is a safety issue. When I tried to explain this to the security guard, he made me throw it in the trash. That didn't give me a very good first impression of the business and I hadn't even made it in the door yet. \n\nI ordered a membership card online prior to arriving because I was told that it would be easier than waiting in line to buy one there. I still had to wait in line to pick it up and when I did, they had no record of my purchase. When I showed them my receipt email on my phone, the receipt that was sent to me was for another person. I spoke with a manager and forwarded him the emails so that he could send it to corporate to investigate. Safe to say, I'm a bit nervous that they can't keep receipts straight in email I'm worried about them having my credit card information. \n\nAll in all, a negative first experience. I will wait to see how the membership issue is resolved, but as it stands right now I was not impressed enough to want to give them any more of my money.\n\nUpdate: After 2 weeks, no one from the company has reached out to me about my issue despite being promised that I would hear from someone within a day or two. I am very disappointed in the customer service displayed by all levels of this company.
332	Got take-out to go for lunch at work. Decent food, nothing really great but certainly not bad. I would like to dine in at some point to give a better assessment but for now a would say this is a decent restaurant.
333	Restaurants that have you exit through the gift shop are a curious sort of place to dine. That someone thinks a restaurant even needs a gift shop might have some of the youngin's on Yelp confused (as opposed to immediately suspect). \n\n\"Zowie, Uncle Karl, are there dining experiences so amazing that you really want to buy a tshirt to let everyone know you supped there?\"\n\nThe short answer is \"no\". The long answer is still \"no\" but gather round, padawans, for another one of Uncle Karl's tales of 1990s horror. Bill Clinton was in the White House, a young Will Ferrell was teaching America to laugh, and people were seemingly growing tired of dining and then seeing a show, preferring to get back to their VHS systems and AOL. \n\nWhat if you could combine dining with some of the aspects of theater? Surely, Americans would flock to your door. The great thing about capitalism is it doesn't take much of an idea, or an idea at all, to set off a flurry of competition. \n\nRainforest Cafe, of which this Yelp review is about, is the sole remaining survivor of the great Themed Restaurant bubble of the 1990s. We had Planet Hollywood, Fashion Cafe, Harley-Davidson Cafe, Copperfield's Magic Underground, the Star Trek Experience Bar and Manatee's Coastal Sea Life Aquarium on a Plate. \n\nMost of these places went bust by the latter part of the millennium when it became apparent the market for $14 hamburgers served with potato chips was limited or might not have outright existed. Staring at a glass display case containing the sari Ben Kingsley wore in Gandhi really doesn't make your burger taste any better, no matter what a marketing guru in a pastel blazer (http:\/\/www.wallpaperbase.com\/wallpapers\/movie\/miamivice\/miami_vice_2.jpg) tells you.\n\nSo the question remains why the Rainforest cafe survived the Great and Horrible Themed Restaurant Contraction of 2000. You still get a $14 burger that comes with potato chips. There's a $1 extra option for fries. Maybe that saved them. While kids no doubt have no clue why an adult would want to, or should, get excited about dining next to a display case containing Tom Cruise's first pair of Wayfares or a guitar signed by the members of Chalk Circle, an animatronic monkey on a swing that lights up every fifteen minutes is pure crack to an 8 year old.\n\nThe children like this place. I guess. If you don't like dining with children, or prefer to simply dine on them, you might want to give this place a pass. If you have kids and have never considered the wisdom of turning them into a ready source of protein, this might be cheaper than a day at Wonderland.
334	Note: This review is ONLY for their bakery.\n\nI ordered a cake for the boy's birthday, sight and taste unseen.  I have never been to Hubbard Avenue.  I was drawn in by their online order form that listed sizes, cake flavors, filling flavors, and frosting flavors.  There were just so many options!  And for $12.99!  Sold!\n\nI called up and ordered a mocha cake with raspberry filling and mocha frosting.  The lady on the phone told me how good that sounded.  I know, Phone Lady, I know.  She asked for an inscription.  She then asked if I wanted any particular decoration.  Baffled, I said no, they could do whatever they wanted.  Upon hanging up, I hit myself in the forehead.  I should have specified that the cake was for a 31 year old man, not a 5 year old boy.  Shit.  Hopefully they don't put clowns or pokemon or something stupid on it.\n\nI picked it up, and I was extremely pleased.  It was a pretty little cake, the color of wet sand, with a palm tree on it.  Tasteful (pun not intended)!  Professionalism and prettiness aside, it was a gloriously delicious cake.  The best part really is the mocha buttercream frosting.  I want that frosting on everything I eat from now on.  It'll be worth weighing 400 pounds.
335	First off, let me emphasize that this review is not about the service, which is actually quite good and attentive. The hostess was very sweet. Our two waiters were on top of things from start to finish. This is a frank review of an establishment which includes the word \"prime\" in their name. \"Prime,\" as in \"superior,\" or \"top of the line.\"\n\nKelly's is NOT \"prime.\" So reel back any such expectations.\n\nI've read that Kelly's is where Ruth Chris Steakhouse once stood. By my observations, the ownership has invested very little money into refurbishing a restaurant which shows a great deal of mileage. The carpeting is old, and while not filthy, it does show the kind of wear and tear that shampooing simply cannot remove. The entire establishment is in dire need of fresh paint. Why would anyone looking to open a new establishment skimp on such relatively inexpensive basics? \n\nI've read other Yelpers state that Kelly's smells of insecticide. I didn't detect any such smell, but the place does smell stale and musty (my guess is the old carpeting and interior paint are the sources). \n\nAs for the food....just okay. We had a coupon from Travel Zoo. They honored the coupon according to the terms, but the overall quality was disappointing. The wedge salad was good, but the petite fillet mignon wasn't particularly tender. The au gratin potatoes were undercooked. I'd rate the food a B+ for quantity, but only a C for quality. And that's not \"Prime.\"\n\nThis place has potential, but it's not even close to being there yet. They need to close down for 6 months or so and do it right. Right now, it's lipstick on a pig.\n\nPass on Kelly's until they make the necessary improvements to live up to their name (Kelly's \"PRIME\" Steak & Seafood). There are many, many better options in Las Vegas. If our party had to pay full price for this dining experience, we would've been pretty unhappy about it.
336	Avoid this place at all costs. The food is disappointing. Also, the owner (manager?) regularly blocks the bike lane in front of the shop to unload food items from his car. It's not only illegal, but dangerous to road users. Besides, the car looks very dirty on the inside. I wouldn't want to eat anything that has been transported in there.
337	Like everyone has said... It is in a crapy location. The food was ok, again like others said SALTY! You almost need to take a diuretic when you get home. They will not substitute anything for you. The first and probably only time there, I got the lunch combo and asked if I could substitute the hot and sour soup for the egg drop. The Asian man started screaming, \"no subtooshin, no subtooshin, it say no subtooshin\". I'm thinking damn, it was only a request. I said \"ok\", then he starts in with \"hot sour soup very special, feed 6 people, has lots of stuff in it\". I said ok, and he again said \"I no subtoot, you get soup\". Ok. Kinda funny when I look back at it. Maybe that is why it was me and one more table for lunch.
338	Went to this restaurant for lunch. Biggest problem was finding parking in this parking lot at lunch time! \n\nThe place was packed when we got there (I guess that's a good thing). We had the Nachitos as a starter (pretty good but not much quantity) and I ordered the chicken Pad Thai as my main course. The quality and quantity of the pad thai was good and I was happy with it (even had some left over to bring home) but the food was a bit pricy. \n\nOverall I would recommend this place to someone who wants to try a different restaurant other than the usual kelseys, BP, etc. as they do have a pretty good menu that has a few things I haven't seen before (swordfish burger!)
339	Used to love this place years ago when they opened but since they change shifts the menu has seriously gone down. I don't recommend this place at all anymore
340	Now I know why they say that you should wait a few months before trying a brand  new restaurant. We heard about this place while at Mi Va Mi (which I go to whenever I'm in town) and decided to try it. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Ba-Li Laffa. The humus with mushrooms was ok but the lamb kebab with 'special' rice was awful. The lamb was basically pieces of grilled fat. And the rice was    overcooked white rice with canned peas and carrots. Not so special after all. The server-Anais-while sweet wasn't all that well trained and kept apologizing. We asked for the chicken Shish Kebab and it was just OK. Nothing special or even good.  They left off the potato garnish on this one so I can't comment on what potentially could have been the only edible item.  Needless to say, the experience left us cold. And hungry. We gave our feedback to the server but got the feeling that it would fall on deaf ears. While I'm all for competition, I don't think Mi Va Mi has much to worry about.  Unless that is Ba-Li Laffa gets a real chef and someone to run the place. I was shocked that no one came over to get a read from us. After all, in this age of customer crowd sourcing they're missing out on not only constructive criticism but a chance for redemption.
341	This place is amazing.  We had reservations for a Friday night and we were seated immediately upon arriving.  The waitress was really nice and friendly and gave us complimentary shots of something delicious... maybe it had rhubarb in it??  Our drinks were great, and the food is some of the best in the Madison area.  We had a mushroom (I think they were morels?) appetizer that was perfectly balanced with the light flaky pastry and delicious sauce.  Then we had the bacon wrapped fig appetizer and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  Seriously, you need to order this, you will be so happy you did.  It was complex and a little bit goes a long way, but the flavors explode in your mouth.  We had the lamb dinner, and again, top notch.  Then we had the two creme brulee desserts - my husband had the brown sugar and I had the dark chocolate.  He liked his better and I liked mine better, so I'm not sure there was a clear winner, but we were both so happy with our choice.  The cool creamy custard with the hot crispy sugared top... yum.   This is going to be my go-to restaurant for birthday dinners, anniversary dinners, and any time I get to choose where we eat!
342	I drive this location everyday heading to and from work. Today I stopped by.. my son and I walked to a super nice super clean McDonald's. This visit was my first using the kiosk. I will say they are very user friendly. I was able to navigate quickly through the menu. While I was ordering the cashier took the time and went out of her way to give my son a toy. Super appreciative of that!!! The staff as a whole are friendly!! I recommend the kiosk experience if you haven't tried it! \nThank guys!!
343	A sister restaurant to my homebase Robbie Fox's.\nI was lucky to attend a soft opening a few weeks back and was unbelievably impressed. The building is gorgeous, the decor and design are superb. I especiallly liked seeing all the different rooms and pictures, especially all the ones of JFK! The old church organ in the main dining room is a wonderful touch! Since it is a new establishment, the new servers will eventually get their legs, same goes for the food being cooked in the back. Chef Mark though has created a wonderfully tasteful menu. It makes me jealous of the food at Robbie's. The owner's Robbie and Dominic have worked very hard on this new pub and it shows. I wish I lived closer to it though, there are no signs of obnoxious ASU students to detract from the environment!!!! I forsee Johnny Fox's becoming the best pub in the west valley; dishing out pints of \"Craic\" for years to come!
344	By the time I ate here, I was totally cynical of all Scottsdale restaurants and was really thinking about having my lunch at In-N-Out.  \n\nI got off to a really bad start at this place, too, they made me wait for a table at this half empty restaurant.  Which was okay, I guess, because D. Frank Designs is across the street.   Anyway, I come back, the sweet little hostess girl has my table ready, but the poor girl is limping because she fell at home the night before and hurt her knee!!  She even shows me the damage!  So, I guess it's okay that I had to wait a bit.  I mean the poor working girl is maimed!!!\n\nSo, wouldn't you know, she sits me in front of a window and it's hot as blazes there.  Geez.  So, I complain to my delightful servers Byran and Melia.  Yes, I get two servers.  I think they can easily identify a tough customer at this joint.  I quickly identified them as Mutt & Jeff.  So, Byran says he will tamper with my ventilation and I think, ya right.  But right away, it gets cooler and so do I.  \n\nAnyway, this place has \"Republic of Tea\" tea.  You can't go wrong with any establishment that serves Republic of Tea.  I'm getting stoked now.  So, anyway, I check out the menu and can't decide what I want.  I mean, I'm starving, but I'm not that hungry.  Bryan convinces me to try the Stetson.  He says that if I don't love it, he will take it back and get me something else.  He says that no one has ever sent back the salad.  That's a challenge I can't pass up on.  So, I've finally made up my mind and then that wonderful Melia  comes out with some incredible hummus, fresh chopped salsa and spinach tortillas to tide me over until my salad come.  The flavors were so amazing together!  So fresh and delicious!\n\nNext comes my Stetson Salad.  I don't need to describe it, because every yelp-er before me has done an excellent job.  But you don't know how really amazing this salad is until you try one yourself.  It is so incredibly good.  It's the first and only time that I have ever finished any salad anywhere.  It was so amazing.\n\nAnyway, the sad part for me was that this was my last meal in Scottsdale.  And it was just lunch.  I wish I would have eaten here sooner and I wish I could have experienced dinner.  I will be back.  And Cowboy Ciao will be my first stop next time.\n\nOne of the things that I think sets this place apart, (besides the interesting food),  is the incredible service.  I felt like I was visiting Bryan's and Melia's and they were there to take care of me.  It's a very friendly place, I love that!!
345	Stopped here with my sis on the way back from the airport. Nice quaint little place. The food wasn't spectacular but nice options and definitely a better experience than the local chains like IHOP and Denny's. A little pricey would be my only complaint - $38 for 2 breakfasts and a coffee drink. Still it's definitely worth trying.
346	I've had dinner here a few times and it seems that food quality gets worse with each visit. Yesterday was definitely my last.  The sangria I ordered was made from wine made out of someone's garage. Poor garbage. Should be ashamed of yourself for serving this crap. The pizza was not cooked. The crust was raw. The calamari were recooked and nuked in the microwave. The service was slow. No bread was served or water. With service like this, it won't take long for people to stop dining here. If I could give no stars, I would.
347	Excellent!  Office is clean and the staff is awesome.   They went out of  their way to help me understand the treatment I needed  and how it worked with my insurance benefits.
348	Yikes. Where do I start? Well, we walked in around 2 pm on a Sunday and were told to sit at a two top. Waited around 15 minutes and no one came over to say hi or give us menus. The servers looked a bit frazzled so I went up to the counter and asked for menus. The waitress seemed annoyed (understandable) at me for doing this. Another 10 minutes go by, and while we have a pitcher of water, we don't have cups!  My boyfriend goes up to ask for glassware and is told to wait. He ended up just grabbed two cups from the other table (they were clean!). \n\nAt this point, the place had calmed down and was not busy at all. We noticed a couple come in and they were sat right away and given menus, water and glassware. We also noticed that the waitress was about to take their order (before us, even though we had been there, at this point, 45 minutes). We asked if she could take our order first and she didn't like that suggestion. She begrudgingly took our order. We got our food so quickly after that... JUST KIDDING! \n\nThe couple next to us that had just arrived, got their food AND finished their meals, while we were still waiting for our order. A different waiter came by with two plates, but it was for another table. \n\nWe spoke to the waitress, who really could not care less, about the long wait times and asked how much longer it would be, to which she replied \"Sorry\" over and over again. We decided to wait another 10 minutes for our food. In the end we walked out. The service was just horrendous. The servers just did not seem to make an effort to try to serve us or communicate with us. It was just terrible. It seemed as they did not care for our business. \n\nI suggest waiting in line at Seven Lives. At least there you are guaranteed food after waiting an hour.
349	This is one of the closest Starbucks to my house, so if I'm sitting at home and have a sudden craving for an iced tea, hot chocolate, or apple cider, this will be my first choice.  Drive-through can get clogged up pretty quick in the morning, but avoiding peak hours helps keep it smooth.  They do tend to run out of their baked goods rather quickly, though I don't normally indulge in them, so not really an issue for me.  I will note that about 1\/6 times I visit this location, they get my order wrong (I ask for soy milk in hot drinks and no sweetener in tea), which is fine, because getting a free drink 1\/6 of the time makes me feel better about frequenting a corporate chain.\n\nNote:  Parking can get cramped, especially with the drive-through exiting through the middle of the lot.
350	What a cute little place! Maizie's is really adorable! I can't wait for the heat to go away and sit on the patio, it's a bit tight in Maizie's. First we got seated at a table that you literally bump into when you walk in-- I suggest just getting rid of that table. But they moved to a high top for 6. there was another lunch duo on the other side but I don't mind this kind of dining-- kinda fun! \n\nSo I had the salmon salad even though I saw beautiful sandwiches and fries coming out of the kitchen. The salad was fresh, delicious and really big~ so happy I went this route. My lunch buddy had a turkey wrap and she really enjoyed it as well. \n\nThe server was nice, staff was attentive and personable. I did this place! The happy hour looks really great too an I have heard great things about it so I am hoping to hit a HH up there sometime. \n\nLet me end this on how my lunch ended at Maizie's too--- as we were paying the bill, the most wonderful smell came over me and I look around to see where it is coming from and of course it's the kitchen and a server walks by with the BEST smelling cookie with ice cream over it I have ever seen\/smelled. I wanted it so bad but I behaved, maybe next time.
351	Man do I love Spak Brothers!\n\nI'm looking for an apartment and I am honestly, truly checking the distance from potential apartments to Spak Brothers bc that is a selling point for me.\n\nI live in the S Hills now so my life has been sadly void of Spak.\n\nI love everything about their pizza.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I can't  get enough of hteir Seitan wings.  Its cheap.  Its delicious.  I'm on a diet but I'll get fatter for Spak Brothers.
352	I decided to switch my pharmacy needs to this CVS since it's an easy drive from the house. My doctor called in my prescription and I was told that they were still working on it. So I waited and the lady behind the counter called me and rang up $49 for a week's dosage without asking me some basic questions. So I asked her a question when she uttered $49. Is that the Blue Cross rate? She said \"No, we didn't have you in the system.\" Well here's my card, so let's see what happens. Magically the price fell to $13. So my point is that CVS needs to get to know their customers a little better and ask some obvious questions. \n\nThe reason my rating is a 3 instead of of 2 or 1 is that the other parts of the store have their act together. I just wish CVS would ditch the customer card that they scan when you check out at the register.
353	NOTE THIS COMPANY KEEPS HIDING MY REVIEW. THEY HAVE SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT THEY ARE HIDING THEM... Nice Business practice MIDWAY. I have had my car serviced here. That is the only reason I went was for oil changes and a steering issue. Well their service department apparently give customer information to the sales department. I have gotten calls almost weekly for over 6 months asking me to sell my car. I have told them to stop calling, they say they will then I get a call from another sales person the next week. I am sick and tired of it. I filed complaints with the FTC and BBB on them today. If they do not stop calling I am taking legal action. I will NEVER go back to this dealership. I would not advise anyone to give them business unless your prepared for harassing calls from their service department. I am so angry that I cannot see straight.
354	HANDS DOWN THE BEST BUFFET \nWe went for dinner which was $54.99 on the weekday. The line was long as expected.\nWe were able to get inside at 8pm which was 2 hours before closing. \nThey had a seafood section, meat section, Chinese food selection, salad section, tacos made to order, soup(ramen,pho,miso), dim sum section, Italian section, dessert\/fruit section, and so much more!\nMy favorites were:\n1. American Waygu Beef\n2. Lamb \n3. Snow crab legs(they split it in half for you and there's melted butter to dip with too)\n4. Oysters \n5. Roasted pork belly \n6. Beef ribs \n\nHonestly, everything here was good. It was well seasoned and did not taste like cheap buffet food. I think it is worth the money. \nHowever, I did not enjoy their steamed snow crabs legs. It was really salty! They also have bone marrow, but it was too much for me.
355	Everly has become my new spot to impress guests! Their French classic decor and feel is so neat with their indoor\/outdoor bar. Half of the bar is inside and the other half is outside with barstools. There are trendy garage doors to open and close and reveal the outside. Oh and the food is delish! It's healthy and flavorful. Try the so-cal bowl, a mix of grain, nuts and proteins. So many good flavors, you'll be full and happy post meal.
356	Hubby is originally from Southern California and absolutely loves Fatburger and since there aren't any close to where we live in the Bay he had to visit Fatburger on the strip while we were in Vegas. \n\nWhen we entered we noticed how small the space is and how you just know it is not clean. \n\nMt husband ordered a fat king burger with egg and since I was not hungry I decided not to place an order. \n\nThere was not very many people in the restaurant but it did take a little while for the food because the food is made to order. \n\nWhile we were waiting we met a very nice lady from Utah who was with her family. \n\nIt is the typical fast food burger joint that has a lot a kids working. \n\n3 stars because my husband's burger was pretty good and typical of Fatburger. \n\nI bet we will be back when we visit Vegas again.
357	This is a great theater because it one of the only theaters in the valley that plays independent films.\n\nTheater is clean, I've had no issue with that, seats are smaller, but the arms do go up. \n\nIn the same vicinity there are a bunch of eateries and shops such as bachi burger, 808 tapas, red ribbon, etc, and for dessert- cold stone creamery!! It makes this place a great place for a date\/movie night! \n\nDuring the holidays they have different events that families can get involved in and the whole vicinity it is decorated. Last year they had a picture area during October with haystacks that made for a really cute photo opportunity
358	Review for gaming only:   I found the casino on the unwelcoming side.  I signed up for the players card and the woman who was taking my information down for the card looked like she didn't want to deal with people.  She also didn't explain the \"lucky money\" free play cash that you get on the card for signing up.  I seriously only knew about it because I could hear the woman helping my husband sign up for his card explain it to him.  Also a lot of the signage is in Chinese only.\n\nThe place is super geared towards what games your \"typical\" Asian tourist would want to play.  Mostly Asian card games, a couple of black jack tables and a bunch of slots.   No craps table so that was a bust for me.  I tried the slots and they were super tight.  The one good thing they had going for them is that the waitress who took my drink order while I was playing was on point.  She was back in only a few minutes but that might have been because they were pretty slow.  There weren't too many people playing and a lot of the tables were empty with bored looking dealers sitting there.
359	I just waited 2 hours for a salad to be delivered. The soda was warm. \n\nI asked for utensils as I just moved.  I have a back injury and couldn't  get out. I have proof that I ordered utensils  and don't  appreciate  being called a liar. \nThese people  are rude and incompetent  imo. I'll  call Marcos  next  time. \nThe salad was awful
360	Not worth the hype! Always a cover, Mediocre typical gay diva tunes.  2-4-1s are nice, but many other bars have nights where they offer the same.. You come to Scottsdale expecting an upscale experience and they fall very short of \"upscale\"! Rude staff, not all, but most of them. Suggested to a friend to have a birthday there recently. They were charging $150 to $200 for a VIP area without bottle service and not once did a cocktail server come in to check on us. They also wanted to charge an outrageous extra amount for a dancer to come in and entertain over 30 paying customers. Nothing special about it anymore and desperately needs a remodel..
361	Looking to express your artistic nature with paint, then this is where you go.  I have enjoyed my classes in oil painting tremendously and if that is not your thing then there are other mediums available.  I enjoy growing with like minded people in art.  The other bonus is that there is great art to be purchased the art walls are beautiful. Joni has something new going on almost every week, check CFA\"s web site out.
362	There are many reasons why this place deserves a 2.5 star rating:\n-The name for this place is puzzling given that it's a crappy dive bar... is that why there is a question mark?!\n- The poutine has shredded cheese in it\n- The gravy was dare I say bland\n- This place was abnormally dark on a Thursday afternoon and had a really dingy feel...\n- The aforementioned is fine... except if the word fine food is in your title and you are dining with your mom\n- Speaking of mom, their tag is something like \"Better than your mom's cooking\"... which is true only if your mom happens to be Dina Lohan!\n- Even for a dive this place was both lacklustre and unmemorable\n- Our waitress\/bartender spent more time outside smoking then indoors waiting tables\n- They only take cash
363	Some thoughts:\n\nIt's dark, with little tea-light covered trees. Everything is champagne colored. It has a romantic ambiance, although many of the tables were groups of friends and not couples. \n\nOur waiter looked like Joaquin Phoenix, so that was pretty fun. \n\nThe crusty homemade bread was excellent. Bring on those carbs.\n\nWe ate a huge pile of oysters, from little baby ones to intimidating sea-monster-sized ones. \n\nThe Smoke Stack was (a) stacked, obviously, and thus super trendy and fun and (b) full of flavors! So many flavors! Not for the faint of heart. I liked it.\n\nFor dessert, I had pear upside down cake that looked like a brain and tasted awesome. Yum, brainzzzz!\n\nThere's a big boat in the lobby. Why? Because boat.
364	I'm pretty sure that Chino Bandido, an establishment that has been around since 1990, was light years ahead of the rest of the food culture when it came to fusion concepts. For this alone, you have to give Chino credit for being an innovator of sorts. And given that they are one of the most frequently reviewed restaurants on Yelp within the Phoenix area, it's obvious that they've amassed quite a following over the years.\n\nI've only dined here three times. Originally, I went with some work colleagues after their publicity from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Additionally, my girlfriend and have dined here twice.\n\nAs many people point out, Chino is located in a bit of a sketchy area that seems to get increasingly more uncomfortable deeper into the night. Nevertheless, it seems to receive a lot of business from people who appear to be regulars. Their menu cards are a bit odd, but they're willing to help you if you're confused on how to order. I like that they offer samples of their meats in order to reduce the risk of making mistakes.\n\nI've had their Jade Red Chicken a few times and have always found it to have fairly decent quality for the price. Their Chile Relleno, something I decided to take a risk on (since sampling it is forbidden), ended up being a surprise hit. Traditional rice and jerk fried rice are both decent as well. Throwing in a free snicker doodle cookie with each meal is a nice touch.\n\nI suggest that you be realistic. Don't go in here expecting to eat high-end cuisine that's on par with what you'd receive at a five star restaurant. It's the equivalent of \"fast casual\" - without the sleek IKEA-ish decor, of course.\n\nI don't feel it's the best Mexican or Chinese food I've ever eaten, nor is it something that I find myself craving in the same manner that other people seem to on a regular basis. But for what it's worth, by the standards of \"dive\" food, it's good enough.
365	Jadie was amazing!\n\nAs most of my friends know, I never get my nails done and get pedicures only at random salons so I don't share in the same loyalty to nail salons and technicians as most girls I know.  I went with a co-worker when we had some time to kill this last Saturday in between events we had to work.  I got a gel manicure and pedicure from Jadie. She was amazing!  I didn't really know what to do with my nails so I just told her to get creative.  She gave me this really pretty sparkly red with a white accent nail.  I'm really excited to have cute nails!
366	Phenomenal staff-I would highly suggest an intro class to get acquainted and become familiar with the routine-LIFE CHANGING-LOVE YOU SUMMERLIN STAFF!!!
367	I came into the cafe on a late Saturday afternoon. The place was pretty packed for the time of day, but feel like that's the case most of the time and I can see why. Very attentive staff and wonderful chill atmosphere. I only ordered the Root Wrap to go because I needed something quick, but it was SO GOOD! I need to get back there more often for the vibe and to try other things. I'm not even vegetarian\/vegan but eat healthy most of the time so this place is definitely a spot to go to if you're into a healthy lifestyle.
368	5 stars for THE BEST DEALS EVER on Nordstrom apparel, shoes etc! The prices are so great that there's actually people I know who shop here and resell the items on Ebay. Shopping here is an actual business for people. I got a Kate Spade purse and wallet and a dozen pair of designer shoes all at a great price!\nThe con is that it gets crowded. I would recommend not bringing your child as it gets crazy there and the lines are long. Also, avoid the fitting room if you can because the line is long.
369	Okay, so I visited Al's again for the first time since they opened. Whoa, where to begin. \n\nWe ordered the Italian Beef combo w\/sausage and a double Chicago style Red Hot, that came without drinks to $12. \n\nThe beef was cut so thin and was sitting in the juice for so long that is was a pile of mush; and I ordered it dry. Go figure. The double Red Hots must have been in water too long since there was no snap in the Vienna beef hot dogs and the bun was moist. So what can I say?  One star at best from my original four when they first opened.  \n\nOh, what I would give for a Super Dawg or a Gold Coast. Heh, maybe they'll open a Lou Malnati's someday?
370	LAVAL... we have a problem. lol. I want to hate this place so badly. A suburb hamburger place that screams doooooche. Fake blonds and muscle men with barbwire tattoos in every direction. But the problem is that I don't hate it.\n\nIt's not bad. And in a world of bland Baton Rouge and Madison Steak House, this place is at the top of my restaurants in Laval to get a burger with a few friends. The food is ok. I wouldn't go as far as some of the other reviewers, but it will do just fine. The decor is pretty cool. The service works well enough despite always being packed. And every time I go I LOVE the music. So what's the hate... that guy who drove up in the yellow Hummer? Yes, but I see myself returning none the less. \n\nPS: The a picture of Larry Bird on the menu. I should give them 5 stars;)
371	I have nothing but great things to say about this place.  I got lucky, on the walk home from work one night, I was walking down St. Denis and the menu caught my eye out of sheer simplicity.  A restaurant having a succinct list is always a good sign, it usually means they pick a few things and do them well.\n\nLetty, one of the guys who works there started chatting with me and made me feel welcome right away.  Later I found out he was one of the owners.  I really felt like an amazing salad with protein on it and a good glass of wine or two.  I started a new job that sent me up to Montreal for training for 6 weeks, so I was new to the area, it was my first day and I needed a good meal and a drink.  \n\nWhat came out what probably one of the best salads I have ever had.  The chef perfectly grilled a nice big piece of salmon, over a bed of arugula and some grilled veggies underneath, he made an amazing vinaigrette and I had a glass of a light Tuscan Sangiovese from Maremma.  I chatted with them about the list a bit, they do have cool eclectic list going on there.  I enjoyed my salad, had a few glasses of wine and the also asked them to pack my lunch for me for the following day so I could have another killer salad.  Again, that they did, a great piece of grilled chicken, a big salad, some roasted veggies, a little pureed squash and a new vinaigrette.  I was sold!\n\nI have been back every week and the food just continues to blow me away.  But, its not just the food.  Montreal is filled with amazing food, this city rocks my world with the food.  With Le Demand General it's a combination of a lot of things with this place, Letty and the crew always make you feel like you're part of the family when you walk in.  It's like a real life Cheers, but with great food, and a great bar.  The bartender\/ sommelier really knows his stuff and is pretty fun to chat with.  The place is super cool, you have a mix of having a nice restaurant area to eat in as well as a bar to hang out, drink and chill with friends at.  \n\nOne of my friends came up and visited on a weekend and we went their which was an absolute blast.  We ordered some appetizers and main courses to share and branded out a lot into their ever growing wine list.  They had a wild mushroom risotto that I need more of in my life, for sure.  We also had a beef cheek what was so rich, sharing it was more than enough.  Every bite was memorable.\n\nI know there are so many great places to go, but, Le Demande General is not a place to be missed.  They don't have anything frozen and the don't cut any corners, so everything you have is fresh and great quality.  I do wish they would do some more marketing!  When I tell my co-workers about it, not many people have heard of it, but other than that, I wouldn't change anything.
372	I don't know how this place is in business.  There was nobody there for dinner, the waiter was incompetent, the food was mediocre, and the owner was rude. I will never be going back there.\n\nIt was a Friday night, and some friends and I wanted to go Salsa dancing, so we figured we'd go here and just get there early for some dinner.  Bad idea.\n\nThe food was mediocre, but the waiter was so incompetent it became funny.  He told us we could order sandwiches from the lunch menu, but forgot to tell us that it didn't come with the usual hummus or house salad - only french fries - until the food had already come. We ordered 2 shwarmas and 2 felafels, and he brought 3 felafels.  When he went back to get the shwarma, apparently they were now out of it, but we could get gyros (pronounced in the most non-authentic way ever).  We got the salad instead.  When ordering drinks, he had no idea what grenadine was or if they had it, even though there is a full bar. .  Somehow he managed to split the check correctly!\n\nOnto the dancing:  the lessons were pretty good, form 9:30 - 10:30, split into 2 different groups. There was a decent crowd and a DJ, although I wasn't fond of the DJs mix of music.  \n\nThe worst part for me was that the when I took my glass from dinner up to the bar, they would not give me water, or even a glass of ice, insisting that I had to pay the $2 for a bottle of water. I've  heard this is illegal in AZ, but even if it's not, it's still bad business practice.   After getting annoyed with the bartender, he finally gave me some ice so I could go fill up the glass with warm water from the bathroom. \n\nI'm sorry, but especially when there is a $7 cover for dancing, and when the air-conditioning was not keeping up with the amount of people, you have to offer water. That is non-negotiable to me.  \n\nThe cherry topper was that when I asked to talk to the manager (who I think was the owner), letting him know that he had to make water available if he wanted people to come for dancing, he said in a rude manner, \"If you can't afford $2 for water, than you can just leave\".   So we did, and I will never go back. I hope you never do, either.
373	Without a doubt THE worst place to try and rent space from for an event! None of my inquiries were addressed. Facebook-no response! Voicemail-no return call! Email-no response! I left multiple messages. My daughter also tried in vain to get some sort of feedback.\nPlease don't waste your time with these people. Have your event somewhere else. You'll be disappointed right off the bat!!
374	Their point system is odd because you never know what you're going to get points for. The emails list some items but they're not always accurate. This is definitely not their best location. They close all their lanes early and if you're in a bit before close be prepared to be harassed about leaving on time and then have to wait in line for 20 min after close because they're not prepared for people leaving at once. Seem to find a lot of products that were expiring or have already expired so definitely double check the date. A box of crackers I bought expired 4 months ago. The bonus of that is you can find some 30% of stickers on a lot of soon to expire meat and pre-checked lettuce. Staff is not helpful and not friendly either.
375	\"I wanna be a meatball from Gino's\"\nSandwiches, meatballs, homemade lasagna, cheese, and the oh so famous chicken pesto salad.  It's all good.  If you are picking up lunch or dinner from here, please let me know so I can swing by.\nWhen you walk in and smell that perfect Italian Deli scent, you know you're in the right place!
376	I love these tacos.  As a vegetarian it's a little hard to find filing and delicious options for tacos. My favorite would definitely be the fried cauliflower. On top of having these dope tacos the margaritas are so good.  I have tried them all and I don't have a clear favorite.  But if I had to pick one it would be the frozen strawberry Margarita.  Also they have the best happy hour deal in town.
377	I had a great time kayaking on the Hoover Dam Launch tour in June. Janet our guide was friendly, patient and efficient. The small paddling crowd varied from old to young and from athletic to medium. The conditions that day were pretty good with some wind in the afternoon which made things more challenging.\n\nBest parts: This is a lovely area of the Colorado River. We saw some wonderful wildlife. Along the 11 mile stretch of river that is the Hoover Dam Launch tour, we stopped several times and hiked into the slot canyons and hot springs. We saw some beautiful caves and crystal clear water, and amazing rock formations everywhere. This is a great getaway and a really well-planned trip. It's also a good taster for destinations you might want to seek out on  your own next time for camping or soaking in that area. Most parts she showed us have road access although you may have to hike a lot more than we did to get to the springs or river.\n\nWorst parts: None really except maybe really decide if the Hoover Dam Launch tour is for all levels including beginner. If you have kayaked very little and aren't super active, think about a shorter trip so you get the ultimate enjoyment out of things. At the end of our 11 mile paddle I was pooped in the rear so had no warning there was a strong current to avoid right before our landing area and found out the hard way. \n\nBut overall it was a great experience and I felt like I was in really good hands, and I'd recommend it if you want to get out of Vegas and have some nice experiences checking out the scenery and being active.
378	Based on the size of this place I can see why Betty would be sweaty when this place is packed.  There's a front area which looks like a traditional bar, a rear area that's more of a lounging place packed with furniture that looks like it was picked up off the side of the road, and a patio that is partially covered by foliage.  \n\nEnjoy the pints at $1 off before 7:00 and don't forget to check out CD #48 on the jukebox, The Cure's Greatest Hits, I'm sure you'll love it.
379	We've been coming here since it opened and the food is overall very good though some menu refreshing would be nice. Tonight though we had a horrible experience. The waitress felt is was ok to yell loudly from behind the counter which was loud and annoying. However the worst part was the table near us was the owners wife or some sort of relative with one of their friends. They were so loud and distracting, which the waitress also played into and then to too it off Vasily himself came out and sat at the booth next to that table and they all yelled back and forth. It was as if I had broken into their house during a family party and we were kind of in the way. It was annoying and so stinking loud my wife and I couldn't hear each other. It was bad. I understand this isn't a fancy place, and I certainly understand treating family and friends differently but you need to create an inviting atmosphere and that has been going downhill. We may not come back. Vasily - keep better control of your restaurant and realize it's the general public patronizing you that allows you to have a place to have loud family visit.
380	My visit was after the lunch crowd, around 1:35 on a week day and we were sat immediately.  \n\nIf you've never been, the decor and atmosphere can be classified as Americanized-Mexican.  Plenty of parking available. The ambiance is nice, decor is that of a mix of modern and Pier One Mexican decor.  There's modern American music playing, but it is very possible to have a conversation with people at your table. \n\nClientele is a good mix of stay at home mothers, old pals catching up for a drink and others there to have business lunches. Most are dressed from casual to business casual. Bar area wasn't busy, 3-4 patrons sitting at the bar. They offer daily drink specials but I didn't partake in this during my visit. \n\nOur waiter was very attentive.  I was there for a quick meet up, to have some appetizers and not having a full fledged meal.  We ordered the Prima Guacamole (made at our table) and were very specific that we did not want anything spicy in our guacamole.  Waiter listened to us and made our guacamole perfectly.  Fresh tomatoes and lots of lime and a smidge of cilantro - just how I like it.  Chips were warm and had perfect salt seasoning - not too much, not too little. \n\nWe also ordered the Chicken empanadas off of the appetizer section.  This includes 4 triangle empanadas filled with  cheese, chicken and Pico de Gallo.  Perfect serving for two people. The plate was garnished well with a bed of lettuce and bits of tomatoes for the empanadas to lay in, empanadas were drizzled lightly with chipotle ranch and serve with side of guacamole and sour cream (not spicy). These empanadas were flavorful and served at perfect temperature! \n\nWe then shared a Cuatro Leches Cake to satisfy our sweet tooth.  Cuatro leches is a cake with four types of milk poured over it.   It is topped with a sugar-merengue, garnished with mint leaves.  It was DEVINE but very rich for just one person to have, in my opinion.  We shared this cuatro leches cake and between the both of us were unable to finish it.  \n\nWe enjoyed our visit to Cantina but felt a rushed at the end, as our waiter brought our bill at the same time as our dessert.  Our total visit was less than a hour long, there were lots of open tables and no one waiting to be seated so I thought perhaps it was shift change.
381	Great customer service. I was there for the Cleveland.com tweet up and the happy hour included free shoe rental and discounted play - $4.25\/person per game.
382	Neat little spot in Atherton Mill that sells a myriad of spices and spice blends . These products can be sampled in-store and are available for purchase in a 3-4 different sizes. Savory Spice Shop also has ready made seasoning blends of which I purchased one for a rustic red sauce ( just add crushed tomatoes) and one for pot roast ( just add roast, broth, veggies, etc ). I've used the red sauce blend and it was amazing, definitely something I would buy again. Within the store there is also local honey, loose leaf tea, and barbecue\/finishing sauces for sale. The sales team are very friendly and helpful.
383	Came with a group of 6 people. Sam accommodated us very well! The staff was great and very focused on pleasing us. We had one butthole in the group. We would like to apologize for his behavior. The staff didn't kick us out like we expected due to his behavior. The rooms are clean and the space is reasonable. They definitely have strong hands and great customer service. Thanks again! Oh they have groupons but Sam works a deal for you if you call in advance.
384	Cozy BYOB very close to UPMC-Shadyside.   The rooms nicely lit and service was very good.  Ordered the Wagyu Meatloaf based on reviews and it didn't disappoint.   Server was kind to substitute potatoes for a vegetable!  Complementary bread with wonderful chive butter provided before meal while waiting.  I look forward to coming back again and brining nice bottle of wine (flew into town and didn't have time to purchase, although server mentioned Giant Eagle close by now has liquor store in it).
385	Great food and friendly, fast service. The turkey avacado is awesome, prickly pear hummus is great and excellent iced coffees. One of the best lunch spots in the area.
386	I was feeling really beat down from drinking whiskey when my friend called me at noon on Saturday. He asked if I still wanted to go the the museums. I didn't want to. He said we can drink some coffee and he will share some of his Jack Frost donuts. They were the fuel I needed to get back on my feet and walk around. They really are the best donuts that I have ever had. Some flavors I tried had crushed peanut butter cups and crushed oreo cookies along with frosting. At around 60 cents a donut, you will be very happy!
387	We stood in line for about 5 mins. I order the same thing every time I eat here which is a bowl with chicken and carnitas and everything on it. Love it!!
388	I just finished eating at their shack meet up and I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the food! The 2 best bites I had were the shack stack burger and the shack-ago hot dog. I also went classic with a simple vanilla shake and it was perfectly sweet.\n\nThe ambiance is very casual and there isn't any very convenient parking but it's a solid option especially around the NY NY.\n\nService was friendly and although very busy, all the areas I saw were surprisingly clean and orderly.\n\nNext time I want to have more ice cream!
389	I have been coming to 32Shea since they opened in 2011. There are a bunch of great things to say, but my main proposal for why you should check them out is that you will be blown away by the design and construction of this business. The building is TINY and they have managed to make enough space for you, your family, your extended family, and all of their close personal friends. \n\nPro\/Con: The food here is great, though I little pricy for the amount you get. BUT you must splurge for the bruschetta at least once.\n\nPro\/Con: The cafe drinks are usually remarkable, though the consistency has been challenged by (what I attribute to) high employee turnover. BUT NUTELLA. Also, their chai. YUM. \n\nPro: The evening drinky drinks have been spot on every time. \n\nPro: 32Shea has every single coffee shop in Phoenix beat when it comes to atmosphere. It is extraordinary what they've done with their patio in the last few years. And whether inside or outside, SO romantic in the evenings. It's truly an inspiring space that I love to be in both alone and with company.\n\nPro: dog-friendly patio\n\nCon: Service, like I said, is spotty. There's been some really cool baristas over the years, but for the most part I've had a hard time keeping track of the ever-changing staff. \n\nPro: drive-thru and call-ahead orders\n\nCon: due to space their entry\/line system can get a little confusing. \n\nPro: Their bathroom has dancing lazer lights, so you don't get bored when you pee like you might at other coffee shops. \n\nGO THERE!
390	UN AVIS DE 1*, MAIS VUE QUE MON AMIE N'A PAS PAYÉ SON REPAS ET QUE LE SERVEUR A ÉTÉ COURTOIS JE MET UNE ÉTOILE DE PLUS...Alors l'avis va comme suit...\n\nMercredi soir au début décembre 19h30. La grosse pancarte sur la 40 qui annonçait le spécial 2 pour 22 avait attiré mon attention. Alors, cherchant une place pas cher pour manger, nous avons décidé d'aller là-bas...ERREUR. Premièrement, je sais que ce n'est pas la faute au resto mais il est quand même difficile de trouver l'endroit en auto. Ce n'est pas trop bien expliqué. \nBref, nous rentrons là, le resto à quelques clients...genre une quinzaine. L'hôte hyper amicale nous a placer sur une banquette. Alors, je regarde le menu de pauvre, 2 pour 22, et bien il n'était pas trop attrayant.\n\n Et il y avait les autres plats....les fruits de mer avec pâtes m'attrayait. Et mon amie a décidé de me suivre, mais avec la table d'hôte. Elle a pris un tartare au saumon et moi les pâtes aux fruits de mer. Le serveur a amené la soupe de mon amie. Quelques minutes plus tard, le serveur est venu me demandé si c'est bel et bien les pâtes avec fruits de mer et non celui de crevettes, pétoncles et champignon. Je reconfirme mon plat de fruits de mer. En attendant nos plats, on a demandé du pain...c'était des petites baguettes...dûr au bout, mais chaude et moelleuse au milieu. Alors on reçoit nos plats. La lumière est très tamisé, alors je ne voyais pas bien le plat et j'avais faim. Après que j'ai mis du parmesan fourni par le serveur  et poivre moulu de tavle(le serveur nous a pas dit s'il y avait du poivre frais), je me rends compte que ce n'est pas le plat de fruit de mer...mais bien celui fe crevettes et champignons. J'y ai goutté..un peu trop de crème à mon goût et je voulais mes pâtes aux fruits de mer...alors obliger de dire au serveur et d'attendre une quinzaine de minutes pour qu'on me fasse le plat que j'ai demandé 2 fois...En attendant, je mangeais les frites de mon amie hehehe...elles étaient sec et dur.\n\nElle me dis que son saumon du tartare goûte bizarre. Je goûte et effectivement..un goût de poisson cuit avec du citron. Je regarde donc avec la lumière de mon cell et effectivement le saumon était rose cuit. Ça veut dire que le tartare n'était pas frais et à sûrement passé des heures mariné dans le citron...Le serveur a été mis au courant et a offert à mon amie si elle voulait autre chose ..le non a été sa réponse. \n\nVu qu'elle a pris la table d'hôte, elle avait le droit à un café. Le café arrive...et met le lait et elle ne dit..NONNN ok là ça ne va pas...UNE BOULE ÉTAIT FORMÉ DANS LE PETIT TRUC DE LAIT TELLEMENT QU'IL ÉTAIT VIEUX WASHHH. Bref..le serveur s'est excusé et il a été voir le gérant et le souper lui a été offert...\n\nMettons que je ne retournerai sûrement pas...!
391	First time I came here was at the Yelp event that I purely enjoyed. Came here last night to see how it's like on a regular night. The vibe is very relaxed. The bar seemed pretty packed. But, You are able to sit yourself in the dining area. Someone automatically brings you a menu & lets us know our server will be with us.\n\nErin was our server for the night. We automatically checked into Yelp & redeemed our free whiskey shots. We also ordered Mad Mule $10 (which was served at the Yelp event) & a Cinnamon Apple Sour $7. Apple sour was on the sour side & extremely strong. The whiskey shots came in coffee & cinnamon flavored. Yuck! Those drinks did the job done alright!\n\nFor food:\nShrimp Spinach Artichoke Dip $9.99 -- it was very very very very bland. It didn't have enough cheesiness. The shrimp didn't blend in well with the other ingredients. A lot of chips, not enough dip.\n\nStreet tacos $7.99 -- shredded chicken with usual contents that comes with a taco. It had a chipotle dressing on top. These were pretty good. Still, nothing that made me want to order it again. \n\nNew York Steak & Eggs $11.99 -- beau said it was good cooked perfect. It came with hash browns. & you can choose between English muffin or toast. I tasted it, tasted like regular steak ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯ \n\nFrench toast $7.99 -- beau also got French Toast (guess he was hungry). These were excellent. Probably best thing we ate last night. It was light and fluffy. \n\nErin, our server, was very attentive. She came and checked on us every so often. She was nice & had lots of personality. When asked if we can change the channel of the TV next to us she said she would but she never did, but we didn't make a big deal out of it. Other bummer, she charged us for our free \"yelp check in\" shots. Of course I told the beau to look at the itemized billing like I ALWAYS do & of course he said he did but really didn't (men!) and just signed his life away. Later I looked at the bill & we were charged for them *insert angry face*
392	The Abandoned room was super fun! Definitely needs a lot of teamwork with 2 teams split between 2 rooms at first. 2 free hints in 45 minutes. They use cool direction locks for this one and lots of clever letter\/number clues. Creepy music sets the mood pretty well. We had 8 people and it's definitely a room that needs lots of people to work together at the same time to win. No tech malfunctions which is a plus. Will definitely be back for another room!\nGroupon was $50 for 4 people on weekend.
393	Prepare to unzip your pants and possibly vomit (in a good way)!\n\nThank you Vegas foodies for rating this spot so high and posting so many foodgasm shots of their popular Fried Chicken & Waffles plate. You guys led us here. And surprisingly, this place was packed on a random weekday during the daytime. We sat at the bar since there was no wait for the seating there. \n\nI ordered myself a monstrous hot chocolate to start. I seriously probably took about 3 sips of that thing. I felt so bad wasting all that warm, chocolatey goodness in that huge mug.\n\nFor grub I ordered one of their farm benedicts, hoping it wouldn't come out as huge as the the fried chicken and waffles plate. Boy was I wrong! My benedict came with smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, this roasted red pepper cream and topped w\/ two basted eggs. What makes these benedicts so special is that they serve it on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes. Talk about CARB overload! Since I don't have a binge-eating disorder anymore, I barely made a dent even into this plate. Boo!\n\nThe bf ordered an actual plate that didn't come out monstrous. I believe it was just a simple breakfast plate with eggs, meat and some potatoes. If he ordered a flapjack (which are the size of a Thanksgiving turkey serving tray) he would have been screwed for sure.\n\nEven if you plan to swing into this restaurant hungover, I suggest sharing a plate with 1 or even 2 other people! Portions are more than plentiful.
394	This is not a good sushi place for the following reasons: 1. The place was so loud. 2. The food is so bland. 3. Its an all day dinner menu for jan 1, 2017 but most of the items were not there. 4. We waited for our orders such as white tuna , edamame and beef cubes just to find out that there's no more food to serve. 5. The servers dont dare to tell u that they ran out of food. You pay for dinner but the food is for lunch only. What a rip off. Not coming back to this stupid place again. You dont even deserve a 1 star!
395	My foodie friend and I checked this out today. We tried the pandas, fish and bean. I am not a big fan of beans, but it was good. The fish version was nice as well. I had the oxtail entree and my friend had the stewed beef. Very nice well seasoned. Plantains we delish. Nice music and a chill atmosphere. They are trying for a liquor license. A good beer would have topped the meal off.
396	Because I'm a denizen of the same neighborhood as this establishment I've tried it out a few times and they really never seemed to care when I said, \"Hey, I'm a neighbor\". They don't offer a locals discount and I don't remember a particularly friendly experience whenever I go back. This morning I tried it again and I don't think I'll be back any time soon. They just recently started staying open  24 hours and I get off work at 4am, so I went back. When I approached the two armed guards out front I said something to the effect that I lived across the street and I was glad they had 24 security out there all the time. The older guard offered no greeting or welcome, just brusquely asked me to remove all my metal and walk through a metal detector! I'd certainly never had that experience at any other dispensary. I found it quite jarring and it kind of ruined the whole experience. There's too many good dispensaries in this neighborhood to be treating people like that.
397	I thought the food here was amazing, especially because lamb skewers are one of my favourite things to eat, and the ones served here tasted pretty damn authentic.\n\nWe came here for dinner and the menu was pretty extensive. Great for those that enjoy spicy foods. We arrived at 7pm and the restaurant was full, with people lined up, until 9pm. I would highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time.\n\nThe reason why I'm not giving Hunan Garden a 5-star review is because the service was absolutely AWFUL. I'm pretty used to brusque service at Chinese restaurants in Toronto, but this was the next level of rudeness. We asked one of the waiters for clarification on the size of a noodle dish and how many we should order to feed a party of six. Instead of simply responding with a number, we got a condescending lecture on how we already ordered a combo that comes with a noodle dish and when we asked again if we should order an extra one, the waiter literally responded with a loud sigh, \"You still don't get it? You already ordered one\". Well, thank-you-very-much for stating the obvious, but we're a hungry group of people and maybe one plate, especially in a combo deal, is not enough! We did end up deciding to ordering an extra plate, which was good because they only provided a tiny bowl of noodles that was probably only meant to feed two people at the most. It didn't get much better as dinner went on.\n\nBecause of the poor service, I'm not sure if I will be returning, which is a pity since the food was pretty good (and I LOVE lamb skewers!). However, there are other great options in the area who I think would be more appreciative of their customers.
398	Ohhhhh Saint-Sulpice. What I like to call my 'first-year' stomping ground. This place is a university bar mixed with St-Denis chic with a little trashy Quebecois-ness thrown in for good measure. This place has the largest patio EVER, its really quite grotesque (in the best way possible) and its always teeming with people in the summer. It makes for the perfect place to sit on a hot summer's night and refresh with a pitcher or a pint. The inside itself is equally massive. The facade is deceptive, you think 'oh that looks like a cute little bar,' until you realize this place spans like a city block and goes on for many floors. The basement is a mixture of coat check-club-bar. The floor doesn't know what it make of itself but it seems to be where the drunkest people congregate. The second floor is the main floor and it features another bar, with bathrooms, and rooms where people sit and drink with table service. There is another floor, the 'library' floor which is this odd combination of library and drinking room. But its where people sit to drink and chat. Now, the final floor is perhaps where things get most interesting. This is the straight-up 'club' floor with its own bar, dancing platforms, and smoking room. There is nowhere to sit and its pure Dirty Dancing Havana Nights. The discotheque tends to be get packed, sticky, and raunchy. Which are qualities that are really best suited for the really inebriated. They have a patio so you can duck off for a quick smoke and the hit the floor soon after if you're so inclined. \n\nThe crowd is really a bizarre mixture of people. Gangsters, slutty Anglophone girls, American tourists who stumbled across the first watering hole, Quebeckers from the east end, some gays, some Latinos, Arabs, etc. etc. There is no 'typical' clientele at this place and it plays to every niche you could think of. Attention girls: most of my girlfriends agree this place attracts the 'aggressive' types unlike any other bar\/club in the city. There are guys on the prowl here and they're looking for ass. So be forewarned (maybe because theres a strip joint across the street??) you'll be groped. \n\nBut: the drinks are cheap cheap cheap. Make sure you ask the bartender for the nightly specials. They often have draft beer for like $2.50 which is pennies compared to most places. I always stick to beer\/shots here if only because the bartenders could not make a proper mixed drink to save their life. Also, it TIP the bartenders. They're VERY aggressive about tipping--I guess cause many people don't--and they will flat out ask you to tip\/give more money if they're not satisfied. $2\/drink is the minimum. Now, if you DO tip you'll get great service for the rest of the night and they'll come to you first even if they're faced with a bar full of other patrons. So open your wallets to enjoy friendly bartenders and plentiful drinks. It helps to speak French here too (like most places in Montreal) for all you bilinguals in the crowd.
399	I've been here a few times with some friends who live in the area. It's always pretty fantastic! Came by Saturday for an early drink with friends...turned into an all-night throwback dance party. Loved it. \n\nAs a side note: I have to say that the Middleburg Heights police are Canada-level polite... Or maybe that's just the way things are done in the suburbs...There was an insanely drunk Eastern European guy (\"Vlad\", as we came to know him) who had to be removed from the Islander after getting into a fight with a taxi driver. He was pretty befuddled, and it was pretty interesting to watch the cops try to figure out his name (he didn't know it), where he lived (nope) or whether he was married (he's single....YES!) for over a half hour, with the most delicate of kid gloves. It was kind of sweet, actually.
400	Cute little sandwich shop in downtown Kent. I got the 6 once veggie (#14) and it was more than enough food for me. All of the staff I saw there were nice and friendly. The prices were pretty good too.
401	I chose this dry cleaning business because of location and their stellar reviews. Sadly, my experience was less than acceptable. \n\nI stopped in on Saturday, October 29th around 10am and and door was locked. The sign said they open at 9am. \n\nI called and was told they would be there in 30 minutes. I decided to give them a chance and went back in a half hour to drop off my suit. \n\nThe gentleman told me they would have my 3 piece suit ready by Friday, November 3rd. I stopped in on Monday, November 6th at it still wasn't ready. \n\nThey finally had it ready on Wednesday, November 8th; 10 days after I dropped it off.
402	Save ur money .. go to chipotle .. wasnt verry appealing at all so i gave it a try.. not the best burrito but hey the people that work inside is friendly..
403	I haven't had any food here, but it's a good spot for a beer on the patio at a good price. There are misters on in the summer. I've seen karaoke here. I've also seen the underaged get kicked out from time to time so I know they follow the rules on that one.  I will be back!
404	Dr. Patti did an adjustment that helped me more than I thought chiropractic could. I actually only went to take my mom in for an adjustment but while I was there, I did try and I am so glad I did. I assumed my long standing sports injury would not be able to be helped with Chiropractic but I was wrong. The staff is extremely friendly, the place is clean and you will not be disappointed.
405	Really like and enjoy this place, it's great food and entertainment all rolled into one.\nThe food here is really fantastic at a great price and then on top of it they entertain you with a great experience with their chefs preparing the food right in front of you in an entertaining, fun way which makes for a great experience all the way around.\nVery reasonably priced, very tasty and very entertaining. I honestly don't know how they do all they do for the price they do it for.
406	Well I am disappointed the food was below average.  I guess we had an old menu and I said the name and number but numbers changed so he place the order just on numbers. I am glad that we did not order what showed up it looked like I tried to cook it and forgot it in the fryer. Greasiest dumpling I have ever seen.  I should have taken a picture. We usually order China Wok every Sunday they were closed for Easter so we called yummy yummy huge mistake.... Next holiday we will just make food.
407	Although this is not authentic, I really enjoyed it! \n\nWe started off with chips and guacamole. The guacamole was not special but it was good. It comes with a large pork rind seasoned with something spicy that I thought was unique and yummy. The salsa tastes smokey and spicy which I thought was tasty.\n\nI had the pork belly al pasteur, chorizo queso, and beef cheek. The pork belly had the right amount of flavor and was delish! The chorizo queso was good but did not stand out like the pork belly. The beef cheek was a little dry, however just add some salsa and it's fine. \n\nThis place is not good for groups - a max of 4 to a group would be able to sit together. I did come early to beat the lines and I recommend it. I did find the music a little too loud, but that's probably why this place is not good for groups. You are either sitting at the bar or in a cozy table so you can still hear each other since you are so close in proximity. This place does not take credit cards but they do take debit.\n\nI think this place is worth coming back to but not to wait forever like some others have mentioned. Just come early and you will be good.
408	The Service was great, our waiters were friendly and attentive. The food was realllyyy good. I got the spaghetti and meatballs. I definitely recommend this place.
409	Went to My Dr. Now and saw Dr. Pragit. She only spent about three minutes in the room with me then made me come back to get test results. Was charged another Co-Pay just for her to hand me a sheet of paper and walk out of the room. Afterwords, I received an e-mail stating that I still owed $10 dollars on a co-pay. Called to pay it and was told I owed another $10 on the visit for test results but I was never notified of this. I will not be returning to any My Dr. Now and if you value your time, money, and health, find a real doctor.
410	Can't rate the food here as the service or lack of service forced us to leave. Apparently going on a non weekend day and not being a regular impacts your ability to be served. Also I apparently did a big no no by bringing in the last of my iced Starbucks (sorry my bad), and because I ordered water (fyi I don't drink coffee), my starbucks was an iced chai. But instead of advising me I couldn't bring my drink in (which I would have been fine with) they stand behind our booth and talk about me, my starbucks and my water request.  BTW, I finished my chai within 3 mins of entering. We waited 15 more minutes for someone to come and take our order (never happened). Wow immature much, thanks but no thanks. We left and went to BLD.
411	The partiers from the surrounding clubs will come inside and have loud sex in the hallway outside your door. The hotel will do nothing about it.
412	DO NOT COME HERE! I don't know what sucks more: their non existent service or their food. \n\nThe food:\n\nLet's start off with the best thing there: honeydew. I should have just ate honeydew the whole time because everything else sucked. Don't even bother getting their sushi....it's just California roll with sauce on top or presented differently. Their seafood soup or whatever tasted very fishy. The pineapples looked like they had been sitting out for too long. Idk the food was just a huge mess. I felt like I only ate their veggie tempura, baked sweet potato and honey dew the whole time because everything else sucked. And as for the veggie tempura, it wasn't even good, but it was one of the better food options. Thank god they didn't fail on baking the sweet potato or else idk how and why they are still open. \n\nThe service:\n\n\nWe asked for napkins like literally 5 times and the waitresses had attitude. We also asked for hot tea and they put the hot tea in a plastic cup. Wait hold up? Have these waitresses not gone thru some type of food handlers training? Even if they didn't, do they not have common sense? Because you know it's common sense to not put hot drinks in plastic cups. Omg. They need to throw these waitresses back into kindergarten cus clearly they hired dumbasses. They also don't know how to own a business because the customer should always be right. We asked for the hot tea to be poured into a mug, but the waitress said the mug is for coffee only. Like wtf?! Are you stupid? Sigh.
413	Great spa, very professional and clean! They are very nice and accommodating. Hours are great, open till 9pm during the week. Great for waxing, laser and manicure and pedicures.
414	Love, love the fish!!!  It's served with rice, you put on teryiaki sauce.  You can get nice pieces of steamed cabbage, too.  The cabbage salad is very tasty with a ginger dressing.  This is nothing compared to the service, though.  I have difficulty carrying things.  I've been here twice.  The girls behind counter are helpful.  Tonight the cashier, Desire is a totally thoughtful, cheerful, helpful sweetheart in every way.  I vote big raise!!  Thanks Ono Hawiian.  Looking forward to coming again :)
415	I have to give this place a good rating. It's higher end type of food, but not everything was super amazing. It's not like I couldn't get the same kind of food\/quality elsewhere, but there was so much variety, plus an amazing dessert area that it still deserves four stars in my book. \n\nAnyway, the set price comes with a beverage, so our group got unlimited OJ and they were quick with refilling glasses. Probably hoping the guests would get fuller faster! I focused mainly on shrimp cocktail, mashed potatoes, some pasta dishes, breakfast foods like sausages and eggs, but then I got full quickly. My family had more seafood, like crab legs, which is what I think a lot of people focus on here. If I had room, I would have had a hearty salad, some deli meats\/sandwich, tried more of the \"ethnic\" cuisine. \n\nMy favorite part was the desserts though- very big chocolate covered strawberries. Eclairs. A tiramisu dessert. I wanted more, and it's hard to eat everything in one sitting. But no one rushes you out, you can linger and enjoy your meal.
416	Milos is the Greek restaurant in the Cosmopolitan and it's such a fun restaurant to go to, I really love the vibe. The restaurant has a very upbeat feel to it, the servers are always very friendly and welcoming, it's just cheery space. They have a gorgeous seafood display where you can choose the fish you want to eat with I always find so fun. An absolute must try is the whole fish baked in salt crust in the traditional Greek fashion, it's incredible. People rave on this restaurant, it's not my favorite in the Cosmo for dishes though, I think STK and Beaty & Essex are much more delicious all around, and Zuma which is such a great dining experience! Check out my other reviews on each of those! Milos is definitely worth a visit though.
417	The OG. \n\nThis place is your classic diner spot located in a strip mall. Sadly this is the norm in Vegas, but it doesn't take away from the fact that this place is actually a great option for breakfast and brunch.\n\nI highly recommend the snowcaps. Bagels cut into small pieces, pan fried in butter and topped with powdered sugar. These little sugar bombs will definitely shattered any diet plan you had going for you, so I would share these with your brunching buddy. Trust me, they give you plenty. \n\nThe omelets and benedict's here are very good and satisfying, no small portions at the Sunrise, but my favorite is the Fiesta Benedict. An open-faced bagel with jalapeno bacon, pepper jack cheese, two eggs and a spicy hollandaise sauce, this meal is amazing and really has a great kick of heat. The hollandaise sauce is rich and creamy and the eggs are cooked to that perfect point of soft\/medium yolk. \n\nI would avoid Sunday mornings and come right around 12:30pm, right as the crowds start to disband and there's no wait for a seat. \n\nBrunch proper my friends.
418	The 2 stars are because we were happy that there were no cages. We brought our large short haired dog because of shedding and expected him to come out brushed. When we picked him up we still had handfuls of hair in our hands. Not worth it and we won't be back.
419	Great steak, huge servings, excellent service- comes with a high price too. Good thing I was invited here by a supplier.\nDinner comes with complimentary bread, pickles and olives. The olives are fabulous. Their prime rib is  about 1.5 - 2 inches thick and almost covers the entire dinner plate. All entrees come with broccoli and carrots. Their desserts are wonderful as well. We had pecan pie, cheesecake , chocolate mouse.
420	Clean, fully equipped with a kitchen stocked with all dishes, pans and utensils and dining room. A patio\/balcony with BBQ on patio (and all BBQ cooking utensils in kitchen, master bedroom and bath, extra bedroom and bath and living room with fireplace. \nKitchen: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/81-wh-qHg2hvwHQBjC0Q-w?select=8Jd1dKWd6zlii63sys3b3g\nLiving Room: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/81-wh-qHg2hvwHQBjC0Q-w?select=P4NJJx6oOqrBbu5D3ilu6w\nExtra Bedroom: \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/81-wh-qHg2hvwHQBjC0Q-w?select=dkegFspW9pXbFxhq0qvbgA\n\nI see it more as a family place for longer term stay. The full sized kitchen and patio equipment make it large and comfortable for the all the kids, but it is not on the strip. There is a bus shuttle that runs until 12:30AM, but the shuttle didn't run as often as I think it should so planning on going to the strip adn coming back wasn't as convenient as it could be. \n\nNo casino or macnines in the hotel, but there are basketball courts, a game room and some pools for family entertainment. \n\nA friend of a friends has a timeshare here and let us use it for free, so it's really hard to complain. It was a great, comfortable, clean free place to stay, but if I had to pay my own way, I would pick something closer\/on the strip with a casino or bars in it.
421	To all those who say that los dos is not authentic mexican food, you are right.  It's new mexican food loud and proud putos.  Get delicious, spicy, enchiladas, machaca, chile rellenos and carne adovada served new mexican style.  The service here is somewhat sketch at times, but the margaritas are tasty and the salsas are delish and put a fire on your tongue that necessitates mas margarita which equals mas divertido.  My favorite thing that they serve, carne adovada tacos, is actually not on the menu at this location (i usually go to the downtown location), but the enchiladas, carne adovada, and salsas are legitima.
422	I give this Roberto's a 3 star. I love the food, but the service has been lacking and most of the times I have gone to this locations, they do not have the salsa bar stocked and\/or the drinks are out. \n\nThis location is just across the street from where I live on Eastern and is also in the same parking lot as Jamba Juice, Panda Express, and 24 Hour Fitness. I come to this location more often now then before because of the location and it's very convenient for me to just walk a few minutes and get some food fast. \n\nI always order the chicken tacos (in my opinion, some of the best chicken tacos I've ever had!), and have at times ordered the Carna Asada Burrito or the Carna Asada fries. Both are also very good. Food always comes out quickly. Never have waited more then 5-8 minutes for an order, which is always a big plus++.\n\nCons for this location:\n1. They could make sure the salsa bar is always stocked, especially during rush hours.\n2. Drink\/Ice machine needs to be always filled as well.\n3. The times that I've gone, there are always dirty tables.\n4. They also need to run a\/c or at least a fan in their shop. It's always so stuffy and hot whenever I go there.\n\nOther then that, it's a great place to get food fast.
423	I've been in the brewing industry for a long time.  Back when all these new \"beer snobs\" were drinking Natty Light in their college dorm.  This place is one of the top 3 breweries I have been to in the US, hands down.  We came on a Saturday and it was brewers choice day.  All these random beers they put on tap.  Mellon sour, Berliner Weisse and lambic to name a few.  One was better than the next.  This place main focus is Belgian styles and its refreshing.  Save the piney, chewey IPAs for every other chump and drink some inventive, ORIGINAL beers.  Surprised they have been open for 5 years and I have not been there yet.  I gotta step up my game.  We got there 10 minutes after they opened and it was already busy.  Plenty of friendly servers and bartenders.  All eager to explain the beers and chat ya up.  No food but we brought in wings from Big Shot Bobs and they didn't even bat an eye.  Super cool peoples.  Glad to see they are not taking the elitist, douchebag attitude that most new brewery staff have taken on.  I would describe the \"vibe\" and \"space\" but I'll leave that for the others.  Yet another reason I will be back to Pittsburgh soon...
424	THE VERY BEST MACARONS I HAVE EVER TASTED. They were MIND BLOWING CRAZY GOOD! Slap your Momma. Go to Church CRAZY GOOD!  Little bite sized wonders of not the ordinary flavors. I LOVED THE Savory Thai Curry Macarons, Tikka Masala macarons, and Rosemary and Cheve Macarons. I was told soon Whole Foods will carry them and I was told AJ's carries them. I have never tasted a French Macaron that was so transforming as these from Aunt Abby before!\n\nSmoke a cigarette good even if you don't smoke good!\n\nReally REALLY good!
425	i believe this is the official business for my dentist, Dr. Karawi. of note, his brother is also a dentist, so the Karawi clan must be conquering AZ!\n\nfor more details, i have a review for Dr. Moatz Karawi earlier on, but let me just say...Dr Karawi is a phenomenal dentist. he is friendly, outgoing, and extremely professional. he even does most of the cleanings himself because as he puts it, \"i like meeting and getting to know my patients\". how novel!\n\ngreat guy! great staff! if you need a dentist, this is your place!
426	Black and gold overload! This store is fantastic if you're a Pittsburgh sports fan....wall to wall, upstairs, downstairs, out on the street black and gold. I came in looking for some swag to bring home to San Diego and I definitely found it. I was able to get some Pens gear, some Steelers gear and an ornament for my holiday tree. My lovely husband, who is not a black and gold fan was amazed by the amount of stuff there, and actually picked up a Pens shirt for himself. The bus outside is fun too, and if you're in the Strip District a trip to Yinzers is a \"must do.\"
427	I wound up getting stuck with this lame company again via Amazon Prime. I didn't realize they were the courier. They say they delivered my package...problem is they didn't deliver it to my house...somebody else must have it. I can't stand this company and Amazon looks so bad for using them
428	Unsanitary practices, I was disgusted.\nThey have this employee who has got to be the most unfriendly and inappropriately dressed food handler I've ever encountered (just for pure description purpose, she's Asian, with facial piercings).\nShe prepared food for the person ahead of me. Used her fingers to scoop vegetables\/fruits, no gloves, then exchanged money to complete the transaction. WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS, she proceeded to prepare my order, touched the fruit with her hands, wiped them on her shirt and then took my money. GROSS! Can you imagine the filth that's on her hands, touching the food that customers are about to consume?!\n\n\nDuring the summer, she wears these teeny short short spandex shorts (more like underwear) and half of her bottom hangs out, I AM STARING AT HER BARE AS*!! I think another reviewer commented on this. \nLet's not forget that regardless of how tasty this food may be or how popular this place may be, this is a FOOD joint and certain practices are unacceptable.\n\nAnother thing with this place is that servers think they're too cool to prepare your food. No smiles, barely any eye contact, as if I'm bothering them by being there?\n\nI'm tired of these \"cool\" places that are popping up, where attitude is on the menu.\n\nGet real. Be nice to customers. Otherwise, you won't get any. And for god's sake, wash your hands and at least try to wear clothes  that don't expose your as*.
429	I wish I could give this company a ZERO!!! If you are going through your home warranty company just be advised that this company treats home warranty customers extremely poorly.  They are unresponsive, unprofessional and the veracity of their employees is highly questionable.  Don't waste your time with them. If your home warranty company refers you to them, request another company.
430	We tried three specialty drinks when we came in. The Sun Devil Sweet Tea, Matcha Tea, and Malibu Most Wanted - ah-mazing. The Sun Devil's black tea had real bits of strawberry and peach, the Malibu's Coconut and Pineapple slush tasted like sweet bliss on a summer day- and the classic Matcha Tea's simplicity made it timeless. The trio was remarkable. Each sip created a photographic moment, as the drinks were beautiful!\nThe owners, Matt, Benson, and Eric, three friends reigning from California, told us how the teas were locally sourced and on tap to be the freshest you could have, and how their signature diamond popsicles were not ordinary popsicles but gelato popsicles topped with all types of toppings. \nWe topped off the night by topping each of our own custom diamond bars - I personally had a pistachio bar dipped in white chocolate, drizzled with dark chocolate and topped with sprinkles - absolutely divine. Cheers to a wonderful venue and a wonderful staff!
431	Holy smokes is that free focaccia bread delicious. Great food, great location, great space. What's not to love?
432	Wow! These guys rock. Called yesterday and they were here today and ahead of schedule. YES! Repaired my garage door and installed a remote keypad in no time flat. So reasonably priced that I almost choked:) if you need a garage door repair or even a new one, tell em Julie sent ya. Big Mahalos Ryan
433	Got to be my favorite quick Thai food in the Valley!  Excellent options and like many others I went for the lunch special with yellow curry and chicken.  Superb!  Portions are large enough to bring home leftovers great the next day.
434	The prices are a little high, I think because they include the wine and dessert automatically. I didn't understand wine was included. My group and I were not interested in having the wine, so I feel like we paid for something we didn't want. The service was decent. There was a man playing the accordion and he came to our table - he was super sweet and definitely added to the ambiance. The restaurant was very dark.
435	Wow. Small place, huge flavor. Friendly, not prissy waiter. Knew the menu inside and out. Made great recommendations. Pizza is as good as the best out there: Bianco, Grazie, etc. good pasta and amazing cannoli. Saw them featured on PBS Check Please! show. So glad we found them!
436	Coby is an awesome real estate agent, he is very efficient, offers great customer service, and answered all of my questions. Would highly recommend his services.
437	great view. location a little rough to get to. i'll stay more central next time, like the sheraton centre.
438	OH H#LL NO! \n\nI lived in indiana (home of the steak and shakes) and so I was pumped to get my fix. First off, I sat down with my grandma and sister in a booth. The waitress came over and looked at me and goes 'the tables move if you want to push it away\"....I was instantly pissed. So you officially called me fat indirectly. F&CK YOU! She was really rude and hard to understand throughout the visit. My grandma tried ordering the small  burgers and the waitress could not understand at all. finally my grandma got fed up and just pointed at one of the $4 meals and said she would do that. \n\nThe food was not up to the standards. The shake tasted like the ice cream had gone bad and they were using expired product. So lumpy and not in a good way. My sister and I both agreed they were horrible! The burger and fries were warm, not hot and fresh. I was so disappointed. Needless to say none of us left a tip for our server who provided horrible service. You expect me to tip you after you essentially call me fat?! NOPE! \n\nMy sister and I went and gave the place a second chance one late night after returning to the hotel. We did takeout this time. Well actually it was the third attempt, as we stood in line a different day but found that the line wasn't moving. We finally the third time got through the line and the food was a bit better, but not by much, the food was ok. I tried the chili fries...waste of money. Just stick with the fries. This place will stay in business because it is a big name and \"fast food\", but really i think everyone will be disappointed. It does not meet the standards of steak and shake and the staff is horrible!
439	Some careless person threw bread crumbs into oncoming traffic. People are so rude\/gross!!! Everyone knows that the Bloordale-Parkdale pigeons' #1 weakness is breadcrumbs. And you're gonna put breadcrumbs on the road during the morning rush?! You monsters.  On a typical day I would consider this a bad omen, but unlike those pigeons, my day was GREAT!\n\nThe original plan was to go to The Works up the street, but fortunately The Yellow Griffin just happened to be closer.  I ordered the Calypso burger with onion rings and they were too delicious to describe. My bf had the Canadian burger and he thought it was amazing as well.  Even the beverages were fresh and delicious. \n\nThere was a HUGE and THICK bee flying around the windows inside the restaurant.  The bee was slow; I actually think it was a wasp.  Wasps are the ones with the child-bearing hips and the terrifying dangly legs.  This wasp is my only constructive criticism.  Next time either escort it off the premises or get a clip board and slap it down from the air until you hear that thud sound. \n\nFor all of the above reasons, I give The Yellow Griffin, 4 stars.  The star that elevates it to 5, is the delightful gentleman who wears the hearty smile and pleasant disposition. Another delightfully symmetrical man serving on the west side. He didn't even fumble when that big ol bee came around. I love that guy but he probably wont call.\n\n5 STARS!!!
440	I remember Cindy from her days running Suite Lorain. She has a great eye, and is always showing fun, cool stuff. My daughters grew up wearing \"her\" dresses, skirts and tops.  She's a bright, fair businesswoman who gets beyond the clutter, and makes it a pleasure to browse and buy.
441	We tried all the flavors and NONE weren't great. My favorites so far have been the rum raisin and the Nutella. We go to Viva Las Arepas next door all the time, and have added Art of Flavors to any trip we make downtown.
442	It's 3:30 late night early morning. You're on your way home after being in the club for who knows how many hours. They know you been drinking and no matter which way you take they're waiting for you, and being strategically placed around the city, they'll  get you before you make it home.\n  Yes, I'm talking about  Roberto's tacos. Open 24 hours and multiple locations. The chances of finding a Roberto's taco shop when you're drunk are as good as finding a McDonald's when you're sober.\n  Every time I go to Roberto's I have a hard time deciding what I want to order, ( besides having a hard time standing) everything is SO good. The machaca burritos and the rolled taquitos and the nachos and pretty much anything else that ends in \"os\" are my favorite!  \n  So next time you're out and looking for something good and little greasy to help you soak some of the alcohol in your system. Robertos is the place!\n  And please don't use Roberto's as an excuse for drinking..... That's \"my\" excuse!
443	I have mixed feelings about Evoke.\n\nBeen here about half a dozen times and there is one hairdresser that I swear by. She always gives me the most amazing hairdos and on one occasion, fixed a horrible mess of a haircut I had a week after I came back from vacationing in Baltimore*. She works wonders! She is very sincere and also manages to make her clients feel comfortable in their skin. We always have good conversations** together. \n\nMy last visit however, wasn't so grand.\n\nSince I wasn't able to book my favourite hairdress, I decided to try another. On the day of the visit, the new hairdresser was prompt and greeted me. We chatted a bit about what I wanted and then went to get my hair washed. The head massage was nice and since I was in a good mood, I continued making a few jokes here and there. \n\nNow, I'm not an intimidating person, partly due to the fact that most people still think I'm in high school; however, the hairdresser began getting more nervous as the time passed. She wasn't really talking back or responding to me - I hadn't said anything offensive and had stuck with neutral small talk - so I just stopped talking altogether. This seemed particularly unusual** and in the end, we were the only pair that were completely silent.  It felt as if I was on a bad date in an Italian restaurant. The haircut that came out of this wasn't particularly impressive and although she said she wanted to \"add some volume\" - and even my mother confirmed this within an hour of this incident - she had somehow managed to flatten my hair against the top of my head. The part wasn't done well and my bangs didn't hang properly. While I don't think she was taciturn because of me, I left feeling awkward and confused (i.e. \"Why did my date go so badly?\"). While I won't ask for her again, I'm sure she's still a decent hairdresser, as others have pointed out on Yelp reviews.\n\nMost of the receptionists I've encountered are nice, but most of them don't seem sincere. Some of them seem generally apathetic and I feel as if they're looking past me with vacant eyes. Too bad the last person I often have to interact is is with the money-taking mannequins at the front desk.\n\nThere's only one reason why I'm come back to Evoke. If I had more money, I'd hire my favourite hairdresser privately so I wouldn't have to deal with the rest of the staff.\n__________________________________\n*There are very few Asian people in Baltimore. It wasn't exactly the best idea that I went for a haircut there. Hindsight is 20\/20.\n\n**Part of the unwritten rules of hairdressing is that the hairdresser should give you the chance to gab and get any stress off your chest by chatting about it.
444	Wholey's... It's the beating heart of the Pittsburgh Strip District. \n\nFresh seafood, always. They have selection,  quantity and tremendous variety. And everything that goes with everything, right down to a very large recipe rack!  Fresh isn't working for you?  Then take it canned or frozen. Selection is how you prefer. \n\nGreat hot foods, take out or a cute eat in area to enjoy your choices.  One word:  SMELTS.\n\nFresh meats, reasonably priced!  Including duck, rabbit, buffalo and other harder to find offerings. \n\nFresh produce, including freshly squeezed OJ.\n\nIf you must limit your Strip visit, Wholey's can be your \"one stop\".
445	I have been here twice in a week and was hoping for a better experience my second time around. They just recently opened and still have kinks to work out, but I totally get this. My first visit I had the watermelon Margarita and it was way too sweet. We had the Brussel sprout nachos and they were good, probably the best item I have had on the menu. My second visit I shared the Tulum Poke on coconut rice. I was disappointed because I love poke. The fact that they have 3 different options for poke they just pour the sauce on top of the poke instead of it being marinated in the sauce. It was lack luster in taste and small portion of Tuna on a heaping mound of rice. We had the street corn dip which was good but not hot enough in temperature.  I had the chicken green chile taco and shrimp taco. I felt that everything is just under seasoned and I am not a huge salt fan. The plethora of sauces help liven up the tacos. I had the coconut margarita, it came in a cool mini coconut, but I feel the coconut water does not go well with the margarita mix. The atmosphere is adorable and I really want to like this place. I will come back in a couple of months to see if they have worked the kinks out. I really hope so!!
446	Thanks to the great reviews on yelp I decided to give Pan Asia a try. Walked in and was immediately greeted by David! he helped me understand exactly what I was ordering since it was my first time there. After 10-15 minutes food came right out. Ended up loving everything I ordered. Few days later Took my mom to try it out might I mention she is a very picky eater but I knew she would love this place and she did!
447	I can tell you all that Encore Beach Club is one of the best day club ever!!!! Luckily my group were on the guest list because this place is pricy! Ladies are around 50 and men $60. They do  have lockers so you don't have to hold on to your cellphone the whole day. Also, they have some amazing headliners playing at this venue. When I came David Guetta was performing and I can say he is better live. I was inches away from him!! In addition, the vibe is amazing and a great place to soak up some sun!! I can't wait to come back! Until then Encore Beach Club!!!
448	This place has tasty food - hence the 4 stars.\nIs it mind blowing? No.  But for fast food, it is a four star option.\n\nHowever, when I compare it to other greek-style places, it falls short in a few ways:\n\n1) The condiments.  For starters, you do not get any.  Between myself and my husband, we could probably go through a gallon of tzatiki sauce in one meal.  He likes to drench his fries in it, I like to dress my salad with it...but all you get (per gyro) is one itty bitty sad little cup.  And if you want feta cheese?  Jalapenos? Olives? A side of ANYTHING?  You must pay.  It makes one feel a bit nickeled and dimed (although the condiments cost much more than a single nickel or dime or nickel and dime combined).  It even cost $.50 to add cucumber to your gyro.  That can buy an entire cucumber at the grocery store!\n\n2) The french fries.  They are not bad fries per say, but they are bland.  They need some salt, or some garlic seasoning, or something.  I will add - they are not soggy and that is something I appreciate.  I hate soggy fries!!!  The other downside is that they are a small serving.  As a female, I often try to avoid greasy food to help counterbalance my ice cream intake, and instead I like to eat them off my husband's plate. Because if they come from my husband's plate, then they do not count as part of my meal. Right?  But this is hard to do when my husband is protecting a small reserve.\n\nAt the end of the day,when you add up all the condiments, a meal costs over $20.  And as I type this, my husband is in the kitchen eating chips out of the pantry, so the $20 did not even fill him up.\n\nBut was it tasty, yes.\nWe just needed more french fries and condiments.
449	I love Costco.  Great prices, decent customer service, great lunch deals!  Where else can you have a 1\/4 pound hot dog and a drink for $1.60?  Of course they have free samples that encourage you to buy an item.  They sometimes hook me with those.  But you can have lunch every day in that place and never spend a penny.  And like Elle said, the items are a much higher quality than Sams Club.\n\nIf you didn't know, Costco is a warehouse club that sells things in bulk.  Then also have jewelry and electronics that are a great deal.  I often order items from the web-site when I can get free shipping.  Also note that they have great prices on tires (often beating Discount Tire) and gasoline.  The pumps are a little hidden on the east side of the building, but they have plenty of them.  No diesel though.\n\nThe only downside to this Costco is the parking.  Holy shit!  There have been many times when I've wanted to go postal on the morons who are parking their 25 foot long SUV's in tiny assed spaces blocking the entire aisle for 10 minutes while they lube up the sides to squeeze in.  All this while they yap on the phone and adjust their tits\/nuts.  But then, I'm impatient.  I usually park on the side lot south of the tire shop.
450	My brother and I went back to Jambo later that evening and the moment the manager saw my mom, he ran to the back. We told my mom to wait in the car while we confronted the manager. To make a very long story short, throughout the 20 minutes of him being in denial and saying that what he did was not wrong the 2 things that stood out were: \n\n1. ALL adults should know that ONLY water goes in to those cups and if my mom saw something otherwise, she should've poured it out (Yeah, cause my mom works there and knows their rules) \n\n2. As to why she didn't \"rat\" the guy out who gave my son soda, \"Let's say your son was being beat, wouldn't you want management to know who was beating him and not worry so much about him getting fired?\" (Uhhh beating a child and giving him a small cup of soda is NOT comparable!!!) \n\nHis logic was so irrational. In the end, after refusing repeatedly to give us the owner or HIS managers name, he finally blurts out, \"You can call here another day and ask for Jackie.\" My brother: Okay, who's Jackie? CHRIS: She's a black lady. \nUHHHHH what does her having to be black have ANYTHING to do with this? \nCHRIS: I'm not trying to be discriminatory. She's another manager. mmm okay. \n\nWe demanded a refund and at first he refused to give us one saying he was allowed to give only 2 refunds a month,  then he retracted and said, okay, if I give you a refund will you not bring this up again and leave me alone?  Will you not escalate this?  (Admitting fault, are we?).  My brother kept demanding the refund to which he gave us.  Are we satisfied? Absolutely not.  This is still going to be escalated!!!!!
451	Came here for the first time on a Monday night for dinner, and I was rather disappointed. For its price, I definitely expected something a lot better. This buffet is pretty small so there wasn't much variety. All the food served here were really standard. The crab legs and shrimps were not fresh. You get your drinks from the fountain machines. There is also no gelato! They only had the self serve ice cream machines so it wasn't special at all. Compared to the buffet in wynn and cosmopolitan this one is really not up to par. Won't be returning in the future.
452	Good food but not amazing. Good for a quick affordable meal if you want to avoid fast food.
453	This went from a potentially favorable review to 1 star because they just admitted they alternated conventional oil and synthetic for my last several oil changes.
454	I arrived at lunch time to this Wendy's it was super busy 15min wait for food... The food was good if I was in the mood for Wendy's again I would go back to this location again.
455	This is the first place I ever came to for my nails when I moved to Vegas in 2005. I've been coming back ever since then. They have new gossip magazines, the place is very clean, best massage chairs,and they are always friendly. I've never had one problem in all the years I've gone here. highly recommend this nail place.
456	This place is my absolute favorite! I live about 2 hours north but always find time to come down here to shop. I can always find clothes that fit me perfectly and I bring my own clothing to sell as well!
457	Last year I wrote a less than flattering review about the pastizzi.   Went today and they were perfect. Dough was chewy and flaky and the cheese was hot and flavourful. Thanks.
458	We had lunch at Little Miss BBQ for the first time. It was the best BBQ I've ever had. My pulled pork sandwich was so tender it was like butter! The cold is good, the grits are good and these are good. I will recommend and will be back many many times! Beware the place is very tiny they have misters outside with some picnic tables and you will have to wait. But it is well worth the wait!
459	Ordered BBQ takeout from the place. They no longer have it outside by the cashier, so it was prepared (cut) inside.\n\nMy pound of bbq pork turned out more like half a pound when I opened it at home and my marinated duck had the roasted duck plum sauce included instead :(
460	I come to this location about four times a week and Danny always kicks my ass whenever we're in training together clean machines plenty of Weights super friendly staff this is my home away from home
461	different taste of the one in Pacific Mall. \nless noodles inside. need to improve, don't want to go there any more
462	I really enjoyed this restaurant. Food was delicious, service was great and fast, and the atmosphere was really nice. I got the kale salad with grilled chicken. I am really weird about grilled chicken and get grossed out easily and this grilled chicken was perfect!  So well done. And the fries are amazing.
463	We had to check this place out after seeing 5 stars reviews in yelp. After an hour wait in line, it was worth the wait. Yum!! Brisket, sausage, pecan pie and the sides are all so yummy. Jalapeño grits and potato salad have a lil kick for me but still yum. Was too hungry and forgot to take pictures
464	Mac n cheese burger was very flavorful and juicy. The nachos were good as well but they brought our meal at almost the exact same time so really did not get to enjoy them. Felt a little rushed when it was not even that busy.
465	I was going to take pictures, but it smelled so good I couldn't wait. \n\nI drive past the restaurant every day on my way to work, so I've been eagerly awaiting the reopening, as there aren't many great stir fry places here in town. I went with a friend and we each ordered a stir fry and we shared the sriracha fries and the dumplings. All of it was amaaaazing. The apps didn't last more than a minute, and we inhaled our noodles. \n\nIn addition to the great food, the staff there is super nice. They explained the ordering process and helped us decide which noodles and sauces to use in our stir fry. They even let us taste all of the sauces to decide which one we wanted. \n\nOverall, awesome place and I can't wait to go back!
466	I admit it.... I'm a book junky!\nNo seriously, I love books.\nI never get time to read all the books I buy.\nOld books, new books, character books, business, self-help.\nMaybe I need a book on how to read all the books I have?!\n\nOk, back on point.\nThis is a gem in the awesome community of Kensington.\nAre you a bookworm\/bibliophile\/book-lover??\nIf so then this is the place for you.\n\nA wickedly charming space on two floors.\nBooks you won't find at a big-box retailer nor is there a SB in the store.\nSpeaking of which, you can buy a book or ten here and then pop across the street to Higher Ground for a real coffee and a cookie and support yet another local business.\n\nThis place smells like a book store should it is THAT authentic!\nThe floors creak for extra character too - lol\n\nLiterary genius is evident in every book you pick up.\nKids books, cook books, novels, technical books, business - they have it all.\nPerhaps 2 or 3 copies at most. But who cares!! The selection is small and magical!\n\nThe staff are knowledgeable and so generous with their time to help you.\n\nNotebooks!! I love all the unique notebooks they have - which is the reason I went in to the store in the first place. What a great find. \nI'll be back over and over ---- and you should be too.\n\nSupport local - we never want to lose this gem!
467	Food is always good but service is not good. They've expanded the place but it made service worse. A lot of empty tables but a line at the door with one guy working register, seating people and acting as a waiter too!!! Normally I would get up and leave but food is good\nAll said and done I'll still come back\nAdios
468	What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said about Barbra Streisand..... \n\nLadies and Gentleman: \n\nOne night I went there dancing and saw two folks hitting it off at the bar upstairs - drinkin'. dancin', kissin', cuddlin', and 9 yards later they're downstairs swooning over nachos while dialing for a cab... AAANNND SCENE. On a major bender, the boys and I were out all night and decided to do a round trip back to Sneaky Dee's for some Breakfast.... as any drunk and restless 20something year old would do... but to our surprise we saw the SAME girl from last night WITHOUT the guy. She sat alone, poking away at the breakfast special with the same dress on, heels leaning on the other side of the booth - where the man once sat MERELY hours ago -, and her mascara running into the eggs.... not only were the eggs scrambled, but clearly her memory from last night.\n \nThis is Toronto.\nThis is Sneaky Dee's. \n\nThere are too many positive attributes to give this place. Giving only 5 stars truly doesn't do it justice; If I could give a sixth star I totally would.... I'D BE ON THAT LIKE PEACHES ON TOAST. AND1. \n\nGreat location, flexible hours, accessible by legs or wheels, family run business, very cheap beer, very cheap food, very delicious eats, very vegan friendly, very friendly staff....this place is your home away from home. Often I find myself eating \/ drinking \/ partying here a couple times a month and not once does it get boring, not once does it get dated, this place is as consistent as the warm bath mama used to make you... or still does.... how would I know?! I AIN'T YOU! \n\nNot only does this place offer delicious eats, a punk rock decor, and the dirtiest washrooms you can stomach.... but the upstairs concert venue has a spectrum of entertainment as as wide as Streisand's nose... \n\nBOOM! TWO - FER ! YEAH! \n\nEvery night of the week something is happen' - Legends of Karaoke, MFOY, WHAT'S POPPIN',  Live Bands, Shake a Tail ..... you name it! It's graced the upstairs venue. \n\nIf you don't come for the nachos, the dance parties, bringing home hot chicks, the bouncers pummeling morons, that drunk girl falling down the front steps, the juggler outside, loud music, drunken shenanigans.... then you probably just stepped in just to use the washroom... in which case, the joke is on you. \n\nHave a cheeky glance at Sneaks -  This place is magic. \n\nSincerely, \n\nAbraham Lincoln
469	Was recommended I pre-order doughnuts so I did, pre-paid as well.  When it was time for me to pick up they weren't set aside for me but the cool night shift lady tried to accommodate the misfortune by offering other items, I decided to see Lance in the morning to get my money back.  The lady showed me the clipboard with my name, my order, and the fact I paid.\n\nI don't live remotely close to the area so it took me another day to come out but I arrived.  While standing in line Lance was taking care of a customer and asks me what I needed, I told him just to get my money back and he laughed and said \"yea right\".  Talk about embarrassing, the customer behind me who was waiting for his girl to complete the purchase laughed at me and Pink Box's unofficial worker who opens doors for people chuckled at me too.  \n\nWhen asked what I was talking about I explained my situation and his cashier said she recognized my name but doesn't know what happened.\n\nLance refunded my money back in good faith, but it'd be kinda awkward to go back to a place that just embarrassed me?  We'll see, doughnuts are still good.
470	The atmosphere is totally cool. If you're looking for an awesome place to eat in Phoenix, this is it. We were there over the holiday weekend and it seemed like everything was closed, but this place was hopping. The service was excellent. We highly recommend the pretzel appetizer, and the Turkey Sloppy Joe.
471	Great service. Very clean salon. Friendly staff. Everyone is talented, my favorite is Kevin.
472	The Croque Madame was lacking in flavor and they skimped on ingredients (from the béchamel sauce to the cheese on the bread). The side potatoes were cold and mushy. For $14, I expect more of an effort. The restaurant also had that low ambient cooler noise that made it seem more like a cafeteria than a cozy french bistro. We won't be back.
473	This is by far the best Starbucks I've ever been to! All the Barista's are very nice(MJ is so amazing), and I had a great experience. These guys make a pretty damn fine espresso.
474	OMG god am I glad I only live 5 minutes from here! Can I just live here and eat here everyday?!? I'm so serious this place blows my mind away!!! It's so ridiculously good! It's really intimate and when you first walk in you may think you are walking into any other hole in the wall Vietnamese joint but boy are you in for a treat! Anything you get on the menu I guarantee will be great. I highly recommend the spring rolls on the appetizer section, it looks like a condom with a bunch of veggies and shrimp and beef stuffed inside but it's amazing! Also if you have never tried pho before this is a great place to do so. I love seafood so I always get the shrimp and beef pho and it never disappoints me. Customer service is great! They are always on their toes to make sure you are pleased! This place absolutely deserves a 5 star. It's a must try!!!
475	Today I had the chicken Teaka masala lamb biryani and the shrimp korma and the service was excellent
476	The employees move in slow motion some days, and they run out of the pastries easily. There raspberry lemonades and iced Capps are in consistent and depends on who makes it! It sucks because you hope it would be too concentrated or too watery!!!! \n\nThe tim hortons right outside the mall is ten times better!
477	First of all I am a doughnut junkie I friggin love em,  I have been to numerous shops that are rated best in the country, Doughnut Plant in New York, Round Rock Doughnuts in Austin...ect. So I feel I really know what to expect from a good doughnut. This was my second trip to PBD which is as bad as the first, on my first visit they had just been open for a week, so I let everything slide and decided I would give them another shot.\n\nMy second visit started out just like the first, the showcases almost empty and not much to choose from. They did have the large tray holder out and I had to keep asking what's that and he would pull out the tray to show me what was not in the case.\n\nOk, now for the quality, these boys need to visit a few doughnut shops around the country, they need learn the doghnut biz. The dougnuts are not even soft, the glaze on the doghnuts are so thin you can see the bread underneath showing through. \n\nBut the worst part of this visist was how they packed the doughnuts (you can see a pic #51 of it on thier yelp page) They just threw them on top of each other and just kept stacking them one on another, and this was done by the spiky hair manager. \n\n\n\nI was totally wrong in this review and should have made a third trip to PBD before reviewing. \n\nI now really really love their donuts especially the maple bacon, i am now a very good customer. \n\nThey have very creative and super tasty donuts anyone would love.
478	Came in today because when you search places to eat in Scottsdale this is one of the cutest. This place def didn't let me down, such amazing decor and great service! We had Collin helping us out and he was amazing! I am from San Diego so this heat is very different for me,so I had to try the snow cone margarita. Collin warned me that it would be sweet, but it was just perfect, great tequila and super girly! To eat I had the Brussel sprout nachos and shrimp taco, I cannot say enough about the amazing sauces that they offer. Not just the sauce they put on the meal but they bring out 6 different sauces for the table as well. Our favorite sauce was the Serrano ranch...absolutely delicious!! My boyfriend got the California burrito which was either a flop or fail since Im from Cali but the meat was so delicious and tender, the corn included...great Cali burrito!!
479	Had dinner there tonight. Had the Hogtown tacos. Big mistake. Was absolutely infect and uneatable. Where one would expect pulled pork, I instead got little cubes of what appeared to be ham soaked in an over-salted bbq sauce, along with a few strips of bacon. The soft taco shells had long lost any softness. Disgusting would be putting it mildly. \n\nMy wife had the turkey club. How on earth can you screw up a turkey club? At St Louis Bar, they manage to do that. And the French fries? They were memorable for their fat-induced limpness. \n\nI have instructed my kids to have me institutionalized if I  ever mention going there again.
480	Que Rico! \n\nI had the Fajitas a la Mexicana today, and they were easily the best fajitas I've ever had. The chef sent out an extra queso fundido topping for the fajitas that was incredible! The staff are a delight. Our server was Elizabeth, and she was so much fun to talk to. Service was superb. Food was superb. This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. \n\nMuchas Gracias Los Cucos!
481	I just moved to this side of town and haven't shopped at F&E since I lived in Centennial Hills so I was excited to have an F&E be the nearest grocery store to me! They have changed a lot and this location isn't as big as the other location I would go to but they still have clearance items that are still fresh and the prices aren't too terrible. I just wish they would come out with new fresh meals, they still have the same old pasta and such it gets boring after awhile to eat the same thing over and over it would be nice to see more new prepped items as I have little time to cook since I work full time. Other than that, they are 24 hours which is convenient and have self check outs! I do feel bad when they have a cashier on duty, I did run into one who was like \"hey I can help you over here\" which made me feel awkward because I already started scanning my items and I'm happy doing the work myself especially when I wasn't buying that much.
482	This is some good shit!!!\n\nThis is the first Indian food I've tried in Cleveland. My husband went bananas over the papri chat - totally agree with Pam C on that one!!!! We had the buttery, soft naan as well. I guess naan can't really be bad, but this was gooooood.\n\nI had the lamb saag, which was different for me, as I usually order chicken korma or chana masala. It was great, but I actually liked the sauce more than the lamb itself. The rice was moist and delicately spiced. \n\nHaven't been to the restaurant, as ordered from food fetchers, but I would definitely go in a heartbeat. And I would order takeout again! There are a LOT of items to choose from.
483	Saber knows how to cook good clean food!!! I typically eat here 1-2 times a week... I always get their grass feed topless burger. Always cooked to perfection,  topped with a creamy butter,garlic tomato mix. The fries are awesome- regular or sweet potato!  The sauted veggies have this simple yet irresistible flavor!\n\nI work at the school down the street and we often cater from Herb N Flavors - guests are always amazed by the food we serve. \n\nThis is a local business that cares about their customers and the quality of their food.
484	I like how you can call your order in and they'll make it fresh for you. I had the Mexican wrap and Lebanese salad and the macaroon that came with all for $10. I really enjoyed the salad and macaroon not so much the wrap but I will definitely be back. The cashier was very friendly and asked if I would to sample anything which was very appealing for me to return to try new items on the menu.
485	I have eaten middle eastern food all over Toronto. Came here for lunch and ordered a simple Swarma. While waiting out of curiously and was surprised at the low scoring reviews. Then my sandwich arrived and I realized my wife and I had different toppings (but I hadn't order any of my toppings). Not the end of the world and my sandwich was okay. My son didn't like the pickles or beets and picked his out. It is just odd that when u publish toppings on the menu you don't ask what people want. Next time I will go to a smaller family owned shop and make sure I decide what is on my sandwich. Service. Poor overall service unless you are an UBER eats driver as they take care of those guys.
486	Like the other reviewers here, we too are still waiting on our car, being shipped from NJ to CA. \nThe 17 day window they promise as the \"extreme\" case, and it will very likely be quicker.\nNow that we have surpassed this date, the customer service claims, that is just an estimate, we cannot guarantee when it will arrive.\nI will concur, it is very difficult to find a reliable car carrier, but avoid DAS, they are more expensive than other providers, and simply do not provide strong customer service, and certainly are unable to get your car.\nUnfortunately we have now spent over $700 in rental car fees to make up forthis.\nStill waiting on our car.\n\nI will update this when we receive the car.
487	Let me preface this by saying I've been a Yelp! elite since 2009 and I can't remember the last time I doled out a 1-star review.   \n\nHow do you mess up dinner out with the family?   BAM! Take them to Emeril's.    \n\n10 minute wait to be acknowledged at your table and offered a beverage?  BAM! Only at Emeril's.  \n\nPlaced an order for 2 Filet's - only to hear that they were out of that cut of steak.   BAM, disappointing! \n\nThe \"creamy\" mashed potatoes were soupy and inedible.   BAM... You get the point.   \n\nThe jambalaya came out cold.   \n\nBurger for the kids cooked medium well?   How about ground beef consistency in the middle.  It was medium at best.  Sent it back and due to the length of time we had been waiting we just had it removed from the bill as my kids were now tired and hungry only having eaten the side of fries and pretzel rolls for dinner.   Great.    \n\nBourbon sweet potatoes?   Oily and over seasoned with cinnamon and no Bourbon flavor.  \n\nLet our server, Don, know about our dissatisfaction and a manager never even made his way to the table to check on us.  Did I mention that after we expressed our dissatisfaction to him he had another server bring over our check.   He never came back to check on us after we expressed our displeasure.  Poor execution.  \n\nOverall sorely disappointed.    Asked for the General Managers name, (Sean?) but not even worth the effort to write a letter.   \n\nBAM! Won't be back...
488	Located in Fulton Ranch, a fairly new upscale shopping center including an AJ's, Sautee seemed to be trying too hard and in some cases not hard enough.\n\nI stopped in for an impromptu lunch, even though I was still slightly full from breakfast.\nOh I hate it when i go somewhere new and everything sounds good and I don't know what to order, so I thought I'd try a few different things.\n\nPretty expensive entrees, up to $29.95! Moderately priced salads and sandwiches around the $10 range.\n\nI decided to start with the Fried Calamari, soaked in buttermilk for maximum tenderness these thick and juicy strips were melt in your mouth bliss.(see pics) \nThe accompaniment sauces however were not a good match, chipotle chile, tasted like spicy BBQ and the key lime red pepper was like a sweetened thinned out mayo, I didn't detect any lime flavor in there at all, I ended up asking for lemon wedges which were just what those babies needed, YUM!\n\nI also ordered the Chicken Satay skewers served with spicy tangerine sauce, these were tasty and the sauce was perfect match(see pics)\n\nThe last thing I tried was one of their Fire Grilled Flat-breads, I chose the \"of the day\" flavor which was urban chicken, with spinach, mushroom and smoked gouda (see pics) \nNot impressed at all, I can guarantee this was not made to order, my toppings slid around under a thick blanket of dried cheese, meaning it was melted sometime before I ever ordered it. I only took two bites.\n\nMy waiter service was good, I was visited in total by 3 different waiters(?) all who asked how everything was and I expressed to each of them my dislike of the pizza. \n\nUnfortunately none of them offered to get me something else or remove it from my bill~which is the courteous standard at most restaurants~especially NEW ones.\n\nThe pizza was even boxed  up for me, why would I want to take home something I didn't like? I told him to toss it.\n\nI'm not sure if I would come back here or not, maybe to try a salad, but I'm not going to chance spending $30 on entree that I might not like.
489	I've brought my son here since he was born and Dr. Alan Jauregui has always been amazing with my son honestly I'd give 5 stars to him and his team.\n\nBUT today my husband had an appointment with Dr. Hugh and her team was professional and she acted professionally as well. BUT the way she was dressed was soooo inappropriate I honestly couldn't believe my eyes. I understand if you're going on a hot date or to a party or something even out to the mall is fine. In a doctors office this is not ok. She was wearing a tiny black shoulder off dress and high black stiletto heels. \nI'm honestly no one to judge she looked great in her dress but in a doctors office this is not ok. I kind of felt a little offended that she would wear this to see patients. \n\nAnyways This is why I give this medical 3 stars because the employees should dress more professionally.
490	I would be beside myself if Grinders closed. It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.\n\nI'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...\n\nThe music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.\n\nThe coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.\n\nThere's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.\n\nThere's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.\n\nA lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.\n\nEarly in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes. \n\nOrdinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.\n\nThere's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever. \n\nI can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.\n\nGrinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there. LAME!
491	One of the best Doctors I know!  He takes time with his patients and very knowledgeable.  Dr. Burdorf is highly recommended for any type of Neuro Orthopedic rehabilitation needs.  A+++ in my book.
492	Located in the Cosmopolitan hotel, this is a perfect place to grab a quick bite. The first visit I ordered a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich which was quite good. Nothing special about it, but made to order and quite good for breakfast. The second visit I had the slut which was a coddled egg on potato purée which was absolutely delicious. They serve it in a glass jar which I felt was wasteful to the environment with no place to recycle the glass jars... I had a chocolate cookie here which was amazing... they give a lot of paper and plastic with each order. I brought back a bag full of utensils, napkins etc that we never used and the guy said I was the first to ever do that... I'm from Canada and we are heavily into recycling! Love this place,\nworth the wait!
493	I am ABSOLUTELY! disgusted, I was in today and sat in a table close to the kitchen. I could hear management \"obviously the 2 men in suits\" talking about their staff in an absolute horrid way, also could hear them and the fowl way the man was yelling at his staff in the kitchen (since they seated me in the worst table in an almost empty restaurant). The service was on point obviously because there servers were walking around scared instead of happy.\nThe food was mediocre, I'm more disgusted with the management and ways they spoke about my awesome server kalie.\nIf you want a good steak I would save your time and money.  Having to listening to restaurant politics when I was just trying to relax on my day off (leave that shit in the office, came to relax not listen to b.s.) was not relaxing..... Lite your grill, save your money.This place is a joke!!!
494	Another one of my go to places for lunch when I'm in Pittsburgh.  I had the corned beef sandwich with a raspberry lemonade.  Always a great experience. Friendly service in a friendly atmosphere.
495	Vacation time spent by a trip to see the family is generally rife with compromises. After failing to produce an agreement on anything we all really wanted, we ended up at the somewhat unfortunately named BJ's Brewhouse.\n\nI half expected to see gaggles of teenage boys and tweenage girls (of roughly the same maturity level) stifling giggles about what \"BJ\" might stand for, but did not. The other half expected the food to be disappointing and for me to be already longing for some good Szechuan before I'd been in Arizona 2 hours, and pleasantly did not experience that either. Standard chain decor, standard chain service, standard ratio of operational to non-operational men's room stalls (non-zero.)\n\nWe opted for the stealth $20 email special of a shared medium pizza (any specialty or number of toppings), a shared \"pizookie\" dessert and individual soup or salad which I would strongly recommend since normally a specialty pizza itself is $20.\n\nThe starter? Minestrone with a bit of cheese. Italian. Adequate. Unremarkable.\nThe pizza? A paradoxically Chicago-style Southwestern, like a chain boutique version of Pizza Hut. Solid crust, great by Seattle standards (low.)\nThe dessert? A very thin (Peanut Butter, among the 5+ varieties) cookie in a pancake-sized tin topped with vanilla ice cream. I was more preoccupied with whether Madame K's Pizza Brothel, er, Bistro in Seattle copied the Screaming Orgasm from them or vice-versa (and thinking they would have been better off to copy BJ's pizza) than the experience of the sweet cookie.\n\nThe verdict? For optimizing any particular aspect, one could do better elsewhere, but the pizza is quite good among mostly forgettable accompaniments. Chains are generally compromise candidates, and in that vein, BJ's Brewhouse performs the job.
496	The bar tender tonight was rude.  Two customers were ar the bar and i asked for 2 drinks and a water.  He was mad that i asked for a drink?  Well, the staff waiting on customers in the gambling areas asked us what we wanted, but never came back with our orders, two plus hours waiting.  2 drinks had no alcohol.  Cranberry vodka.  Bartender used his gun?  30 dollars for two drinks with no alcohol.  Rude rude rude rude.
497	We are local newly weds and wanted a mini getaway.\nHad been wanted to stay here for a while. Luckily we found a deal through hotels.com. We were definitely not disappointed. The staff was very friendly. Even though it was raining hard we didn't hear a thing.\nThe only downside was there was no hot water the first time we tried to use the tub. But we realized it was kinda late and went to sleep. Took a morning bubble bath it was perfect will definitely be back!
498	Delicious authentic Thai food. \n\nEvery time we come in we get what they call \"the crying tiger\". It's steak on a bed of lettuce that comes out with these 2 sauces. The sauces are the highlighters! This is why you cry when u eat this dish. Lol it is spicer then anything but it's also extra delicious so you just can't get enough of it! One sauce is red (my favorite) and one is green (burns your whole mouth). I honestly love spicy foods but the green sauce might just be my limit! \n\nThe dish comes out with rice. I usually make like a little lettuce wrap with it. You can just dip the meat in the sauce and eat it with rice. Which ever way.. It's extra delicious. Also you can substitute the meat with chicken which is what my beau does because he's on a diet and can only eat chicken. But if you want chicken breast you have to call ahead and check if they have it because they don't always carry chicken breast. But either way it's still bomb.\n\nI've also had the chicken Pad Thai which was amazing as well. I actually ate the whole dish by myself which NEVER happens! Lol \n\nThe staff are really attentive and nice. They make sure they come and talk to us and converse. Waters are always full. And one time one of the species took over my throat and I was coughing up a storm and they Gave me a free Thai tea! Which actually helped with the heat. \n\nLove this place and usually come in once a week or once every other week!
499	Dinner on a Friday night and there were only 2 other sets of diners.\nNice decor and open kitchen view with two LATINO chefs.  Waitress, bus girl were also not from Vietnam.  No diners from Vietnam.  Draw your own conclusions but my wife and I ordered their \"dancing beef\" and split it between us, plus tea and bowl of rice that cost over $21.  There was over a half of the dish left (beef tasted mildly like liver) and we usually take home any left overs but not this time.  Owner not overseeing his place indicates how much interest he must have.  Good location. Will not return when there are so many other choices nearby with better food.
500	$6.99 yep... \n\nSteak cooked perfectly, salad, beans, bread, potato and hand crafted rootbear or beer. \n\n$6.99...\n\nPs if you see a really nice old lady by herself please join her for dinner, she is super nice. Her name is Jean and tell her Daren from Arizona said hello.
501	Omg - the lunch buffet is insanely amazing, every dish is delicious. I am big into Indian food- and from New York, so i know pretty much about Indian food. But this place is a blast- quality of food is 10\/10. Service by staff 10\/10. Cleanness, cutlery, variety of food- everything is amazing. Price is very decent for this kind of buffet $ 12 for lunch buffet . It's equal to pay nothing for this food. Host is amazing, very nice experienced guy, who knows the likes and dislikes of custmors. Interior decor of the place so beautiful, very decent place.\n\nStrongly recommended.
502	The Pollo Loco of Charlotte? Maybe. :) BEST CHICKEN SOUP!\n\nThis is our go-to healthy meal when we order lunch for everyone at the office. We always get 2 latin combos and 2 chicken soups.\n\nThe chicken is rotisserie, very juicy and the salad is really fresh. Yummy Plantains, Yummy Yucca, Good rice and beans too. \n\nThe chimichurri sauce will kick your butt though - dont eat that. The green sauce is also pretty hot - the white sauce is super yummy - get extra of that and use it on the salad - thats my jam!\n\nI skip the rice and the beans usually - and never feel guilty about eating the yummy chicken, salad and plantains. :)
503	It seems like most everyone else has had a much better experience than we did. My partner and I went to Arrogant Butcher for dinner Christmas Eve. The service and food started out great, but it all fell apart when it came to the entrees. They did adjust the bill, but the way they handled the situation was very poor.\n\nWe started with an Antipasti appetizer consisting of two cheeses, one meat and marinated olives. The waiter assisted with our selections and it along with our drink order came promptly. The appetizer was delicious.\n\nWhen the entrees came my partner's steak, which was ordered medium well, was burnt to a crisp. The server even asked him what he thought of it and said they already had another steak cooking for hm since this one looked overcooked. \n\nWhy bother bringing food to the table that you know isn't right? Now I had my dinner and while he technically had food he was waiting for the replacement. At his suggestion I ate my dinner and of course finished before he received his. \n\nThe biggest issue was the overcooked steak. A couple small things were the side of grilled asparagus I ordered came chilled. I asked and that's the way they prepare it. Grill it, then chill it. That should have been disclosed as I've never heard of that type of preparation before. My glass of wine I ordered \"with dinner\" came half way through my meal. Again, poorly executed.\n\nWe still had a nice evening despite the missteps by the restaurant.
504	Why did you guys close? You guys had the best pizza in and around Carrick. The other places don't compare. I would have bought the business off of you just so there would be a decent pizza place around. I know you have been closed for a few years. Make me an offer l will get this business back up and running!!!! :)
505	Just ate $2 tacos during Happy Hour! They were soooo good! The service was impeccable! Ask for Brittany- she was a ball of energy!!! The atmosphere was upbeat with current music. The place smelled good as we walked in. This is a great atmosphere to eat and chill out, especially during Happy Hour!
506	The food is good. I will agree that the quality has changed as I remember coming to this restaurant with my family as a child, but the food is still okay. The service is terrible. I understand there is a language barrier, but respectively I feel customer service is an attitude and you should treat all customers the same. I could not understand the woman at the register and she became very short and upset with me when I was extremely patient and nice. I would suggest they hire someone with more experience working with customers.
507	This was my first time buying a home and Bryce made the process super easy for me! I was unsure what type of home I wanted at first and Bryce was patient with me to help me figure out the best buy. After a few months of working together, we found me the perfect home and such a great price. Bryce worked very hard to negotiate on my behalf as get me the best deal possible. Anyone who is looking to buy a home for the first time I highly recommend using Bryce. He will not only meet expectations but also exceed them.\n\nThanks Bryce for doing such an amazing job!
508	Dr. Lin and his staff are great. I went in for a kidney stone in January 2010 and that went well.  I then went in for the big V in December 2010... it was straightforward, the doctor was very comforting and the procedure went very well.  I'm sure my jokes about strange women grabbing my bits and pieces fell on deaf ears but that's how I dealt with it.  Healing went smoothly and I was back to normal functionality in 3 weeks.  I've had 3 friends go through the procedure elsewhere and all three got infections or some other sort of complication.  I'm happy to say that mine went flawlessly- and as of Friday, in the immortal words of the Cabin Boy- Chris Elliot \"These pipes are clean!!!!!\"
509	Items Selected:\nLobster & Truffle Chawanmushi with Black Truffle Potato Base\nHeritage Berkshire Pork Gyoza with Soy-Vinegar Dipping Sauce\nBaked Crab Hand Rolls - Baked Snow Crab with signature sauce, rice, soy paper\nSashimi Course - Fresh Uni with Ikura, Ama Ebi, Snapper, Scallop, Aji, Ora King Salmon, Octopus, Kampachi\nTomago\nLobster Tempura - Half Lobster lightly battered and tossed with creamy, spicy sauce, topped with candied walnuts\nCorn Crunch Roll - Garlic Butter Sauteed Shrimp and Avocado Rolled with Crispy Corn Tempura drizzled with sweet soy\nWafu Carbonara - Slow cooked Bacon, Soy Reduction, Soft Poached Egg\nWarm Bread Pudding - Cinnamon Custard, Caramel Sauce, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream\nLemon Berry Pie - Yuzu Custard, Shortbread Crust, Macerated Strawberries, Strawberry Sorbet\nDouble Espresso over Ice - LAMill\n\nLike many of the Los Angeles offshoots within the SLS Hotel and Casino, Katsuya by Starck arrived to excited opening acclaim when the resort opened its doors just one year ago, and although time as well as legal troubles have led to a bit of negative press the restaurants themselves have continued to show well with trendy crowds and bumping EDM detracting only slightly from cuisine that fares far better than doubters may expect.\n\nAdmittedly known to the house, but ordering a la carte and treated to items no different to those served at tables around us, it was at a cozy booth decorated in katana and neon fans that our trio sat, and greeted by Chefs as well as a young server who proved above par for the course a ten-item sampler of signatures as well as a couple more eclectic items were ordered, the results ranging from truly excellent to surprisingly not bad.\n\nNo doubt a spot to be seen, the crowd well dressed and attractive with the sort of lighting and ambiance that intentionally screams 'cool,' the meal began with Japanese Beer alongside Sake and progressing to an atypical chawanmushi that saw custard atop black truffle mashed potatoes punched up with lobster there is little doubt the menu's high prices are at least in-part justified by the quality of ingredients, each bite utterly indulgent no matter how far from tradition it did stray.\n\nRequesting the kitchen to roll out items at the Chef's discretion, plates two and three featured Katsuya's signature crab roll alongside rich pork gyoza interconnected by a flaky lattice, and although the former was indeed creamy and supple the crustacean itself seemed a touch muddled by semi-sweet sauce while the golden dumplings were a head-on assault on the senses, the thin shell breaking forth with juicy bekshire pig lent balance by a melange of herbs and spices.\n\nNext offered an iced sashimi box along with a full order of tomago, suffice it to say that with exception of a few mispronunciations from the server everything spoke to quality fish sliced by a skilled hand, and with the half lobster arriving next given a whimsical 'walnut prawn' treatment the lightness of the batter almost seemed impossible, particularly when accounting for the fact that the flesh itself remained sweet, tender, and appropriately cooked just past raw.\n\nAmused by the crunchy corn roll, an item selected almost entirely because it seemed destined to fail yet one that instead offered a complex flavor profile that saw discrepant ingredients each add something to the whole, savories concluded in a large bowl of wafu noodles steaming beneath a poached egg and tender bacon, the soy unfortunately pushing the salinity a bit past 'umami' and into the realm of outright salty, a shame as the noodles and bacon were each prepared quite well.\n\nUnable to settle on just one dessert, the selection of sweets actually quite appealing compared to spots like Nobu or Koi, it was with two items served alongside a double espresso of LAMill over ice that the meal would end, and although the small tart of yuzu pudding on a buttery crust was a refreshing bite brightened by strawberries it simply couldn't compare to a creamy bread pudding given the 'baba au rhum' treatment by way of a pipette of booze, the addition of a honey tuille and rich vanilla ice cream adding complexity of temperature, texture, and taste.\n\nFaring better than similarly branded swank sushi houses with a few standouts and the only real flaws in cuisine a result of too much sauce, Katsuya fulfills its role of offering tourists and club kids a good variety of light bites in a trendy setting while also providing high quality cuisine for more serious diners willing to look past the 'scene.'
510	When I was in elementary school, this was the kind of place that made me excited to know that one day, I too, would drive a car.\n\nThe candy selection is nearly limitless and being that it's all in bulk, curiosities need not go unfulfilled. They also have all the necessary crap for any sort of silly little party. They don't have anything for bachelorette parties, last I checked, so you won't find any dildo action, but that's forgivable. \n\nIf the party is kiddie-centered, then you have found your match.
511	My mother handed my cousins and I her credit card and said go enjoy your cousin's birthday.  What she did was the worst mistake a mother can do, offer the open option agreement.  I believe in her head she thought we would modestly go for pizza or perhaps if a little daring Chinese.  Oh no of course not, we headed directly to Ruth's Chris.  \n\nRuth's Chris Steak House sits directly at the base of the Calgary Tower; I don't need a view to enjoy what I know to be a very expensive meal.  Entering the restaurant, we were literally giggling, I mean my cousins and I are well beyond our late twenties.  But giggling?  \n\nOf course we started our first course with martinis, whisky and white wine.   Appetizers of shrimp, and salads were soon ordered.  What another round of drinks? Sure! And of course what RC's is known for, top of the line Alberta Grade A beef, I mean this is a steak house.  Be careful though, if you do order one of the many sides, (baked potato, mashed potato etc) just get one because these are big portions and can be an even bigger dent to the pocket book if ordered per person.\n\nThe ambience in this place is dressed for Calgary's elite; a very classy deco interior, with brass and dark wood detailing, staff is formal, friendly and pristine.  Dressed to the tens with the best service this city should offer, we were absolutely delighted.  \n\nSo the ticket price of 3, enjoying drinks, appys and a steak meal at RC's?  Well it's 40 for 50 dollars a steak, so round it off $300 and don't forget the 20% gratuity.  \n\nIn this yelpers opinion, is it worth the hype? If you want to impress a very important business associate perhaps,   but for you're out of town guests or that special steak meal, R.C's is not my personal first choice, I can enjoy a nice meal at the Keg or Cattle Baron for half the price.\n\nNeedless to say my mother never offered her credit card again.
512	Most of my friends in college worked here at some point. If it wasn't for that, I would not go here. I think a lot of people have a dream of opening a coffee shop. People like to think about how chill and cool they would make it. (Think Bela Dubby or shit. Starbucks). But Cafe Ah-Roma looks like a cafeteria. I don't know how they screwed it up, but they did. I never felt like I was hanging out in a cool coffee shop here. It sort of reminded me of B-W's Cyber Cafe.
513	Hands down the best wings and sauce I've ever tasted! I used to order the sauce in plastic tubs.But they bottle the sauce now. YAY!\nCrispy crispy WHOLE WINGS..not that drummet BS. THE WHOLE wing. An order of five with a slice of bread and fries and coleslaw will usually get the job done for me. Others seem to enjoy their ribs and polish boys as well. But I don't eat pork. Also much friendlier service than they used to have. There was a mean old lady who used to be at the register. Never smiled always made me feel like I was disturbing her. But she doesn't run the register anymore.\n\nThis place is primarily for take out. Although they DO have one or two small tables I rarely see anyone sit at them and eat.\n\nMy one complaint is that they are SLOW as molasses with anything but a small order of food. I go there whenever I'm home to visit my folks in Ohio. Took an out of town friend here once. Not a big wing fan..that is until he got ahold of a few of these Kim's Wings with sauce!! Boy tried to eat ALL MY WINGS!! I had to pimp-slap him to protect my dinner! The boy is now a Kim's Wings addict!\n\nbtw- These wings are of the sweet and tangy variety. Not spicy at all. Just fyi for the buffalo enthusiasts. If you're looking for that this may not be your place. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and head over to Kim's and treat your tongue to an orgasm of flavor! YES!!
514	Now that I live in a proper city, I no longer eat at places like Chili's. But that doesn't mean I don't still have a bit of fondness in my heart for the big C. \n\nBesides how can you beat the chicken ranch sandwich (crispy breaded chicken breast w\/tangy wing sauce, cool Ranch dressing, lettuce & tomato) served with a side of homestyle fries?
515	Such a great office! The doctor and staff were all so friendly and didn't mind answering my many questions. They excepted my insurance and offered me an in-house finance plan with no interest! I strongly recommend this office for anyone looking for a great dentist scottsdale!
516	First of all, let me say the customer service was great, that's what pushed it from 3 stars to 4. I felt like me, Wayne and the other guy (whos name I forget but seemed like a boss?) clicked just fine.\n\nThe wait was a bit long, maybe 20 minutes, but thats what real fresh food takes. Also, they asked if I like my wings more crisp, and yes I do, so that adds time. \n\nHad catfish, perfectly cooked, tartar and slaw was good, not outstanding.\nChicken strips were as good as anywhere, easily as good as raising canes or better. Spicy dipping sauce, and what I think was also a spicy ranch? Decent.\n\nAnd a family order of fries and wings. Fries were nice and plump, very good. They get a bit soggy in the styrofoam so you may want to consider serving them in another way.\n\nThe chicken wings, 10 honey BBQ, yum and 20 scorching. I told these guys you can't make it too hot for me, and they apparently took that as a personal challenge, LOL. Them bas**rds were HOT! By the time I ate them all I was scorching. \n\nActually it was 19 wings as one of them was a bit off, missing most of it's meet. They graciously noticed this and offered me a free Kool-Aid to make up for it (and to eat the offending wing) The Kool-Aid is sweet and yummy. The wings, even before saucing are well seasoned with a bit of cajun rub.\n\n40 plus dollars before I left, not exactly cheap, but very very yummy!
517	Very easy to make an appointment over Yelp, and I love my balayage from Kathy!\nThanks Snapdragon, I'll be back!
518	I went in for lunch on a whim... my car was being worked on next door. They had great lunch specials and very reasonable! I had a slice with their homemade sausage. The pizza had a nice crispy crust, not too thin or thick. I sat on the patio with a great slice of pizza and a very cold beer and enjoy talking with the owner! She was wonderful and I could tell the care and pride she showed in her recipes and her restaurant showed in the pizza and service!
519	This was our first time visiting North and South Seafood and Smokehouse at the recommendation of a coworker.  We went on a Friday night, so they were busy.  We decided to sit at the small bar while we waited for our table.  We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer. They had a strong fishy odor when they arrived but they were very good with a hint of spiciness.  Only two small crab cakes arrived but just enough to hold off our hunger before dinner.  We had to wait approximately 40 minutes before we were seated.  My husband ordered the all you can eat haddock and I ordered the regular haddock dinner.  You have a choice of two sides.  My husband ordered the baked beans and seasonal vegetables (zucchini, broccoli and one piece of red pepper).  I ordered the seasonal vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.  The garlic red mashed potatoes were a bit pasty but decent but in my opinion were over mashed.  The vegetables were done perfectly, with just a slight bit of crispiness.  The fish was good, hearty, crispy and non-greasy.  I had three decent size pieces of cod on my plate as well as my husband.  However, they brought out an additional plate of cod when they served us for my husband's all you can eat.  In our opinion, they should wait to bring out more cod, as it sits there and gets cold before you can even start eating it.  The place is very noisy as there is a very high ceiling, so it was hard to hear each other.  The ambience was mediocre because of this.  All in all, it was a decent Friday night fish fry.
520	I remember eating here with a friend several years ago, and discovered it again while looking for an Indian buffet in my work area. Just know that it's BEHIND the Audio Express, so that's your landmark to find it. Just got in from the lunch buffet ($9.95 +tax, water only).\nAbsolutely scrumptious! It's one of those things like \"if exotic love had a flavor.\"\nI tried a little of everything, like I always do with buffets, and everything was nice and I repeated my sampling with the next plate. Service was spot on, and the atmosphere was quiet and calm. Perhaps it's more bustling around noon, but I arrived a little after 1pm. I was sufficiently full after 2 plates, and I don't think I'll need dinner except a beer. So glad to find this place again, I could eat at my own pace yet be back at work within the hour. \n\nINSIDE SKINNY: Chutneys! Good with your naan. \nAlso there's a mango yogurt drink (lassi) on ice if you like that.\nI didn't try it because I don't like yogurt.
521	Failed my emissions test due to a fuse that was out. Went onto Yelp to find the closest auto shop open on a Saturday. Right next door to the emissions center was Joe's! They were able to get me in an out within an hour, with a passed emissions test. Thanks Joe!
522	I purchased an expensive engagement ring from Jared and it has been a nightmare ever since. My fiancé received a 'temporary' ring the day that was too big for her, but the salesman and store manager assured that we would be contacted as soon as the actual custom fitted ring arrived at the store. A month passed by (how long they claimed it would take) and there was still no word about the actual ring. I decided to stop in the store and see what the problem was. An associate greeted me with a smile and asked me what I am looking to purchase. As soon as I politely asked her about a ring I was supposed to receive that never arrived, she changed her attitude\/tone completely and treated me like dirt. After she looked at her computer for 5 minutes, she told me that the ring I bought could not be made any smaller and that the order had been rejected 2 weeks prior. No one from Jared ever contacted me about it. After that, the store manager told me that there are no exceptions for their return policy. So, now my fiancé has a beautiful ring that falls off of her finger. I have attempted multiple times to make this right by contacting customer service, but have had no luck at all. However, a payment was one day late and their credit company called me 5 times throughout that day from different numbers. They only care about getting their money.\n\nBottom line - Their employees could care less about their customers after a purchase is made. I will be going to a competitor jeweler to make future purchases.
523	Just as fabulous as the Miami location!! We were seated immediately for our reservation. \nThe little red rooster cocktail was delicious and strong! \nOur waitress was very sweet and professional, and the service overall here was right on par with the Miami location. \nWe got the old school chicken, waffles and watermelon to share and it was fantastic! The mac and cheese was actually better at this location than Miami. The fried green tomato blt was a great way to start the meal, and the deviled eggs and biscuits were incredible! I'm not sure what jam comes with the biscuits, but it is delicious. Thanks for another wonderful evening, Yardbird!! :)
524	I love RED DOOR SPA.  It is a MUST trip at least 2x a year.  But this time I went to a different location to met up with my cousin.  We both had the milk and sugar body scrub, plus the 60 mins massage.  Love the location (upstairs).  Love the look of the place.  But the only thing missing was the bigger relaxation area and changing area.  Maybe because I am spoiled by the Wigwam location, but I like to lounge around a bit before and after my services.  Or course, the services is always top notch!!!
525	This is the MOST disappointing show I've seen on the strip thus far.  \n\nUnderstand that I am not an EJ fan, but my wishful thinking was that the show would serve as entertainment value.  \n\nIf we are paying over $250\/tix I expect more of a performance:\n\nNOT blow up dolls.\nNOT flashing neon signs.\nNOT streaming video depicting your song.\nNOT celebrities on video depicting your song.\nNOT just a band and a piano.\n\nI WANT action, dancers, I want my money's worth, I want, I WANT!!! \n\nI WANT a SHOW not a CONCERT w\/streaming VIDEO.  \n\nYEAH I'm a high maintenance brat.\n\nBTW, for the children of the 80s, there was no LION KING.  Boo!!!
526	Very nice folks work here. Especially Mindy and Craig. Great to service our party on a regular basis. They are really great staff because our tab can get confusing and they handle it well. They have daily specials on the menu which are good. The Rueben is good too. Fun little place for watching sports, karaoke, or shooting a game of pool.
527	Really outstanding authentic Korean food here. Even the rice water hit the spot and I'm not usually a rice water fan. \n\nWe ate bulgogi, kimchee chigae (soup which wasn't on the menu that they made special) and some spicy pork-gogi dish. Everything was delicious and the portions were pretty decent. \n\nMy only possible negative critique is that it was extremely dark at the table. The tables themselves are cool and lit up but it's hard to see your food coming from your plate to your mouth...like I couldn't tell if I had pork or kimchee on my spoon until it was up to my face...that dark...but if they are going for a club vibe, they nailed it and if we were there to drink it probably would have been fine.\n\nThe friendly service was spot on and the food was better than expected. I'll definitely come back and try something new sometime.\n\n\"Yay, I'm a fan\"
528	Easily the worst restaurant service I've experienced combined with incorrect orders and mediocre food.  Feels like any other option would be better.
529	I had studied the menus online and had pretty much decided to go with the seasonal tasting menu.  However, when ordering, my server talked me out of the seasonal menu in favor of the same priced Signature tasting menu.  On his recommendation, that's what I ordered.\n\nI was first brought a choice of rolls and some salted, softened butter--the way butter should be served unless requested otherwise.\n\nThe first course was a domestic caviar parfait with five levels with a shallot, potato pancake on the bottom and topped with the caviar as well as having a layer of smoked salmon.  A very good beginning.\n\nThe second course was a tartare of ahi tuna with Asian pear, pine nuts, and a quail egg mixed together at the table to mix the tuna with the other components.  This was bland.  There was no salt on the table.  The dish could have used some.  This was a bit of a letdown.\n\nThird course was miso-glazed Chilean sea bass with shellfish dumplings.  The sea bass was excellent.  It was cooked perfectly and the miso broth was very good.  The two dumplings were OK.\n\nThe fourth course was Mina's famed lobster pot pie.  My server explained how this affected his career and that this was his signature dish.  The top of the pot pie is sliced around the edge and then this cap is removed to reveal the lobster stew inside.  There were chunks of lobster and vegetables such as celery, potato, and carrot.  The dish is a winner.\n\nNext up was the American wagyu beef, three slices of tender beef with a piece of Hudson Valley foie gras and a pinot noir reduction.  There was also a small amount of mashed potatoes and a slice of mushroom.  The beef was good but steak loses something for me when it's sliced like this even though it was rare.  The mashed potatoes were so sparse they could have been left from the plate and not missed.\n\nFinishing the meal was an assortment of sweets for dessert.  The was a chocolate whiskey cake, cocoa nib ice cream, some candied hazelnuts and salted caramel as well as Mina's famous root beer float which had a chocolate straw embedded in sassafras ice cream.  There was also a warm chocolate chip cookie.\n\nService was excellent.  My server, Alejandro, was a pleasant and polite.  His explanation of the dishes was interesting and his recommendation of the Signature tasting menu was great!  \n\nI was surprised for a tasting menu that there was no amuse-bouche nor any mignardises at the end.  It's not necessary, but you sort of expect it with a tasting menu at a restaurant with this high reputation.\n\nAnother time, I'd order the lobster pot pie as the main course and get the whole lobster.  That would be quite the meal!
530	I remember when this place opened.\n\nI got the whole rundown from the franchise owner.\n\nIt's a Canadian operation that deliverers on healthy options in a sandwich\/wrap shop.\n\nI have a fun story about this particular location though.  \n\nI came in for lunch and was about to order when the staff took one look at me and all the mexicans ran out the back door.  The owner was obviously not working the store anymore.  \n\nThe manager-guy was like \"OH HI THERE!  HO HO HO!  PRETTY FUNNY, EH?\"\n\nHe was freaking out pretty hard.\n\nI realized that I was wearing a polo shirt that read \"INS.\"  Now it didn't stand for immigration, but the people working the grill didn't stick around to find out what I was about.\n\nThe manager bribed me with cookies for my silence... until now!\n\nThe food was better when a MBA was cooking.  Now it's just a bunch of dudes who slop stuff into a pita instead of a burger bun.\n\nIt's pretty hard to screw up falafel though, so give that a try if you want some veggie options.
531	The nail tech did a good job on my pedi but the water was too hot , there isn't a lot of nail polish choices
532	Fushimi is a hidden gem. Their sushi, sashimi,rolls are among the best as far as all you can eat is concerned. Their cooked food is great as well. Service is also good. Dinner is 20.99. \n\nAbout the food \n\nSpecial mention is that this is the only place I been to that serves eel sashimi.  Truffle white tuna is a must try. Mutton Kebab is tasty and tender. Fushimi signature roll is really good. Tempura and teppanyaki is decent. \n\nPlace \nThe place is a little dark and old hence the 4 stars but clean. \n\nConclusion \neat here, you won't regret it. It's worth it.
533	This restaurant is one example of why I can't trust Yelp very much anymore.\n\nIf I were to rate this cafe, I'd give it 4.5. And like most users, that .5 stars is merely because they market themselves as dim sum, but does not have the carts to give you the \"full dim sum experience.\" But you know what? Who cares if they don't have a bunch of old, middle-aged, rude Chinese women pushing your food around?\n\nHere's the deal Yelpers, it blows my mind that most of the reviews take out so many stars or give this place a bad review because of the lack of carts. Let me inform you guys that this place serves the best dim sum food in all of Vegas (bold statement, but true.) The reason why this restaurant does not cart their food around for you is because they know they aren't located in Chinatown with millions of customers everyday, but they want to preserve the quality of their food, which is why they cook their food fresh for you. I can guarantee you that even the other great dim sum places in Vegas (Cathay House, Chang's) will sometimes microwave your food, or heat up leftovers for you to eat. \n\nOh and \"how's the service?\" You might be asking. It is incredible. It may be because I came for a late lunch, but we had the most excellent service ever at any dim sum. Waited a reasonable amount of time to be seated, then had kind service through my whole meal. There are simple key things that waiters and waitresses should do (say \"May I...Please... Thank You...\") I mean very basic things that most restaurants don't accomplish, but it takes you a long way. The waitress was even kind enough to hold the door open on my way out. I won't say to expect these kinds of things at peak hours, but they definitely do put a lot of care into their customers.\n\nTL;DR don't come here if you are looking for cart pushers, come if you want some quality food.
534	I cant believe I haven't done a review for Sugar Factory.  I've been here a couple times and always had a good experience.  Major points for being open 24 hours a day!!!  This is a great place to stop and soak up all the alcohol after a long night of drinking.  They have a wonderful breakfast as well.  I would NOT suggest planning to drink there, one their drinks are crazy over priced and 2 they are wayyyyyy tooo sweet.  More than one of these will give you a headache!  I've ordered one of their 38$ cauldron drinks to split with a table, the idea is fun and they are great to look at , again too sweet though, I am glad we split it between a bunch of us.  The mac n cheese bites appetizer is delicious, one of my favorite items.  The line gets long around lunch and dinner, make a reservation if you can.  This is a great place to go with a large group, they are super accommodating, especially if you have reservations.  The candy store next to the restaurant is a lot of fun too!
535	You don't come for the food. A simple but fair statement, Onoir is a dining experience and definitely worth a try. I feel like it is all well done with the choice of food made before with a simple but broad menu featuring surprise options for each course. \nI have been twice as its close to my home and a great option to bring visitors too. The first visit was so disconcerting I had to take a toilet break to see something - freaked ha. You just don't adapt to it.\nOur food experiences were good but to elaborate on my opening comment it is never going to be about the food. Logic would dicate an experience orientated restaurant like this needs to keep it simple and appeal to a broad range. I read one reviewer complain about having to eat with their hands. . . You are provided with a knife and fork so you don't \"have\" to do anything. But yes I tucked in with my hands to make sure I got every last bite and worth giving a try :)
536	i had absolutely no idea what to expect when we arrived at this show....\ni was even hesitant that I could make it through 90 minutes of 4 guys singing cover tunes...really worried it would be like a \"cruise ship show\"...\n\nwell....i was so wrong! \n\nmy girls and i spent the entire show on our feet...dancing and singing along to each and every song! We laughed so hard! we swooned...\n\nwow these boys put on quite a show...\n\ndo i have a suggestion for improvement...well yes I do...\nmaybe have these hunky men take a little off .. =) i'm sure all the ladies would agree.\n\nsee this show!\ndo it!
537	Dude! That service was freaking awesome. They said it would take an hour and they were done in less than that. Thank you Gary. You guys are the bomb.
538	Been coming to this restaurant for well over 10 years\n\nThe lady already knows I always ask for fish sauce and brings it without even asking, that's good customer service\n\nBeen greeted and remembered as well as amazing food always makes me go back when the urge for the 7 beef dish arises\n\nThis is the ONLY place to have 7 beef dish in Toronto, any other restaurant just sucks for it
539	Fresh pitas made in their place. Large portions and tasty.  The provided veggies were fresh and crisp as well.
540	Got a couple of buddies over there that I shoot the sh*t with from time to time, other than that the place is super overpriced, and the staff seems to have that \"I can't believe you just bothered me\" look on their face when you need their assistance.  They did have a bikini carwash there on Saturday, if they only would have had non tattood ghetto looking broads there I would have bumped it to 3 stars lol.
541	Woodlands always comes through for vegetarian Indian.  Even for the biggest lover of meat , vegetarian Indian is the best.  It is so good and spicy you don't even miss your favorite meat products.  If you haven't tried Indian food, I like to order a lot and eat family style.  So if it is a first visit bring a couple of people with you, so you can order more food. \n\nThe menu is daunting at first glance, if you aren't familiar with Indian food, some of my favorites are the okra and tomatoes, chickpeas in tomato sauce, cheese in tomato sauce, eggplant - there are always plenty of lentil dishes.  Once when you get the Indian words down, you find your favorites fast.  Don't forget to order bread.  It is the most important part for dipping!  If you like it spicy- remember to tell them, because it is so much better spicy.  I might suggest ordering everything medium and one dish spicy, so then you can see what your comfort level is.  \n\nWoodlands is not much to look at - this restaurant is begging for a makeover, it could be so cute, but it is so broke down.  In fact, I prefer  take away rather than dining in.  If you judge restaurants by their restrooms, don't even go in.  \n\nWoodlands has awesome food.
542	Thank you Eric for the great deal on our Nature's Sleep Gel infused Sapphire memory foam bed and bedframe. We love it!\nWe originally came in to mess around on the vibration machine on display. That turned into wanting to buy sheets and bamboo pillows, which then had us laying on the Nature's Sleep beds that were so comfortable.\nI am a skeptic by nature and not easily swayed or buy on impulse, especially when it comes to large items like this. We went and did our homework to compare other nearby memory foam mattresses and dealers. We spent the remainder of the weekend doing this. Holy Sheets had the best price on the mattress we wanted and the best incentives, so we went back to Eric.\nWe were even more thrilled to be able to get a great bedframe (since we upgraded from a Queen to a King sized bed) at a killer deal that would have costs hundreds more from other furniture dealers.\nI don't know which mattress others have purchased, but the one we got is the most comfortable and coolest feeling mattress I've ever slept on. The model we got is a medium firmness and felt just like the one in the store. The sheets are also smooth and cool to the touch. The bamboo pillows took some getting used to as they start out firm, but they recommend you toss them in the dryer for a little bit to soften them up and help dissipate the foam smell.\nBe aware that you can't sleep on your mattress for 24 hours to allow it to uncompress from its rolled up delivery state. They store it in the warehouse this way. So hopefully you have a spare guest room to sleep in for the night like we did. There is a strong foam smell the first couple days but it fades. The better the quality of mattress you get, the less of a foam smell and of course the less comfortable...so don't shortchange yourself.\nWe absolutely love our Sapphire Gel infused memory foam bed and the bedframe we got from Eric. He was a pleasure to work with, hooked us up on sheets and even called us the following days to make sure delivery went well and we were happy with our bed. Now that's great customer service.
543	After deciding I wanted to see a Psychic, I went online to search for places  somewhat close to where I live. I found Crystal Vision on the yelp site and decided that this would be the place I would try out. I am glad I decided this. I called and made an appointment to ensure a spot and headed over. When I arrived, I was a bit nervous but mostly excited. The location is great and easy to find (with lots of bike parking for those of us who bike everywhere!)\nThe decor is soothing and makes for a relaxed atmosphere, not intimidating or anything. Crystal is very warm and welcoming, and gave me a brief of what Chakras were so I would understand when she explained what she saw from me.\nWithout going into the details of my reading, I will tell you I am very happy I made the decision to see her, she not only explained things to me that no one else would ever know, but she helped me to understand and overcome certain things in my life I was struggling with. If you want to go for a fun reading then she is the one to go to, but if you are in need of more, she is absolutely the person I would recommend.
544	Great food, nice ambiance, service was very decent too. I hear complaints about line ups but we escaped that mess. The food is hakka Chinese. So if you are craving fried, heavily sauced, spicy hot Indo\/Chinese. This is your spot. They have their staple dishes but don't be scared to try some of the other ones. We tried a fish it was light compared to the other dishes and tasted great. Wish they would open a branch in Hamilton
545	They showed up sooner than anticipated (called ahead with an opening) and fixed my AC for less than anticipated. Professionals and only did what was required. Happily recommend them to anyone suffering from a broken AC.
546	Needed a tire replaced late on Sunday (today). Was impressed with the team's customer service enough to post this review. What stood out to me is that the team looked like they really enjoyed their work and working together. I always appreciate good customer service when I come across it.
547	I work right around the corner, and these guys are one of my first go-to's when I don't have lunch packed.  I'm hopelessly addicted to the turkey grill sandwich, and have to force myself to get something else now and then.  The salads were about the only thing I've had that weren't very interesting.\n\nIt may be beach-style food, but there is nothing lightweight or bikini-body-ready about the food (which is what makes it so tasty)!  The turkey grill is well-buttered grilled toast, mayo, cheese, avocado, bacon, and turkey, with fries on the side. Yum!\n\nThey also have the added advantage of delivery service, and they know our office well.  So when I am hopelessly chained to my cubicle, I can still get my sandwich and a smoothie to thoroughly stuff myself for the afternoon.  Delivery can run slow sometimes, but I've never had any problems with it eventually getting here and being fresh.
548	Why am I eating at Kowloon Dim Sum Restaurant out of all these restaurants lining along Baldwin Street?\n\nCan I tell you I was forced? But really no one can be forced!! I went in because I was following my Yelp eating Buddies.... and when it was 3 against 1......... \n\nI really don't want to eat dim sum at 9 PM at a strange place so ended up we ordered\n\nLobster in Black Bean and Garlic Sauce ($13.99)\nOyster with Green Onion and Ginger ($11.99)\nVegetables with garlic ($11.99)\n\nAll was Meh!! And heavy on MSG, I was thirsty for the whole night!\n\nOysters were not too fresh and were overcooked........\n\nStaffs are friendly and speaks good English so non Chinese speaking would feel right at home!!\n\nI think I would not be coming back to Kowloon again............ oh please Yelp eating Buddies, can we go somewhere else?!!
549	Much like my suburban yelp sista - Jennifer K, I headed into Brampton downtown seeking an indie-ish coffee shop, you know the type that boasts great music, a rustic design motif and an array of nerdy coffee options only surpassed by the number of posters advertising local art shows and open mic nights.... alas, that was not to be, all I could find was this starbucks\n\nBut I have to give it some cred, it did check at least a couple of my coffee shop boxes during my brief stay. The staff and coffee performed at the usual starbucks level, there  was a pretty eclectic\/cool looking crowd both working here and as customers, the type of folks who I know are just waiting for that hipster coffee shop in the sky to put down roots.\n\nThe winning feature of this spot was in the architecture of the building. As I spoke to staff, they informed me that all the amazing structural elements of the building (brick work, posts, indoor lamp poles, aged wooden floor - were in fact part of the original part of the building - kutos for maintaining some cool Brampton history. \n\nDraw back, this location is drafty as all hell, I actually had to leave because my feet were so col I had to seek refuge in my car (which was parked for 2 hours already out doors). Cool potential for outdoor patio space as this location sits on the downtown brampton central square.\n\nWorth checking out for sure!
550	This has become one of my favorite downtown restaurants. It is under new ownership (run by the man who owns Goodwich) with a fantastic new menu. I only wish he had rebranded the restaurant because the name is tainted by its first iteration. \n\nThe pizzas are tasty and unique, buffalo wings are flavorful and juicy, and the other menu items that I have tried (Brussels sprouts and gnocchi) were great. The beer selection is good enough for the beer snobby hipster crowd as well.
551	Cute little place! If you want a quick and cheap bite on Crescent then this is the place. They have good portions, fun drinks, nice vibes. Don't go if you want some kind of culinary experience, its more of a chill type of place. Bring your friends, grab a few of their drinks, and hang!
552	My first experience of this restaurant was not as bad as some reviews I saw, perhaps because it's a weekday early evening. The restaurant was not very loud or crowded. The food was not top class but for 11.99 all you can eat dinner you really can't ask much more. They did have a wide range of food choices and the atmosphere was not bad for its price tag. The waiter was nice. While he's a bit slow, I saw him clean tables very carefully so I know cleanness is something they care. Some people may hate it that they use plastic bowls and plates but I don't have a problem with that. The only thing you must beware is the deserts (many of them are not good). Overall speaking I'm satisfied with this place. You can get a full belly without spending a lot of money.
553	We've got a burgeoning burger corridor here.  What 15th Century Florence was to the Renaissance is what the Biltmore area has become for the next generation gourmet burger.  \n\nI'm typically not too hot on most Sam Fox restaurants but this is one of the exceptions.  Sure it has the style and flair of its other restaurants.  But it also has a menu that matches the concept.  The burgers are executed flawlessly and they are just unique enough to distinguish them from their Biltmore neighbors.  The shakes were as decadent as weekday matinee, not at all necessary but very tasty.   The fries were great although we thought that the yogurt sauce pairing with the sweet potato fries was a little off.\n\nTop off the experience with some incredible service by our waiter who had the same look and enthusiasm as the indefatigable Steve O and you've got a memorable experience.  The burger gauntlet has been laid and all worthy participants should report to the Biltmore.
554	Great food and beer! Fantastic service!
555	Love this yogurt land! Fun place to go with family friends. Great Variety and selection. My only wish was that they switched up the flavors more often! My fav (Oreo peanut butter) has only been a choice twice when I've been there! But over all love the environment and staff.
556	My dog has been going to Camp Bow Wow Westlake to play and socialize with other dogs, since it first opened. Now she may not know what month or year it is, but let me tell you my dog knows when it is Tuesday and Thursday, her favorite days of the week since she gets to go to camp! I love this place because they have known my dog's name since the day we walked through the doors and learned her personality very quickly! I love everything, especially the staff! Thank you very much for taking great care of my baby!
557	Super Delish!! \n\nVery impressed with the level of service, the quality of food... Ambiance. All great. Nice bar, Happy Hour deals thru whole restaurant. We will absolutely be returning here again. Yummy!!!
558	I kind of forget about Ferrucci's since it's tucked away back off I-77 exit 28 in the Shops on the Green complex.  But when I remember them, I'm always glad I did.  \n\nThat goes for pretty much everything they offer.  Their selections of meats, cheeses, prepared Italian dishes, salads, etc. is first rate.  What's also good is their sandwich menu.  A nice selection made with fresh ingredients and served on at least serviceable bread.  Making my stomach growl just thinking about it but alas, they are closed on Sunday.  They also offer a good selection of Italian specialty canned, jarred items.\n\nI like that you can get prime beef here.  All their meats are pretty pricey by the pound but I've never not been satisfied once I got it home and cooked it up.  A friendly staff though not as outgoing and boisterous as the crew at Derado's.
559	Was obliged to visit stop here for coffee with a friend. To be honest i am kind of glad i did. I ended up ordering a cappuccino which was not bad at all. I cannot comment on the food as we did not eat, but i get the feeling it wouldn't have mattered as ppl come here for one reason. To eat\/drink while watching cats lounge around and walk by you like they own the place. I thought it was a pretty funny concept. The owner seems to work with a lot of animal shelters in the city which is a plus.  I don't mind paying a dollar extra for a coffee to keep a few felines fed. This place seems to get busy quick, worth another visit to try the food.
560	I think this place is kind of typical of a car dealership. They try to rope you in to extended warranties and the like. Then they get you with the service.\n\nI had really bad experiences here with the service department. If you live downtown, I'd highly recommend Cam's Auto Service on King Street East, east of Parliament.
561	Maybe I'm just a little harsh because I'm a Vegas local and I'm use to everything being over-the-top, but seriously now that Aliante Station has been open over a year, I'm really let down. \n\n     When Aliante first opened in October 2008, we were all really excited to have such a one-stop entertainment destionation on this side of town, which is far underdeveloped commercially. Way to many houses, not enough retail, food, etc. We were initially impressed the first few months. Evrything was open, there was always an excess of lanes and registers everywhere, plenty of employees, the Regal Theaters always had a great selection of showtimes, and the rooms were spectacular for an off-Strip hotel. The last time we stayed at the hotel in December 2009, the rooms had gone downhill from our previous stay in February 2009. Lights were out, buttons and knobs were broken, the mini fridge had pieces falling off and was not stocked, and the HD TV sevice was no more. On top of all that, there was only one person at check-in and check out each time, and the were usually preoccupied.\n\n    As for the casino side which we visit more often (or use to), since the opening, Dunkin Dounts has closed, the hours at most the food places have been shortened, the Regal theaters have horrible showtimes now, it is almost always more convient to just make the extra drive to another theater. There are never enough tables open, never more than one cashier window open, and the WORST part is that the often only have THREE floors open in the parking garage out of SIX. HALF of the entire parking garage is closed. Why even build it?!?! I suppose I'm just spoiled living in Las Vegas my whole life and having parking plentiful, but the parking situation was a dealbreaker for me, and I'm one of those people that doesn't mind having to walk a medium distance from car to front door. It is stupid to me when the garage is full, so we are forced to drive the wrong way up the down ramp just to find any space, besides the 60 handicap spaces on level 3. (Level 1 is employee and Valet, and Level 2 is mostly reserved for high level casino card members), so you can see my frustration. Just let us drive up to level 6, no traffic to fight, enjoy a nice view on my way in, and get on with our night.\n\n     In closing, the enitre property is brand new, and most of it really nice, but until they figure out what the word \"service\" means, I'll be taking my buisness to somewhere that is actually prepaired for customers. Unless you enjoy waiting in lines on a Saturday night where only one person is staffed at the movie box office and concessions, and where staff is so thin else where to the point that all you can do is watch from a distance other people having a good time, I would advise you to think twice, take the extra drive, and go elsewhere as well.
562	Wild Wing, did I really? Yeah I did! If you haven't figured it out on your own, it's a wing place. Wings, wings and more... you guessed it, wings! Traditional, boneless or naked, you'll find oodles of flavours. Being the blonde haired, blue eyed yelper I am, I figured it only appropriate my Wild Wing virginity be christened by a pound of Blue Eyed Blonde. Yep, this blue-eyed blonde has an extra pound of Blue Eyed Blonde now in her belly. The chicken wings themselves were a good size. I'm not sure I'd order the same kind again. I wasn't a fan of the wings being smothered completely in blue cheese sauce. I can think of better sauce smotherings for the Blue Eyed Blondes.\n\nThe place itself is alright. It wasn't busy, but the service was good and I enjoyed the wing\/beer special. One pound of any wings and a beer for under $13. Add an extra thirty cents if you'd prefer some yummy WR Velvet Fog that's on tap. Yeah that's right, you can get a coupla local brews on tap :). Yay! \n\nIf you're headed in on a cold night, sit on the west side of the room if there's a table available. You'll avoid the draft from the door. It can get c-c-c-coooooold! Brrrrrr.\n\nI'm not as impressed with the buckets of Molson, Corona and Coors to throw your chicken wings into, or the big MCC logos all over the walls, and hearing that Wild Wing also has its own Wild Wing girls isn't exactly something to bring me through the door again (although maybe it's your thing!). \n\nOverall, it's an alright spot. It's cool we've got a joint that's all about wings.. it'd be cooler if it were something local that you couldn't find anywhere else, but hey, we've gotta start somewhere, right?
563	The staff is helpful and very courteous. Its a little outdated inside, but clean.  My favorite dish is the Eggplant, and is a specialty dish. This place hits the spot better then fast food chinese spots. Prices are reasonable, and they can accomodate large groups easily.  I like many of the dishes, but I am not convinved enough to say this is the best chinese food in the West Valley.
564	My Honda van broke down while I was in  Vegas from LA, I found Hondatronics on Yelp, James was super helpful, honest answers, excellent recommendations. These guys will take care of  your Honda\/Acura.
565	My buddy and I went to Grimaldis for lunch and then decided to stop by here for a drink.  We got there around noon and there were only a few people in the joint. The place is pretty freaking big.  Lots of space to roam and mingle.  We sat at the bar and hung out for a bit.  We had a really friendly and easy going (both in personality AND on the eyes) bartender that we chatted up.  She told us that later on that night, it was \"Ladies Night\" and that drinks were 50 cents for ladies and $1.00 for guys during certain hours.  Not bad.  We decided to come back later that night to check it out.  Here is how that went down..............\n\n10:00pm-  We arrived and were semi patted down and paid our $5.00 cover charge.  They slap a wristband on you and then we grabbed a table.  Tons of people were here.  Definitely a younger (college) crowd.  I felt old and kept reminding myself that I was probably a sophomore in high school when most of these spring chickens were born.  Scary thought, I know!  We hung out for a bit and watched some people dance.  About every 20 minutes, the DJ would play some certain song and people would line up and bust out their moves in a group line dance type deal.  They had one song they played (Didn't know the name of it..sorry) where people are just kicking their feet and doing the slide or whatever it was called.  All of a sudden, there is one point in the song where the beat just dropped...PANDAFUCKINGMODIUM!  People started dancing faster and kicking their legs higher and spinning as fast as a tornado etc.  It was NUTS!  My buddy compared it to the Harlem Shake.  Once that beat dropped.......all hell broke loose!  It was definitely a sight to see.  We chilled for about an hour and then decided to bail.\n\nNot sure on why this place gets a 2 star average.  Every person we encountered there was friendly and service was excellent both time frames we went.  I would definitely come back and I think my wife and her girlfriends would enjoy this place too.
566	I had a major pho craving after a long day of work in the hot Arizona sun. Yeah, even though it was 95 degrees, eating a hot bowl of pho just sounded so satisfying.\n\nWe walked over here from our hotel as we didn't feel like taking a Lyft. It's a small restaurant with a bar and an outside patio. Since it was hot AF, we took a corner spot inside and proceeded to order. The bartender took our order and he was way friendlier than the other guy who came and brought us our utensils. \n\nWe ordered shrimp spring rolls, pho tai, garlic noodles and pork banh mi. \n\nShrimp spring rolls - tiny order for $5.75. It comes with ONE roll cut into two pieces. Pass on this.\n\nPho tai - I got a large for around $15 and on a scale of 1-5, it comes in around a 2.75. The broth had no flavor and the beef was quite chewy. \n\nGarlic noodles- these were pretty good, and I would have eaten more had I not ordered the big bowl of pho.\n\nPork banh mi- my colleague said he liked it and it was huge. The salad that came was it was disappointing as it was basically the lettuce in the sandwich. \n\nAll of this cost $45 and some change. It's definitely on the pricey side, but if you're in town and want pho, it's not a terrible place.
567	Jim from JPG Home Security came by today and inspected our house for a new security alarm.  He was very knowledgeable and straight forward on what types of alarms and sensors our home needed to protect our family.  Knowing he was previously in law enforcement it was neat to get an \"inside view\" of how criminals work and how we can combat their tactics. \n\nWe had previously been setup with ADT but it was setup wrong and wasn't completely keeping us safe.  Thankfully, Jim got us all setup correctly and we are glad we used him.  We even were able to get a new keypad that works with our cell phone, something we really liked.\n\nBeing a business owner myself, I can really tell when an owner is ethical and trustworthy and Jim and his company definitely fit that description.  I'm going to recommend him to any of our friends or family who are interested in home protection or alarm systems.
568	I have been going to these guys for the past few years for both my cars. They know their stuff and I have never had any problems with them or their service. Much better than Chrysler dealership both price wise and the way they treat their customers. Howard is great, so is Andrew.
569	Was supposed to have a technician between 11am and 2pm.  Drove from Chandler to Payson to be ready.  Called around noon and was told the tech would be late due to an install elsewhere.  No problem. Called again around 3 and was told the tech would be a few more hours but they had my number and would call when on the way.  It's after 8pm.  No call. No nothing.  Very unprofessional.  And even after I was totally understanding of them being late.  No excuse for a lack of common courtesy and decency.
570	I just want to send a huge THANK YOU to the people at Carey Moving of Charlotte. \n\nA special shout out to my girl, Joannie Dratch.\n\nI had just had a horrible experience with another moving company who left 1\/4 of my stuff behind. I had already moved to Charlotte and had very little I could do. Joannie was unbelievably nice and understanding and helped me through the whole process.\n\nThe charges were more than fair and everything was done exactly when and as they said.\n\nThanks again for making a traumatic experience much easier on me.
571	I asked why was he charging me $300 extra on his estimate, and this is the answer I got from Scott Gleske\n  \"The way things are going with you and I we are not ever going to be on the same wave length and we will drive each other crazy.  Therefore, I am taking your job off the schedule which will allow you to find a company you can feel more comfortable with.\"
572	My sweetie and I were exhausted from a long move to Ft Hills and wanted a dark quick place to grab a burger and maybe a game on tv.  A friend suggested this place so we gave it a try.  Very dark windows as we walked thru the door hid the minimalist bar and eating area. Simply done, greeted by the hippie dippie weather man (cool guy) and quickly took our drink order, served them and then dinner orderl The tunes were jukebox and then a two man gutair group set up and began performing.  Great music, so so vocals..but an A+ for effort.  My steak panini was generous and done the way I wanted, the fries were a bit limp,  Sweetie's cheeseburger must have been tasty because he ate it very quickly, We laughed, we sang, we had fun!
573	Beer lovers and wine coniseur's can unite under one roof and enjoy the chill beats, great food and ambience in the Coronado neighborhood in Phoenix! My favorite dish is the cash money with a side of green chile mac & cheese and this is the only place I can hear Felt, Mos, Talib and all the other greats while enjoying some primo grub and drinks! My only suggestion is to bring back the chipotle chocolate cheesecake!
574	Delicious. \n\nSeriously.\n\nI went there with two friends...and we are three very talkative ladies. When our food came there was nothing but small noises of joy coming from us. Well, me mostly. The other ladies were better able to keep their foodgasms under control.\n\nI had the french toast: Italian bread dipped in batter and then pressed in the waffle iron. There was a delicious marscapone creme smear on my plate that was so good that I wanted to rub it all over my face and live like that forever. The maple syrup was a perfect compliment. It was seriously so. effin. good.\n\nMy friends were just as pleased with their meals. One got the monte cristo which she said was the best she'd ever had, and the other got...I think it was the Magic? Don't quote me on that, but I think that's what she got, and she said it was awesome.\n\nCoffee was really good. My friend got tea and it seemed as though there was a nice selection. \n\nService was super friendly and prompt. We got there at 11 and the place was almost empty, but there was a wait by the time we left.\n\nI am going back sooner rather than later and next time will try one of their savory options!
575	This store is really well-organized. I've never had any problems finding what i'm looking for. I also recently bought a bouquet of flowers that lasted an unusually long time. They have a nice selection of economical flowers and house plants.\n\nMaybe I just always hit at the busiest times, but this location is always p-a-c-k-e-d. For me, this review is not my usual 4\/5 stars only because the produce seems to be hit-or-miss. Of course, whenever I need it, its just so-so. They also have a lot of old carts that make unbearable squeaking noises, so be sure to try several before you commit to one. I have embarrassingly learned this the hard way before. Sorry if you've had to listen to my crazy squeaky Transformer sounding cart come down the aisles.\n\nOtherwise, this store is fine for everything else I need! They also have a huge bakery, and the gals are always helpful. There's also a Stephen Curry prankster who routinely changes \"Curry Powder\" to \"Lebron Powder\" in the spices aisle, so I would award an extra 1\/2 star just for having a great sense of humor ;)
576	I had high hopes for this place, but it feel short of my expectations.  Parking was simple. You can park on the street or there is close garage parking. There is a $5 cover and they have an ATM right outside.  There is also a pat down by security before you get in, which I have mixed feelings about. It was a relatively younger crowd there than I am use to at a retro bar. And I knew I was in trouble when I saw the backpack kid dance not once but twice. They have a small arcade where you can pay to play some games and they have TVs all over the bar that are playing 80s\/90s music videos and tv shows.\n\nThe downstairs dance floor was very hot. They need to get some ventilation down there. The speakers system also needs some work. The speakers were cutting in and out and were very loud. They had a few fans pushing the hot air around but there were not doing too much.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and the music was good. So, this bar was just \"ok\" for me and I will probably hit up another spot if I go out while I am in town again.
577	I always come to this place when I'm in Vegas. Mostly for breakfast...their omelets are ridiculously huge and delicious. A must-have is the bagel with cream cheese and jam. The service is good...thumbs up to my waitress Destiny, great service.
578	Great burgers and locally sourced meat. Pretty good beer selection too. Do yourself a favor and order the Jimmy Carter burger.
579	Eek!  This was a second time in just a few weeks I've had a \"Meh, I've had much better experience!\"  What has happened to Cornish Pasty???  So I felt compelled to write a review about my experiences so that others would know this Cornish Pasty is in need of some management\/owner love\/help or something.... \n\nService~ yikes! It was turrible, to quote Charles Barkley.  Both visits were the same experience but with different servers.  The servers here seem more interested in talking with each other rather than serving their customers.  On both visits we had to remind our server multiple times to refill our drinks and bring us condiments.  Probably the biggest disappointment is when we complained about our food.  They both were very disinterested in turning our poor dining experience into a positive one.  When we asked to speak to someone in charge in our 2nd turrible visit the waitress disappeared!  I kid you not!  She never came back and when we asked the bartender about her she stated that she went on a break....\n\nFood~ prior visits we've had a pretty good experience trying the different pasty's however lately their food has not been up to par!  The pasty's are very dry lately for some reason and they lack flavor.  This last visit we had the bangers and mash, chicken and the traditional beef and potatoes.  We also had a couple of side of fries and some salads.  The salads and fries were the best parts of our dining experience again unfortunately.  The banger and mash was ok.  It had a good balance of bangers to mash but had too much onions.  Since when did onions become a major star in this pasty?  The chicken pasty was not filled completely and was very dry.  The waitress suggested the red wine sauce to help?? WTH?  NO THE RED WINE SAUCE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH ALL PASTY'S, ESPECIALLY THEIR CHICKEN PASTY! It was gross!  We asked for a different sauce.   The waitress stated that was their only sauce but she could bring us ketchup and that's what a lot of people use.  Yes she did say that! If a lot of people are requesting ketchup, the cook, heck the owner needs to know their customers are having to douse their pasty's in ketchup because they are too dry.  The beef and potato pasty was more potato than beef and yes it was arid dry as the desert....\n\nSo for both visits I give this Cornish Pasty 2 stars because of their salad and fries.  For had we not order those this would easily be a 1 star review. I hope they can turn this place around soon!
580	This Irish pub is in the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay, in the walkway between Mandalay Bay and Luxor. They're trying hard to represent an Irish pub, but with the Cranberries crooning \"Zohohm-bee eeh eeh eeh \" on the speakers, and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish playing on TV, it's classic Vegas kitsch. \n\nService was fast. I ordered a Guinness stout (served colder than I like), the Burren Irish Smoked Salmon small plate and a Sprout Salad, then settled down to watch an obscure European soccer game. \n\nThe salad and salmon arrived simultaneously - I started with the former but it was too dry, though the dried cranberries and spicy cashews were a nice addition. I put it aside and turned to the Burren salmon. \n\nThe salmon was excellent - tender and succulent - but ratio of fish to sundries was way off. Too much pickled red onion, capers, and sour cream, not enough salmon. And the soda bread was way too thick and dry - they'd put store bought Kerrygold butter on top (of course!) which made me smile at the irony. \n\nOverall a meh experience. Likely won't return, with so many other dining options to try out in Vegas. Cheers!
581	I'm highly disgusted and dissapointed in this place.  My fiance and I went in today for the 6:45pm showing for \"don't breath\". As we looked up the rolls to find seats I spotted a mice underneath a theater seat.  I was so disgusted I immediately went and asked for a manager. I informed him of the little rodent that was in the theater and even showed him pictures ,all he kept saying was\"I'm so sorry\". I demanded a refund for our tickets and the for the money spent at the concession stand also. I will never step foot in this place again.
582	Slowly turning into my favorite pizza place. It's a little small and casual, but I'd rather have it cozy than big and restaurant-chain style. Try as much as you can, I did the knots, wings, and pizza with a friend and we finished everything. I only wish they were open on Sundays.
583	Full Disclosure: Regardless of what you've read about me in the tabloids,  I've never had a pedicure before this visit.  And now, well. . . .\n\nI read somewhere recently that old men should be explorers.  While I'm not collecting SS yet, I'm getting an early start.  Beginning with a pedicure. \n\nP(rincess) has beautiful feet and occasionally gets a pedi so I suggested we go toe-gether (get it?) during the holiday break for something to do.  She just about fell over.\n\nShe's been going to Lish for sometime now (found it on Yelp, of course).  We showed up without an appointment and were able to get in with only a 20 minute wait.\n\nThis was such a cool experience, I really recommend it to anyone who hasn't spoiled themselves a little and have this done.  It's so affordable, only $28 plus tip for about a 45 minute soak, cleaning, trim, and callous scrub.  The place is super clean with sterile liners that go into the tubs before they change out the water for you.  \n\nYou get to sit on these incredible massage chairs that were worth the $28 alone! This is a fairly large facility with probably 10-12 chairs for the pedis and another large section for manicures (no, not yet-socks first, then shoes).\n\nWill I be back?  Yes, it was fun and well worth it and great to have some quality time with The Princess.
584	This is the Things Remembered at Fiesta Mall. I have used them over the years to buy unique, engraved gifts and even colorful, personalized throws for my grandkids. The floor space and selection at the store are limited, but they do have a web page and you can order anything from the web site and have it delivered here with no delivery charge to the customer.\nIf you are looking for a wedding, anniversary, or birthday gift that is personalized or engraved, this store has helpful staff. I have also had them engrave items purchased at other stores for a nominal fee.
585	I went here and paid for the diamond car wash, paying 40 some bucks for the worst car wash I have ever had. I don't normally write reviews, but this was too bad! There are spots on the dash that had not even been touched! The places that had been wiped down were done poorly at best!! They write on your back window stating what wash you are getting. After I left I noticed I could still see the writing, if that doesn't say it all I don't know what does!!! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!
586	Best burger I've had in a while! The patty was juicy and had a soft, kind of crumbly texture (in a good way!) and was super delicious. Only gripe was really the fries. My friend and I got both the regular and the upgraded poutine with our combos. The gravy and cheese curds on the poutine was good, but the fries itself were kind of mushy. Looks like they pre-fry it before serving. Unfortunately, I'll only be back for the burgers and probably will skip out on the fries.
587	Consistency check number one. My order, 1 beef sirloin noodle soup. Mild spice. Verdict: Yum.  I arrived at around 12:30 p.m. so it was kind of busy. The understaffed service team seem to be very busy and I had to wait approximately 10 minutes before being served. The food arrived at my table in approximately 10 minutes which wasn't so bad. Flavors behind the soup where a mystery to me but delicious nonetheless. The beef sirloin was tender and flavorful. Combine in the noodles and wow, what an amazing noodle soup dish. I saw other items on the menu that enticed my appetite such as pigs pigs feet and intestines.  Oh so good, but will check them out on my next visit.
588	Went for the first time last night. Great sushi, cocktails, and desserts! Would recommend it to a friend!
589	So,  I ate my food before I could take a picture!! I had the 2 pancakes,  2 eggs,  liver mush and sweet tea for $5.50. Husband had 2 salmon cakes,  grits,  eggs and a biscuit. $5.50. Total for both meals $12 and change.  This is diner food prepared diner style with an open kitchen. The decor is old diner,  but I didn't go for the ambiance,  I came for the food!\nThe food was delicious.  The pancakes were flavorful,  the eggs over medium were perfect as well as the liver mush.  My husband's breakfast was also delicious.  \nI would definitely come back.  The service is excellent.  The ladies out front were efficient and friendly.  Dirty tables are bussed immediately.  \nIf you aren't too picky about the decor,  you'll love this gem,  too.
590	This place is awesome. My son takes guitar through Milano Music so I am usually there every Saturday.  I have bought 3 guitars from them, and one was a special order through Les Paul and was absolutely amazing what they were able to pull off, resulting in a pretty amazing graduation present for my son. \n\nLast Christmas I drew a name for the Christmas Angel and the little girl wanted a guitar.  I went straight to Milanos, and they helped me in choosing a great beginners guitar for a small girl.  When I told them what it was for, they let me know they wanted to help too.  She ended up with a really nice starter kit, and a great guitar.  They are truly wonderful people and are completely committed to music, and providing the best experience possible for their patrons.  Patrons that have been coming back for years!  I know why! \n\nPurchase here - you will not be disappointed, and you too will be a customer for life.
591	It's the first day and they are off to a great start!!  Great service and awesome food and only 2 min walk from the Fremont Experience. Try it and you'll be hooked!!
592	Service outweighs the food, and not in a good way. While we had made a slight error in not including two toddlers in our reservation at 5:30 on a Sunday, they stuck us at a high table. We asked the hostess if we could sit at the standard size table (same size - 6) next to ours and was rudely told that it was reserved for another party. When we asked for clarification, seeing that we had two children under 2 and the table was about a foot taller than the high chairs, she said it was in another servers zone and they can't do anything about it. Okay, I get that there could be issues with zones, but maybe try being nice and not jerks about it? \n\nNext, we ordered guacamole - 1 jalapeño and one without (for the kids) they placed the jalapeño one in front of the kids and said it was without, but said it was the opposite.  Luckily we caught it.\n\nLast complaint, the time it took to get our food was extremely long. Luckily its right on the park there and we spent our time on the grass with the kids while we waited. \n\nI should note the waitress was very nice and attentive, but the rest of the experience was definitely the low point of our trip.
593	I feel like I've been given a food hug here at Yardbird. Exceptional service elevated out large private table experience. Christina was outstanding and made our friends feel special on their birthday as well and separated all our checks. \n\nDeviled eggs same roe were fantastic. Chicken and watermelon and waffles were tasty and the biscuits and gravy were comfort food defined. All was done very well, but nothing was mind blowing. While I was looking for saltier, flakier biscuits, more savory sausage gravy, and bolder bloodies, I am certainly not disappointed in any way. It was a great meal made better by great service and a chill atmosphere. \n\nI'd recommend Yarbird to anyone in Vegas looking for a more authentic dining experience, which is hard to find here, imo.
594	One of the better tasting AYCE for sushi. I have been going to this place for years now. The food quality is consistently exceptional. They have a large selection of variety and is always packed during dinner hours so always reserve during a holiday or weekend if you don't want to wait. The price is a bit on the higher side and also keep in kind they include tips on the bill.
595	My 200th review, who would have thought I would be writing 200 reviews in less than 6 short months. And I can't think of a more suiting place deserving of my 200th spot then my recent experience at 168 Sushi Asian Buffet. \n\nLocated on the North-West corner of Steeles and Dufferin in the Vaughan community of Concord (the neighbourhood I grew up in), 168 has secured itself a spot as a top 3 AYCE sushi spot in my mind.\n\nEntering I almost felt like I had entered into a neon bathed night club circa Scarface 1980. The decor is awash in teals and pastel pink colours, but most importantly is the number of booths which fill this establishment. I really enjoy this element of privacy this provided, good for confidential meetings, dates, or to hide your face whilst stuffing it. They also have a private dining area which other than a secure door entrance isn't really all that private as it's surrounded by a wall of glass making it appear more like a fish bowl - trust me the irony of this is not lost on me (humans in a fish bowl...in a sushi restaurant).\n\nEnough about the look and feel of this place, what about the food? I must echo the sentiments of previous yelpers, the food here is FRESH. I'm a huge proponent of sashimi and 168's portions are fresh, perfectly temperate and generous. Their Kalbi beef short ribs were some of the thickest and most tender I've encountered. Their sushi rolls we industry standard, nothing mind blowing but certainly met expectations to fill the hunger gaps between bites of sashimi. \n\nI honestly can't recall all the items we ordered as I was with a seasoned 168'er and I just ate what was put in front of me and didn't ask too many questions. However some menu standouts for me personally were the Shrimp w\/ Maggie Sauce and their Shrimp Tempura. The shrimp tempura was the BEST, I've had at any sushi and\/or asian fusion restaurant  EVER. Not overly battered, large, long, yum!\n\nThe final point of awesome for my money was the salad and soup buffet. It made so much more sense to be able to walk up and serve yourself all the Miso soup and seaweed salad I could. Saved time on orders and allowed me to have as much or as little as I wanted.
596	Lot of negative reviews floating around the web, but its not so bad IF you have everything in order.  Make sure you double, triple check your forms before you go!  Any slight mistake will mean you have to redo the forms.  I would say plan an extra day as back-up, because there is a good chance they may ask you to come again if something is wrong.\n\n Do not rely on using their computer system.  Complete everything at home and come prepared.  First of all, there will always be someone that is using the computer (Lawrence location only has one computer).  Secondly, while I was there the website kept giving errors.  Some guy tried like three times to complete his forms but the connection was unstable and the website kept crashing.\n\nGo like 15-20min before the office opens.  There is hardly anyone there.  Reps were friendly to deal with.  It also helps that you deal with them first thing in the morning when they are fresh and not in the middle of the day where they could be cranky after dealing with lot of people!\n\nIt is a hassle going through BLS, but at the end of the day we got our document in the timeline they said we would.
597	Started here for an UYE (Harry Potter pub crawl). \n\nThis is a pretty typical British pub in America. Waitstaff missing the British accents (although I could just listen to the hubby's accent and pretend that I'm in England).\n\nFast, attentive service. Didn't eat anything from the menu, but it had a few possibilities. Might be back to try food at some point as the location was pretty convenient.
598	The Lip Lab is the ultimate splurge for any beauty connoisseur and getting the customized lipstick package is the perfect gift for any beauty junkie. \n\nIf you're not already familiar with the fantastic-ness of Bite beauty products what sets them apart from most other lip products is that they are food grade quality meaning they are naturally safer for residual ingestion. Obviously most of us don't eat lipsticks but the by-products and ingredients contained in lipsticks such as parabens and petrolatum can't cumulatively be good for us. Not to mention the color payoff and texture of their lip products are heavenly. \n\nBite lip products also taste amazing, and smell refreshingly pleasant (no surprise since the founder of Bite is non other than Susanne Langmuir formerly of Susanne Lang perfumes) which is a nice change from the likes of old school French lipstick labels like Chanel, YSL, Dior because not everyone wants the smell of roses overkill or old lady perfume wafting from their lips. What's more Bite Beauty production is based out of Toronto and does not test its products on animals. \n\nGifting the customized lip package is spendy but for $150 you get two empty lip bullets (ready for engraving and custom mixed colors)  and an Acai lip butter along with lip brush packed in a gift bag with an invite card outlining how to set up an appointment for lipstick customization. \n\nAll things considered, I highly recommend Bite beauty Lip Lab for both their superlative product line and for the uniquely pleasing experience of creating high quality bespoke lipsticks.
599	Big bite is right. Let me start by telling you my unconditional love for burritos. I LOVE THEM. Especially burrito bowls.. it's like happiness in each bite. Whenever I'm a food court with chipotle, I will get chipotle. It's not even a question. When yelp searching 'burrito' at 12am one night (I know you feel me on this), I came across this 4 star venue not that far away - I knew the next day I had to holla @ it.\n\nThe parking lot is soooo small .. most people in the area walk, but if you are parking .. good luck. Spaces are tighter than your old gym teacher's pants too.. be extremely careful when backing in, which is what you'll want to do because I cannot even fathom leaving this lot (which opens directly into the road) with head in parking. It's super easy to find though, right at kennedy and sheppard. \n\nThe burrito place is bigger than I expected. It was also not dingy, like I had expected. With cute retro and sarcastic signs all over the wall, I knew this was the type of place I can f with. Ordering is super quick and even though there were only 2 workers, they were efficient. Pretty much the same speed as the command chain @ chipotle. I was also surprised to see how many options of burrito, the sizes and sides you can get. They even had more than one vegan\/vegetarian option!! Woop woop! I opted for the sweet potato burrito bowl, which was under $10 and had guac included. Chipotle can seriously eat it's dust because big bite provided such a packed bowl that I felt sickening-full before with a large portion left to spare inside the box. They also had a lot of options to choose from to put in your burrito\/burrito bowl. Corn, jalapeno, tomato, salsa, FREE guac, green pepper, olive, onions and they add in chips on the side for how much extra? FREE! & might I add that the sweet potato medallions in my bowl were larger than life.\n\nThe bf also ordered a pulled pork burrito. They called it out within minutes and he started to devour it, the hungry bear he is. As he was halfway done, the man shouted to him and asked him if it was pulled pork that he had. Turns out it wasn't and he had eaten someone else's burrito. Completely not his fault though because the guy making it did call out pulled pork instead of what it actually was - chicken. So in the end, my boyfriend got a free burrito.. LOL. & He claims the mistaken chicken one he had was actually better than the pulled pork one.\n\nI really like this place and I'm glad it's open kind of late-ish because I will definitely be searching for 'burrito' in the late hours of the night again. I'm also a fan of not going broke every time I get a burrito bowl and have to consider if I should get guac or have enough $ to live semi-comfortably for the rest of the week. Achem, chipotle.
600	Always hot and tasty! My favorites include the Mexican juices and super nachos! But I can say it's all great!
601	Great vibes. It looks like this used to be a church and renovated into a sexy restaurant. The details of the decor and furniture is really cool. High ceilings. Nice looking bar. They came out with chips and salsa. Freshly made in house and so delicious. Extra addicting. We got 5 different tacos. The cherry steak, lamb, Peking duck, carne asada , and blackened shrimp. The best two were the cherry steak and Peking duck. It's a great place for happy hour. Would definitely come back for food and drinks. Vibes on point\n\nRecommendation: cherry steak tacos and Peking duck tacos
602	In trying to find the Escape Hybrid we thought we'd also look at the Mercury Mariner Hybrid (which is the same car).  They had a few at Camelback Ford so we stopped by to check them out.  We walked around the lot for a while before anyone approached us (which is the way I like it).  The guy who finally came around was very chatty and very helpful.  We went inside and he searched all over the Southwest for the car we wanted and then decided that maybe we would be interested in a used hybrid escape.  We went out on a test drive through the Biltmore neighborhood (which was crazy since I'd never been there after living here for almost 20 years).  After we finished up, the salesman even offered to get us a quote on getting the car painted from their body shop.  Pretty helpful.\nAfter considering the reviews of their body shop and how little we wanted a repainted car, we decided to look elsewhere.  They were helpful and great, but they just didn't have what we wanted.
603	Sprinkles who???\nThis is my fav local bakery (I often pick up a treat from LGO) for their amazing OOEY GOOEY cupcakes. The name should say it all!\nThe cake is rick and moist while the frosting is a little piece of heaven. \n\nYou must stop by and grab yourself a treat, you will forget all about Sprinkles cupcakes and be in love!
604	There are some great things and not so great things about this buffet.   \n\nWhat I enjoyed:\n omelet station- I like being able to pick what is in my omelet.   I do suggest that they put omlete toppings somewhere visible so people know what the options are or at least put up a sign\/ menubof choices.   \n\n1\/2 of my bloody Marys.    The first and last ones ordered was just from a mix and just tasted like tomato,  the others the bar tender put mix and vodka \n\nThe seafood soup-tomoato based.   I had clams,  muscles,  squid and a nice broth.   \n\nOysters were good\n\nSalad bar- cute bowls... I just suggest they work on the order of getting items.   Most people make their salads by putting lettuce,  toppings then dressing.   Having the dressings in the middle causes lots of akward bumping around.   \n\nChicken fried steak is good,  but the gravy needs work.   It taste like the flour hasn't been cooked through  so not so pleasant. \n\nThe meat and cheese station had a good selection... But no bagles to go with the lox \n\nNice big beverage section,  not sure if it is too big\n\nGranted I did not eat everything\n\nWhat needs work,  besides what was mentioned above\n\nBreakfast items,  scattered all over the place.   It would be nice if they were put together more.   \n\nScrambled eggs looked unappealing ..i didn't get them,  but while standing in line for an omelet another lady showed her friend and it did look like tofu and were wiggly.  \n\nSushi rice is hard,  taste like store bought.  \n\nExtra paper napkins would be nice to put my fork and knife on.   I will not leave on a table so my cloth napkin looked like a little kid used it. \n\nLike I said I did not eat everything thing.  It is decent but needs some improvements
605	Who doesn't like chocolate? Diabetics maybe? Not by choice anyway.\n\nAny time I have friends and\/or family come into town, this is one of the default places I take them either on the way to Hoover Dam or on the way back. Just don't get disappointed when you come on a Saturday or Sunday because if you were expecting to see the workers in action on the self guided tour, they only work Monday through Friday.\n\nBefore you even make it to the entrance of the tour, you have your basic store where they sell mainly M&M products. At the end of the tour, there is usually a worker handing out 3 kinds of chocolate samples. Milk, Dark, and White Chocolate. Sometimes they substitute one of them with a seasonal item like Peppermint Bark from my visit today.\n\nChocolates here are pretty expensive. How do you think they make up for all the free samples they give out? LOL. That is what is a big plus for me since I don't bother buying anything here. Sometimes they have specials which can save you some money. A lot of times my friends and family end up giving me money to purchase what they want because locals get 10 percent off items that are not already discounted.\n\nFor you liquor enthusiasts, they sell alcohol infused chocolates so your trip here is definitely not a waste.\n\nAnd for the other attraction part of this place? A Cactus Garden. Yay! Who doesn't love looking at cacti of different shapes and sizes? Make sure to eat a box or two of the alcohol infused chocolates before heading out to see these marvelous cacti for your entertainment pleasure.\n\nI would definitely bump this up to 5 stars if they gave out samples of the Chocolate Liqueur. Im sure they would also get a lot more visitors if this comes to fruition. Until then, I will keep this place in my regular rotation of default places to take my visiting guests.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #4
606	New Restaurant on Fremont St. Great vibes, staff and food!\nWe had a party of 8 and everyone loved their food and drinks!\nI had the Steak sandwich - one of the best I've had. The salmon was great and my son is still talking about his Turkey Burger and of course the truffle fries- I would go back for just those!  Service was friendly - a great addition to downtown.
607	My order was $10.23. Give the guy $15. He hands me back the $5 and tells me to come up with 23¢. I asked if he didn't have changed and he just gave me a confused look. Ok?... Also, did you guys run out of sauerkraut for the Rubens? Just give a person a heads up. (PS- I know I'm being ridiculous writing a yelp review on a fast food restaurant but \"come up with 23¢\" is aggressive lol. Really? It was like 845p and what's your deal bro.
608	Definitely was my favorite club out of the 3 we went to for my first time in Vegas.\n\nThey music was good and the vibes were amazing. The water was nice to relax in (although probably really gross..) \nWe got seated at the lily pads, so that was nice. \nWe went here twice and both times were just as great. I would definitely come back here again.
609	Steve is great in all ways. Super professional while still keeping the experience fun. Love all my work from him and hope to be able to come back soon. Everyone else there is dope too, just haven't had any work done by them.
610	3.5 stars for sure.\n\nAnother noodle place in the SW! \n\nMongolian beef pancakes...not my thing I guess. It was ground beef wrapped in a noodle skin. I didn't like the flavor and wasn't impressed. I told my husband that I wanted the beef noodles, B1, not spicy of course for this preggo. He wanted some other dish but they didn't understand what he meant when he ordered. I guess that's how you know it's authentic Chinese food. I told him next time just order whatever the number and letter is on the menu. ;)\n\nThe noodles were a bit soggy but I liked it. It was spicy so I couldn't eat too much of it because spicy makes my heart burn (joys of pregnancy!).  I thought the flavor was good and I would definitely come back because the portions were a good size! You are actually full and I think that's one of the reason why Chinese food is so dang appealing besides the fact that I am Chinese as well and the cost factor. I was able to go back again some other time and this time they didn't add the spice so I was able to enjoy it more. I don't think that they should put the noodles with the broth when ordering to because that's what causes the noodles to be soggy. Overall, it's a decent place and it's close enough to home so that I don't have to drive down that street where no one can drive aka Spring Mtn.
611	I called Bliss today on a recommendation of another barber that wasn't available for an appointment today. My conversation went as follows:\n\nLady: \"Hello Bliss Salon & Spa\"\nMe: \"Hi! How are you doing today?\"\nLady \"IS THIS ANOTHER SALES CALL? DO YOU WANT TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT OR NOT?\"\nMe: \"Not anymore\"\n\nWhat a joke. Sorry if you run a business, getting sales calls happens. However, I wasn't a sales call I was calling to become a customer and possibly a repeat one considering I live right next to it. \n\nSo congratulations Bliss, you lost a customer before I even set foot in your establishment. Whoever was manning the phones at 4:40 on 5\/15\/2014 should take a lesson in customer service.\n\nI will make sure to tell anyone considering using this place my experience and also report back to the store that referred me to STOP referring people to this place.
612	You gotta love a place like Bertha's!  It just has a great FEEL when you walk in the front door.  Despite a line of about 10 in front of us, we gave our order in less than 3 minutes from arrival.   I ordered the Asparagus and Harvati Panini with chicken, and my partner ordered the chicken club.\n\nYou order at the counter and grab a seat if you are dining in.  I saw a lot of folks taking out and many regulars who had phoned their orders in.  We waited maybe 5 minutes max and were rewarded with ample sized sandwiches, that were fresh and tasty; along with a totally decadent chocolate cookie.  I would have tried their daily soup, but it was 110 degrees out so I will wait until Winter.\n\nGood food, great service, easy to dance to. I gave it a 5!
613	Not gonna lie, This place deserves the 4.5 stars that it has on Yelp. This place is excellent if you're tired of the same old junk in Vegas. Buldogis has excellent service in terms of the kindness of the chefs and cashiers, they really know how to make you feel welcomed. The food here is really unique, its not something you'd be able to find just anywhere. Words themselves cannot describe the taste of Buldogis, so I recommend anyone to just come at least once to try it out. Whether you like Asian food or American food, it's an excellent blend of both!
614	Fuck is Susan ever lazy.... but if you like Lazy Susan you'll love Rol Jui.\nOpen most nights until 5am, this is easily my go late night (early morning) to china town eatery and as you've guessed it they have lazy susans on their tables.\n\nThe place seems pretty ghetto once your start to deconstruct your surroundings. We have faded pictures of food blown up and mounted on the walls, the white garbage bag table cloths and the giant fish tanks with mammoth fish that often throw themselves against the tank (and scare the shit out of me every time!) The best or worse part is the cleanup... the waitress just grabs all four garbage bag table cloth corners and carries the plates and utensils in a makeshift bag-cluster to the back room (seriously I wish I could do this at home!)\n\nNow on to the food, which is delicious! I usually get the squid and crab corn chowder. The portions are large and made for sharing so bring friends and don't sit near the fish tank if you get startled easily!
615	It was high time we returned here, so we finally did, with friends in tow.  The dinner was almost as fine as before--but not quite.\n\nBrown Bread with fruit inside it was excellent, and golden Calamari Fritti was great with a fine Remoulade Sauce.  And a Shrimp Cocktail with Horseradishy Cocktail Sauce featured 4 large and delectable shrimp.  But the Caesar Dressing on my Caesar Salad was far too weak--like a light oil that at best contained only a hint of traditional Caesar flavor.  \n\nLobster Bisque with couscous and cream was velvety and excellent.  A medium-rare 6 oz. Filet as part of a Surf & Turf pairing was very good, although so laden with peppercorns that I knocked 2\/3 of them off.  But Goose Fat Potatoes were perfectly crisp, and Potatoes Romanof were creamy and great.  \n\nThere was one notable service error.  Our server initially brought 2 orders of mixed sauteed Wild Mushrooms to the table instead of 1 plus the Potatoes Romanof.  The error was fairly quickly resolved.  Both Bearnaise and Bordelaise Sauces were quite well prepared.\n\nOverall, a fine 4-1\/2 star meal!
616	Caramel Sea Salt is by far the best flavor of ice cream I have EVER tasted.
617	I am a long-time patron of Zipps. I've been here a couple times a month for 8 years. So, right around 200 times. I'm a lifetime $10K+ contributor to Zipps. I used to just love it. The food was stellar... WAS. But now I'm hesitant to rate it at 3 stars. And I'm sadly nostalgic for the 4-star visits in the rear-view mirror.\n\nZipps has been in steady decline over the passed 2-3 years. Sometimes you continue to go to iffy places because they are part of your circle's social rhythm. That's me and my circle with Zipps. Then Zipps started letting me down with their food quality, letting me down consistently. So much so, that Zipps ought to be one of my pallbearers when I died so they can let me down one last time. \n\nIt started with the Chicken Skewers years back. Those went from succulent tasty morsels to smaller rubbery lumps of disappointment. Then the burgers started to drift south. The pizza is awful, but it always has been. So the pizza is not a factor in my review. The challenge lately is eating something that doesn't make my, mostly iron-clad, stomach hurt. \n\nMy advice: Stick with the wings. They have been the shining beacon of delicious consistency in both taste and texture. Can't go wrong with the Zipps wings. We get them extra crispy.\n\nWings and salad. Those things are mostly safe.\n\nWhat about the service? It's been exceptional in the past. Over the last few years the signature aspect Zipps service has been tired, overworked servers. What are you gonna say? I just wish it was different.\n\nGonna stay clear for a while.
618	I saw the show a couple years ado. It was awful. Slow and dragged on and on. Most boring \"Christmas\" show ever! I wanted to walk out.
619	Go here for happy hour! They have the best chicken Tonga taco you'll ever have! Their guacamole is a dream too. I've had their bowls, nachos, and drinks too which never disappoint. So yummy! This place is always a win!
620	Whatever you do, don't leave without having the scallop appetizer, best scallops I have had in a long time, perfectly cooked and the butternut squash puree is amazing. I am not a chocolate fan, but we ended our dinner with the Chocolate Pecan Torte and it had some kind of fried candied banana on top, so good.
621	This is kinda of a cool place. Great beer selection.\nDon't smoke, but it looks like they have a great cigar selection.\nLots of TV's cool patio. \nThey need some live acoustic music or an open mic on that patio. \n(I know a guy that can play)

623	Worst service ever!!! So hubby calls and has the order taker double check and make sure they have gluten free (severe allergy) . Yes they do. So he places order hangs up and a while later he gets a call , they do not have gluten free and our bank card has already been charged! So we are out $48,for 5-7 days!!! For some people that could be their last dollar and they would still be hungry!
624	So everyone kept talking this place up. We popped in around halloween when they were doing to Bob's Burgers thing. It was a great idea, they all looked great, and the food was pretty good. However... it took about 45 minutes to get our to go order. They were understaffed and over packed.I was crushed into a corner waiting for our food. I wanted to go outside but there were 15 people on the sidewalk also waiting for food. While there I heard the staff say \"oh no we ran out of hamburger\" they placed a call to the butcher and ordered more. I don't think they were quite prepared for the turn out. After we left and ate our food, it was cold (not their fault but just a side note). I live very close to this location so I figured... why not give it another try. \n\nThe space is small and cramped. The menu is small. The food is expensive. I don't need old country buffet sized portions of food, but I'd like to feel based on quality and quantity that my money was spent well. My food came. I ate in. It was... sub par. This is not the typeof place when I have out of town visitors that I would exclaim \"OH YOU HAVE TO TRY VANDAL\". It's that place that someone passes in the car with me and goes \"Have you ever eaten there? What's the food like? Is it cool?\" And I sigh and look out the window and say \"I wanted it to be. But it's not.\" \n\nThis restaurant is like the hot guy\/girl in high school that every one talks about how great they are and how fun they are and how interesting they are. One day at a party you end up sat next to them and you converse and you walk away from them and you go \"am I just not cool enough to get it? Theyre totally boring. They're a complete moron.\" and you feel sad a little as you slowly walk away knowing you'll never understand the appeal that everyone else seems to see. You can dress it up in the finest and hippest clothes, but it doesn't change the lack of substance.
625	Scam artist. Creates fraudulent documents and has judges in his back pocket. stay away.
626	Hands down the most authentic tasting Thai food in the area. The staff pays attention to details and provide outstanding service consistently.
627	You can always count on this place for a good lunch. Nothing too crazy, just your regular Americanized Chinese food. It's a much better option than the PPG food court Chinese food, which is known to make people sick, eek! \nGreat lunch prices.  Gets a little busy, so I'd suggest making your way over before noon.
628	The place was small but sweet and the staff was really friendly. I first came for the boba but grabbed a dozen variety of donuts OMG let me tell you I'm not a donut person but these donuts are light and fluffy I have to restrain myself from eating another. My girls who really love donuts enjoyed them so much and said they were the best they have had to date. \n   The coconut boba was really good exactly what I expected and satisfied my craving. I'm so happy to have a boba place in town.\n    I would definitely be making all my donut and boba purchases here!
629	Maybe we were there on a bad day.  This was the worst and the cheapest tasting pizza that we have had in some time.  The crust was bland, the cheese tasted like plastic and the little rubber eraser ends that passed for Italian sausage were chewy and flavorless.  They always seem to be empty when we eat next door at the GREAT Mexican restaurant.  I don't think they will be in business for very long.
630	You'd have to be retarded or devoid of any sense of humor to not love Dick's Last Resort! This place is heaven on Earth. As soon as I found out what they do, I thought to myself, \"why has no one done this before?\"\n\nDick's Last Resort is a restraunt inside the Excalibur Hotel & Casino that prides itself in it's sense of humor. At Dick's the waitstaff are rude, crude, inappropriate, and HIGHLY unprofessional....... on purpose. And they expect you to do the same. Dick's is a place where social constraints and political correctness are left at the door with your hat and coat.\n\nOur waitress walked up to us, threw our utensils and napkins on the table, tossed us some menus and said \"hurry up and decide what you want!\" I fell in love with this place immediately. The best part was when you have a real question about something (like a menu option) she would switch into real waitress-mode and answer your question.... then mercilessly make fun of you for asking such a dumb question. hahaha.\n\nOur waitress was so great at her job, she actually scared away an older Asian family who sat next to us. I don't think they knew the point of Dick's and didn't appreciate the sarcasm. Our waitress did the same routine with the utensils and menus, but when she returned to take their order, they hadn't decided yet. She asked \"do you all speak English?\" to which a meek \"yes\" must have been uttered, and she followed it up with \"well then liven up a little bit, jeez.\" and she walked away. The eldest lady at the table was already halfway out the restraunt by that point! My wife and I were in tears laughing so hard!\n\nThe food was amazing too! My wife had the pulled pork plate and I had the BBQ beef brisket with ribs. Perfection on a plate was what was served to me. I loved it all!\n\nI will most definately be returning to Dick's Last Resort the next time I go to Vegas. 5 stars all the way!
631	Before I start off - I have been coming to Casanova Bros. for years, The food is incredible and the atmosphere was....amazing. The reason for the four stars is because of the food and prior experiences here.\n\nFast forward to the new place.... I went on Feb. 3rd and was so disappointed. Maybe my expectation was too high? But...no more order at the counter and sit...which is one of the reasons I loved this place...true pizza place... anyway not a huge deal, but I am not a fan of the wait on someone else to get your things for you. With that said, I'm going to give them a couple of months to get used to it. I was there for an hour and a half...sitting the entire duration ..waiting...Whether it be on a waitress\/waiter, food or eating.\n\nWhen we first walked in, we were asked if we wanted to sit in the lounge, patio or dining area. We asked for the lounge area which is just a fancy name for the bar. We were seated at a table and asked if we could sit at a booth. The young lady who seated us said she would get someone to clean off a booth. Someone came and cleaned off two booths, but no one ever came back and told us we could moved back over...10 minutes later we moved on our own (mind you, no one had been over to take our orders-even drinks). About 10 minutes later someone came over and asked if we had been helped yet \"Nope\"..she took our drink orders and left. A short while, another waitress came up to us and asked if we had been helped yet... lack of communication between the employees. After that, our waitress returned with our drinks and took our order. All we ordered was a 14\" cheese pizza. No appetizers. No other entrees. Just a plain pizza. 30 minutes later we were still waiting for our pizza, and mind you, not once visit from our waitress between this waiting. We noticed other people had not gotten their food yet either, and Tony was apologizing to everyone about the wait.... However when our pizza finally arrived it was warm...not hot....warm... which means it had been sitting there. After eating we waited another 15 minutes for our check. Hence why the order and sit is so much more convenient.  The food at this place is too good to leave behind forever, however I will be placing my order to go, and only hope that it is ready when they quote me a time. \n\nObviously, they have some kinks to work out being in a new place... I can't change the order and sit conversion to waiters\/waitresses (which I think the east coast feel was lost), but I can wait it out until everyone is up to speed. If this were my first time, rating would be a 2...however like I said...the food is AMAZING.... so just order to go for a few more months.
632	Finally got the chance to go to Johnny's Hamburgers and grab a burger for lunch. \n\nMaybe after reading all these reviews I came with high expectation and was a little disappointed.  The Hamburger ($3.05) I order is ok... not too bad but I definitely have much better one! I found the patty does not have a lot of bite. The bun did not toasted enough so it got a little soggy by the time I eat that. The cooked onion as one of the free toppings is a nice touch if you like onions...\n\nOnion Rings ($2.10) is A-OK. The batter is light and was not too greasy.\n\nBTW, they do have lunch specials for $5.24 Monday to Friday 11:00-3:00 pm will get you a burger\/fries\/drink.\n\nI did get a really good smiling service... the guy that took my order even trying to practise his limited Chinese with me :) and they were all really friendly. Maybe because the place was not too busy when I was there?\n\nWill I go again?? Maybe... since I find the lunch special is quite a good deal and it is good to have a change from eating Asian food all the time! :)
633	One of my favorite places at the food court at the MGM Grand.  This is fast food:  Nothing fancy and the people behind the counter don't give a shit about you so you have to speak up when you order.  That's really the bottom line.  I had the sausage, egg and cheese muffin two mornings in a row along with a hashbrown.  Other than trying to hustle drinks on you, I'd say this is a really good place to eat.  Your other choices are McDonald's (for the price conscience), or the pizza place.  I forgot the other place to the left of Nathan's.  This is a great place for breakfast.  However, looking at all the other reviews, you probably want to pass for all the other meals.
634	Over 30 years ago I stopped at Dazzo's. When I got there it was closed. Two men( the Dazzo's brothers, Ron and Frank) were working inside, one of them came to the door and said \"sorry we're closed, come back tomorrow, that's when we officially open\". So my wife, my Mom and I came back the next day and we have been going to Dazzo's since. We've literally have seen the Dazzo's family grow up; their kids and now there grand kids. I love hot dogs and crazy about their beefs and and sausage sandwich, ( you know sweet and hot peppers and real, real, real wet). Even though we moved a bit farther from their location we still make it a point to stop in and grab a bite to eat. Without question there is no other place like Dazzo's in the Valley. As always best wishes the Dazzo family and lets do another 30 more years.
635	My boyfriend picked this place for dessert while we were in town, and I had no idea what to expect since it was my first time trying rolled ice cream. I opted to pick a S'mores sundae from the menu because I'm indecisive and limiting myself to only three mix-ins\/toppings would have held the line up for at least an hour. \n\nYou place your order at the register and they call you up while they make it, asking for your preference for sauce and toppings during the process. They toasted my marshmallow on a Pocky stick before they chopped it up into my ice cream, which added such an incredible flavor! \n\nThe staff members were so friendly, and all of the sundaes looked so pretty!\n\nI was super pleased, our ice creams were delicious!  I look forward to going back again for more. :)
636	I needed a quick touch up on my roots before I went away for the weekend and could not get in to see my regular stylist. I scheduled an evening appointment for last night with Michaela. I knew something was wrong when she would not turn me towards the mirror as she was blowing it out. Instead of my regular ashy blonde, she had turned my hair red. She then spent the next several hours trying to \"fix\" it. She did a few applications of toner, tried adding more highlights and tried a different color. Five hours after walking in my scalp was raw and my hair was a trashy copper color. Midway this ordeal the owner, Angie, went in the back with Michaela and then decided to go home. I called this morning to see if someone would fix this mess. The owner couldn't be bothered to even come to the phone and, although the receptionist was very apologetic, the best they could do was get me in mid-day tomorrow. I would have been better off using a boxed color from CVS.
637	Had a great time at this place, food & service was good. Wife & I enjoyed the steaks and the ambiance. Thank you,
638	zero consistency in the food.  one visit it will be great, the next visit it will be terrible.  you could order the same pizza and get a different looking one every time.  also, it has been closed for several weeks with no notice on the door, website or voicemail.  is this place even still in business??
639	The name, Alchemy Coffee, is very misleading. With such a name, one expects grand transmutations and elixirs that grant immortality. Neither were demonstrated while I visited.\n\nPragmatics aside, Alchemy Coffee offered a pleasant brunch experience.  As previous reviewers have mentioned, space is a rare commodity in this establishment. Upon arrival, my companion and I scanned the room and there were exactly 2 vacant seats. Perfect!  But not really, because the 2 seats were part of a 4-seater table with 2 other patrons. No worries though, it's the 21st century and Markham is fairly progressive, so surely, these 2 patrons are well-socialized. But nope!  They proceeded to talk colourfully about various lewd topics, but I digress.\n\nWe decided to order the Classic Brekkie, Buttermilk Pancakes, a cappuccino, and a coffee.  In my opinion, all of these items were pretty standard except for the Buttermilk Pancakes.  The pancakes were stacked elegantly with a dollop of blueberry paste placed atop and a garnish of cornflakes.  The pancakes were fluffy and sweet; each bite enveloping you in bliss while enveloping your organs in a layer of fat (cemented by the condensed milk served on the side).\n\nThe brunch was a bit awkward, to be honest. You have to seat yourself, read the menu on the chalk wall, go up to the counter, order food, and then they bring food to you.  None of this was spelled out, and so most patrons entered with puzzled looks on their faces.  \"Do I seat myself or do I wait for a host?  Do I wait by the counter for my food or will they bring it to me?\"  A simple fix would be to add some signage.\n\nMy experience at Alchemy wasn't perfect, but still pleasant.  These types of cafes are rare in Markham, and so I've given them more leeway.  \n\nSuggestions for improvement: \n1) Lease that whole abandoned strip plaza and knock down some walls, increase seating, profit. \n2) Post some signage indicating that patrons should seat themselves.  Better yet, hire a host to seat patrons and provide menus.  They could capitalize on the tips and provide a better service.\n\nJust as alchemists in the ancient medieval and Renaissance periods strived to perfect their chemistry, so too should Alchemy Coffee in their serving of brunch.
640	Everyone loves a round ass. A little junk in the trunk is awesome, and wonderful and if I were a dude you would definitely ping me as an ass man. If your wondering why my ass is getting rounder, Mojo is your answer.. and worth every assrounding calorie I might add!\n\nMojo on Mill is literally, a 23 second walk from my office, and this my fellow Yelpers, is one of the most wonderful things in the universe. I come here, secretly, at least 2 times a week. Usually more. \n\nI love the cleanliness of this place most of all. The fact that over 200+ grubby sweaty college students and corporate whores alike can stumble in from the dirty streets of Tempe all day long and not have a smudge or single drip of yogurt on the floor is spectacular. They always have my favorite flavors, which are always the fruity ones, Pomegranate especially, and they always have my favorite toppings, which are also, always the fruity ones. I'm not just talking Maraschino cherries in sugary syrup or canned Pineapple, i'm talking freshly cut strawberries, just picked blackberries and blueberries and raspberries that will send your taste buds into a frenzy. F-ing Delicious. \n\nThe kids that work here are little smiling dream boats, that never fail to brighten my mood, and the selection is just, perfect.. no one is left out, vegans, lactose intolerants, dieters, fatasses.. there is something for everyone. They also do the secret word of the day on Twitter, for 50% off your purchase, and how badassical is that?\n\nI love you Mojo, not just because you provide me with a tasty little get-a-way from work, but everything about you.. especially what you are doing to my ass.
641	I originally started in the other Family Vetcare in Ahwatukee, but swapped to here when I discovered there was one closer to the house.\n\nEven my cousin ended up taking her extremely hissy pissy cat here and there no problems - she was extremely happy with how they treated Princess Hissy. He's a very troubled cat.\n\nI take Rex here because it's close to the house and he loves the vets...and the vets love him.\n\nMy only complaint is that they don't have grooming services here for him. Boo!\n\nThe newer one in Ahwahtukee is actually like...I don't know? The mothership? It's all super shiny and brand new, but the service in both places are excellent.
642	Watching movies like it's my job!\n\nI like it here. I bring my dates, I bring my brosephs, and sometimes I just bring myself because look at this face. I'm cute! And ladies... I'm single. Meow!\n\nAnyways, the seats are comfy, the bathrooms are clean, and I like the popcorn. What more can be said?
643	Great makeup artist! Amanda did my makeup awhile back for a photo shoot and did a beautiful job. I had the pleasure of witnessing several other ladies who also had their makeup done and everyone was stunning. She is very personable and makes you feel comfortable. I highly recommend Amanda.
644	This nail salon is probably one of the best ones I've ever been to! I had a mani\/pedi done there today and the customer service was spectacular! Everyone there is so kind and the place is very clean; I definitely have no fear of getting fungus on my nails because it's so clean. I also had my eyebrows waxed too and they did a wonderful job shaping it up!
645	My only experience here was in February of 2016 when I went with some friends to see Steel Panther. The venue itself is fine. It's rather small and cozy. The sound is pretty good as well considering we were seeing a band like Steel Panther. There are two levels and both levels have a bar. We sat in the upper level in a \"private\" booth and it was perfect. \n\nIts location is good in terms of being in the heart of Old Town but parking sucks. If you are considering seeing a band you like here, I say go for it!
646	I thought the reviews were too good to be true but it lived up to its expectations! It's almost like boiling crab but the sauce is slightly different and the menu has more items here. \n\nIt wasn't busy at all on a Sunday lunch and I honestly hope it's doesn't get busy like boiling crab. \n\nThey have combos here to choose from and it's pretty reasonably priced. My boyfriend and I decided to do al la crate because I can literally eat 3 lbs of crawfish to myself and the combo didn't let you pick two of the same seafood. \n\nI ordered 3 lbs of crawfish and a Dungeness! We got the level spicy and It's honestly not THAT spicy if you can take heat. Im going to get smokin next time. The crawfish was pretty good frozen and they cooked my boyfriends crab perfect! When you cracked the shell, the meat still kept its shape! \n\nThe sauce is really rich and buttery too! It's less oily than boiling crab which is a plus for me. Oh and the side of rice is pretty big. So I suggest you share it between two people. \n\nWe also ordered calamari and it was okay. It was a little too salty for me and the meat was little. \n\nOther than that, I love this place! A great new addition to Vegas.
647	We used them at my parents house last week and I have to say it was the worst food I ever had prepared by someone else..I think I'm even sick still from it. Let's just say I've been in the bathroom quite a bit the last few days... The two entrees were horrible. Tasteless green chili macaroni and some lasagna concoction that tasted like it was cooked 7 hours before it was served to us. Thanks but I literally have to run to the toilet...
648	This place is awesome!! The food is amazing. I recommend the steak with rajas and the shrimp fajitas. Drinks are nice and strong. Save room for some sopapillas at the end!!! Omar was our excellent server!!!
649	J's has been around for a long time and the reason is simple --- customer service. J and the staff have a code --- If something is wrong, make it right.  I am just one of many, many loyal customers of J's ---- Keep up the good work!!!
650	Love the environment, service and food. Went for brunch and stayed for the after party. Brunch was great, I tried the mimosas, ceasar and the mojitos. Their eggs Florentine was great, the potatoes were a little over cooked but regardless I thoroughly enjoyed. The party was good, VERY crowded, but good!
651	My friend received a giveaway on Instagram for 2, so we didn't have to pay for the rolled ice cream. We came here on a Thursday afternoon and there was no customer before us so we didn't have to wait to be served. \n\nI ordered the Thai Milk Tea ice cream and my friend ordered Nuts for You. I like how we can see how they're preparing our desserts. When I saw the menu and the price, I thought that the ice cream rolls were overpriced, but the amount we get is actually worth it and quite filling! Both ice creams we ordered were yummy and we really enjoyed it.\n\nI will definitely come back to try other flavours! \n\nService: 4 5\/5\nFood\/taste: 5\/5\nPrice: 4.5\/5\nCleanliness: 4\/5
652	Since my canine friend Harley can't write reviews, I'll share my experiences with PetSmart instead. This is my neighborhood location and I feel very lucky that it is! The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive to Harley and me. Although PetSmart is a chain, I don't feel like it is when I visit this location. The staff knows Harley and welcomes him every time we visit. \n\nHarley spends several nights in the doggie hotel and I'm never worried about how he'll be treated. The staff is so sweet to Harley and when I pick him up with a wagging tail and doggie smile on his face, I know he was in good hands. Just recently, I had to leave him for an extended period of time but they offered play time, day care and extra treatment that ensured me Harley was not be forgotten in a cage. \n\nThe grooming department staff at PetSmart are my heroes in life. Harley grows his curly locks frequently but whenever I bring him in to be groomed, he looses his chewbacca look and it's done in an incredibly efficient manner. \n\nI have yet to do the actual training classes at PetSmart, but while I was out of town one time, I purchased training sessions for Harley while he stayed at the hotel. I came back to a much more well-behaved dog and they left me extensive notes and offered to walk me through the training in person as well. \n\nI've already written and raved in a previous review about the fabulous in-house vet, Bandfield (see Banfield review), And of course, PetSmart has all my doggie needs like food, toys and treats. They have great sales as well so keep an eye on the sale rack. \n\nThanks PetSmart for keeping Harley happy, healthy and handsome!
653	Yelper reviews prompted me to go here.  This is a cute bakery with a good selection of baked goods.  The gal at the register was very sweet.\n\nAfter spending $27 on 8 items, I have to say, they were okay, a little bland on a few of their goods.  \n\nWe tried: \nCranberry Cookies (surprisingly good. Think shortbread cookie.)\nAlmond Cookies (flavorful and crisp, lots of almonds)\nChoco Almond Cookies (bland, missing something)\nHoney Bread (bland)\nBanana Sponge Cake (expecting banana flavor or creme filling, kinda dry)\nBread Rolls (what you expect a roll to be)\nCustard Pastry (custard tasted like sweet scrambled egg, eww)\nChocolate Cake Creme (bland, missing something)\n\nWe'll be back to try other things.
654	I really enjoy the miserable and rude staff, it's such a nice and refreshing contrast to the usual polite and kind customer service I receive at most other places I shop.  \n\nI plan on remortgaging my house so that I can continue to shop here and pay top dollar for average products!\n\nKeep up the mediocre work! :)
655	The night I was there there were way too many sloppy-fall-down-drunks and the crowd looked \"ridden hard and put away wet\". \n\nIt was like amateur hour at the Roxbury.
656	This place is worthless . office manager is brainless and incompetent. I doctor praggit is the only person around here that is concerned about the patients treatment .
657	I'm Vietnamese and I have to admit, this place is pretty good. Been living in the area for 14+ years and haven't found a restaurant that has decent authentic Vietnamese food until this place opened recently. This is now my go to place for pho and bun bo hue. Now I don't have to go downtown anymore.
658	Uninspiring decor so we opted to take out. Admittedly we stopped before heading home after driving 500 miles in an ice storm for half the trip. Tired? Yes. Hungry? Definitely. \n\nTwo of us split a sampler with 2 sides. While the ribs and pulled pork were okay, I did enjoy the brisket. Very tasty. I liked the mustardy gold sauce. The hot BBQ sauce was just okay. I'll give it credit for at least being hot without an extract flavor that just kills many hot sauces. The vinegar slaw was good and the other side was so memorable that I can't remember what it was. Mashed potatoes maybe? \n\nPet peeve of mine: serving uninspiring bread. I'm never sure why places provide such pedestrian rolls. They're cheap, not hard to make and add so much. Yes, they had the obligatory meh roll. Too bad.\n\nI'll give positive marks to the cashier. Though her perkiness bordered on equaling the daughter from The Middle, she was very friendly and offered advice.\n\nSeemed a bit pricey for what we got. If I go again, I'll just get the brisket.

You close The Café in The Hotel cavalierly making Raffles a place to avoid because of the crowds. The reception at Raffles, one Blanca, who for me, represents your uncaring hotel, is as unwelcoming and unprofessional as possible.  You have too many people looking to say no to guests. Your valet service is obnoxious. Do they really work on tips? Some of your phone people are intimidating and silly. When I asked for a newspaper delivery one asked if I had a butler. I told her I left him home because I was going to a luxury hotel. Your \"resort fee\" says it includes a newspaper; it does nor say it is the free USA Today and one has to pick it up. PETTY. Getting amenities and things done by your housekeepers is a challenge. Too much of The Hotel's service is handled by Mandalay Bay. Not a good thing. \n\nI save the best for last. I told the front desk on Monday the 19th to check me out Tuesday morning. I got my bill, which was wrong on Tuesday at 2 PM and requested a bill be e-mailed. Being forewarned on just how terribly inefficient, untrained and cavalier your people are I checked my bill today.  Of course, you charged for Tuesday night and made some other overcharges. Your Margaret in unaccounts immediately informed me to prove I checked out Monday. After a long harangue by me she was willing to credit Tuesday. She still could not or would not tell me what the final total was . After spending about 30 minutes with Margaret teaching her arithmetic 101 she digfned to transfer me to her SUPERVISOR,after another 5 minutes I was transferred to Christina who was going to transfer me to the front desk. Remember them ? The people who messed up my incredibly complex checkout. I was not about to spend any more time with the inmates of your asylum. I will deal with your lame , cavalier inefficiency through AMEX. \n\nI have been in hundreds of 4 and 5 star hotels in my life. Never have I been subjected to one as totally customer unfriendly as yours. Strong letter to follow.\n\nArthur L. Finn
660	My husband and I are on vacation in AZ all the way from Maine. During our trip my diamond fell off my wedding ring into my hand. Since it was purchased at Kay Jewelers in Maine we took it to the Arizona Mills location to see what we could do. Carmen was excellent!  She was so friendly and helpful and we enjoyed chatting with her while we were there. Although there isn't time to get my ring repaired here, she wrapped my ring up so it will stay safe until we return home and even took the time to look up our information in the computer and print out our warranty info so that we will be prepared when we go into our home store!  She went above and beyond!  Thank you Carmen!  I really appreciate it!
661	Good food, I always like free chips and salsa and they even one up that by bringing warm free bean dip, my favorite. There was a group of us, and one guy got the chimichanga and he said it was the best he has ever eaten. I got tacos and while they were good, they definitely weren't anything to rave about. Another friend got the fajitas and he said the same thing. Nothing to overly rave about. All in all, a great place with decent prices to eat mexican food. No complaints, but nothing blows us outta the water.
662	Their showroom is massive. You could spend half a day just walking around and looking at everything. Their furniture may not be high quality, but it is affordable. And, looking to decorate my kid's room, we found several things here that he loved. I also found plenty of stuff to buy for myself -- kitchen utensils, trays, lights, etc.\n\nAs for the food, it's mediocre at best located in a cafeteria setting. Their rich, dense Chocolate Conspiracy cake ($2.99) was the best thing we tried. The Swedish meatballs ($4.99) weren't nearly as good as I remember from my childhood. The kids chicken tenders ($1.29) were a step above typical fast food fare. The Swedish apple cake ($2.49) was short on apples heavy on the sugary filling. It was a really cheap meal for me and my kid and the quality matched the price. \n\n2 Stars for the food, 4 for the inexpensive furniture.
663	Great food, so glad they are back in business. Please bring back the balsamic salad dressing!!!
664	This is amazing gelato! You have to come and try it! It's all fresh and NATURAL ingredients, plus they have milkshakes now that are by far the best I've had. You absolutely need to head over to the MacarOn Cafe!
665	Forgive me Father, for I have sinned...I think. \n\nWell, I'm not sure where sampling beers on a Sunday afternoon at a micro-brew located in a former Catholic church necessarily fits in the whole scheme of things, but I felt I was violating some type of rule, code or commandment. Regardless, Church Brew Works had been at the top of my Pittsburgh to-do list since I heard about it last summer and I was checking it out, regardless.\n\nSince I've never tried their beer before, I decided to order the sampler, consisting of eight different 5oz brews for $12.75. But after doing some quick math, I realized I needed to address my growling stomach first to avoid any unintentional purge-atory (rim shot). After looking through the variety of menu options, I decided on the lunch version of the Garden Plum Tomato brick-oven pizza. Aside from being crispy and tasty, it turned out to be the perfect size for one person.\n\nAnyway, back to the beer. Sorry. There were four year-round samples consisting of Celestial Gold, Pious Monk Dunkle (+), Blast Furnace Stout (+) and Pipe Organ Pale Ale. There were also four seasonal brews consisting of Red Nebyllek, Coffee Dunkel (+), Thunder Hop and Oktoberfest (+). It was a great mix of all different types: light, dark and everything in between.\n\nRegarding the interior, I love how they've kept the original structure, including the pews, fixtures and woodwork, mostly the same. Plus, you can walk up center aisle, which divides two separate dining areas, to the front of the church where large, copper brew tanks sit on the front altar. It's sort of weird, yet cool, to see.\n\nSpending lunch here was a fun and pleasant experience and I was glad to see so many other people \"congregating\" here as well. Okay, okay, I'm done.\n\n(+) = liked
666	We were enjoying the street vendors at the South Asian Festival today when suddenly the skies opened up and we were in a monsoon.  Lahore was just too far in the insane rain, so we we sought refuge from the downpour in Gautama.  \n\nI am really really sorry we did.\n\nFirst disappointment...a buffet.  Never my choice of dining experiences, but we didn't notice that until we'd already been seated.  Oh well; could be worse. And it was.\n\nSecond disappointment...the buffet.  Could it be any smaller?  Where is this nice selection?\n\nThird disappointment...the food from the buffet.  As the rain water flooded the streets outside, the chicken dishes too were floating in an ocean of sauce.  The rice had frozen veggies in it - the same kind my parents use in the food they make for their dogs.  The dal, normally one of my favourites, was absolutely flavorless and the palak paneer, well let's just say I saw absolutely no evidence of paneer. But I did find lots of gristle in my chicken. Obviously, I did not go back for seconds.\n\nThe fourth and final disappointment...the service.  The server asked if we wanted another round of Kingfishers.  We said no.  He proceeded to bring two more when we were at the buffet.  We called him over and we reminded him that we said no.  He rolled his eyes, but took them away. \n\nWe waited for an eternity after asking for the bill.  Our original server came over and said \"Why are you still sitting here? Do you want the cheque?\"  Rude and duh...yes.  When the bill came, naturally we were charged for the two Kingfishers we sent back.  When we pointed out this error to him, he began arguing with us that we ordered them and it was our fault.  \n\nI will NEVER EVER come back here!
667	It's anniversary time and you want to take that special lady somewhere special with a dope patio and yummy cocktails.  Where do you go?  Well The Harbord Room is the ticket!  This place is great from the cool NYC style decor, to the super friendly and polite hostess working the front.  I wasn't able to book a reservation, but before I freaked out and thought of the prospect of ruining our anniversary, the friendly hostess told me to come grab a seat by the bar and we could have dinner there or wait for a patio seat.  Phew, that works for me!\n\nThe patio looked awesome, almost as if you were having dinner at a friends backyard.  We ordered the Charcuterie Board, Dry Aged Beef Burger and Red Curry Pork Belly.  We also grabbed a few drinks as well, including those outlandish pineapple goblet cocktails meant for two or more people to share.  Food is top of the line and I cleaned up every last crumb on my wooden plates.  Cocktails and drinks were prepared with the love and care of an experienced bartender, which is good to know considering the drink prices are up there.\n\nService was top notch and what you would expect from a place like this.  You're ordering a $20, burger not a $1.49 extra value pick!  Overall a great experience and I'm sure we'll definitely be back for more.  Make sure to order one of the giant pineapple cocktails to share, they're outlandish and people with stare with envy!  Forget Marvins Room and hit up dat Harbord Room.
668	My good friend decided that a massage was something that I deserved after such a hectic work week so he took me here.\n\nPrice: $22 an hour?! What a steal. The only time I've ever seen a better price was in California. We did some 75 minute package that I can't for the life of me recall the price. I can't imagine it being anything outrageous though. \n\nI wasn't asked whether I preferred a  male or female masseuse since they were low on staff but that is fine, I am pretty easy going. We were placed in a semi private room with two massage chairs which was very much appreciated.\n\nOne of the most relaxing massages I've received. The guy that I had was very perceptive to how much pressure I could handle. 20 minutes into the massage I fell asleep, I didn't wake up until they needed me to flip over, which was when it got a little strange for a bit. I ended up getting a butt massage which was somewhat just awkward for me but it didn't last too long thank goodness. I guess that was my fault also for not mentioning that I didn't want that.\n\nOverall:\nI will definitely be back. Service was great, price and value is unbelievable, and overall I am very impressed.
669	I don't want to admit it but I like the cheese pizza here.  \n\nIt's a hole in the wall.  Guy takes money and handles pizza...no hand washing in between.\n\nDo you remember that episode of Seinfeld when Jerry wants to know if there are any homes to rent in Tuscany because The Maestro (Bob Cobb) says there are no vacancies.  Jerry doesn't want to rent a home, but he just wants to know if there are any available because he can't see how there are NO homes to rent.  \n\nJerry:  Are there any homes to rent?\n\nGuy: Si, Si\n\nJerry: I'm not looking to rent.  I just want to know if there are any available to rent.\n\nGuy: Si, this one!\n\nSo while I wasn't looking for a house to rent at Mare Pizza, my inquiry about fresh slices went a little like this.\n\nMe:  Do you have any hot slices coming out of the oven soon?\n\nGuy: (points to sign with different types of slices available)\n\nMe: Do you have any coming out fresh?\n\nGuy: (points to sign again)\n\nMe: I'll just have a cheese slice\n\nGuy opens the oven and reveals a pizza pre sliced with different slices on it.\n\nThe short end is:\n\nPizza was pretty good.  It wasn't dry being in the oven that long so I guess it was fresh.\n\nIt actually reminds me of a pizza place in Dufferin Mall when I was a kid (This is before the big food court renovation).
670	Double Wide, you've impressed me. You've been around for years, a South Side staple that appeals to a wide audience, and I always rave about your frozen mojitos. Now, I get to sing your praises for your IMMENSE vegan\/vegetarian food offerings.\n\nFirst of all, the Double Wide has an enormous menu to begin with, and they offer two full pages of veg options. Every item is clearly marked whether it's vegan or vegetarian, and there is just SO MUCH. Most veg-friendly restaurants in the city offer a few options, but it's nothing like what Double Wide has got going on.\n\nSecond, the seitan wings. Oh god, yes. THESE are the best wings in the city and as close to the real thing as you can get. What sets their wings apart is the crispiness and the delicious sauces. My only very small complaint is I would love to see a vegan blue cheese or ranch dressing to accompany these delicious bundles. I've also had the seitan gyro twice, and it never disappoints.\n\nDouble Wide boasts a huge draft list, offers growlers and pints to go (it's called a meowler, how cute is that?), and still serves the best frozen drink in town. And they have a dog-friendly patio section, what more could you ask for?
671	Came here for the Queen concert in late June (phenomenal concert btw, but that's a side note).  We had floor seats, so the entrance process was a little bit different from other stadiums I've been to, and felt a bit more \"underground\", which meant I didn't really get to experience anything the stadium had to offer - concessions etc.  \n\nEntering was pretty easy though, again, I believe this was somewhat due to our phenomenal seats, and there wasn't really a line or anything.  I think I was in my seat within 10 minutes of being dropped off by the limo.  \n\nLayout of the stadium seemed decent and I believe even those way up high had a decent view and sound.
672	I don't know why this isn't the cathedral of Phoenix. I always thought it was but then find out it wasn't. Beautiful old church though
673	Very professional and fast. \n\nTook my call when I called to inquire and was available to copy immediately. I came by Paul's house just east Davisville station. I waited outside and he took literally 2 minutes to make my copy for $50 and the fob works great at my apartment! \n\nI had a card fob to copy and he gave me a keychain fob copy which is much more convenient and handy for me than the card fob. \n\nThe reason I needed a fob copy was because I am not currently on my boyfriend's lease and my building will not give out a fob unless I was added as a occupant. They did not approve the occupant application as we just moved in, they said to try back in a few months after we have proved ourselves as trustworthy tenants - but in the meantime I don't have a fob to enter the lobby!\n\nWould definitely recommend to anyone looking to make a fob copy as there aren't very many fob copy services available in Toronto! \n\nThanks so much FobToronto!
674	$13.50 to play half the course with a golf cart.  That's a pretty good deal, and you can bring your own cooler filled with booze!  I never liked golfing, but I took on this course with two girlfriends.  We aren't great golfers, but this course is fun to play on and not intimidating at all.  The course is quite pretty too, set against the backdrop of the Papago mountains.  I thoroughly enjoyed attempting to golf while getting drunk.  Next time I'm bringing cigars, then I'll feel like a true golfer.
675	Having been to japan I've tasted a lot of different kinds of ramen, so I came here with pretty low expectations. Of course you can't compare to Japan's, however Futobuta's ramen was alright. When I came my broth although deep in flavor, was not salty enough. Also they gave me siracha as a side to add to my ramen, no Chile oil, no sesame oil, or seasoning. For 14 dollars, I definitely did not get my money's worth in my opinion. The atmosphere is nice and it has a hipster-ish feel to the place, but ramen wise, I'll pass.
676	Best breakfast in Vegas! We used to go often when we lived around the corner, now go every trip home to visit! Get the Sunrise Mountain with sausage for breakfast! So good!!! We also picked up their potatoe seasoning and use it at home often.
677	Love their bread with light olive oil!\nGrilled octopus was made perfectly and remained soft and delicate. Their tomatoes   Greek salad was so addictive. Tomatoes were so flavorful!!
678	Loryann is talented, professional and all-around wonderful. She uses awesome tools, knowledgeable hands and techniques, fine products, and understands my aging skin needs are more than skin deep!  Best face massage ever. Highly recommend.
679	On vacation in Henderson, at Green Valley, this was our third day eating here at China Tango. We tried the Cashew Chicken today, yesterday was the General Chicken, the day before I had Spicy Garlic Chicken and my husband had Mongolian Beef. The food was delicious. The portions were more than generous. The service was fast and on top of drink refills. They were eveything we like in a quick lunch.
680	Can I be honest? I love that huge escalator ride. I dare not walk up it. I enjoy every moment of it (unless I am late for my show). It helps to bring the whole movie-going experience to epic proportions. \n\nThis theatre always has the 3D movies - there's never a long lineup to get your tickets or food, because its well staffed. I find the theatres pretty clean and the shows always start on time. \n\nI could review the Burger King at this location seperately - as they've had to inform me \"we are out of burgers\" a number of times. Well, what exactly are they the King of then? That is just as irritating as when Popeye's runs out of chicken or biscuits. \n\nThis is really your average theater - but with IMAX Digital 3-D, good service, and a really big-ass escalator. I approve.
681	I went to the Metro Center location today. I have been thinking about possibly bringing a new addition into my rescued family. However, it bothered me a lot that in order to even pet or meet any of the animals, I had to fill out a complete questionnaire with all of my personal information. I understand that is necessary if you are going to adopt an animal, but just to look at one or pet one? \n\nI felt very uncomfortable being forced to share my personal information when I was basically window shopping. I know they are sweet little animals- don't get me wrong, but I would not adopt on the spot- I would have FIRST meet the dog, 2nd pet the dog and get to know the dog a little bit, THIRD- go home and think it over- Only then would I be ready to adopt and ONLY THEN would all my personal information, including my address, phone number, email, financial and home etc. (all the info they required in order for me to PET a dog)- only then would all that personal information be necessary.\n\nIf it's a matter of fear for the animal or theft- I will gladly hand over my ID or sign a disclaimer- but it's incredibly intrusive to require I provide all of my personal information, NOT to ADOPT the dog, but to PET it.\n\nI am a bit irritated, because I think this intrusive requirement in order to meet\/pet a dog is off putting and less animals are likely to find good homes. I know for me, I left- and the staff didn't care at all- in fact both of the women showed dismissive and apathetic attitudes. They could care less that I was leaving. \n\nThe location looked clean, but the smell in there was awful- the urine and ammonia actually made me a bit sick feeling at first, but I was able to get used to it the longer I was in there. They also had animals mislabeled. For example there was a terrier and the sign said he was a chihuahua... A couple windows said the age was unknown, but they guessed the dogs to be exactly 2 years 10 months an 17 days... What a coincidence? How often does more than one dog meet that exact aging? Maybe there is a backstory somewhere- I bet if they had nice and friendly workers in there- maybe someone might have shared it.\n\nI have decided, I will go to the Human Society when the time comes- Not only am I allowed to pet a dog, meet a dog and take a dog around on a leash- I don't have to provide every detail of my personal life until I am actually ready to adopt an animal.\n\nJust an FYI, I have a home, a great job, a 8000 sq. ft. lot. 2 rescues already- I am willing and able to not only provide for an animal and give one a great home, but also ensure it gets lots of exercise and will have a life full of love and fun times! \n\nI'm disappointed by this experience- also, the adoption fees were steep. Many dogs were listed in the $300 and up range. It's not a matter of not being able to afford it, I was just very surprised as I have never seen prices like that with a rescue organization before.
682	My husband had settled in for the night at a poker table at the Bellagio, and since we were staying at Paris, I decided to go to the 10:30 show at Ballys.  I was sitting in the front row, of the back section, but felt a little cramped, so I asked the usher if I could move back to one of the empty rows, she said sure.  I was glad I did.  I had somehow forgotten that it was topless, so I felt a little akward when I saw all the boobs, but not nearly as bad as when the guys came out in thongs.  Those boys are either really well endowed or someone stuffed a large grapefruit down the front of the thong.  I got the laugh out loud giggles.  Overall the show was entertaining, the acts between the dance numbers were great.  The margarita I got on the way in was surprisingly great.
683	We first tried this buffet for fathers day. We got through the 1hour long line to miss the lunch\/dinner cut off time by ONE minute! Now we weren't even sure where we were gonna go and hubby chose The Buffet last minute. We were expecting dinner prices but once we saw the sign it was lunch still it was meant to be! But like I said we were next to pay and the clock changed and so did the prices :( the food took FOREVER to change from brunch to dinner. I was irritated that an hour after we were sat they were not done switching over....we left a lil angry and hungry. We payed so much and had to wait to even eat! \nFast forward to last week. My cousins come into town stay at the Bellagio and invite us out to the buffet because they had line passes. We were a lil nervous but we made sure to go at 6pm so dinner would be in full swing! And I'm so glad we gave it another go!! The food was delicious! The crab is already cut for you the prepared salads were tasty! Their prime rib melted in my mouth!! I couldn't stop eating. It's not a terribly large buffet but what they offer is worth it. Oh and if you order orange juice it's the good stuff, not fresh squeezed, but not the crap from a machine like places usually have. And their hot tea was to die for!!! Visit this buffet it's worth it!
684	I thoroughly enjoy coming to True Food. I like all of the Fox restaurants and this is no exception. The open concept, great vibes, culture, and the food is always fresh and really good. \n\nI recently got the grilled chicken salad with the champagne dressing and it was very tasty. And I don't think I have ever had anything bad here or not good. The food is always good. \n\nI guess my only qualm with True is the food is a tad over priced and it seems that the servers always try to up-sell on additional items. If I am already at $14 for some lettuce and protein I don't want to pay another $2-$3 for adding avocado. Prices seem steep for lunch and it was $75 for 3 people at lunch time with no liquor. I get it, everyone is trying to make a profit and True\/Fox has built the brand to I guess command it. Again nevertheless, I still had a great experience and always do. \n\nI know this may sound weird but I like how the bathrooms are and they have an open outdoor space to wash your hands. Yea it's weird but I do appreciate clean and updated bathrooms, it's all a reflection of the brand, meaning details. \n\nI will be back for sure and continue to try many other dishes.
685	Came here for dinner and loved the sushi here!  They use pretty ordinary fish for their rolls (tuna, salmon, eel, etc.), but they add a creative twist to it.  One of my favorites is their Ninja roll.  I believe it had eel, salmon, avocado, a minty leaf flavor, and a soy wrap.  Good portion size too with 8 pieces per roll at reasonable prices.
686	I wanted to try on a pair of shorts, so I walked around until I found the fitting room.  A little red sign says \"push\" for service.  Loving to push buttons I felt compelled by the power of Christ to oblige.  I waited for a while, and no one came.  So I pushed the button again.  As I stood just outside the fitting room door I decided to give the handle a nudge and lo and behold it opened.  By the time I was done trying on the shorts I came out of the fitting room and noticed that the button had stopped flashing, so I pushed it again because clearly it was just one of those dummy buttons where you push it and nothing really happens.  \n\nOnto the basketballs, I grabbed myself a standard Wilson B-ball and headed to the check out nearest the mall entrance.  Mr Hunkasuarus Rex was manning the check out, and while he was easy on the eyes his apparent lack of brain power did not cater well to my impatience.  He was waiting on some woman with a rugrat who had confounded him into a drooling stupor with her super mom multitasking abilities, all whilst the rugrat beat the counter with a cheese head hat.  \n\nI gave up and decided to try a different register near the exit to the outside.  There was a long line there.  The Dicks were out in full force here today.  This cashier looks up in mid-transaction and says \"does anyone need to make a purchase?\"  To which the dude in front of me holds up his merchandise confusedly.  Just what the hell are we doing in this line of hurry up and wait???  Dick must have not wanted to wait on me specifically because a few moments later he looked me in the eye and said \"there are other registers open that have no wait.\"  To which I said \"I ain't leaving buddy.\"  Secretly I knew that hunkasaurus Rex on the other side of the store was still tapping a Dick club card on his forehead waiting for an epiphany.  \n\nPart of their problem is that they have to try and sell you an insurance plan with every piece of equipment you buy, along with trying to get you to sign up for a club card so you too can be a Dick.  By the time I got through with my purchase it suddenly dawned on him to call for help.  He speaks into his mic head set \"can I get some help up here?   The line is pretty long.\"  To which I turn to see about 20 other highly annoyed faces waiting in line.\n\nI used to really like going here to see Dicks.  But their customer service has fallen below the acceptable level.  No one is on the floor to help you, yet they have cashiers who try to up sell the hell out of you.   What a bunch of dicks.
687	I stayed in Tower II - Widescreen remodeled room. It looks much nicer than the regular rooms. But the first thing we noticed was a blood stain on the sheet, which they quickly replaced after a call. The shower had very low water pressure and there was no tub. Also no fridge or microwave. The iron was messed up\/ no steam button. \n\nThe smell of the lobby is pretty bad. It smells more like dust and smoke than most of the other hotels. The crowd there is pretty ghetto. I wouldn't bring kids here but then again I wouldn't take kids to Vegas! They were arresting some cholo just a few doors down, escorting him out of the room.\n\nTo top it off, the front desk customer service lady wanted to charge us $25 for a one hour later check out... on a Sunday! Then she lied about being the manager when we asked to speak to the Manager. \n\nOn a positive note.. it's a good place on the strip if you want to stay on the South side. The bed was very comfy and the flat screen TV was cool. But who watches TV in Vegas?\n\nBottomline.. I won't stay there again.
688	I get it. Judge away. Yes, I was in Vegas and ate at Margaritaville - out of all the thousands of other restos. But the bride-to-be was in charge and wanted 'ritas and queso. \n\nI'd actually never been to Margaritaville. I will say that the \"Perfect Margarita\" was good - strong, pure lime juice, agave and semi-guilt free. The queso had nothing on real Texas queso, but the salsa was good. Other menu items weren't too intriguing - they have fish tacos but your only option is beer-battered. I settled on the grilled chicken which was pretty plain Jane. \n\nI will say the best part of the experience - other than the 'ritas and odd people-watching - was our service from Ryan L. He brought out the drinks fast - even one on the house as he noticed our bride was crying tears of joy - and even split our checks without our party even requesting that. (And that's the only restaurant in Vegas that did it. Not even the top-dollar restos would accommodate.)
689	The sushi here was alright, but I have definitely had better. 3 stars for the sushi and 1 more for how cheap it is.
690	WTF?\n\nJasmine's Favorite dish is apparently frozen vegetables, microwaved with canned beans, rice and chewy lamb. Wow... I'm not sure why would anyone go out for dinner if that's the grub they serve. Maybe they're better for lunch but for dinner, I don't recommend it.\n\nDessert did look delicious.
691	Spent Thanksgiving here and was just awestruck, I mean I cannot believe that I was that totally blown away in my entire life. It was not the food, it was not the service, it was specifically every single hostess that was in the place tonight. There is a level of hotness that I could not ever believe could be attained, this places surpassed it by leaps and bounds. Just walking in and seeing the first young lady was simply... WOW... then it was like they multiplied  at every turn. Jesus H. Christ, did they grow them specifically to do this job. OMFG, I drooled, legit drooled like I had not eaten in 5 years and someone put a piece of pie in front of me but would not let me touch it.\n\nThe service was really good to, not hostess level hot good, but our server was really on top of things and the rest of the wait staff was also very attentive. The old man seemed to enjoy his food as did I. Was it worth the cost, pretty close, but we are in a casino eatery, it of course is going to be expensive. I knew that coming in. The group of hostess ladies though... holy shit. It has been like 4 hours since we left and I still cannot get them out of my head. Just elegant, beautiful young ladies. I cannot use enough terms to describe how amazing they looked. WOW!
692	Made an order over the phone for twelve guys. Guy tells me they don't deliver, but they'll make an exception for us because we are ordering so much food and are not far away. \n\nGuy gives us the total and we all throw our cash together and wait.\n\nFast forward one hour. I call back because the food hasn't arrived. Owner takes the call. \"Yeah I fired the guy who took your order. He was a lazy scoundrel and never worked hard anyway. We didn't make any food for you.\"\n\nBut that's not what bothers me. What bothers me is that no one called to tell us there wasn't going to be a delivery. Also, I'm sure no one got fired and the owner was just lying to me.\n\n#bebetter #overpromisedanddidnotdeliver
693	I love this place, great ambiance, good food. Large rolls worth every penny. The special rolls look like a work of art. \n\nI usually get the fire mountain it is by far my favourite roll. \n\nGreat place to take a date as it's private and decent spot.
694	Loved Mark our waiter\nLoved our dinner, the veal was devine\n\nWe will be back!!!
695	Okay, come on. It's 18 and over, yes it's going to be lame and cheesy, but hey, we don't go there because its classy and upscale. \n\nIt's a simple club. Dance floor in the middle, bar in the back, upstairs exclusively for the 21 and over crowd, and a couple of seating area's to the side. \n\nYeah, the crowd is a little \"ghetto\". Got a lot of skanks and wanna-be pimps, but hey, they're everywhere. The music is mostly the \"mainstream\" radio stuff that you'll find on 101.5, because they play the same music on that station that they play in the club on Friday nights. I can't complain too much about it. Gotta please the public, and right now, that's what's pleasing the majority of the public. \n\nThis place is fun, as long as you bring your own people. If you're going there to look for a hottie, you're bound to be disappointed. (Unless you like ghetto =] )
696	Deana has mad skills. Her work speaks for itself, just check out the photos. Add that she's super sweet and any time spent in her chair will be enjoyable. I was looking for a new stylist and she was recommended to me by a colleague. While always nerve wracking to try someone new I saw her Instagram page and was like woah she's good! I did have to wait a while to get in for my first appointment but I had a feeling she was worth the wait. And I was so right. I didn't leave her studio without being scheduled for my next visit.\n\nShe did color, balayage, gloss and a cut. The scalp massage when getting my hair washed was amazing. I couldn't be happier. She even took the time to help me work on my technique for creating waves with a curling iron. If you're ready to step up your hair game I definitely recommend going to see Deana!
697	I was pleasantly surprised at the County's facility for behavior health, I had been expecting something far worse.  I guess that's the trick: set your expectations very low and you'll never be disappointed.  \n\nThings you should know: visiting hours are from 2 pm - 7 pm.  I've been told 1:00 pm but that's not true, it's 2. You can bring in snacks, drinks and clothing.  No strings, laces, plastic bags or sharp objects.  The security guard takes you ID, asks you to walk through a metal detector and then gives you a locker for your personal items.  It's pretty painless but if you carry a gun, it's good to know which places have a metal detector.  \n\nThe nurses inside seem friendly and engaging towards the patients.  The patients appear to have plenty of activities to do.  I'm told that the food is good and chorizo, eggs, potatoes and tortillas are on the breakfast menu regularly.
698	This place is one of our favorites to visit,  but last night, I did have a meal that was not up to par. I ordered a BBQ pork sandwich. I didn't realize the one I ordered had cole slaw on it (my fault totally), but I like cole slaw so it wasn't a big problem. I don't like sloppy sandwiches so I decided to eat it with a fork. The problem was with the lack of actual meat. Most of it was fat.  so I ended up only eating maybe 1\/4 of my meal. Love beef & pork...hate fat! I have had several different meals here and this definitely won't stop me from coming back because they do BBQ right. But to the person prepping those sandwiches, come on man. Who wants a sandwich of fat? Really?!! You owe your employer to do your job and ensure what you are sending out to serve someone is up to par. That's why restaurants get bad reviews and lose business. Mgmt, don't lower your standards. I want to continue to patronize your restaurant,  but I expect better in a meal. I'll be back again...I hope the problem gets corrected so we don't have to find another place to go.
699	The perfect remedy to all the chaos endured on the Vegas strip.\n\nThis Starbucks is located in the food court of the Monte Carlo Resort and I will have to state, that for all caffeinated junkies needing to recuperate after spending the early wee morning hours on the strip, a good vat of coffee is only a few floors away via elevators.\n\nAll I can say is busy.  This spot is busy......there is a mini setup just for the 10+ customers in line and we sure did not mind waiting in it while shaking off headaches and sleepyhead syndromes.  My breve lattes were always served hot and quickly, thanks to the efficient staff taking orders and making the drinks.  I also found a lovely blueberry scone slathered with a blueberry glaze, something I have yet to find here in CA.  In addition, is it just me or did all the scones in California shrink overnight in response to the economic instability?  The scones here in NV are still thick and glorious in size.  \n\nThanks for making our 3:00 am flights of fancy a possibility, Starbucks!
700	Always love coming here. Bartenders are always great! Rebecca and Jessica make your day.
701	I've really come around to Paymon's. They actually have saganaki on the menu, which is something I just totally love. And their tzatziki and hummus is delicious. They also have great fries, gyros, pasta, etc. I wasn't much of a fan when I first came here a few years ago. But I've definitely grown to enjoy it. I actually opted for take out on my last visit. It was a large order, but it was prepared quickly and packaged perfectly. I think I've found my go-to mediterranean place.
702	This is one of the coolest places I have ever been.  They have every candy known to man, even candy that was popular decades ago.  This place brings me back to my childhood and I like going in there sometimes just to look around.  I never leave empty-handed.
703	My boyfriend debated about going here during our vacation and eventually made our way there out of boredom on our last night in LV. Small preamble: we are not drinkers at all and as a result do not enjoy terrible bar bands or drink tickets being shoved in our face by strangers, so if you enjoy those things my review may not reflect your experience.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that there was, in essence, a very expensive screensaver being displayed on the canopy, so that was underwhelming right away. Basically a low-definition looping series of ads. After walking a little bit I had been nearly trampled a dozen times by large groups of sloppy drunks; it was like 8:30, by the way. We walked still farther and passed by two separate bands playing Journey and Guns n Roses covers and their middle-aged drunken audience dancing awkwardly and swinging their drinks in people's faces in the middle of the walkway. After that we only walked far enough to get decent photos of the cowboy\/cowgirl neon signs and left.\n\nIncreased review from 1 star to 2 stars because the bus ride back and forth was interesting, and the hooker transaction we witnessed at the bus stop was hilarious. The FSE is basically a large-scale version of a gross Midwestern dive bar, so if that doesn't appeal to you, avoid.
704	Working in the dental field for the past 20 yrs...I was not satisfied with the first AND LAST visit. I called to make an appointment for my mother and verified that the insurance was accepted. Once I arrived, the front desk staff appeared uninterested and told us that they did not accept the insurance :(\nAfter discussing this matter a bit more...They agreed to accomplish an exam and x- Rays and we were told there's nothing more they can do because of the insurance. I attempted to call the Patient Advocate\/Customer Care Rep listed in the waiting area and it was simply a voicemail-That's how they do business?\nThe office is huge and only 1 young dentist works there. I find the \"Corporate Dental World\" is disconnected, poorly managed and poorly paid. Private Practice is the ONLY way to go. At Western Dental there is no accountability and I doubt the AAAHC has good things to say about that organization as well.
705	MY Family took me there for father's day. Everyone loved their food.  The service was great.\nThe curry shrimp was out this World!
706	There are plenty of sushi restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas, but if you're in the mood for something unique and different, try Sushi Samba.  It looks like a funky nightclub at first glance, but venture inside and you'll find a lively restaurant with an eclectic atmosphere and friendly service.  If you're looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, this probably isn't your place.\n\nStart out with a drink.  The sake list is long and distinguished, sure to satisfy even the most discerning sake drinker.  And if sake is not your thing, they have great signature drinks. Try the Yemenja (vodka, ginger liqueur, lemongrass and mint).\n\nTime to eat!  You'll discover the menu is just as eclectic as the ambience, fusing Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine.  If you want sushi, they have sushi.  Or if you prefer Brazilian BBQ, they have Churrasco.  But it's the smaller more distinct plates that make this place great.   The miso-glazed seabass skewers are a MUST, served with large kernel Peruvian corn, they're \"melt in your mouth\" good.  Also, the Samba Strip roll (lobster, mango, peanut curry) will knock your socks off.  One could return to this spot several times and still not try everything on the menu. In fact, I recommend bringing a large group of friends so that you can sample more of the many delights Sushi Samba has to offer.
707	As of 7\/11\/2018 Esurranty has had my Samsung S8 since September 2017 and has stopped responding to my inquires.  They have not returned my property.
708	Okay, so I wasn't super impressed, because even though I gave it 4 stars, the food I had was lackluster.\n\nThe ambiance is great, the service was great, I wish there was a TEENSY bit more wiggle room between certain tables, but that can be forgiven. \n\nMy blasphemous move was ordering the burger. It was good, but my friend ordered the Osso Bucco, and I will regret not ordering it until I go back.\n\n*Damn*
709	Beef Sandwich!  Beef Sandwich!  Beef Sandwich!  \n\nThis place has the best Beef \nSandwich west of Al's Beef in Chicago! The beef is tender, the gravy is nicely seasoned, and the bread is outstanding! \n\nPizza is a solid choice too. I haven't tried anything other than the pizza and the Beef Sandwich because I am so infatuated with...you guessed it...BEEF SANDWICH! \n\nSmall restaurant cranking out BIG food!\n\nBeef Sandwich! Get two. You'll be happy you ordered a second after finishing the first!\n\nRemember. \nBeef.\nSandwich.
710	Three times the charm to line up earlier. Ordered the egg, bacon and cheese sandwiches, honey buttermilk biscuit and salted chocolate chip cookie. All delicious I'm not a fan o salted sweeties but their cookie had a touch of it which is enough to taste the salt without overwhelming the sweet. I recommend this place.
711	A few months ago I went to Sona MedSpa to find out more about their services and boy did I learn a lot!\n\nSona has a procedure called coolsculpting that targets the fat cells in a specific area of the face, neck or body and cryogenically freezes them and causing them to die off! \n\nAfter studying the procedure, it seemed to be perfect for someone like me who has stubborn areas on my body that no matter how much I diet and exercise I do the small pockets of fat won't seem to go away! \n\nI wasn't interested in a costly surgical procedure, just something simple to help me along in my better body goal!  \n\nAfter doing my research on coolsculpting I found that there was no downtime, it's cost-effective, and only targets the areas that you need a little help with!  \n\nThree months later and I'm here at Sona for my coolsculpting treatment!  The office is very well maintained and clean. \n\nThe waiting areas are fully stocked with a variety of hot teas and ice cold water!  \n\nI was taken to the coolsculpting room within a few minutes!  Liz was the technician that did my treatment; she snapped a few photos and I was ready to begin! \n\nShe did two areas back to back and they were 60 minutes each. Liz explained every detail of what was going to happen and made sure I was comfortable.  \n\nOnce I had my phone and tablet by my side I was ready to go! She put a cool pad on and applied the machine, it was a little uncomfortable for about eight minutes then I was fine. The time flew by, and 60 minutes later I was done!  The second hour was even quicker than the first, but I was able to take care of some business and even book a flight while getting my coolsculpting treatment! \n\nAfter the treatment Liz massaged the areas, and shortly after I was on my way!  \n\nLiz explained that I will start to see results in a few days but the real difference will be revealed in about three to four months!  \n\nStay tuned for an update yelpers!
712	Went there to buy a car today. Walked around the lot for 20 mins and another 15 mins wandering around inside. So in 35 mins at a car dealership and not a single person even said hello!???
713	Second time and we still love it. Services is friendly and food delicious.  Pasta is made when you order. Happy hour 2-6 buy one beer and get a second one free. Will definitely be back.
714	They must be cutting back on their overhead while still charging you the same price. My so called \"Ultimate Double Chicken Bowl\" barely has any chicken in it all. My friends \"CHICKEN Burrito\" has a couple of scraps of chicken. If I pay for what I ordered, I expect it to be what I want. It's not rocket science nor gormet. GET IT RIGHT!!!!!
715	Whoever invented Sushi burritos is seriously a genius. That is all. Oh, and get the caterpillar burrito. You're welcome.
716	Peppermint is one of my favorite go-to restaurants close to home. They're relatively fast when ordering takeout. We usually order food for 3-5 people, and it's always very good. The quality of food doesn't differ between takeout and dine in, it's always delicious. I haven't been inside Peppermint for a while, but the interior has nice decorations and, from what I remember, the staff was always attentive and polite. Their Pad Thai (I think shrimp and chicken comes automatically) is my favorite thing on the menu, and I could probably eat the whole container in one sitting! The beef satay is also very good, well seasoned and gets a bonus point because it's on a stick, and who doesn't love things on sticks? This review is getting long, but Peppermint is so good that the deliciousness of their food can't be explained in words! Definitely try the pad thai, beef satay (the peanut sauce that comes with it is the best sauce I've ever tasted, and it goes well in the pad thai), and if you're in the mood for yummy hot food, try Peppermint!
717	We tried Green Pepper last week as our first taste of Korean food, and we were really happy with it.  We had kind of been putting off trying it for awhile, as it is the restaurant to replace our beloved Sweet Basil, but I'm so glad we finally checked it out!\n\nFirst of all, they have a small wine list, but you can also BYOB for a $7.50 corking fee.  I think this is the first Pittsburgh place we've seen that has both a wine list and a BYOB option, so we liked that.\n\nOur waitress was really helpful and informative.  I had a few questions about the menu, and she was really great with taking the time to answer each one.  She explained to us that the type of spice used in Korean cooking can sometimes feel spicier than it really is, because even the milder versions sometimes make you feel like your nose will run.  It was nice to have a heads-up about that (and the menu also lists if items are spicy or not).\n\nWe started with an order of the pork and kimchi steamed dumplings, which we really loved.  These were just perfectly done all around.\n\nWe each tried something different for our entrees.  All of the entrees (except the stews) come with miso soup, which is basically my favorite thing right now, so I really appreciated that.  Their miso is very basic, no tofu in it or anything, but super yummy.  The soup was served alongside our meals, which came in a fancy TV-dinner-like plate, with the little dividers for different menu items.\n\nI got the spicy pork, which was sooo good.  It was quite oniony, but the sauce was not overly heavy.  With the pork, you also get kimchi (think cold holobchi stuffed cabbage in terms of flavor), cold cellophane noodles, tempura-breaded zucchini, and steamed white rice.  The portions were sizeable but not huge, so I only had a little bit to take home with me.\n\nMy husband got the bibim bap, which can be served vegetarian or with ground beef.  He got the ground beef version, which comes in a pot with a variety of veggies and egg on top, and is served with kimchi, bean sprouts, and rice on the side.  Everything was quite hot, although not too spicy, and he was really pleased with the flavor. \n\nGreen Pepper doesn't offer any real desserts, but you get a cold cinammon tea with your meal in place of that.\n\nWe loved the atmosphere as well, very bright and welcoming.  After they close, you can apparently rent out their 'karaoke lounge' for parties (and during business hours, large groups can sit there).  The prices were a little higher than other restaurants in the same area, but they put a big emphasis on the healthy components of their meals, so it's worth it.\n\nI also give them points for their super cool silverware, including metallic reusable chopsticks.  The presentation of the meals was just lovely!\n\nWe went on a Saturday night, and it does appear to get crowded at times.  Fortunately, we had a short wait, but I would recommend going early if you stop in on the weekend.  Even if you have to wait a bit, the quality of the food is well worth it!
718	Service is a plus. The interior looks great. I've had the same server for both of the times that I've went so far. He goes over the menu for a brief 5-mins intro of their selections and categories. He speaks highly of their happy hour menu, quoting as \"one of the very best\" because they take their most popular items and make them cheaper for HH :0). \n\nI'll list all the dishes I've gotten on my 2 visits (all HH except for the fatty tuna) and what ones I wouldn't mind getting again. \n\nBeet Fries $5\n-- I'm not really a fan of beet fries so this did not stick out to me, but whatever the sauce is, that was pretty yum.\n\nSake Orenji $7\n-- Delish! I got it both times. There's a nice kick to it and I like the touch of the oranges with it.\n\nLipa Roll $7\n-- Pretty standard tasting in terms of a roll.\nNegihama Roll $5\n-- Yellowtail with scallions and that was pretty decent.\nNegitoro Roll $7\n-- Bluefin tuna toro with scallions. Decent.\nCrunchy spicy tuna hand roll $5\n-- Nothing special really. Might wanna add your own wasabi.\n\nChuka buns $7\n-- It's got pork belly, green apple, cilantro, jalapeno, shallots, black lime, and kimchee puree. It reminds me of the Great Bao buns and it's not too shabby, but I wouldn't be begging for it.\n\nKaraage $5\n-- Surprisingly decent. I guess I got used to the lame ones at those ramen places.\n\nGyu Sliders $7\n-- Double no. It was bland and tasted quite plain. I ended up dipping it in the sauce from the beet fries and that made it taste less bland, lol. Don't recommend this one personally.\n\nFatty Tuna Nigiri $5 apiece\n-- If you're the type that likes your fish-on-rice plain and simple, then you might not like how they add seasonings and shiz on it. I liked it, though :0).\n\nI'll be back to try a few of the other things that I missed from their Happy Hour menu as well as try some daily specials fish (sashimi) another time :0). Happy Hour is from 5-630pm and 11pm-2am daily. They open from 5pm-2am daily.
719	Is it weird to fall in love with a gas station? I mean I almost anticipate the next time I need a fill because it means I can go to one place to get everything done.\n\nIt's impressive enough that Centex gives price discounts on gasoline every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. However you add an excellent manual and automatic car wash to the mix and I am really feeling you. Add the option of convenient and accessible vacuum stations that really suck and you have my attention, particularly after the word suck. Heck it even has a propane station. \n\nThe line ups for gas are almost never an issue. The line for the automatic car wash is usually reasonable. The service is good. And the last time I got a free coffee with a fill up.\n\nThere really isn't more to say. My favourite gas station in the city hands down!
720	I had one of the worst experiences here!\nMy wife bought a groupon for two hour long massages. She had a really nice, tall black man who seemed to do great with her.\nBut I got this older white guy who clearly knew nothing about good customer service.\n\nHe started by asking me what issues I'd been having. I mentioned a couple of areas and he rudely interrupted and explained that I didn't pay full price (because I used groupon) so I'm basically only entitled to a quick rub. I told him I was just answering his question, and he just said that if I want a good quality massage, I can pay extra. I declined, simply because he had been so rude.\n\nThe massage was, I'll admit, really good. Apart from his VERY hairy arms grazing my back, it was enjoyable. But only because he eventually said \"I can tell you're in a lot of pain so I'll do a deep tissue, and you can just make up the difference in gratuity\". So unprofessional.\n\nMy massage finished a little before my wife so I waited in the lobby for her. During which time my masseuse- in front of the other masseuse and the receptionist- asked if I had \"forgotten anything\", meaning his tip. I hadn't, and I explained that I was waiting for my wife first. I had no idea what the massage had costed so I wanted to make sure I paid the appropriate percentage. But he came over and pressured me (even rubbed his thumb into his palm indicating he meant money). So I just gave him a $20 to make him leave. And leave he did. Didn't even say goodbye.\n\nLiterally the opposite of a relaxing experience. Absolutely horrible.
721	I have been here several times and not once have I been disappointed. I highly recommend the enchiladas as they only serve it on the weekends. The trout platter my mother order was tempting! I couldn't help but pick from her plate. I love the rustic environment and that they didn't ruin it with comfort; meaning it's picnic table-like seating, dirt and wood chips everywhere. Tons of places to take family pics (I actually had my pregnancy photo shoot here). I love that my daughter can walk around and play in the grass and get dirty. Always a favorite place of mine
722	I know all of this is opinions and everyone is entitled to their opinion- but, I don't know how anyone could give this place one star. \n\nI had an entire breakfast (eggs, potatoes, toast) for $1.99. Coffee was good and our service was good. Our food came so fast that I was literally shocked. The waitress apologized bc it was out and I was doing something - lol\n\nAll you can eat breakfast bar for $6.99 and their salad bar (on the breakfast bar) was huge!\n\nWe will be back!
723	Young and black, be prepared to feel discriminated against. I'm white, my best friend is black. We both walk in, and the general manager standing in front immediately asked my friend for her ID.\n\nNow. There's no problem being carded. We get carded all the time. What we do have a problem with is ONLY her being asked for an ID. Dave and Buster's age policy is under 18 must be accompanied by someone over 25. There's only a 4 year difference between us. Even if he thought she was under 18, there was no reason not to also card me to make sure I was the right age to accompany her. \n\nWhen someone gets carded in a group, you card the group. Especially if the only person you feel like carding is black and you explicitly tell their white friend they don't need their ID, but you'll look \"if it makes her feel better\". And then proceed to tell the 22 y\/o woman you just carded you're a \"pretty good judge of age\" trying to defend not carding her friend. Not to mention NONE of our other baby faced white friends who came in later got carded at all. When we expressed how rude it felt, we both felt the apology was pretty blown off and he threw us a couple $5 cards from the huge stack in his hand to get us out of his hair.
724	\"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\" Even the Mad Hatter didn't know the answer to that. \n\nThere are lots of reasons to stop by this cupcakery if you're in the Vegas area, even more if you love Lewis Carrol's Alice In Wonderland. The decor inside is a kitschy homage to the Mad Hatter's origins and really adorable. The paintings on the wall are really fantastic and I wish I knew who painted them. If you know, please drop this yelper a line because I'd love to get a painting for myself.  \n\nOn to the cupcakes...\n\nNow I'm pretty picky with cupcakes. I like them to be a perfect blend of cupcake size, flavor, frosting variety, and moistness. Mad Hatter gets pretty close and even takes it up a notch by having fillings as well.\n\nThere were three of us that wondered into this little cupcake shop, and it took us about 15 minutes to decided we would split a dozen. There are some signature cupcakes that they have which are aptly named (wascally wabbit, mad about banana, silk n' velvet, etc).\n\nI ended up choosing the wascally wabbit (i can't resist carrot cake), silk n' velvet (red velvet cake should come with a warning sign), and 2 custom made cupcakes. My first custom one was a banana cupcake with vanilla filling and banana rum frosting. It was a total mouthgasm! My second custom cupcake was the pumpkin cupcake with vanilla filling and cream cheese frosting. The pumpkin cupcake was had a fantastic spice flavor to it that wasn't overwhelming or too artificial. \n\nThe size of the cupcake was pretty standard. Nothing like the steroid ones offered at Sprinkles. The frosting is fairly sweat without being so obnoxious you feel like you're getting a cavity. Our cupcakes lasted two days in room temp without losing any of its moistness at all (not easy when you have the heat on in a hotel room). You also get the option to decorate the cupcake with assorted sprinkles and baubles. I chose both a hello kitty and cinderella ring.\n\nThe prices are pretty standard for a cupcake place. If you go with a couple of people you save a bit if you split a dozen or half a dozen.\n\nP.S. The answer that Lewis Carroll came up with was \"because Edgar Allen Poe wrote on both\" :)
725	I like this Saks! It is much better than Nordstrom in the same complex. It is also much better than the Saks in South Coast Plaza, people!!\n\nHandbag selection is pretty good here. There is both a Chanel and Louis Vuitton boutique. Prada has its own corner and there's always some nice Miu Miu bags on display. Coach collection is pretty sad, still.\n\nDecent shoe section as well- I saw 2 Chanel flats on sale today for $359!\n\nI also like the contemporary women's section, which is actually OUTSIDE of Saks proper on the 2nd floor. They have a pretty good selection of stuff (lotsa Juicy couture, designer jeans that take up entire corner, Theory, DVF, BCBG, etc). However, I don't see many good sales going on here. To me, the SA's have always been less than nice too.\n\nDo not be fooled- even though it's Cleveland and the economy is in the dump, I called the DAY OF a presale and was told everything was sold out! Gross.
726	If you need any bagels... please do not even attempt to visit this place. \n\nI'm not one to rip or walk out of a place but this place was horrible. I stood at the desk waiting to be served, however the manager was more interested in telling off her staff for poor service. \n\nBusiness lost
727	Scrrrrumptious cheesesteak sub\n\nWhat a pleasure to chow down on this juicy hot sub sandwich at the Las Vegas Airport yesterday for my combined lunch and dinner. For airport food, this was  better than your average sandwich!! I got wheat bread and it was soft and fresh. That was fantastic, because most of the time sandwich bread is a little or a lot stale at sandwich vendors anywhere, from my experiences! You can customize your sandwich fillings but I understand there were only two types of bread. I don't believe they have gluten-free options here. I always get pickles, tomatoes, and lettuce. The meat was of decent quality. There was so much of the meat that I had to scoop some out. Melted cheese and grilled onions, (plus grilled peppers? I can't recall) made this standard cheese steak sandwich complete. Big portion to split in 2 for many.\n\nThe place was well-staffed, which can be rare these days, eh? They were hard-working and communicated well. It was pretty crowded and you might have to wait a little while for them to make your hot sandwich, like I did. Open 24 hrs for flyers' convenience.
728	I've used this service around 10-12 times, and all of my experiences have been positive. The reason I prefer Lyft is that they're more reliable than the local cab services, courteous, and an overall better value.\n\nI've never once encountered any kind of sexual harassment or rude behavior in any way, shape, or form.Also, make sure to tip your driver!
729	I love, love, love this place. The food is incredibly tasty (especially the desserts, most of which are American: cake, torte, etc.). I've had the octal soup, vegetable egg rolls, all the curries,  the sweet and sour, and several monthly specials. I usually bring half my portion home (duh, to leave room for dessert), but my husband can polish off a whole order of beef fried rice. As to the spiciness levels, my brother and I once ordered our dishes at a 2 out of 3, and hubby got a good laugh watching us blowing our noses and wiping our eyes during the meal; from then on I've stuck to 1 out of 3! The staff are nice, the restaurant is clean, and it is never crowded or loud when we go. My only complaint is that it is often too cold for my taste. I am constantly recommending this place when I go out to eat with friends, because I don't want them to go out of business!
730	Went in for dinner tonight! I'm at the miserable point of too full because it was too good and I pigged out! \n\nWe were seated quickly in a nice booth. The booths are comfy and high so makes it a nice private intimate date night since you can't hear the people around you. Deanna was our server and she was very nice and stayed on top of our refills even though we were drinking water like it was going out of style. \n\nWe received a coupon in the mail so went in for the campfire feast for 2 that is an appetizer to share, 2 entrees, 4 sides, and dessert. We got the steakhouse nachos for appetizer that is incredible! Easily best nachos I have ever had with tons of toppings and meat. For the entrees we got tri tip and prime rib. Both were very good but I wish the au jus was better for my prime rib. That is typically the best part but it kinda tasted like a bland broth. But other than that everything was great. We were too full so we took a cheesecake home for dessert. \n\nOverall everything was super good! Food, service, and expert level full! Thank you black angus.
731	Great food, and delivery is a definite plus. The only tip I have for this business is to be more consumer friendly on the phone. They are very accurate in delivery time as well, and the food tastes really good and it reminds of me the Chinese restaurants that deliver in Chicago so that was also a big time plus for me.
732	Great, friendly service. This garage is owned by a pair of Armenian brothers who moved here from LA. They pretty much do everything but body work, including tires and oil changes. Came in when my car horn stopped working and they took care of it quickly and even had discounted parts on hand. Garage itself is clean, billing is straight forward, and they have an air-conditioned waiting area.\n\nThe two things that stood out most about this place is that they didn't round up the labor time and they didn't try to talk me into having additional work done. Note that this spot is closed on Sundays!
733	Probably THE best taco restaurant in town. All of the food tastes so fresh and they have a variety of food options. I never have a terrible visit. The employees are diverse but super sweet and helpful. It's got a beachy taco shop feel. I love it. They have the best hot sauce.
734	Great place and our waiter, Mr. Chocolate, was the best. My wife had the salmon and I had the adobo tacos. Very delicious
735	If I place a special order and the employee says that he will call me on Monday with the status, I expect a call. If I then call on Tuesday, and the same guy says he will call back on Wednesday, I again expect a call back. By Thursday with no word, it's pretty clear the place has blown me off.\n\nTwo stars because Menards has so many odds and ends at cheap prices -- from $1 throw rugs to $5 shower organizers and backpacks. They even carry name-brand food at discount prices. If only the workers weren't such donkeys...
736	About to lose my mind!  If you call, you will wait a LONG time, if you email, they tell you to call them, and if you chat, you will get something like this:\n\nkerry: at 11:30:46 \nI have an appointment on Tuesday from noon to 4. If they come at 4 and it takes 4 hours to install, I need to reschedule for an earlier time. Please advise.\nKevin W.: at 11:32:03\nIs the appointment to run a fiber line and install the modem or just to install the modem by itself?\nkerry: at 11:32:32 \ninstall Prism.\nkerry: at 11:32:38 \nCan you not see that on my account?\nkerry: at 11:33:51 \nHello\nKevin W.: at 11:33:58\nI cant see your account since I do not have it pulled up.

737	My Experience: Lucky I guess reading other reviews, but I drive right up to a parking space beside the building. However, I can see there could be a problem in parking. Especially, if you are not familiar with this area like me. \n\nThis coffee shop is small with inside seating as well as outside seating. It's completely comfortable once you find a seat inside. Outside Seating looks like it would be the place to sit at if the weather is nice and not hot like is right now on this late June day.\n\nThey do have WiFi but the password must be given to you at time of checkout. The password is something weird. The cashier wrote it down on a piece of napkin but I couldn't read her hand writing. So I took my IPhone 7 to her and she typed it in for me. She also did my MacBook Air. So, that's great customer service.\n\nHow Discovered:  I found this place because I use the Yelp App. I hit directions to take me here but it was wanting me to use a path that included a road closed. I believe it was 36th Street. So, I redirected my Yelp GPS and I finally got here on a Sunday morning just before noon. \n\nMenu item ordered:  I studied the Yelp listing, reviews and photos taken and decided on the toasted coconut frappe with whip cream. It's a cold sweet drink with caffeine that is perfect for this time of year in early Summer.  It was delicious and was so good that it was gone within a few minutes.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I really like this coffee shop. Yes, I would come back if in area. A lot of college age students were at this coffee shop while I was here.  Now, there are several colleges and Universities close by and it looks like when the students visit this business when they are not in class. Also, when looking outside down the street the visit other local establishments close by too.
738	As a die-hard meat eater this Steakhouse is not to be missed. The atmosphere is as super chill, and the service fast and friendly. The Steaks.....OMG so good.  The entrés are not to be missed and my scallops for an  appy were also perfectly cooked.  This place us a Gem and not to be missed.
739	The epitome of a greasy spoon diner, this place reminds me of Riverdale.  Complete with mini jukeboxes at every booth, you can sip on a milkshake that's been made through an olden-timey milkshake blender...though you probably wouldn't want to sit here for long: the place is has \"vintage charm\" (aka old tables, chairs, slightly dingy floors and walls). Food is run-of-the-mill: pancakes were mediocre, nothing too fancy, but prices are low and pretty much exactly what you'd expect of a typical diner.  There's really no particular draw to this place unless you're in the area and just looking for a quick breakfast, or you're dying to soak in some 1950's ~vibes~ while gushing about Buff Archie.
740	This place was great. For $35, you're provided the materials and instruction to paint a really nice painting. They have their offerings of pictures online, so you always know what you're coming in to paint, and what's available. You can provide your own drinks and snacks, which I thought was great. My only gripe is that they have no ice available, which is really something that can be easily fixed by buying a cheap ice machine. \n\nAndy was our instructor, and he was really nice and knowledgeable. I would definitely frequent if I was in the area.
741	If you want to get a feel for things - I mean really get a feel for the vibe of a place - check out the flea market.  No upscale arena here.  This is where everyone cleans out the closet, packs all their crap into the back of the pickup and sets up shop for the weekend.\n\nAlso note that when I say the back of the pickup, I am not talking about one of those forty-five thousand dollar jobs that you see lining the lots of the NASCAR hall of fame car dealerships.  No, these babies collectively were probably not worth that much when they were new, and that was half a century ago.  Now that they are pushing into antique territory, they might be appreciating in value if you were unable to see through the floorboards.\n\nMeanwhile, the boxes are unpacked, lined along rickety tables in a huge lot, and everyone swaps stuff.  Or at least talks about it.  I really cannot say if anything is sold here, because each week it looks like the same stuff on the tables.  Maybe someone buys, someone sells and the merchandise merely moves from one table to the next.\n\nThe real star here is the food.  Since the Sweet Union has been basically taken over by a hispanic contingent, you will find all manner of treats: Fresh churros, plantain chips, tacos, tamales, and all manner of goodies - many from food trucks that you are hard-pressed to find elsewhere.  You could even buy livestock and set up yourself next week (permits may be required, your mileage may vary).  My personal suggestion?  Try the churros if nothing else.  Mmm...
742	From previous reviews you will probably realize that this park is gorgeous, that it's lush, open, and a wonderful spot for both theatre and festivals. What no other review has told you yet though, is that Prince's Island Park is THE Pokémon destination. Lovely river walk with public art on every corner. Those public art pieces are now Pokéstops, baby! You can go for a romantic evening stroll along the river and also stock up on pokèballs at the same time. Nothing makes a date better better than getting your hands on a Jiggly Puff, if you know what I mean. And I mean a Jiggly Puff in the Pokémon sense and nothing more. Careful as the day turns to dusk there are pesky Zubats everywhere. I had an altercation with a large mouthed pointy toothed Golbat, but from what I hear, the situation is quite rare.\n\nSeriously though, these past few days there have been hundreds, if not thousands of people cruising this spot enjoying life, catching some rays, and catching 'em all.
743	I've been trying to turn my kids into bookworms so naturally, we've been going to the Bibliothèque et Archives Nationales du Québec very often lately. I always go directly to the kids' section, so my review is based on that floor. Subscribing was very easy and free! We just provided them with proofs of residence and identity, then each one of them was given a subscriber's card.\n\nThe kids' area is awesome, they can watch documentaries and\/or movies, listen to music, participate in activities such as video games workshops, currently they have a very interesting exhibit for kids about all aspects of Montreal (for the city's 375th anniversary), there's also a computer section and of course they have extensive books, movies and games collections for all ages, we always spend hours there! \n\nIf you're looking for a nice free activity to do with your kids this is definitely the place :)
744	Yeah - I've been to the one in Tempe before as well as some in California but the other day was my first time here - and I didn't even know it was pretty much right in my H double O D till recently! So of course, the first thing I did was hang out by the scented soap section and I smelled as many different flavors of soap as I could before my nostrils were ready to revolt and I started having a sneezing fit. Then I went and looked at all the bulk grains. The only thing I wanted was buckwheat and that was empty. Bah! So then I wandered around the meat section - they had Bison hot dogs so I grabbed a thing of those. So here I am in this post-hippie organic healthy kind of grocery thinking I'm gonna at least try to eat more healthy and maybe cut down on drinking and I turn the corner and whoa - there's a BAR right in the middle of the place! WTF? Do they have a cigar room as well? Maybe an opium den? Medical Marijuana dispensary? Still... I made a note of it - novel place to get a drink sometime. Next time I get together with friends I'll tell them \"HEY! I know this really hip bar to go to - just meet me at Whole Foods. We'll mix it up with the soccer moms and metrosexuals!\" So they have what seems to be healthier junk food and I would have stocked up much more if they weren't priced so high. 5 dollars for a bag of kale chips the size of what you get in a vending machine? Plus they were covered in chocolate anyway - definitely more geared towards postmenopausal chocomoms. They also had a sushi bar - but it looked kind of funky and was rather high priced for sushi that sat around all day and much longer than they would have at a Chinese buffet. I wasn't that desperate - figured I might end up choking on a freaking goji berry or something. I'm sure I'll be back - for the bar at least if nothing else. Lotsa parking because it's in a mall. If you wanna go back westward on Ray you have to exit at the southeast corner of the mall and turn north on Coronado street and make the light. Otherwise every other exit has you going eastbound on Ray.
745	Please keep in mind that this was only my second cirque du soleil show (with the first being Michael Jackson's Immortal) as you read this review. \n\nWe went on a Sunday night, the 9:30 showing.  The door opened at 9, but there was no need to get there early.  I heard this venue was tiny, but was definitely surprised how small it is in person.  There really isn't a \"bad\" seat in the house.  We were seated in section 201 row BB.  We didn't have the most centralized view, but that was fine.  Sections 202, 203, and 204 have better views if you're into \"best\" seat in the house.  \n\nNow onto the storyline...or was there one? I couldn't figure it out either way.  The whole baby character is a bit too bizarre for me though.  And without giving the show away, I thought some of the other characters such as the \"French man\" was a little distracting.  His main purpose was to provide some sort of comical relief to the audience, but I didn't find him to be funny.  \n\nThe acrobats and trapeze were outstanding of course.  They sure take the free show over at Circus Circus to the next level and above.  They're the ones we paid to see, and they did the show justice.  \n\nOverall, I liked the show, but I wish I enjoyed it a little more.  Then again, I was fighting the urge of falling asleep after a day out in the scorching sun AND a dinner buffet.  But at least I did better than the guy sitting next to us, who was asleep the entire time.  His gf stormed out of the venue as soon as it ended...and what happens to him after that is a mystère.
746	Just left with a bunch of groceries and a tank full of gas. The only downfall to this location is that it's always so crowded which is not its fault. I'm sure they want to stay busy. But no matter how busy they get the checkout seems to go rather quickly. At least it did today. The cashiers are very friendly and the young man who helpedin the deli was patient and friendly.
747	This place is so good! The atmosphere really gives off an Asian vibe and the food is amazing!
748	I received the white platinum frames (2 sets). The sizes were accurate but one of them had a visible crack. I didn't bother contacting the manufacturer because the crack would not be visible when viewed from the front. My gripe is with the corner joins. There is gap in some of corners. If I had known this earlier, I would have made the frames myself. I have done this before. Basically, they are not worth the money. I went for these because I wanted to save time with ready made frames but I made major miscalculation.
749	I had the beef vermicelli and it was delicious. The spring rolls were great. Definitely would go back again. It's hard to find healthy authentic food.
750	I shop at this location because it's close and have not really minded the \"interesting\" clientele or parking-lot denizens.  The prices are good and the staff is improving all the time.\n\nHere's where I draw the line, though:\n\nFrozen foods that have melted should be thrown out, NOT refrozen and marked down.\n\nThis has happened twice in the last few weeks, once with popsicles and most recently with frozen yogurt.  I'm pretty much convinced this is a business practice and not a one-off occurrence.  It's incredibly disappointing...and lacks in integrity.  Both times, the purchases were inedible and had to be thown out.
751	I have gone here for over 20 years.  Dr. Glick knows so much, has such a superior ethic, knows how to give painless injections and has handled many dental issues for me. I trust him implicitly. He also teaches dental students, and stays ahead of the work that is being done in the field. If you want a Dentist that knows what to do, and can handle any dental problem with ease and  a high degree of knowledge and confidence, this is your dentist. You may have to wait a few weeks to get in, but the wait is worth it. He also has a very nice manner, which greatly helps, when you are in pain.
752	Great tasting cold brew coffee and a nice, convenient location.  I have been getting hazelnut cold brew coffees from here since I moved to the area a few weeks ago.  I wanted to be able to make them at home so I purchased some of their cold brew ground coffee.  The hazelnut flavor is what really makes the drink so Chloe behind the counter said hey, we can sell you the same hazelnut we use in the drinks you love. She also gave me one of their little scoops they use so I could measure out the hazelnut powder into my drink (above and beyond service). Awesome!  She was very friendly and helped facilitate me getting the materials to make my own drinks at home.  Every time I have come in the staff has been friendly, the store has been clean and the coffee has tasted good.  No reason to not give them five stars.
753	I would give this place a big fat ZERO for taste and customer service. \n\nI ordered a $350 baby shower cake here for my shower. I emailed them and arranged a meeting with the owner, a woman named Genevieve I believe. Instead, one of her bakers met with me and instead of talking to me about design and cake flavors, she basically did nothing while my best friend and I tried to explain what I wanted. We were both heavily pregnant at the time, my bestie with twins, and we had been told we've be able to try samples, etc., and none of this happened. The baker was not helpful in the design.\n\nWe bought a few cupcakes to munch on (actually we bought one of almost every flavor) and at first bite, we were making YUCK faces. They were dry and the icing was horrendous. It tasted like someone had smeared butter into a huge blob. It needed more taste, more sugar. The flavors had real potential but the cupcakes should have been an indication of what my cake would end up being.\n\nThis place was so disappointing. Even now, a year later, my stomach twists up in distaste thinking of my terrible experience with this place. Since I'd received no help from her associate's in the design, I emailed Genevieve frequently trying to work it out. In every single email, she was rude and curt, acting as if I was a pain the a**. It was my first baby, my first shower, my first big custom cake and I wanted it to be special. If I was a pain in the ass then that's what happens when you're 7 months pregnant and feeling like a gross whale!\n\nMoving on... the week of my shower, having heard NOTHING from them, I called and inquired about pick up or delivery. I was informed I'd be charged $50 on a $350 order to deliver from... get this... Liberty Village to the Old Mil. $50 for what, 10 minutes? I thought that was appalling. We picked it up instead. \n\nThe cake looked great. Everyone oo'ed and ahh'ed. Until they bit into it and faces of women at my shower did the whole \"fake yummy\" thing. It was gross. It was dry. It was bland... and worst of all, my two tiered cake had TWO WRONG FLAVORS!! Worst of all, one of the flavors was banana cake with vanilla buttercream icing and it was VILE. My cake didn't get eaten more than a few bites of each plate. \n\nAnd to make matters WORSE, when I emailed Genevieve about her massive mistake, she literally said \"glad you're guests liked it\". Um... my guests did NOT like it, I was very upset since it was a big deal to me, and I paid $350 for this piece of shiz! The decent thing to do, Genevieve, would be to offer at least a partial refund. What did Genevieve do? She offered me a coupon for six MINI cupcakes. Worth $20.\n\nNot only will I never EVER go back to this crappy business, I have been telling everyone about my experience and making sure no friend of mine ever makes the same mistake. This woman basically ripped me off for $350 for a cake for 25 people and it didn't even taste good. NEVER GO HERE. Certainly don't let her do your custom cake. Yes, I'm still upset over it all.
754	Chiming in with what others have said, the customer service here is phenomenal. \n\nThe tacos served here are very similar to those offered downtown and they're just as tasty! \n\nI came here at night and after ordering our food and sitting down, I realized they were gonna close in 10 minutes.. I so did not want to be that guy that stays past closing lol. \n\nI preceded to scarf down my food as fast as possible and despite almost closing, the guy who worked there took some time and made small talk with us. Greatly appreciated.
755	Just bought porkchops meat on 5.29.20011 and on 5\/30\/2011 when I opened the package it was RANCID!!!!!!!\nTook back to the store on 5\/31\/2011 and the lady was non apoligetic and refused to return my money when the meat was clearly marked with best use date and walmart wrappers. She would only offer me a gift card.\nNEVER A \"I'M SORRY\"...NOTHING. I will never shop here or any walmart again for meat!!!!!\nIt was GROSS!!!!!
756	Crazy cute store for the yoga lover. Vegan power bars are my favorite. Have tried their lotions and face wash brands and they are good.
757	The first thing I saw when I came in is the woman on the front asking me if I want to try their fresh bread, after trying the bread which I like very much I told her that I will come back to try sandwich later on and that's what I did. \nI tried the sandwich tuna which was really good and I highly recommend it. \nThe place looks very clean and appealing and above all the service is really good. \nI recommend this place to whoever love different type of bread and homemade style!
758	I received a call back from them - they couldn't work on a commercial cooler but helped me find someone who could.  Great Service!!!
759	So I had to hit the oldest Irish pub in Montreal.\n\nI really liked this place.  Multiple levels, old pub feel.  They serve food, but I only got beer.  Watched a rugby match (France v Wales) with a bunch of hooligans.  I like that kind of thing.\n\nA very fun place to hang out.  The beers were good, the bartender was knowledgable, and didn't mind us asking questions about the area.  Overall a must stop if you are in the neighborhood.
760	I had been to this location a couple times. I usually go to an actual barber, which I really like, but I always found Great Clips to be good enough for a quick fix if I was in a hurry. \n\nYesterday I walked in and waited about 10 minutes for my turn. The woman working the door\/reception was the one who seated me at her station. When I arrived she asked my phone number and confirmed I was in their database, which I took to mean they would email me coupons, or some garbage like that.\n\nI sat down, she tossed a plastic sheet over me and asked me if this was the way I normally wore my hair. I agreed, thinking she must be able to tell a little something about my last haircut by the way my hair currently looked. But then she whipped out a pair of clippers and proceeded to run it straight down the center of my head. \n\nI asked what she was doing, and she said it was ok because she was using a #4. I assume now that has something to do with the clipper attachment, but I did not ask for my head to be shaved, and certainly didn't ask for a #4. When I told her this, she replied that it was in the system that I preferred this. \n\nI don't know what their system says about me, but I can't understand why you wouldn't ask someone before shaving their hair off, especially if it was clear they didn't have that down last time. \n\nThe part that really bothers me was the total lack of accountability. She quickly told me it wasn't her fault and that I should have said something before she did this. I assure you, there was no real time to react before she had already lopped off a good part of my hair. \n\nSince I didn't have much choice a this point, I told her to go ahed and finish what she started, never getting an apology. As a matter of fact, she was actually rude to me about the whole thing. \n\nI didn't tip her, which earned me a snarky comment I didn't quite catch as I walked out the door. \n\nNow I doubt this is a normal occurrence here, but I did feel compelled to warn people that whatever the computer says, these lemmings will do without checking. The misunderstanding wouldn't have been so bad, if not the addition of the attitude that came with it. I'm obviously not going back, and I would advice other to use caution. \n\nGood luck out there, and try not to lose your head.
761	The BF and I decided to have a date day starting with a nice lunch. I've heard about this 3 course $20.12 meal which used to be weekday. When I found out that they now serve it everyday until 2:30pm we headed straight over. \n\nI love the airy room and the terrace looks like a nice option to enjoy on a rare nice day. It was too hot so we stayed inside. \n\nThey start you off with grilled, crusty bread and some good olive oil.\n\nStarters : \n\nFresh Diver Scallop Skewer with green bell pepper, sweet onion & couscous- the skewer had some of the most fresh and sweet scallops I've had since moving to Vegas. It leads me to believe they weren't pre packaged , but fresh shucked as that's the only time I've had as superior of a scallop.   The preparation was very simple but it showed off the quality well. \n\nGrilled Mediterranean Octopus ($10 supplement) - this was worth the supplement. It was tender, the char was strong but was a nice flavor with the onions, caper and simple lemon, olive oil and sea salt. The BF normally doesn't like octopus because in his mind the texture is too rubbery but he enjoyed this. \n\nMain: \n\nWe both got the Lavraki\/ grilled Mediterranean bass - It's a whole fish that just needed some of the lemon and that's it. They buttferfly it and debone except the collar and keep the head, skin on so keep in mind for people who only eat foods that don't resemble the animal they are. I happen to love that they chose to keep it  The flavor was a bit sweet, ocean-y in the right ways. It comes with a few broccoli stems and I thought I would need some sort of starch but I didn't. I had a bit of the bread left and that was enough and didn't take away from the fish. I even convinced my BF to try eating pieces of its face and eyes since it was fresh. Hah.  If you love sea bass like we do then this will make you very happy.  \n\nDessert: \n\nWalnut Pie with Kaimaki ice cream - With the description and even the look of the walnut cake I thought it was gonna be rich, warm and buttery and it was not. It took a whole unexpected crumbly texture and was served cold. The kaimaki isn't a ice cream I see often and it was nice to see a very Greek thing on the menu. Oddly, this is a refreshing dessert because of the texture and coolness and our other dessert that I thought was going to be light was the rich one.  \n\nYogurt Martini - this was rich and lovely. It is not like store Greek yogurt if that is what you are expecting but it's almost like a very soft cheese consistency. The berry syrup with it gave the right amount of tang. \n\nIt seems like the portions would make for a skimpy meal, but we were happily full.\n\nThe service was good, courteous, attentive and unobtrusive the way a high end restaurant should be. From our app to main there was a bit of a wait so maybe our fish went to someone else, but they definitely checked on us, apologized for the wait, brought us out more bread and got it to us cooked perfectly. I do not mind waiting for food that is delicious.\n\nThis is a very solid dinner and I feel a \"must do\" on the strip. If you love humble meals that show off the natural flavors of things then this place will impress in freshness. I will definitely be doing this again when family is in town.
762	If you are at the \"Justice Center\" and craving a convenient sandwich then this is an option for you.  \n\nIt's located just off the entrance on the 1st floor. There is an ATM outside, but they do accept credit cards. \n\nThey have a lot of signs everywhere saying they won't make change for the garage unless you buy something. \n\nInside they have a pretty large seating area that was empty even during the lunch hour. It was not very clean, though, and a lot of tables had trash and debris. \n\nI tried their small \"Bobbie\" sandwich which they are famous for. FYI the small is 9\" and plenty for one person. It has shredded turkey, stuffing, cranberry, and mayo (but\nI left that off since I think mayo is gross). The bread was fresh and soft. The turkey seemed to be mixed white and dark meat and was a bit on the dry side. The stuffing was moist, and the cranberry sauce was very good. They have a small selection of chips though no options for baked chips. The meal came to $11.23 with medium drink and chips. One incredibly stupid thing - they had a sign saying $1 for soda refills. That's just ludicrous. You can get unlimited refills at any fast food or sandwich shop (Subway, McDonalds, etc.), so charging $1 for a refill is just pure ludicrous greed.
763	I can't say more about this place. Victor is as skillful as he is helpful. Took my Mustang in and 1.5 hours later, I was as happy as I could be. The work was great, and I couldn't be happier. He uses top rate materials, and stands behind his work. I will be more than happy to refer him to my family and friends. As well as anyone else who needs tinting done to their vehicle. Don't look any further, this is the place.
764	It depends on which hairdresser you choose. I have been to this place many times for the past a few years. Generally all the Japanese hairdressers are nice and friendly and they do a good job on average. However, there is a Korean speaking woman hairdresser pissed me off today. My hair looks terrible after her cut and she is very rude. I'd recommend avoiding her if you can.
765	It's okay. But the service is inconsistent. I  ordered the 801 Sashmi, which is reasonably priced at $12.00. Sometimes it's really nicely done, other times it's chunks of fish that looked as though it was put together by a 12 year old. I tried to order takeout at 5:30pm but was told pickup time was going to be at the earliest 7pm! A 1.5hr wait, uh, no thanks, it's not worth the wait.
766	Eyebrow Envy is the place to go. Susan doesn't only treat you as a regular customer, she treats you as a friend or family member. Not to say, she is really good at threading. Because of this, I've been a loyal customer ;).\n\nI'll see you soon Susan :)
767	I have officially lived in skysong for about a month.\n\nStill no vomit in the elevators.  People clean up after their pets.  The property is clean and well maintained.  The maintenance staff is cordial and has been working diligently to fix any issues, no matter how small, since I moved in.\n\nA second event that I attended was pretty neat.  Free pancakes.  mmmm.  I really like the event coordinators.  They are very nice.\n\nNo problems with the office staff.   Trash cans are not overflowing.\n\nOh!  I heard someone the other day being loud.  It was around 1 am, and some drunk people were coming home from a bar.  You know... just like every other apartment complex with common areas.\n\nHmmmm... I will keep reviewing...
768	Love this place for great delivery. They will customize your food order to your taste. Alway asked them for Order Read Back so you know your Both on the Same Page.
769	Great place to take your cat. Treated me good and the cat as well....it can be a bit pricey but they will diagnose your pet well. Usually open late.
770	New Sabor in Huntersville, get hype! As I was pulling into the Harris Teeter shopping center this morning, I saw the unmistakable logo for some seriously delicious tacos. Knowing I would be in Huntersville all day, the lunch plan was set.\n\nOnly 2 weeks old now, the restaurant obivously still has that new car smell. Clean, attractive tables, wood-style laminate flooring, a really sleek decor with a warm color scheme. Interior-wise, this is a really nice restaurant and my favorite Sabor so far. This chain always seems to find great locations for their restaurants and this one is no different. \n\nToday is Tuesday and you've probably guessed, they have a Taco special. There are a few options: Chicken, Ground Beef, Black Bean, (and I think one other, can't remember). Keep in mind that these are very, very basic tacos, but they are well worth the $1 price point. I usually get 2 of the $1 tacos and then a full sized taco (like the Locos, fully loaded with a meat plus chorizo!).\n\nFood is just as delicious as the other Sabor locations. Moist chicken, well seasoned ground beef, and a nice dynamic flavor profile on the Al Pastor pork. The salsa bar is a highlight of Sabor with four super fresh options. I implore you to try the Pineapple Habenero, it's not quite as hot as it sounds, best salsa in town as far as I'm concerned.\n\nA few side notes: This location is at one of the busiest corners in Huntersville. It was a heck of a lunch crowd today. Keep in mind that if you arrive at prime lunchtime, there certainly will be a line. Also, make sure to check-in on Yelp, you get a free side of Chips as a Check-in offer that you can use immediately!\n\nWelcome to Huntersville, Sabor! Now, get workin' on a location near University!
771	I'd like to say I loved this place, because for the most part I did.\n\nThe veggie selection was beautiful, the store was bright and clean, but ultimately, all of that was ruined by my experience at the check out.\n\nI went through the self check out, you know, so I could avoid talking to cashiers and go through the process quickly? Instead the attendant would not leave me alone and it took twice as long.\n\nHe hovered and hassled me the entire time I was going through the check out, he yelled out the veggies at me that I was buying from his station, and it was really frustrating. It totally ruined the whole experience for me. \n\nIf I do go back, I'm not going to bother doing self check-out (and I don't recommend anyone else does either), not much point if someone is going to micromanage the entire process.\n\nI would have given this place a five, I wanted to give this place a two after I left, but it gets a begrudging three because it has such a nice selection and a clean bright location.
772	RELAXING ENVIRONMENT WITH TURKISH COFFEE BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THE RICE! \n     I really do regret writing this review but the near health hazard and mistake I experienced at Istanbul I cannot overlook.  I will start at the beginning.  I LOVE middle eastern style foods and trying all different kinds\/tastes.  I also love trying new things (especially food).  When I saw this establishment with my roommate, we DEFINITELY wanted to try it out.  Arriving at Istanbul is a bit difficult at the time of writing this review because currently there is construction around the area and the street just outside the parking lot.  Upon arrival you see a simple entrance with flat, tall glass windows and a few tables outside.  When you walk in, you first see a small bar in front of you and tables on your left that carry on all the way to back where the restrooms are.  There is approximately 2 dozen tables and we were seated at one of the booths closer to the bar.  Very comfortable actually.  Looking over the menu I wanted to try a lamb dish with a side of rice and relish.  Before the food arrived, we ordered their Turkish coffee and it was a delight and probably the best part of the meal.  When the food arrived, I was immediately thrown off by the \"shiny\" object in my rice right on top.  I had NO idea what it was so I took my fork and looked it over.  IT WAS A STEEL FLAKE!  YES!  THERE WAS METAL IN MY RICE!  I immediately called over the waiter and asked, \"What do you guys clean your pots with?\"  as I pointed to the metal flake on my plate.  He looked at it and almost started laughing saying, \"Oh, that's my Brillo Pad.\"  WHAT!?!?!  You scrubbed the pot but didn't wash it?!?  I couldn't believe that!  He then said,  \"I'll get you some more rice.\"  I was skeptical on the rice so I concentrated on the lamb which was actually well prepared with NO metal flakes from a Brillo Pad.  He brought back the rice and because I was hungry I decided to sift through it and give it a try.  I did not see anymore Brillo Pad.  Overall, I give this place TWO stars because of the Turkish coffee being the only delight and we will NOT be returning.  They still had me pay FULL PRICE for my meal because I \"finished the lamb\".  Unacceptable after finding a piece of Brillo pad in my rice!  I could have seriously been injured or cut myself.  No thanks.
773	LOVE this place! Delicious Caribbean food, beautiful decor and lovely service. Must try their Kaya Burger (vegetarian or meat), tacos, paella, and desserts! The waitress made my birthday very special :)
774	What can I say? Absolutely breathtaking! The show was very entertaining! The acrobatics were out of this world!! The stagecraft was mind-blowing, the acting was superb! The whole thing was impeccable! So amazed with these people! I am honored to have experienced their talent!!!!
775	Beer: Unusual variety. Always new and different bottles in the cooler.\n\nFood: The pizza in the back room is amazing, but pricey.\n\nCrowd: Typical trendy tremont folks, which is much better than the west 9th broskies.\n\nBartenders: The one wavy\/curly haired girl was very personable and working her butt off to do both tables and the bar.  The other skinny girl with long black hair was content not moving and shooting death stares all night. But Thomas Edison still gets 5 stars from me.
776	Restaurant week with my mom continued tonight.  She likes Chinese food and this place is only about 5 minutes away from our house.  Seemed like a good time to head on over.  \n\nWe went inside and were seated immediately.  As soon as I sat down, I felt a little anxiety.  They do a bustling take out business but their waiting area is very tiny and it was right next to our table.  It felt like people were on top of us the whole time.  Every time you would lift your head, someone was there or looking your way.  A little bit uncomfortable.  If there is a next time, hopefully we will sit someone against the wall or something.  Anyways..........placed our order for Diet Cokes and actually used the Yelp check-in app in order to score us 2 free egg rolls!  We decided to go with Mongolian Beef and Orange Peel Chicken.  Here is how everything tasted...............\n\nEgg Rolls-  Best part of the meal, by far!  There were 2 of them and you could tell they were homemade and they tasted great.  They are served with a little sweet and sour sauce with a pinch of hot mustard.  The egg rolls and sauce were delicious.  They were hot, fresh, crispy and hearty for being such small things.  I would definitely get them again and maybe even a few orders of them  in addition to the free one you get from the Yelp app. \n\nMongolian Beef-  This was presented nicely with a ton of onions and beef.  I am spoiled though and am used to certain kinds of Chinese food (Golden Chopsticks in National City rings a bell).  I dug in to this and it tasted ok.  The meat was a little tough though and could have been seasoned just a bit more.  Not bad in any way, just nothing compared to other places that I have had Mongolian Beef before.  Portion size seemed just a bit skimp too.  Overall, it was just ok.\n\nOrange Peel Chicken-  Once again, I am used to certain things when it comes to Chinese food and this was totally different.  Their Orange Chicken is basically a breaded chicken breast cut up into strips a la chicken katsu.  It was covered in a sweet tasting sauce that was just ok.  The breading on the chicken fell off pretty easily which was kind of annoying.  Once again, the portion was a tad skimp.\n\nWhite Rice-  Rice was ok.  They give you a huge container of it at least.\n\nOverall, everything was just alright.  We ate all the food presented to us and didn't have any leftovers (rare with Chinese food...it boils down to the kind of skimp portions though) and were not totally stuffed to the brim.  Service, while friendly, was a tad slow.  Will I come back?  Eh...possibly.  My wife doesn't eat Chinese food other than Pick Up Stix and PF Changs, so I will probably be rolling solo if I do come back.  Nothing was really bad, but nothing stood out as super delicious either.  A-OK about sums it up....maybe even on the low end of A-OK.  Total bill for everything including tip was around $30.00.  Fair enough I guess.
777	I came here looking for a cool spot that didn't play EDM. I arrived to a very empty lounge. There was some hustle & bustle by the DJ area but that emptied out within an hour. I stuck around to enjoy the view and to hopefully hear some good music. The music was meh. It was what I'd call EDM light. What is it with the damn EDM music everywhere in Vegas? There is absolutely zero diversity in the music played - it's either EDM or stupid trap music. It makes going out dancing just about impossible if you like halfway decent music. I was really disappointed because the DJ is from the Bay, so I had hoped he'd spin more R&B at least. But nope - EDM versions of R&B. *heavy eye roll*\n\nThe view is definitely stellar. I arrived in time to take advantage of their late happy hour (food only) and ordered the roasted tomato fondue. It was tasty but nothing spectacular. I don't drink so I can't speak to the quality of the drinks. The waitress was very nice, though. I left after about an hour and a half. In retrospect, I should have just stayed in the hotel room and played my own music. Oh well. Lesson learned. If you want a great view, an intimate, romantic setting with EDM music playing in the background, this is the place for you. \n\nI wouldn't return unless they featured a DJ that didn't play one single EDM song. I hate EDM - can you tell??
778	I almost don't even want to review the place because I like I can rush in get what I want and be gone if need be without huge crowds...this will soon change.  Food was fantastic, service was excellent and we've been there when busy (once) and empty and it was always excellent.\n\nWe lived in India for a few years, so we have a solid reference point, but we all know food is a preference individually but I love the place.  They are an Andrha run business (Hyderabad) style cuisine, so they can make it mild, but specialize in spicy!  Loved it.  It was so good my brother in-law who is afraid of 'unique' food, loved it to death!  A convert to good Indian food.
779	There were a couple entertaining things right in the beginning (like the hula-hoop girl) that gave you the false sense of \"This show might be good\" but overall it was a total bore.  I expected \"sensual\" as they advertised but instead it was just in-your-face childish sex jokes and displays.  It was basically something a pubescent high school boy would get excited over.  Some things, like the woman having fake, pre-recorded orgasms, were just weird and slightly awkward- I'm not kidding.  She was dropped from the ceiling, her body completely wrapped up in sashes and ribbons like a mummy, blindfolded.  There was no lead-up into it; just came out of nowhere from the ceiling.  Then began her violently convulsing to really loud, exaggerated orgasms like she was trying to break free from the sashes and that was her *ENTIRE* bit in the show.  Freaking bizarre.\n\nI'm sorry that we wasted our time and money to watch this.  It also seemed a lot shorter than the other Cirque du Soleil shows I've gone to.  There wasn't any story to it either.  The other ones I've seen all played out with a storyline to it; this one lacked that.  It was just lame sex stuff over and over.  Nothing sensual about it.  Would not recommend it nor watch it again, even if it were free.
780	Yum Yum. I came here with my sis-in-law for a random Friday lunch. It was busy but we were taken care of quite fast by a fantastic server.\n\nThe menu had a list of many mouth watering dishes making the choice hard. When we asked for suggestions, we were told to begin our journey with \"The Remedy\". Remedy for what? A hangover, hunger, life? Yes. It just really satisfied everything. A return trip is a must.\n\nAlso, amazing cappuccinos. Soooo good.
781	I've had the privilege of having John as my realtor for purchasing two homes here in the Valley.   In the first home search we had a long list of things we wanted but didn't know what area we'd end up in.   John didn't waste our time showing us homes that didn't meet our needs.  He was patient in showing us options in all different neighborhoods within our price range so we could get a better idea of our choices.   We ended up purchasing a home we loved in Kierland area.  John was also wonderfully proactive in helping us pick a home we could grow with.  He helped us paint a vision for what we could do with the home as they years went on.  For my second purchase I knew I wanted a condo in Old Town Scottsdale.  While the properties were a very different type of purchase from my first, John was just as thorough, just as professional and aggressive in helping me find something quickly.  This purchase was at a point in the market where homes went fast and there were usually multiple offers on desirable units.  John did an amazing job working with the sellers' realtors in getting my offer accepted.   We are about to start our search in the competitive Arcadia neighborhood.  There's no one else I would trust to get us into our dream home other than John Gluch Group!
782	I recently saw a burlesque show here and was disappointed in the venue. It was hard to see the stage because the seats weren't staggered or tiered, it was warm inside despite ample space, the sound system is antiquated and there's a pillar near near stage left that blocks the view for attendees. On the upside, The bartenders and private security staff are friendly and I feel the prices for drinks and hamburgers and hotdogs were reasonable. Definitely room for improvement.
783	Went for late night, kitchen was still open at 11. Nice.\n\nFood was ok, they were serving burgers and appetizers at that point. Fine by me. Nothing outstanding but no low points. Menu was trying really hard to be frisky, kind of like when your boring aunt makes a push to become the cool aunt.\n\nThe decor is so contrived and lame. This is the kind of restaurant that gets made fun of back in Seattle. It looks like they went into the sysco food systems catalog, opened to the chapter titled \"trendy 5 years ago\" and checked every item on the list. \"Free Idea: Decorate a restaurant with Edison bulbs?\" -Jesse Thorn (@JesseThorn) \n\nIt's fine, just not especially good.
784	I adore Kawa. Ka-Vah, Polish for coffee.\nI'm here more than any other shop in the city (at least 4 times a week...)\n\nLike Dinah G. - I am also writing my review whilst sitting at Kawa.  I could go on for days about how wonderful it is here. Perhaps it'll be better for everyone if I write a list!\n1) They serve 49th Parallel Coffee - http:\/\/www.49thparallelroasters.com\/\n2) They are fully licensed, with a lovely array of bottled micro-brews & vino\n3) The staff are competent, quick, and oh so friendly\n4) Location, Location, Location\n5) Free Wireless!!\n6) 2 hr parking on 14th ave, and a few reserved spots on 8th street\n7) Live Music most nights, or cool tunes ring through the speakers\n8) Special Culinary Events (usually vegetarian, or gluten-free, or equally delicious & yummy) These ALWAYS sell out in advance\n9) Fresh Euro Pastries Every Day... Save Room!\n10) Nice washrooms. I can't speak for the gents, but the ladies room is always stocked, the lighting is good, and it smells lush \n11) Last one - they are open late! 11:00PM most nights.\n\nEnjoy!\nKLM
785	Loved this place! I actually came here two nights in a row! Fun games, great chill vibe, good food & drinks! I come here every time I'm in Vegas & just want to do something off the strip.
786	***************************** 1428 ***************************\n\n  Nice lay out, beautiful waitresses, white leather couches, divider with between, newly furnished, dim lighting, strong drinks and good service.\n\n I stayed at my usual the Bellagio but the rest of my team was here at the Hard Rock Hotel for The Party At NACS 2015. We were here 3 days straight and the service were consistently good.
787	Bank on this!\n The best Clark county credit union branch in Las Vegas. Convenient location  always very clean and the employees are always happy to serve you. That's the difference between a bank and a credit union, service, service, service. And with better rates than a bank you cannot go wrong!\n I'm not receiving nothing for this review, zit , nada, zero....although an extra zero at the end of my account balance would be great.
788	I came out of Star Wars at the Palms jonesing for pizza. I had wanted pizza on Saturday but a famous pizza place near me recorded my credit card wrong on the phone (of course then it would not go through argh) so I was already in distress.\nWe ran over to the food court which is about 23 feet from the theatres. I got the pepper and cheese which was the bomb of all pizza spices- after all I love a good thin crust- my husband got a pepperoni and he agreed it was great- and the garlic knots-5 scrumptious garlic soaked little devils. Could not finish them all so they made a great lunch today!!\nOh I am so thrilled we have them 1.4 miles away.\nPizza is great!!!!
789	Recently moved here from Chicago, and after searching for sushi in this city we tried Ginko based on the suggestions of fellow Yelpers and others.  Sadly disappointed.  \n\nAs i do with most new places, I order the baseline items for pure comparison - and as a first round we ordered a tuna role, yellowtail and scallion and one of their special roles.  What we got in return was rice rolled up in seaweed with a sliver (and i'm not exaggerating) of fish in each roll.  Sure, some will say we should've started off with the speciality rolls rather than the basic boring rolls.  However, we had enough rice to decide we didn't need to try anything else - 3 very small rolls, 2 beers and $55 later, we packed up and went to another nearby place for another drink and appetizer.  Subpar, very overpriced sushi.\n\nCleveland, you deserve better.
790	I believe this is supposed to be Paris Hilton's favorite Japanese restaurant, but when I dined here, I only saw Doogie Howser here.  Funny enough, Doogie (Michael or something?) ordered the Kobe beef burgers -- this was just after Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle came out, so I found this to be hilarious.\n\nNo, I was not trying to peer into his life, he happened to sit very close to me, and like I said, hilarious.\n\nAnyways, back to the food.  Very elegant and creative.  The fish is fresh, and the food is tasty.  It is probably my second favorite place in Las Vegas to get sushi.  The drinks are amazing though.  The bartender created a pomegranate martini for me on the fly (a \"Pometini\" we coined it).
791	Hands down the best wonton and soup base! Their wontons are huge and delicious!
792	The atmosphere is beautiful, the service exceptional and the food was great.  Then unique flavors really make it standout from all the other restaurants around.  We went back for a second night to experience different tastes from the night before.
793	No I don't listen to their morning show. \n\nFor ten minutes solid it's Boomshakalakaboomboomshakalaka...heeeeyyyyyy...hooooooooo....booomshakalaka...\n\nAnd then they play Taylor Swift.\n\nBooomboootabootablipbleepblurp*trendyvocaleffect*boombootaboota...\n\nAnd now...Train. \n\nIs this Top 40 now? Is KISS FM the new B-94? Did they take B-94 and WAMO and smush them together? Or is this some new format? \n\nAll I know is that it makes me wish Slayer had the number one single in the country. \n\nPittsburgh radio is in the swamp, man.
794	I had a pleasant experience renting bikes from this place.  It was easy and affordable. \n\nWe rented two single bikes to cruise around the island.  For $8 for the first hour and $4 per half hour increment thereafter, you get a simple beach cruiser type bike.  It did not come with a lock or a basket.   You deposit $10 per rental with an ID, and either pay additional charges or get money back when you return the bike. In addition to single bikes, they also rent tandem, and quad bikes. \n\nIt's located in the back of the island, so once you get off the ferry at Centre Island, you walk an additional 10 minutes or so to get to the rental location.  Looks like the shack is run by an Asian family, and service they may be abrupt at times. \n\nPS. It's cheaper to rent once of the city bikes, I think it was only $7 for the entire day, but then you have to transport it onto the ferry against heavy pedestrian traffic.  So it may be best to rent here.
795	K and I have shopped here before and again, using the coupon in the Sunday paper, walk out feeling like Michaels corporate just doesn't care. The coupons promise something is on sale but upon further review of the small print with a magnifying glass you come to find that the item you want isn't discounted but something similar is. No doubt, the items that sell slowly are the ones qualified under the coupon. This time we had a coupon that said 40% off stickers. So we got some stickers for C to use on a school project. When we checked out the girl informed us that not all stickers were included under the coupon, just certain ones. Of course, none of the packets we grabbed were included. As I said, this happened before when K and I were shopping for gifts for C's cousins. We found stuff that seemingly would work with the coupon from the paper but upon trying to use it at check out we were told that the items we were buying did not qualify. \n\nThe thing is, Michaels is not cheap. This is not a bargain place. But, a lot of the stuff they sell is also carried at other stores. 2 of those are less than half a mile to the west. As K said as we were leaving, Michaels needs to be more like Khols. They make taking coupons an art. K is always happy with how Khols handles the coupons and discount cards. But in the end, it just hurts Michaels. We hardly ever go there because of the past issues and anymore, there's other stores in town.\n\nOn the plus side, the staff we've encountered has been very pleasant and this store seems to have a pretty good selection of stuff. \n\nNice Staff. Lousy Coupon policy. Above average Prices. Good Inventory. 2 Stars.
796	I wish I had read the reviews here before purchasing a Groupon for eyelash extensions.  My experience was just as bad as that of the other women who have left negative comments.  First, there is the salon itself - the reception \"service\" is a disaster.  The first woman I dealt with was merely a dim bulb, but the second was downright rude - not in a snooty way, but in an abrasive, low class, doesn't know how to talk to clients kind of way.  I had picked up one of the price list handouts that they had ON DISPLAY on the counter, and without my even asking about any of the services she said, \"Those prices aren't good any more.\" and SNATCHED the card out of my hand.  (She also said the prices on the website are incorrect, so they do NOT honor advertised prices.) Note to salon owners: when hiring someone in a public-interface position, make sure she wasn't raised by wolves.\n\nNow for the eyelash service: the room in which this is performed is a little cubby hole off the reception area.  There is no door, just an opening in the wall.  Every time someone opens the front door of the salon, you feel the wind rushing in, and you can hear everything that goes on in the the reception area, including some very LOUD voices.  A side wall of the cubbyhole has a huge hole in it where it appears a door used to be, but it is just boarded up with plywood and not even painted over. The floor was FILTHY (I thought maybe it was an abstract pattern in the tile, but I bent down and touched it with my finger, and it smudged.) The linens on the table where you lie down for the service did not appear to have been changed since the previous client - unsanitary.  I seriously think that the Health  Department should pay an unannounced visit.  The description of the service in their \"contract\" says that the lashes will be chosen after consultation with the client, but there was no consultation - she just chose what she wanted to give me.  When I saw the results, I was in shock.  The lashes can most kindly be described as \"theatrical\" - basically I looked like Lucille Ball in her \"I Love Lucy\" days.  I am over 50, have extremely fair skin, flaxen blonde hair, and pale blue eyes, and there I was with midnight black lashes that would perfectly suit a showgirl on The Strip. They curve up 180 degrees and poke into my eyelids. I have to hold them down to apply either eyeshadow or eyeliner. \n\nThe woman who did this was pleasant enough, and claimed to have worked for several high-end cosmetics companies, but said she is now doing only eyelash extensions.  That may not have been a strategic career move for her.  In any event, I actually gave her a rather generous tip because, despite my disappointment in the results, I felt sorry for her working in those conditions. I am sure she pays the salon rent for that little hovel, and they don't even supply clean linens.  Having paid a total of $91 ($46 Groupon, $10 for adhesive to hold down lower lashes, $35 tip, which they made clear should be based on the LIST price, not the Groupon price), I am now stuck with the Lucy Look for the next few weeks, and I can hardly wait until the lashes fall off.  Despite the many positive reviews for the hair stylists, I cannot imagine ever returning to this salon for anything.  Too many bad memories.
797	Awaiting my flight at CLE. Overall, the airport staff is friendly and helpful. There are the usual shops but little in the way of vegan food. The airport is decorating for Christmas so they cut off access from gate 22 area to the bathrooms. In the connecting hallway they blocked access to set up a Santa display.  They could have made a better choice here as now you have to walk all the way around to the main concourse to access the restrooms. As much as I like Santa, as a middle aged business traveler,  I value easy access to the restroom more. CLE features pretty good pokemon go play too.
798	Christmas Day, the young man was craving some cong you bing (scallion pancakes) and I had read about China Mama on here. I was pretty certain they'd be open, but just to make sure I called beforehand. I tried starting at 10am but no answer.... closer to 11am they answered and indeed were open -- at 11am!\n\nWe headed over there, got seated, looked at a menu and our server, a Shanghainese man, seemed quite pleased to speak my home dialect with me.\n\nThey don't have salty soy milk and if you want sweet soy milk, you can add the sugar yourself. What they bring to you is a bowl of plain soy milk -- which was fine by us because we added some vinegar and soy to it and it sufficed. Not the best, but it worked.\n\nThe XLB arrived right after the soymilk and immediately, I knew they wouldn't be very good. A few had pierced through so all the juicy liquid had oozed out. I picked up an XLB and put the thing in my mouth after dipping it into vinegar -- hmmmm --- the piece of meat was too dense -- definitely not good enough for me to come back just for these, but what followed turned out to be a really wonderful surprise.\n\nPotstickers arrived and after biting into one I was completely sold! These were some of the most perfect potstickers I've ever had -- crispy on the bottom and still succulent everywhere else. the wrapper wasn't too thick and the filling not too small -- it was pretty damn good!\n\nSheng jian bao (don't know what they are called in English) are these little buns which contain pork. I've not had anything this perfect in the US. The bottom was crispy and the top had the perfect pillowy softness of the bao. Most places I've had these at would steam the bun first and then fry the buns when you order. This is the wrong way to cook these. The name 'sheng jian bao' literally means pan frying the bun from its raw format. What they do is, they fry the raw bun in a pan, add liquid, close the lid to 'steam' the bun as it cooks the filling and the top part of the bun, remove lid and wait until the bottom is dry, remove and serve. \n\nAnd how do I know that these were done the correct way? Well, there is a certain crust that forms on the bottom and around the bun and these ones had it. The other sign is that the bun part is like a pillow when you bite into them, not hard and dense like those you might find at dim sum where they steam the buns and then pan fry them.\n\nDefinitely some of the best sheng jian baos ever!\n\nCong you bing -- was okay, wasn't the best I've ever had, a little too greasy, but they used enough scallions so it was a plus.\n\nI saw another table had the beef roll and couldn't resist but order some. This was another dish which is done to perfection here! They are generous with the five spiced beef filling and the condiments like cilantro is ample but not too much or too little. The sweet sauce they drizzle into it is also not overtly sweet and so, enhances the flavors without making it sickly sweet.\n\nDefinitely some really above average Chinese\/Taiwanese breakfast foods I've tasted! This will stay on my list of places to return to whenever we're in town!\n\n4.5 stars!
799	Never fear for Tammie Coe's cookies and cakes are still near! I nearly cried when I found out that Tammie Coe's cakes and cookies wouldn't be served at LGO anymore, but then I realized that I could still visit the bakery for my sweet tooth fix! Phew! I absolutely love her baked goods. Recently, I purchase a package of her burger buns for burgers and they are fresh, fluffy and tasty! My go-to treats are her delectable cookies, especially the chocolate ones and the apple cinnamon cookie. The apple cookie has real apples in it! Do yourself a favor and find a way to try some of Tammy Coe's delicious treats!
800	Cheap meals but they are tiny portions. I'm too lazy to do grocery shopping so I continue to use them. Meals taste decent for the most part but nothing to write home about.
801	I don't want to be one of those vegans who give a bad review of a place based on the vegan options at a primarily meat based restaurant, but I'm going too. The reason for my annoyance, for all the veggies reading, is that the Veggie Burger cannot, or at least should not be eaten by any vegetarian. The waitress was nice enough to inform me that it is cooked alongside the beef burgers, ruining any chance this restaurant had of me enjoying a meal here. To their credit the waitress did let me know about this before I had to ask, which I can only hope is a regular practice for all the wait staff there and the only reason they're getting 2 stars. It's nice to get the warning.\n\nAs far as I can see there's only 2 types of people who would order a Veggie Burger; a vegetarian, or someone looking for a healthier option with less fat. Well this grease soaked burger screws us both. Thanks for trying though Jack's, you obviously realized there was a market here that you wanted to exploit, unfortunately you missed the point completely. The one and only meal I could eat was the vegetable fajita and luckily you really can't mess up fried vegetables on tortillas, but I've definitely had better. \n\nI would never have gone to this place if it hadn't been a work related outing and hopefully I will never have to go again. If you're a vegetarian, do yourself a favour and avoid this place. Like I needed to tell you.
802	Ok, it must get better over time. (I hope)! Grand opening, and the place wasn't too packed. Got my red velvet, chai latte, lemon meringue, triple cinnamon, and vanilla. All were way too dry, and lacked flavor with the exception of the lemon. But still way to dry! They must've baked way too many and had them sit out way too long. That's what I get for going to their grand opening. I just pray this isn't what to expect in the future, as I will just stick to their ice cream.
803	My friend and I were visiting from out of town and decided to try this place out when we saw their groupon. The first thing we noticed was an empty parking lot at 7:30 pm on a holiday weekend. Awful location?\n\nUpon entering we felt a little relieved with the warm reception from the young host. He found us a booth quickly and was kind enough to turn off the fan that was blowing our paper table cloth everywhere. \n\nAlthough delivered quickly, after one sip of our Diet \"COKE\", it was obvious that it was RC Diet Cola and right from a flat 2-liter bottle. \n\nThe salad bar, if that's what you would call it, was slim pickens and only offered hearts of romaine and three dressings. They had some other Italian appetizers as well, ie. rolled deli ham and cheese cubes. \n\nThe hot plate section was not labeled and it took an explanation from the young host in order for us to know what the dishes were. The Chicken Cacciatore and Cheese Balls were incredible :) \n\nMain course: As the first round of meats arrived, you can tell that they were made very recently. We received italian sausage, grilled pineapple, garlic bread, pork rib, grilled chicken, and top sirloin. They were up to par in taste and served from a hot skewer and the portions were fair.  We never received any tri-tip, leg of lamb, or filet mignon - all of which are advertised on their groupon\/website! \n\nThe highlight of our underwhelming experience was the warm smile and friendly attitude from the head chef and his staff. \n\nIn all honesty, the groupon price we paid ($65 incl tip) is still a pretty high for what we received.
804	My business partner and I love getting wings for lunch. That hunt for great wings led us to Armadillo Grill and has now turned into a weekly occurrence. I still have a place or two in Central Phx that I haven't tried (yet), but Armadillo Grill has hit the best wings in town, IMO. Yes, they are that good. What's even better is they are half price on \"Wing Wednesday\"! I strongly recommend the Armadillo Gold (Medium spicy), followed by the Honey Hot (Mild). Great seasoning on the wings, amazing sauce. Even their Buffalo (hot) is tasty - I just like the Armadillo Gold too much to venture away from it very often.\n\nI have NEVER had a rude experience with the staff. Minimal issues with service or food, that were always fixed right away and with a smile. \n\nAs for the atmosphere, you just have to know what you are walking into, and the place is great. What it is NOT: Chic, Upscale, Pretentious. What it IS: Really good food, down to earth, and no frills. It's not a \"Dive\", but it's not Twin Peaks, Buffalo Wild Wings, or Zipps either. It has an OTB (Off Track Betting) so finding half a dozen guys betting the ponies is to be expected. It's a \"Bar and Grill\" - not the worst place for a family, but if you bring kids, make sure you sit in the \"restaurant\" area, not at the tables within ear shot of the bar (that seems kind of logical though).\n\nThank you Brenda for giving us our regular \"Wing Wednesday\" hang-out!
805	Overpriced meh food.  Bad service. They had a groupon where they weren't upfront that it was only available for, like, a three hour window M-Th. It didn't say that anywhere in the groupon. I think they just didn't want to honor it. \n\n That would have been nice to know when we first sat down and told the hostess, \"hey, we have a groupon.\" Instead, she said \"great!\" Then, we had a $40 lunch that consisted of two burgers and were stuck paying full price for mediocre cold burgers.\n\nThis place is like a wannabe hooters. The entire time we were here, there were three or four scantily clad ladies behind the bar giving each other backrubs. Gross.
806	Awesome place! This is my second time coming here. I don't really like chains so this place is perfect and right around the corner from me. And the staff is amazing.
807	This place has the best Philly cheesesteak I've every eaten. The employees are extremely nice as well.
808	After all the hype on Yelp for this place I had high expectations. I am also not a huge fan of BBQ. But my work recently changed locations to just down the street so I am actually able to make it here in time before they close now. \n\nI went in the middle of the week around 3ish and it was pretty quiet. The staff here are super friendly and seem to really like their jobs. The made some suggestions on what I should try my first visit and were very patient with me. The food is unbelievable!  I'm not even big into BBQ and I was back the next day to bring home smoked pecan pie. Whatever you get here plan to be pleased.  I can't wait to share this place with my friends and family.
809	One star for fries.\r\n\r\nOne star for egg and cheese sandwich.\r\n\r\nNother star for being open when it is 3:30 am and that is when I am consuming this greasy carbfest as an organic, foodie vegetarian would normally NEVER eat unless feeling the pink elephant junk food parade...and walking through the driveway.\r\n\r\nMinus that star for being open and wondering why I have grease spots on my bedsheets and zits two days later.
810	I have only been here once, but it was a great experience. The servers seem to make a point to ask and remember your name which is nice. I had Ling's seafood hot pot, which was great and served in a neat black kettle. There was an assortment of seafood in a green curry broth. It consisted of shrimp, scallops, mussels and fish with your choice of rice. They are not skimpy on the seafood. It was loaded. Great atmosphere and service. I will have to try more of their food if I am in the area again.. And maybe update my review.
811	The inside of the motel is nice enough for business travelers.  The reason why I am giving two starts is because this is not a safe area for a woman to walk around.  I stayed here without a car and felt uncomfortable walking to restaurants.  I even had someone pull over asking me for a ride.  Not safe.
812	15 dollars for 9 pieces of dukbokki the same amount can be bought just outside this place by the lady at the cart for like 5 dollars
813	I went to Uncle Tetsu's like an hour ago and the sign said wait to be seat so we wait till host seated us and she gave us menu after 15 mins past by no one come to take order so we left and I saw 3 waiters walked around no one come to ask or take order. I really want to try their cheesecake but at the first time visited I feel really disappointed.
814	I love this places  great staff and the cooks are awesome except for that older gentleman he seems like he doesnt want to cook anymore
815	I came here for a late night dinner of fish and chips after hearing so much about his place.  \n\nThe place was packed and pretty noisy due to a U2 cover band playing that evening.  I sat in the dinning area, which was 1 or 2 decibels quieter.  I opted for the fish and chips as well as the home made crisps for an app.\n\nThe homemade crisps were very good.  The sauces that came with them were hit and miss.  The curry was a hit, the other one (whose name escapes me) was a big miss.  As for the entree, the portions were quite generous: three big peices of cod.  The fish were not breaded too heavily and were flaky, but there wasn't too much flavor to them.  Unfortunately, even with the tartar sauce, not too much was added in terms of flavor.  The fries were average, freshly made and absorbing the vinegar nicely.  The cole slaw was nothing special and forgettable.  \n\nService was above average considering there was a bar full of patrons next door and only one waiter.  Overall the tab came out to about $25 with tax and tip, a bit on the steep side for a single diner.  \n\nIf you do come here, you might want to try for one of their specials (eg AYCE fish and chips on Thursdays) to make the price and overall experience a little more palatable.  Also remember this is a pub, so there are drunk people with bad judgement around: when leaving the place I almost got caught up in a brawl between a group of 6 and a group of 2.  Luckily, I escaped any drama by quickly and quietly walking to my car.
816	I must preface my remarks by saying that the location for this store has changed to Yonge and Eglinton (south west side) but Uzel Olive and Olive and Oil has only been open here for about 2 weeks as of this writing and I appear to be its first reviewer since its re-opening.  \n\nI was intrigued by the store front where the name was inconspicuous but very fresh and tasty looking spinach pies stood temptingly in the window.  I am always attracted to foods that I would never attempt to make myself as I know I could never do as good a job.  I went in after a Barre class (they are a neighbour of Barre Beautiful) and decided to order a few slices of pie as well as one of several freshly made sandwiches served on a white baguette (a combination of ground beef and lamb with sliced red onions).  Other options that day were mixed grilled vegetables and basa fish but the owner Mehmet advised that there is also a tomato and feta sandwich.  I found the spinach pie to be rather light, chewy and filling (it would probably be great with one of the Turkish coffees, which I did not sample).  It was not salty, or overly greasy and was light on the feta.  It is a delicious alternative treat to a sweet pastry, also on offer (there was baklava in the window as well). The sandwich was very tasty though not quite spectacular.  I found the meat to be a little on the salty side.  Everything is homemade by the owner Mehmet Uzel.  One can also purchase various other treats, such as Turkish delight, dried seasonal fruits, organic tea, and dried goods from Turkey, like legumes and handmade olive oil soap.  \n\nThe main attraction of the operation, however, are the olives and the extra virgin olive oil.  I tried the spicy green olives (there are several varieties in different marinades) and after several tastes have become quite a fan.  They are pitted and stuffed with a pimento.  The flavour is well balanced and not overly salty.  They were also reasonably priced (especially as you are not paying for pits here-the olives are weighed) and I would definitely repurchase.  The black pearl olives, are a specialty item here, native to Turkey and sold by Uzel in a variety of marinades and aging processes.  I tried those a few days later (there flavours are regular, bay leaf\/lemon and spicy) and like them as well (they are in line with a nicoise olive in terms of salt -higher than the green variety-but tastier).  The black olives aren't pitted.  All in all this is a nice, friendly, neighbourhood specialty shop, selling very good quality olives, and where one can also go for a reasonably priced sandwich or snack, Turkish style.
817	Wow. Do you love macaroons? Do you love ice cream? Well I'm here to tell you they are amazing together!!! It's not just hype- their products are good quality and the guy who helped me made me something that wasn't on the menu that I saw on yelp. It was sooooooo good. There's so many things to choose from so do your homework a little bit before you go if it takes you a little while to make your mind up.
818	I was in the unfortunate circumstance this past weekend of having to wake up at 630am to drive and pick up my Bountiful Basket from Ahwatukee. To help offset the sleep, I decided to grab an iced coffee from the king of coffee, Dunkin Donuts.\n\nAs I walked back to my filthy, dusty car, I got the overwhelming desire to wash it. Now, folks, on the rare occasions when I want nothing more than to clean my car or house, I try to monopolize on the opportunity, so I drove around to three different car washes in an attempt to get my baby cleaned... but as luck would have it, not one god damned place was open.\n\nJust when my will to live was seconds away from being squashed, I suddenly remembered that there was a Groupon special a week ago for Clean Freak, and I felt like it was a moment of Nachos (see Dallas G.) so I decided to see if the Nachos Gods were on my side this day.\n\nWell guess what, Clean Freak was open! And I was excited because that big blue tunnel was just fascinating! And what is this? $10 for the most pricey wash that cleans my tires too?? AND air freshener?? SCORE!!! And to boot, the cashier dude was in holiday spirit wearing his Halloween costume!\n\nNow, here comes this crappy part... the wash really wasn't that good. My windows weren't clean and there was still grime all over my tires. I had to buy window cleaner. None of the dead bugs came off my grill, either.\n\nOh.... and the vacuum's... I honestly believe that they could have sucked an unborn child from my womb had I been carrying one. But instead it got one of the many pieces of my stereo console. I'm sure that is going to cost me good money to replace. Thanks.\n\nNext time I have to make such an effort to get my car washed, I will just live like a filthy slob until I can find time to make it over to Danny's Family. It may cost $25 but at least my car is clean and I don't have to worry about losing my uterus.
819	See Kait for fantastic color and cut.\nI've been coloring my hair blonde for years, and the tone was brassy and too warm. \nShe suggested, and delivered, the most beautiful, multi toned champagne blonde.\nI love it.  She focused on condition of my hair (post beach vacay), future style options and even gave me a lesson on proper blow outs.\nI'd recommend her - a real pro, very passionate about her work, and very nice as well.
820	We stay here but the bathroom door lock was broken.  The room was nice the hotel was big.  Alot of stuff to see but our view wasn't great because we were looking at the back side of the Hotel all we to check out was the room and parking.  We should of  ask for a view.
821	Thank you all at MCVH for keeping my 20 year old Syrup happy and healthy. A couple months ago I thought I would have to say goodbye due to her chronic kidney disease however the amazing vets there accurately diagnosed her and the staff nursed her back to health. Now she is her old self chasing my 1 year old cat around.\nAs a fellow veterinarian, albeit one with workplace restrictions on providing veterinary services for personal animals, I have entrusted the care of my special needs pets to MCVH and they have never failed to exceed expectations.
822	Lube is cheap, but unfortunately, so are the parts. And to think I drove around my SUV for 3000 miles with the oil filter they installed. After noticing spots of oil in the drive way I took it to Eco wash auto spa where they told me the oil filter was cheap and leaking from every side. I won't be servicing any vehicle here anymore nor would I recommend their services to anyone.
823	Large wine selection and a unique venue. Only purchased wine and cheese board. Entrees $$$$.
824	We decided to check out National Stone based off Yelp reviews. We had a couple of quotes from other contractors as well. When we arrived to National Stone on a Saturday afternoon, they were closing. Zane, who was closing the gate seen us pull up and realized how disappointed we were that they were closing that he allowed us to come in to see their granite even though it was after hours. He was awesome!!! He spent 45 minutes showing us the different granite and explained the different kinds. Truly five star customer service!! We called the next morning to schedule an estimate. For what they offered, the price was great! We selected the granite and in a couple of weeks had the countertops installed. The installers took 4 hrs! I couldn't believe how fast they were and it turned out beautiful!!! I am so in love with my kitchen!! Definitely 5 stars for service and quality work!! Highly recommend!!
825	Great tasting Chinese and Thai dishes! They have an extensive menu and their food isn't nearly as oily as other Chinese take-out\/ delivery places I've been to- they even have a 'healthy menu' which has fresh steamed options instead of fried or sauteed.
826	Really wanted to like it but I won't be back, the restaurant wasn't very clean, and my food was soggy. It was weird
827	Disappointed in this place, as I've had much better Indian AYCE food elsewhere.  The flavours were just lacking on almost all the dishes I tried (except for the butter chicken that tasted amazing).  \n\nThe dishes I was most disappointed in were the fish pakoras (they had the pakora flavour but b\/c it was just a piece of fish, the texture and overall flavour were off) and the chicken biryani (the rice was soft, the spices were very tame and the chicken felt like it was repurposed from another dish).  \n\nI won't be back for sure and will stick some of the AYCE places in Toronto.
828	Scott's Generations is hands down the best east coast-style deli in the valley, particularly for breakfast. It's just as cheap as Denny's down the street and about ten times more satisfying and wholesome. \n\nTheir baked goods and bagels are crisp, chewy perfection. No perpetrating steam oven biscuit bagels here like Breuggers or Einsteins.  And there's plenty of cream cheese options to schmear to your heart's content. \n\nI'm usually a pretty flexible diner, rotating through a menu to try new things, but here I get one thing and one thing only every time. Brandi's Breakfast Special for only four bucks: two eggs over easy, home fries and a garlic bagel with chive cream cheese.\n\nI guarantee that meal will sink like a satisfying rock to the bottom of your stomach and keep you full for hours. With coffee and tip the whole thing will set you back about eight bucks.\n\nEnjoy the surly granny wait staff that'll call you doll or sugar, and treat yourself to a black and white cookie on the way out. Trust me.
829	Super nice staff and the bakery smells amazing! The croissants were deliciously buttery and flakey. I bought a bunch back home to share with family and friends. They loved it! \n\nThe bakery is very small with limited seating.
830	DO NOT RENT FROM BOARDWALK. I've lived in Madison for 5 years as a student and I've never had a worse experience with a management\/landlord company. Our landlord has confused our MGE bills throughout the whole year of 2014-2015. My 3 roommates and I are now recalculating all of our bills because Boardwalk claims there is no record of us paying any bill whatsoever to MGE or Boardwalk. They are VERY untrustworthy, disorganized and RUDE. I can truthfully say that every encounter I have had with Boardwalk Investments, whether it be stopping by their office to drop off rent, or discuss a bill complication with an employee, has been very RUDE. They don't have an ounce of compassion and have never been flexible about anything. They're always short with you, and I've even had them roll their eyes at me. It's fine if the company has no manners at all as long as they can figure out our bills correctly. But they can't even do that. I really believe that they're just trying to take your money, because they charge us for everything, and even claim that we haven't paid any bills for a full year. Also, one of our roommates paid rent a day late. So she went and spoke to them about it, because it's ONE DAY LATE. They reversed the late fee on it, and a few months recharged her for it. What kind of professional company re-charges a fee once an agreement has been made to waive it??
831	I don't do scathing reviews -- most places have the tiniest redeeming quality that allows me to look past all the suck just a little bit. Not Co-Op. Don't walk; RUN away. \n\nI've been coming here since I was in high school. The effort it took to find a new eye doctor outweighed how much I hated coming here; hence my years of patronage. Dr. Feldman is a decent eye doctor, and he is friendly. I have no problem with him. The rest of the staff, however, is terrible. Co-Op is, first and foremost, a business. That means that they will stop at no end to keep you buying overpriced, ugly frames from them; even if it really isn't in your best interest. A couple of years ago I broke my only pair of glasses and they wouldn't give me my prescription to get glasses right away at another place, because \"it will only take a few days more\" and \"we're so much less expensive!\". Fine, except I'm legally blind and really shouldn't be driving around in glasses I haven't worn since elementary school. They are rude and condescending, and I have literally been bullied into buying my glasses from them. \n\nI stopped in today to get my prescription so I could order new glasses online, and the woman at reception was insanely rude. She called me \"honey\" and then proceeded to smirk and tell me that no one would sell me glasses with my prescription being 2 years old. She begrudgingly handed over a piece of paper with only the bare minimum - I had to call them later and badger them into giving me my PD.  \n\nI realise that it's their job to sell eyewear. But they'd be wise to learn to do it with a little bit more class and tact. Until that happens, it's finally time for me to find a new eye doctor.
832	We were looking for a chapel to host our 10 year vow renewal, but wanted to stay clear of anything cheesy. Oh - and do it on the 4th of July, a holiday. We spent hours on the web looking at chapels and finally found Mon Bel Ami. From the moment we emailed them Carrie was helpful in guiding me through exactly what we wanted. I was a bit skeptical - we've all seen some movies about Vegas chapels. I am also very picky about photography, so we figured we do the minimum and call it good. At the last minute, Carrie emailed us with a photo package special and we took a chance. We are so glad we did! Everything exceeded our expectations. Our limo bus for 16 never showed at the hotel, so already we're running late. We called, and the ladies said we were ok. We got there, and the staff was incredibly sweet making sure I was ok, spent some time calming my husband and got everyone settled as they arrived in separate taxis. The flowers were more beautiful than I imagined. The chapel was absolutely perfect. Tony, the officiant, spent time with me and my husband asking us how we'd like the ceremony to go. It was quick, but very lovely. Just what we wanted And the photos after were more than we expected. The photographer was so kind and worked with us and our family to get shots of people that we requested, then took us outside for a few of just us. They turned out fabulous and we are so glad we purchased the extra photo package. They are very much invested in making your experience the best it can be. Give them a call. You'll be glad you did!
833	If you think you have tried the best sandwich you have ever had--you haven't. \n\nAnd you don't have to trust me on that. In fact, I urge you to test my theory and go to Gabe's yourself. Because these sandwiches made my face fall off--that's how good they are.\n\nFirst, let me get this out of the way... Gabe is a sandwich god. Don't question it, just trust his taste combos and let yourself melt into Flavortown. And if you can help it, try not to take away ingredients or sub anything out. I doubt it would ruin these sammies, but still. Gabe knows what he's doing. \n\nSecond, I feel like Cleveland has been missing a damn good deli for a while now and I couldn't be happier that it's Gabe's filling that void. \n\nMy mother and I stopped in for a late lunch and found an empty restaurant. We stood in awe of the menu because every sandwich looked amazing. We settled on the Tower City (me) and The Deer Hunter (mom) and decided to swap halves to try them both. Tower City is like a deluxe club featuring toasted sourdough packed with turkey, ham, bacon, white cheddar, shredded lettuce and sliced tomato. The Deer Hunter is tender roast beef, cheddar, lettuce-tomato-onion and homemade horseradish sauce on a farm roll. \n\nThe Tower City came out and I realized I was already staring wide-eyed, pondering how I was going to unhinge my jaw to eat this beautiful \"tower\" of goodness. Yes, the name is appropriate. If you're thinking a club sandwich is just a club sandwich... YOU ARE WRONG. I want to die eating this sandwich. It's perfect in every.single.way. And it's big enough for two meals. The Deer Hunter was just as delicious, and I'm really not an onion or mayo-based sauce kind of person. But the combo of these ingredients together made this one of the best things I've ever tasted. And that roast beef was some kind of tender perfection. When we managed to come up to breathe, my mom and I mumbled these things to each other: \n\n\"Jeezus... I just want to live in this sandwich.\"\n\"I just can't stop eating it. It's so good I just can't stop...\" \n\"What this guy does here is magical. He makes magic sandwiches.\" \n\"I want this every day of my life.\" \n\nOh, and they have Old City Soda. If you haven't tried this stuff, you're in for a great surprise of goodness. \n\nI can't wait to come back to try their brunch items, homemade, traditional deli sides and bagel sandwiches.
834	I can't believe there's a hot dog on a stick that's not in a mall. I was just driving by and really needed a place to go to the restroom before my CPR class and BAM! Hot Dog On A Stick definitely caught my eye. There were two people working and another family inside. The drive thru was busy so I had to wait, and so I decided to use the restroom to waste some time. I came back and she was ready for me, perfect timing! Their menu is small but very much worth the price. I got the meal with one stick, fries, and a drink. I chose an american cheese on a stick...my favorite! I was so tempted to get the meal that had two sticks because of course I wanted a hot dog, but I was in a hurry so I couldn't really enjoy my food as much as I really wanted to. I got the cherry lemonade, my faaaaaave. I want to just go there and buy that all on its own. They have a yelp check in discount, BONUS! And really friendly service. Though it might take a minute, it's definitely worth the tiny wait! :) Hot Dog Heaven!
835	We've been going to Vegas twice a year for the past 10 years or so. Normally, on Friday nights we go the Seafood buffet. Usually the snow crab legs make the buffet a good buy. This past Friday (12\/1\/17) - the crab legs were tiny. Think I've seen crabs on Oahu beaches with legs this size. I would normally give this place at least 4 stars but not this time. In fact, my wife said 2 stars are too many.
836	My experience at Happy Dog started off quite awful and ended up with a happy ending. A group of four of us went the other day after the art parade to et some food, the place was crowded so we waiting to grab the first open table. Once finally finding a table we ended up waiting over 10 minutes for someone to come by and hopefully clean our table. The waitress cake by and told us she couldn't clean the table but the bus boy who was backed up would be by shortly. As someone who is also a server you can AND SHOULD HELP clean your tables. She didn't even bother to ask our drinks after that and just walked away. Another 20-30 minutes went buy and nobody came by. I understand to busy but come on at least say something nice to us or grab a drink. After waiting we ended up just asking the bartender to take our order, cleaned off the table ourself and grabbed our own waters. The bartender was super friendly got out food out which was AMAZING pretty quickly and even came by to check on us! Overall though we had a much better experience at the other location and probably will my be returning to this one.
837	This place was a blast! Did the lost Dutchman's mine. Finished it with 2 mins to spare. If you haven't been here in about a year or more you have to go! They have been expanding! By far the best escape room place around.
838	Went early on a Tuesday night and felt like I was prepared for a casual bar type atmosphere with quality food.  Staff was very friendly and attentive, from the hostess to the waitress.  Cool design, however it becomes very loud as the entire place is made of concrete, metal, and stone.  Huge bar but a surprisingly small list of \"house\" drinks.  Now for the bad.  Order the shrimp quesadilla which had a few large shrimp with a very dry cheese, peppers, and onions. The filling was ok but should have used some kind of a \"melty\" cheese.  The problem was that instead of using a soft flour type of tortilla they used a hard shell type of tortilla.  Not good at all.  My wife had the spinach salad which was ok but the spinach wilted rapidly and the dressing was really thin.  The biggest problem was the \"deluxe burger\" for $13 I was expecting a juicy decent sized burger with bacon and cheese.  The roll was excellent however despite ordering my burger medium it came out very well which was strange as it had no sign of it being on a grill or flat top.  Just cool and grey.  Originally they brought out the burger with only a piece of lettuce on it and nothing else.  I told them it was not what I ordered and they brought back the same burger with just a squirt of mayo on it and lettuce.  Again I explained this is not what I ordered.  She brought back the same burger with a tiny piece of unmelted hard cheese and some sort of chopped up bacon topping.  They should have at least offered to make a new burger vs carrying the same cold overcooked burger back and forth three times.  It was maybe a quarter of an inch thick and clearly was not hand made.  School lunch burger on a great roll. I hope they figure it out but I doubt we will be back.
839	I have been to this location 3 times and unfortunately will not return. The first visit there were a few ingredients missing from the order, but as they had just opened, I let it slide. Each subsequent visit unfortunately has just not improved with issues ranging from lack of service to menu mistakes and more (15 min to get drinks, much longer to place an order for meals, food lacking flavor, tacos missing ingredients listed on the menu, etc).\nI'm not sure why consistency is such an issue, but the food and service here has never been as good as the original location. I will continue to visit the Old Town restaurant, but will not be back to this one.
840	I was in Vegas for a trade show and popped into Chica for a drink and an app at the bar. I ended up ordering the grilled octopus and the arepas with braised short rib on top. Both were SO good. The octopus was crunchy because of the quinoa and the peppers had a great bite. The arepas were delicious and the short rib on top was sweet and juicy. \n\nI loved the meal so much that I ended up making a reservation for the following night for a group dinner. Yet again AMAZING. Everyone at the table said it was the best meal they had had in Vegas. We started with the empanadas (I would actually skip on these next time) and the grilled octopus. Next we each got a different entree, but everything looked amazing. Since I loved the arepas from the night before so much, I ordered the braised short rib. One of the best meals I've ever had! It has raw sugar in it so it's a little sweet and it has slightly crispy edges. It's on top three different sauces that I honestly am not sure what they are, but they're great!! \n\nThe cocktails were just as good as the food and we finished it off with lemon donuts. I will recommend this restaurant to anyone going to Vegas!
841	Had this place bookmarked for a while after hearing other yelpers recommend in Yelp Talk. \n\nCame here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. \n\nExterior looks like one of those old style Diners. Inside, totally not what i expected. Yeah it still had the diner's look for the tables\/seating but the kitchen area was re-vamped. \n\nIn a way like a fast food kitchen, kind of, more like Capriotti's style kitchen ? \n\nBeing a restaurant that was featured on food network? travel channel? ... of course i had to check out their specialty item. The \"Award Winning Italian Beef\". 3 different choices to pick. Regular Al, Big Al, or Al's Combo Beef and Sausage with options to add more meat to the regular or big Al's. Also the option to add homemade \"Hot\" or sweet peppers, provolone, cheddar, or american cheese at the cost of 45 cents EACH. \n\nI had read on yelp a little before hand and people recommended to have it dipped as well as add hot peppers. So thats what i did. Someone also had a tip to have it double dipped but i feared it may make it too soggy? so i opt'ed for dipped. XD \n\nMy order came out pretty fast. Double-wrapped on a tray. I grabbed a decent amount of napkins because i knew it may get a bit messy because of the sandwich being dipped. \n\nFor those who dont know what \"dipped\" means. Its when they dip the entire sandwich into au jus or similar, having the entire sandwich soaked in juice, including the bread ! \n\nAfter opening the wrap, it was pretty soaked. XD i dont want to imagine how double dipped would be like @_@ i tried eating the sandwich with it wrapped on the bottom but it was too much of a hassle. And went hands in =D (lol... )\n\nJuicy sandwich. Yes soaked bread. When i had ordered this sandwich, i didn't know they were putting a whole sausage vs sausage slices. Good and bad. Depends how you like it. Whole sausage takes up space which means not much beef. But if you like sausage, you get a whole sausage XD \n\nAs i had mentioned before, i had added hot peppers. didn't really notice it much. yeah overall it was a little spicy (not sure if it was because of the peppers or the sauce\/juice sandwich was dipped in) but it wasnt as spicy as i had hoped. i like spicy :D \n\nOverall, not a bad sandwich. May be a little small for the price in comparison to other places but you cant really compare this place to like subway or anything. its just different. Would prefer it maybe a little bigger, and have a little more beef in the beef and sausage combo. \n\nService is good. There was a guy just going around collecting finished trays and cleaning up. Didn't expect that. +1 for him :D \n\nThe bathroom is super cold ! LOL i know it doesnt have to do with anything but omg its like they have a separate unit for the bathroom XD
842	Stopped in after picking up my car and super satisfied!\nThis place is adorable and an absolute gem\nGot the Udon with shrimp tempura and the baked lobster roll \nGreat music, service and vibes
843	The sandwich artist who assembled my footlong turkey and provolone was polite, helpful and provided me with a well stuffed and properly assembled sandwich. The ingredients appeared fresh (other than the lettuce that needed a little help and some of the tomatoes in the stack had some core). She seemed a little disappointed that I did not want a \"combo\" and had a bottle of water I brought with me.\n\nThe restaurant was clean though one of the tables had some trash on it that was cleaned while I sat there.\n\nNice, helpful, good. Four stars.
844	whoever thought the idea of all you can eat sushi would be a good idea was an idiot. a group of 18 and i went to Yama at 2pm for AYCE sushi. at least half of us were hungover, so the thought of scarfing down roll after roll didn't sound that appealing to me. but i'm never one to turn down a buffet opportunity so i gave in.\n\ni was so confused about the ordering process of the place. i totally imagined a bar with tons of different types of sushi that we can pick up ourselves. instead, we filled out the menus, which were then sent to the sushi chefs ... i think there were at least 3, to be made. for a sushi buffet, i was impressed that they still made their food fresh. there were so many different types of rolls, as well as their own concocted ones, which had really interesting, yet inappropriate names to it. \n\none of my friends ordered the wet dream (that was really sweet), and other rolls donned names like who's yo daddy and happy ending and more nasty names that i wish i remembered. i had the harry potter, which had tuna on top and was a cucumber roll. \n\nthe buffet also extended to appetizers and desserts. the seafood salad was awesome and our table was filled with different flavors of mochi (vanilla, strawberry, mango, and like 3 more flavors) and ice cream (green tea, red bean, plum!!!) by the end of the meal. also, everyone lost track of what they ordered, so we all ended up taking a roll or two and passing it down the table. so i had no idea what i was eating most of the meal. eventually all the rolls began to look and taste the same. some had different names but was identical in ingredients. \n\nit got really bad by the end because all the rolls came first and then the sushi. we ended up with like 6 full plates of salmon and the same amount of tuna that everyone claims they didn't order. the rule was that we had to finish everything, or else we had to pay for everything we ordered at individual prices, which would have cost a fortune. thankfully my table had some eaters and we were able to demolish most of the sushi and rolls. \n\nconsidering how the sushi is intended for buffet use, with lesser quality of ingredients, everything was still really good. definitely worth the $22.99 for AYCE sushi.\n\nand major props to our two or three waitresses accommodating a 19 person group. :)\n\nwould i do it again? yes! but give me a few months to recover :)
845	I love filipino food, and love to try different restaurants. However this place probably has the poorest service. The interior is fancier than most filipino resturants, the food was good... But the service whomp whoomp whooomp. We asked for soup when we ordered our food.. We got our food and no soup. A couple minutes later the lady came and apologize for not giving us soup... More than half way through our meal still NO soup. We tried to look for someone and they just seemed busy talking.. Ended our meal upset because the lady even asked about our soup and still didn't even give it to us even when it wasn't busy yet they were sitting there chit chatting. Not cool. Won't be coming back.
846	Went there cause it was the closest to the baseball diamond we were playing at. Nothing special. Average pizza  seating isn't great either. All in all your local mom and pop pizza joint in the middle of rexdale.
847	Arrived at Houlihans on a Tuesday a little after 5:00. We were shown to a table in the bar which was strange because the dining room was empty. But ok. Soon after we order an older man comes in trying to pick up older women. Ok. The check comes and I give the waitress a birthday certificate which gives you one free entree with the purchase of another. Soon a manager? comes over to tell us since we ordered two sandwiches we were not entitled to one free.   I wasn't aware that a 50 cent difference in an entree and a sandwich would cause the certificate to be invalid. The way the menu reads it really doesn't state the entrees. Needless to say we paid for both sandwiches about 25.00. No offer of a free dessert to make up for it. To add insult to injury my husband lost his crown eating his chicken sandwich. All in all a terrible experience. We will never be back! Very bad customer service.
848	Not impressed with the \"featured\" greens drink- someone must have mixed up the ratios of cucumber and celery, because there's no reason for what I drank to be so overwhelmingly bitter. Not sure if the specific person who helped me is to blame or if their drink ingredients are simply a rough guideline to follow. I make green juices regularly at home, but clearly no attempt was made at balancing the flavors in this drink.\n\nIn addition to fresh juices, menu also includes smoothies and a host of acai bowls- trying the peanut butter version is next on my list. Didn't notice until after I ordered at the counter that they have bottled cold-press juices (which I prefer) in the refrigerated case: I'll stick to those next time.\n\nLocation is by the Macy's entrance, you'll know you're near if you see the Bath and Body Works or Brighton stores.
849	This place is bad all around.\nParking is bad, wait time is bad, service is bad, food is bad, and you pay way too much for everything bad.\n\nI've wanted to come here, seeing it on top of the hill everytime I pass by it driving I-10 going somewhere else. And now that I've experienced it I warn you this place is bad.\n\nThe good thing I can say is that the view is good.
850	My go to at Wynn. Their orange beef is fantastic - reminds me of great NY Chinese food. They do a banana spring roll type dessert that is not to be missed ! Service is always fast and friendly. Give it a try, you'll be glad you did.
851	I'm so excited to find this adorable nail shop with friendly and quality service! The shop is decorated with a mermaid theme and smells great. I felt very relaxed to spend my Sunday afternoon here getting pampered. \n\nJaxx and Angie were both incredibly sweet and welcoming. I got the Gel Mani-Spa Pedi package. I didn't have to purchase through Groupon and they still honored the $35 deal. Jaxx did both of my mani and pedi with creative advices from Angie, and the results were amazing! I love their attention to details, genuine attitude, and professional services and products. Thank you ladies for the lovely nails, I can't wait to come back!
852	Awesomeness!! \n\nStore is SUPER Clean!!\n\nGreat Selection Of Furniture, Wall Units, Home Decor,  Electronics, Carpet, and Flooring!! This Store Has ALOT Of Cool Deals For Your Home!! Something For Everyone. \n\nAmazingly Friendly & Helpful  Staff!!\n\nKrista in Carpet\/ Flooring Was Very Friendly  Professional, Helpful and Easy To Work With! I Definitely Recommend Her!\n\nGreat Store and Great Location! I Highly Recommend Visiting This Location. :)
853	Hit or miss for service, have had good service and poor.  Just spent 20 minutes in the drive through for a coffee - if your in a hurry defiantly go elsewhere.
854	Let me start this review by saying that there is a lot of really cool stuff in this store. The small store in Downtown Container park is stocked with gorgeous original artwork of pretty much any Disney character you can think of. They also have some really cute figurines and other collectables. If you are a Disney fan, this place really is a must stop. And if you have some money to burn, you might find yourself taking something home.\n\nIf you can physically take it home, that is. If you are visiting Las Vegas on vacation, as people are known to do from time to time, and want them to ship a purchase home to you well ... not so much. And here in lies the reason behind me giving out a VERY rare one-star review.\n\nAs I was exploring DTCP, I decided to stop in the Disney Fine Art store to look around. It was the day before Valentine's Day, and I thought I might find something here for my wife, who is a huge Disney fan. Most of the store is filled with really cool original paintings ... they're not cheap, but they have some fantastic pieces. I didn't see anything that I felt confident my wife would like, so I was hesitant to pull the trigger on an expensive piece of artwork. But I noticed these cute figurines in the back. They had one that was Kermit and Miss Piggy dining together ... my wife LOVES the Muppets, especially Kermit, so I thought this would be a perfect gift, and was entirely affordable and reasonable at $25. I asked the attendant working if they could ship it to me and she noted that it came in a box that would keep it safe. But I was doing carry-on only and was already tight on space, and I didn't want to risk it being broken, so I paid an extra $8 to have it delivered. I gave them my home address, paid with my credit card, and got a crappy handwritten receipt, plus an e-receipt via Square. \n\nAfter a couple of weeks went by I never received either a package, nor a message from the store stating that the package was shipped, with a tracking number provided. I called the store and got a guy who was very nice and apologetic and took my information, said he would look into it, and would call me back immediately with a status update. \n\nA couple of weeks pass again, and I've heard nothing. I don't have time to track down things I've already paid for and figure out why they haven't been shipped to me yet, so I wrote it off as a lost cause. But I figured I'd give them another chance. I called again and spoke to a lady who said she was the new store manager and that they had been busy planning a new store opening, and she was just gaining an understanding of what had been done there, etc. I didn't need to hear her story, but she sounded sincere, apologetic, and seemed like someone who had their stuff together. Finally, I thought, I'll be able to get this really cool gift that my wife would LOVE and that I have paid for delivered to me. The lady found my information on file, apologized for it \"slipping through the cracks\" and would contact me back by close of business with a tracking number.\n\nSo guess what happened next? If you guessed nothing ... DING DING DING, you're today's big winner. I waited about 5 days, heard nothing, and filed a dispute for a refund through my credit card company. \n\nAgain, let me stress that the merchandise they sell here is fantastic - some really cool stuff. If you live in the Las Vegas area and can buy and take the merchandise home that day - and afford it - you will be happy. But if they can't ship a product I bought onsite, and paid to have shipped, within a month then they should think about making their one store function properly before opening others.
855	My husband and I have been to this location several times to look at guns and even bought my first gun here.  Recently I have taken two classes here and both of them were excellent.  There were a different instructor for each class and both of them were really good.  I really liked that they didn't treat the women in the classes any differently than the men, which is a big deal to me because when it comes to gun shops women aren't always treated the same.  The instructors were very knowledgeable in regards to what they taught and made the classes feel comfortable and relaxed.  Being someone who doesn't have a ton of gun knowledge I'm so happy I went to Caswells for their classes and I'll be going back again to take some more classes.
856	Reading reviews still decided to give them a chance. Stay away 0 customer service. \nThe car I chose and prepaid was not available. Had to wait for vehicle, was not what I expected, car was substandard. Also made the mistake of not checking the fuel tank. It was not full. Tried to reach them immediately after leaving rental place regarding fuel issue. Unable to communicate with anyone at both telephone numbers listed. Snapped a picture of the fuel tank and mileage. Upon returning car explain problem with fuel. Zero acknowledgement.\n They ended up charging  an additional $30.\n Pay the extra money go with the reliable rental company. The other problem is they are located off-off site, resulting into shuttle buses.
857	\"Maybe I'll get a burger\" said a young man who hadn't been to The Beast before. The five Torontonians who accompanied him all shook their head laughing \"NOO. No food.\" \nAnyone who came of age in Toronto spent many University nights getting drunk in this basement hole.\n\nThey have personal pitchers of all mixed drinks for cheap and on Thursdays they do draws and you can win things. Great things, like peach schnapps. Be prepared to pay as you go throughout the night. The men in crew neck sweaters don't trust you. \n\nAmong the worst bathrooms in the city. There are no words. \n\nPEPPER POINTS For their hidden back patio.
858	I am 62 and have eaten all over the world.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever seen.  The outdoor patio, which welcomes dogs, smells like fresh dog feces.  The blaring TV's make any conversation impossible.  The wait staff is poorly trained, unfriendly, and useless.  The food is horrible and ridiculously overpriced.  $15.95 for a steak salad that had at most 2 ounces of tough steak and wouldn't qualify as a side salad quantity at any other restaurant.  It was overdressed by a factor of 5 at least and was a soggy mess.  Do not waste your time or money at this place.
859	What isn't to love about Thomas Street? They have the best patio ever out back. The food is really good actually. But I love going there for the awesome drink specials and corn hole.
860	Ikea is like going on a adventure! Be prepared to spend a lot of time here because they have it all. \n\nI've bought some furniture here and I can't complain about the quality. My kids rooms are full of their furniture and it's taken their abuse, so that's a plus. You can furnish a room for less than a grand...yes, please!!\n\nYou can't leave Ikea without at least trying their meatballs once. The other stuff they sell is pretty tasty too. I've never had a complaint about their food. \n\nAll in all, you have to at least stop by once!
861	While I usually don't review chain stores, I felt compelled to do so today after my visit to the the Steelyard Petco. I was greeted immediately upon entering the store. A staff member walked me to the aisle and helped me locate everything I needed. Everyone there was so nice. The store had everything I was looking for. As I checked out an employee took true interest in me. They asked about the cat food I had selected and even asked to see pictures of my pets. It was a great experience. I felt like a valued customer and I will definitely return to the Steelyard Petco!
862	Well, the service was really good. But I swear it was impossible to focus on anything but the 8,000,000 televisions. I'm not old fashioned but I'd be lying if it didn't grab every bit of my attention and my wife hated it haha. \n\nThe food was mediocre at best and I'd rather go somewhere quieter and a bit less visually overloading. Although, I learned ChiveTV is a thing and completely enthralling. \n\nImagine Texas Roadhouse with a tv on every surface of every wall and 'meh' food. That's the best way to describe it.
863	Im always a bit skeptical about ridiculously high priced chinese food that is in a place that probably caters to mostly non-chinese people.  \nHowever, the food here was pretty good.  I usually would give it three stars for being good but overpriced, but thinking about it, I realized that it should get 4 stars for being overpriced chinese food but still tasty!\nSurprise surprise!  \nBad thing is that it didnt have the real chile sauce.   Oh well cant be too greedy.\nThe other nice thing is that eating there feels like a very clean homey feel of a dingy delicious hole in the wall chinese restaurant but it was in the Venetian. \nService is slow.
864	I HATE Blue Wasabi. I had the WORST experience here. You couldn't pay me to consume that repulsive crap they call \"Sushi\". \nQuick summary of my experience.... My boyfriend and I went on a date. We sat on the patio. It took FOREVER to get our food. Granted it was kinda busy, we only ordered 2 rolls & some edamame. It shouldn't take an hour & a half. The waiter offered no apologies or explanation. The rice was sooo stale & dry. Sushi looked like it had been sitting out for an hour. We couldn't even choke it down. It was horrible, no joke. \nThen some poor girls purse was stolen right from the patio. Some dickhead drove up to the patio, his friend jumped out & snatched this womans purse who was dining on the patio. \nIt was a horrible experience. Blue Wasabi SUCKS!
865	Ok. I've been to all three Hash Kitchen's now. My family was excited about the new chandler location cause it's closer to them but really far for me. Anyways, I'm always game to go to Hash Kitchen. \n\nWe got a big table towards the back. Huge wooden table that fit 9 people comfortable. I didn't even have to come through the front door but come in through the back side door because I saw our table. So I didn't even get to experience what the whole restaurant was like but it's just like all the other Hash Kitchen 's on the weekends. DJ playing loud music and lots of people. \n\nI had the Asian Chicken Sandwich which had coleslaw. The bread was really fresh and the chicken and slaw was really good. Really good combination. It works really well together. It was perfect. Was great with the fries. Really filling and I loved it. Gave a bite to my wife and she really liked it too.\n\nMy son and wife got the Huevos Rancho Hash. They thought it was okay. The beef was a little over cooked but other than that it was pretty good. Everyone else really enjoyed their meal too. \n\nWe ended our meal with Cannoli Donuts. These are freshly fried donuts with the Cannoli inside in the hole of the donut. So you get the freshness of the donut with the sweetness of the Cannoli and it was so good. Really loved it\n\nI thought the service was really good. We had Katrina and she was very good. Very friendly. Kept our water cups and coffee cups filled. We even had the manager Dominic come by and make sure our meal was satisfactory. He was very friendly and took care of us. The only problem we had was with the kitchen. They brought out half of the tables food and we were waiting for the other half for awhile. The people who got their food finished half way by the time we got our food. The server and manger apologized and tried to get our food out as quickly as possible. \n\nSo the place is just like the other Hash Kitchens. Very crowded. Very loud with DJ. Very good food but decent service due to the kitchen. We were also told that this location is the experiment menu. They try it out here before the menu item goes out to the other locations. So if you want to try new item on the menu then this is the place to go to. \n\nWe love HK and we will be back. Enjoy cause we did.
866	Boooo hiss. \n\nNot a fan - they were not careful at all and my cuticles were mangled after this. I live down town so cheap nail places aren't hard to find and the one near me takes their time for the same price. These girls were not the kindest to my friend or I even when we tried making polite conversation and left great tips. Language barriers aside - a smile is pretty universal...so is being all rammy-jammy with sharp nail tools...\n\nNa thanks. Not sure what the raves are about but I will be sticking to my own place now.
867	wah! this store is such a trap, just like shoppers. i promised myself I wouldn't buy anything, and guess what happened?!! \n\nThere's way too much useful gadgets type things in here, and good sales. \n\nEverything I see, I'm like, \"I can use that\" and have to think twice, or three times whether I would actually use it, or have an alternative already at home. And standing in line is the worst, because I was so distracted with all the little things around me that I didn't know what the cashier was telling me. It all happened in a daze\n\nThey have bathroom, stuff, storage things, picture frames, kitchen gadgets and dishes.
868	I wish I could transport this place to Chicago - if Cafe Santropol were in Chicago I'd be here constantly.  Though I'm sure the garden is better enjoyed in daytime, I wound up here on a warm lovely night and still enjoyed sitting outside (bonus: spot the cats!  Those with cat allergies and\/or opposed to dining in restaurants with animals should choose another establishment).\n\nI ordered the No. 13 (the menus are in French and English, yay!), which is a giant sandwich on brown bread with blackcurrant jam, bananas, honey and cream cheese...and, lettuce.  The lettuce was weird, though overall the sandwich was quite good.  Other reviewers are right, Cafe Santropol is seriously heavy on the cream cheese and it seems to be featured in almost every sandwich. I also ordered a chai soy latte, which was great.  You can tell they actually brew the tea rather than using the prepackaged stuff like most places do.\n\nI lingered far after I was done eating, just enjoying the ambiance on the patio (and yes, fine, eavesdropping on my fellow diners).  I never felt rushed or as though the staff wanted me to leave.  Cafe Santropol would be great for lunch or dinner and would also be a fantastic place to waste a few hours with friends.  If only we had something like this at home...
869	No problems ordering at this Papa Murphy's and the pizzas are always tasty. Their cookies are pretty good too. Instructions are clear and easy to follow. We recently had a half Hawaiian and half pepperoni at home which was filled with toppings, and ended our meal with some tasty mint chocolate chip cookies. I do wish they were open later though!
870	My stomach was growling for tacos when I saw the Pepe's on my left. A quick U-Turn on Rainbow, and I was there. My only regret was not being able to sample more of their meaty tacos. I tried the Al Pastor, Lengua, and Cabeza; all three were outstanding. The salsa rojo was spicy and flavorful, the place was very clean, and I will be back for more. And the best part is that I will soon be living very close to this location.
871	100% recommend, we are so very happy with every photo, Karen creatively captured our beautiful wedding day!!!  We couldn't be any happier, thank you so much Karen!!!
872	So disappointed in this event. I'm grateful that people are so fond of food trucks but I'm super unhappy that I didn't get to participate in the way that I wanted.\n\nThe traffic was horrible. Did they not cap the ticket sales? For 25 food trucks, there were 13,000 people? That's 520 people per truck - no wonder it took several hours for people to wait in line and get food! No normal restaurant can serve that many people.\n\nPlanning was awful, parking was awful. Charging for parking, ticket entry, AND food? Wow.\n\nDear Salt River Fields, next time CAP THE TICKET SALES -- maybe a few thousand at most. Charge more if you have to (clearly people are interested). Invite more food trucks!
873	Oh my, the crowd was awesome but the bartender Sue was very rude and told me she won't make me a bloody Mary because I'm not playing enough but we had just been gambling the whole time and been playing 80 dollars in less then a half hour. She is terrible! Never again wil I sit at the bar with her behind it!
874	This is by far the best Italian place I've ever eaten at!!  This is the 3rd time I've eaten here and it never dissapoints. You have to try the steak and cheese sandwich, stuffed shells, and the chicken pesto pasta is a must! I'd give it ten stars if I could.
875	Since moving to another place in the center city, this isn't my go to pub, but still a good place for food in the evening and partying upstairs in the late night.
876	I am surprised to see that I have not yet Yelped this TJ's.\nThis is quite close to me and I have been going here for years.\nI always love it . \nIt is clean,and well laid out. They are always there to help you find what you are looking for. Fruit is great, although sometimes you cannot always get what you want. I think they go more for what is in season. You cannot complain about that.\nI have tried a many item here. Some are amazily fantastic. Like the Italian finger cookies we got there once. That is the best Finger cookies that I have ever found in the Valley.\nI even got some the last time I was in San Diego, they could not compare.\nMy sister even shops here all the time.\nThey seem to always have some type of sample for something going on most days.\nParking can be tricky, so you have to watch the cars around you when pulling out.\nStore is clean and well stocked.\nBut, as I have been told, read the labels.
877	So this was my first time taking a class @ Flex Ed & it was through work. We have an education building that our classes are held in, not sure why TNCC wasn't being held there & they were using Flex Ed this time around? \nI always get a little nervous when having to take a class for one of my nursing certs @ a new place with instructors I've never had before. \n\nAs you can see I'm giving Flex Ed 5 stars & highly recommend coming here for your educational needs. I registered to renew my TNCC cert. through work back in March for a one day class in Sept. I was hearing from co-workers that the one day renewal was hard & decided to switch to the 2 day certification class but I wasn't able to switch it because it said it was full through my work education app. \n\nI stopped by one morning on my way home from work to pick up my TNCC book because I wanted to get started in reviewing. The hours are posted outside the door saying its not opened until 9am but it was open you just have to ring a little buzzer. Someone let me inside & I went to the counter & told the lady I was there to pick up my TNCC book. She looked me up & couldn't' find me listed for the class. I was like \"I signed up back in March\" & showed her my copy of my registration & she told me she didn't know what she was looking at. She mentioned that Justin didn't usually release the participants of the class till about 30 days before it starts. I was there less then the 30 days. I was a little annoyed because I basically wasted a trip out there & I wasn't able to get my book to get studying. I asked the lady if there was any room in the 2 day class & she told me \"yes.\" I asked her if she could switch me cause @ my job it says its full. Well guess they close the classes apx. 30 days before it starts so no one can sign up for it. \n\nShe tried calling Justin (I believe he's the IT manager ??) to see if he could sign me up for the 2 day class & he didn't answer. He actually called me later. After jumping through a few hoops he was able to get me signed up for the 2 day class. I had a co-worker who let me borrow his TNCC book & when I brought it home & hunted for my TNCC book from 4 years ago I realized it was the same edition so I didn't need to run back to Flex Ed to get my book. \n\nI was dreading the 2 day class. Hours listed was Thursday & Friday 7:30am-6:30pm. Those are long days of sitting in a classroom & listening to lectures. Well it actually ended up not being bad @ all & the days went by fast. I never once fell asleep in class....lol \n\nWe had more then one instructor & they were all great & knowledgeable. They even brought us bagels the first day, had snacks for us after lunch & pastries the next day for breakfast. Super sweet!! Thank you again!! \n\nI brought a cooler bag with some drinks & snacks for myself and I had planned on going out for lunch on the first day as there are many places close by to grab something to eat. Some are within walking distance such as McDonalds, Dell Taco, The Cracked Egg, Joe Philly's (Italian rest. which supposedly has a $5 pizza slice & drink special but they take a long time) & French Gourmet. We got an hour each day so plenty of time. \n\nThey have vending machines too. They only take change\/cash no credit cards. I believe the sodas were only $1.00...awesome sauce! Coke products. The only thing I was bummed about is that they don't have a refrigerator for us to use & store our lunch in for those who want to bring their own food\/drinks. \n\nIt was interesting to learn that a few of the nurses in the class were from Cali & one from Reno so not everyone is from Vegas. One of our instructors was also from Cali. They all had a pretty extensive nsg background with lots of diff. nsg specialities over their nsg career. They knew what they were talking about for sure! They were clear, spoke in a normal paced manner & used a Power Point slide presentation but it was made from TNCC & they mentioned they were not allowed to add their own slides. They did share some handouts with us. \n\nThe first day of TNCC we had lecture for the beginning of the day & towards the end of the day we did some stations, hands-on in small groups. We learned\/reviewed some stuff such as how to inject an IO, take off a helmet, take a child out of a car seat, inserting OPA's & NPA's. Then we went into a separate classroom in our group & did a hands on TNP. We each had to do one then we did them as a group taking turns on the process. This really helped for the day when we each had to do our own TNP part for the test. \n\nOur instructors were Pat H., Tina, Pat S., Carrie & Mitch. Mitch was new & was getting tested on his lecturing. You could tell he was very nervous when he was giving his lecture to us (which I would have been too!) but I didn't see any nervousness when he was helping with the hands on stations. \n\nIt was a great 2 days & it went by fast. I highly recommend coming here for your educational needs, you won't regret it!!! Thanks again!! :-)
878	I was advised by my local police department (Irvine, California) to contact the Phoenix PD to update and report my situation of a bad business dealing with a Local Used Car Dealership (Speed Auto Sales and Leasing) and the Owner Mike Aminov. \n\nI was able to file my report and given an incident number to be followed up by an investigator...\n\nSpeed Auto Sales and Leasing took my $6000 deposit and tried to keep it... They held my money and even denied they received it... I had to wait 9 months and file complaints with the Attorney General of Arizona to have them help me get my money back...\n\nNow the owner of Speed Auto Sales and Leasing is harassing by email and has threatened to sue me if I do not remove my review from Yelp.... \n\nTHANK YOU PHOENIX POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR PROTECTING ALL CITIZENS... EVEN THE ONES THAT DON'T LIVE IN YOUR CITY...\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE... BE SAFE...
879	Awesome experience!!  Misty was an outstanding sales lady and I would highly recommend hitting Mor if you're in the market.  Tried the room store but they seemed really shady!
880	Wonderful! Friendly, great food & good prices. \nHealthy, quick & the fish is always fresh. Quite a variety as well\nWill be returning at least once a week!
881	I'm not nearly cool or hip enough to be a customer of Barrio. Lucky for me, they don't have a policy that prevents me from paying them a visit once and awhile. Barrio is one of those places that's that's just a bit off the more crowded paths of Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood. That's not to say that it's a quiet place to hang out, actually quite the opposite.\n\nOn the day of our visit, a Friday, probably about 6:30ish, the place was packed. The inside space is pretty tiny and we had to weave and bob our way through to the hostess. We were happy to find out that there were still a few empty tables out on the patio. Speaking of which, if you are able and the weather's cooperating, sit on the patio. It's one of the best in Tremont.\n\nMy first complaint, and I know, it's something I tend to complain about alot in my reviews, is that it was really freakin' loud on the patio. They've got these giant PA system speakers set up outside and I'm pretty sure they were cranked to 11. I'm a firm believer that music, especially in restaurants, should be in the background. It's not a dance club people. I'm sure they do this so that people won't hang around too long.\n\nNext, lets talk about their schtick. Sort of like a Happy Dog for tacos, Barrio has crafted a menu that allows you to build your own tacos from a list of ingredients and toppings. It's basically all they serve aside from a small selection of salsas, guacs and the like. I really dig the concept of keeping it simple but offering essentially unlimited variations on a single theme. The ingredients list is amazing, filled with fresh fixins and just exotic enough to keep it interesting. Oh yeah, and at only $3 each, you can kinda go a little crazy. If you haven't been here before, they've even offered up a selection of pre-designed tacos to help you get started.\n\nOur server busted her ass throughout our time there. I swear I don't think I ever saw her stop moving. The place was busy so we waited a bit for our food order, but we didn't notice too much. The weather was nice, the music was good and our drinks never ran dry. The chips and salsa we had to munch on were just as tasty as all get out. I'm pretty sure they're the reason I could barely finish my third taco.\n\nAnd the tacos, my god the tacos. These things are among the most amazing things I've ever shoved into my mouth. I didn't even mind the fact that most of the sauces wound up in my beard. Just gave me some for later. Anyway, these things are so damn good. I got the Spicy Sapanaro from the recommended tacos list. That Barrio Sauce, I don't know what's in it, but I need it every day. \n\nThe rest were creations of our own that included the Stoner, White Widow and Green Goddess tortillas (a taco encased in a soft flour tortilla, smeared with white queso sauce and then wrapped around a crispy taco? drool) and just about every protein they had on the menu. Get the lengua, trust me. Once you go tongue you'll never go back.\n\nThe beer list, while not that large, does offer some great rotating and seasonal craft beer selections from in and around the region. On the eve of our visit I pounced on the chance to sample a Cleveland-brewed beer from Platform Beer Co. called The Juice - a light, refreshing fruit beer that helped to tame the heat from the tacos. Another thing I wasn't too keen on - serving beer in mason jars. C'mon. This trend needs to go away. Craft beer deserves better.\n\nYeah, we had a pretty damn good experience at Barrio. We're old, so the loud music was bound to irritate and annoy us, and I am a bit of a craft beer snob so the glassware thing was a small thorn in my side, but the food, those tacos, I could eat them every day of my life. Great service, friendly and attentive even at their busiest.  I'm pretty sure they'll be seeing us again soon. Ole mis amigos. Ole indeed.
882	We have been going out our way to go here for lunch for a few years now.  Their lunch specials are reasonably priced and the food is consistently good.  My favorite dishes are their basis sauce with seafood and their pad see ew.    Yummy.  Would definitely recommend this place.  Service is really good as well.  The only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is the soups I have tried have not been as enjoyable as the rest.  Still, we will be back!
883	Not my thing, but sports pubs never are. \n\nFood selection is tiny and very un-vegetable-based. Aging frat boys draped everywhere in cornflower blue biz shirts. Somewhat decent beer selection, and of course, such a concentration of TVs that everyone's face is bathed in zombie-blue light.\n \nHad some pretty dismal service both times I stopped in for a pint, so yeah, I think I'll leave this place to other, more interested parties.
884	Showed up on a Thursday afternoon at 2:30 and they were sold out!!! Returned Friday at 1 and waited about 35 minutes to get my food, but it was well worth the wait. Love the sausage and the chopped brisket!! Great smoked flavor that is not over powering and you get to really enjoy the taste of the meats. If you want good BBQ, put this joint on your bucket list. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.
885	This is my second Cirque du Soleil and they do not disappoint.  The acrobats the flips the rollerblades the bungee cords they bounce up and down on simply amazing. Artistic design and engineering fabulous. The stage choreography and costumes thumbs up.\nThey do have some dark scenes in it because they take you through history but they put a little love in our hearts!!
886	Place was cool staff was so friendly to walk around the showroom is free which is a score!! \nSome awesome cars and other stuff. \nWish the showroom was bigger because it was all amazing. \nOnly gripe is t-shirt $30\nBut can I complain ? when the tour was free
887	I specifically have gone to different stores to be able to get a chicken po boy but no popeyes in the pittsburgh area seems to carry the bread for the sandwich. It's always something when i go here...
888	Great used book store in Plaza Midwood with a very angry cat. \n\nI could stop my review there, but it just wouldn't do justice to the love I have for this place. Amongst rows of shelves, you'll find just about everything here at a great price. The older gentleman that runs the store always knows where whatever you ask for is and his suggestions have never steered me wrong. Sure, he's not exactly brimming with Southern friendliness but he's a straight shooter and knows his books - what more do you want in a bookstore?\n\nThe parking is easy, the hours are convenient and there's just something so mom-and-pop mixed with dive bar mixed with almost-out-of-business-please-help-us that makes it lovable to me. But that damn cat needs to be taken to their house - sometimes I wander into him by accident and his claws have their way with me :'(
889	I've been twice now and have had great experiences both times. The staff is lovely and take pride in there work. I'll definitely be back!\n\nUpdate: I'm disappointed in today's mani-pedi. My nail technician was very nice however didn't really clean-up my cuticles and nails very well. She was too delicate and barely trimmed or pushed back cuticles. I asked about 3 times for fixes (trim dead skin away or paint where she had missed on the side of my nail). And even after asking she still didn't really fix a few of the issues.
890	Levi S. Was an amazing server and made the whole experience amazing. The chicken Marsala was amazing and his recommendation. We will definitely be back and asking for him!
891	For the last 20 minutes, my nose has been running, and my lips have been on fire. Sin City Thai brings the HEAT!  Finally, I found a Thai restaurant that understands how to infuse spice into a dish without compromising the other ingredients.  \n\nThey offer plenty of lunch specials for $6.95, but I was craving spicy chicken with basil for lunch. I ordered Level 3 (out of 5) and instantly knew I was in for a challenge. I like Hot food, but not to the extent where my mouth goes numb and I start crying. The food smelled so spicy and delicious, I couldn't wait to get back to work and eat it. After giving it some thought, I decided to sneak a bite at the first stop light to see how spicy this food really was. Then it hit me--WOW! Not only was this dish hotter than Jennifer Lawrence, it was really good. \n\nThe chicken was cooked perfectly (sliced not ground) and was mixed with white onions, basil, red, and green peppers. However, what I liked most was the fantastic sauce this food was swimming in. I tossed my steamed rice up in there to soak up every last delicious drop. \n\nThe place is casual, and the gentleman who took my order was really nice. My food was ready in 10 minutes which made me nervous. I didn't think you could put a dish together that quickly that packed so many flavors. I really like it here. Next time, I will bring my wife so she can try something else and I could sample it. I know what I am getting! Why mess with perfection?\n\nChallenge accepted Sin City!  I laugh in the face of your level 3. Just kidding-don't hurt me. Level 3 is just fine!
892	Great place with excellent attentive friendly staff. \n\nJust a glance at their menu let's you see this place is doing its own thing and doing it well. \n\nEvery dish out table ordered was great. Putting this place on my list of regular dinner stops. \n\nLooking forward to going back
893	To whomever this concerns.  I was a paying customer for your event on July 1st, rammsteins, Korn and stone sour.  Had purchased my tickets months in advance.  Come the day of the show we arrived 3 hous early.  Hour before the posted 6.00 door opening time we lined up at the doors. Doors opened 15 minutes late....  then came the other problem. Not a single form of crowd control existed upon the doors opening at it became a sardine of every one rushing to get inside. people forming their own lines, lines merging into other lines. Ppl cutting into the front of the lines.  Me and my two frI ends were left standing in line for and hour and a half.  By the time we made it in stone sour was already heavy into their performance and we missed one of the bands we came to see and yet we were an hour early.....   doors should open at least an hour or two before any band starts to accommodate for large crowds and too give time for every one tof get inside and at their designated ticket seats...   then their is the problem of a sever lack of trash cans at the door to collect the horrendous amount of trash that had piled up at your entrance doors due to your policy of no outside food or drinks or containers.  I'd also like to point out that security was also a major flop at your event.  We watch a young woman have to escorts a clearly drunk and wasted man by herself cause not a single guard was posted or a bouncer.  I feel almost as if I should be demanding my money back for the inconvenience and lack of preparation on your staffs half.
894	Heard about this place from yelp and online decided it was worth the try. The girl at the counter seemed super friendly... to the person in front of me, i was kinda just looked over and kind of rushed so she could get back to her friend. When i asked questions like \"what type of beans do you use\" i got a very short WE HAVE OUR OWN, etc. The drink was good in an overlysweet kind of way. The parking was super confusing. And i had no idea where i should enter since its an old house turned into shop. All in all... It wasnt the best ive ever had, but it wasnt great either. I might be back.... maybe.
895	I decided to try Cutting Image because of all the great reviews on Yelp. \n\nI went with a level 1 stylist because she was available the same day I called to make my appointment.  I've tried level 1 stylists in other salons before with great results, so I wasn't apprehensive at all.\n\nI told the stylist I wanted a wash and a cut.  She asked if I minded if she dry cut my hair first.  I've never had a hair cut that was completely done dry (usually, the perimeter is cut wet and the rest is cut dry), but I went with it.  She flat ironed the hell out of my hair and then proceeded to cut.  When she was done she said that she would wash my hair if I really wanted her too (to be honest, it seemed like she was trying to talk me out of getting my hair washed).  My hair was so stick straight and flattened to my head there was no way I was walking in public looking like that, so I told her that I did want my hair washed, but I did tell her not to use the flat iron.  I didn't expect to come out looking like I should be in a Pantene commercial, but I also didn't expect that I would look like Scully from season 1 of X-Files (wavy, but in a bad 90s way).   \n\nBut you may ask, how was the cut?  I came in with a lightly layered bob that had grown out and came out with....not that.  I did tell the stylist that the bottom had gotten too bulky, but the layers are now too short. I will admit, that's probably my fault for not telling her I wanted to keep the bob.  But there is this one hank of hair that will not blend in with the rest no matter what I do to it.\n\nBottom line.  I'll probably try it again, but with a more experienced stylist.\n\n\nUpdated 07\/08\/13\n\nI hadn't had my hair professionally cut since January, and my hair was a hot mess (me + boredom + wine + hair shears = disaster). Since it's close to my office, and I was desperate, I decided to bite the bullet and try Cutting Image again. I am absolutely thrilled with the results.\n\nThis time my appointment was with Rachel, a Master Stylist. During the consultation, I felt like she really listened to me and understood the problems I was having with my hair. She took her time cutting (almost an hour), wanting to find a solution to fixing my choppy (self-inflicted) layers without sacrificing the length. She also took the bulkiness of bottom of my hair without giving me the inverted triangle look (which is what happens 95% of the time). \n\nToday was the first day I've tried styling it myself. I was running late this morning, so I had to half-ass it, but it still came out looking great. I will definitely be coming back to see Rachel in the future.\n\n\nUpdated Spring 2015\n\nAfter growing out my hair for over a year I was in desperate need of a haircut. My layers had grown out and I was getting that inverted triangle look again (where the top is flat and the bottom is bulky). I made an appointment with a Master Stylist and told her what I wanted...I wanted to freshen up the layers and I wanted more layers put in. She said no. Well, she didn't come right out and say no, she said that she was going to just trim up the ends. I paid $50 (before tip) for a trim that took maybe 10 minutes. A trim that did nothing to deal with the inverted triangle look or the split ends. Maybe it was a sign because the next week I made an appointment with another salon and had twelve inches chopped off. I think this is where this salon and I part ways.
896	A real, authentic, TRUE Bangladeshi restaurant in Calgary?! This is too good to be true!\n\nSome quick education for non-Bengali folks: Bangladesh is a small country nestled right beside India and Burma. The food is very similar to Indian food, heavily curry-and-rice based, but usually less spicy, and a little less 'rich', if that makes sense. \n\nI arrived at Nilu's Kitchen this past Sunday for brunch with my non-Bengali brunching partner, super excited. As soon as I walked through the doors, I took note of the interior of the restaurant. Very bare bones, with not much in the way of decoration.. almost had an 'office' type feel to it. But everything was extremely clean, I noted happily. I walked up to their 'reception desk' type counter and was greeted by a young Bengali lady who spoke fluent English to us, which was not necessary for me, but I guess put my brunching partner at ease. The modest brunch menu was up on a chalkboard. As I read the items, a warm feeling of familiarity swept through me. The brunch items were authentic, true Bengali brunch items which are typically eaten in Bangladesh on weekends. Very simple, but so true to the roots. We ordered 3 parathas (pan-fried flatbreads), fried eggs, a beef bhuna (beef curry with a lot less 'sauce' than normal curries) and aloo bhaji (curried potato strips) and two cups of Bengali cha (chai). \n\nThe food came fairly quickly to our table. The parathas were amazing. Flakey, cripsy on the outside, but doughy on the inside. The fried eggs were typical Bengali style.. with pieces of onions in them. The aloo bhaji was awesome, as was the beef bhuna. Me and my non-Bengali brunching partner literally wiped our plates clean, and it all left us salivating for more. Everything we ordered were top notch. Nothing fancy about any of the dishes, just good quality, true home-cooked Bangladeshi food. The kind your aunt would make for you on a Sunday morning in Bangladesh. \n\nI loved Nilu's kitchen precisely for that. They are not trying to be something they are not. It's a family-run restaurant where they are lovingly preparing classic Bangladeshi dishes and serving it to the public at affordable prices in a modest establishment. As we finished our meals, more patrons came steadily streaming through the doors, and we could tell that this restaurant had already gotten popular among the South Asian community. A fantastic start to the first Bangladeshi restaurant in this city.\n\nAt the end, our meal came up to around $22. A steal. A big fat delicious steal.\n\nFor all you folks interested in giving Bangladeshi food a try, let me know, I'm looking for any excuse I can get to return to Nilu's Kitchen! But a word of caution: be prepared to eat with your fingers :)
897	MercBar is a dark, dimly lit, and sexy cocktail bar!  \n\nI came here with a fairly large group and despite a packed house on a Saturday night, the wait at the bar for order drinks was never long.\n\nI can be a bit particular with my drink orders and the bartenders here do what they're supposed to do -- listen to their patrons and mix up a delicious concoction!  My concoction is a Bulleit Rye Old Fashioned with three Luxardo cherries.  And they got it right!  \n\nAnd maybe I am becoming conditioned to paying more exorbitant drink prices, but $12 in this prime Biltmore location for that drink is not too bad at all!\n\nThere are plenty of relatively private seating areas that would work for intimate groups of two all the way up to groups of 8-10... and for those even  larger groups, you can always grab some extra seats and slide them over to your area.  And a very important point for me is that all of their seating very comfortable!  When relaxing with your friends enjoying favorite cocktail, who wants to be sitting in an old uncomfortable chair, right?  MercBar gets it right!\n\nI'm a fan!  \n\n****FOUR STARS****
898	I'm always up for a good egg sandwich for breakfast.  As such, the wife and I had to give Eggslut a try.  We arrived around 10AM on a Monday morning.  There was a short line, but it moved fast since the menu was very concise, there weren't many customization options to consider, orders were taken efficiently, and the kitchen pumped out food at very steady pace.  The wife and I shared a Fairfax ($8, soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and sriracha mayo in a brioche bun) w\/bacon (add $3) and a Slut ($10), a coddled egg on top of potato purée cooked in a small Mason jar topped with chives and served with a toasted baguette slices.  Our Fairfax was hot, fresh, and satisfying, but messy and somewhat difficult to eat trying to keep it all together.  The light, airy brioche bun was the true star of the sandwich.  The Slut was simple, yet delicious.  Honestly, it outshined the Fairfax by a country mile.  Was Eggslut a bit overpriced?  Perhaps, but I thought their use of fresh, quality ingredients justified the price.  Is Eggslut a horrible name for restaurant?  I'm no prude, but it may be off-putting to some, which would be a shame since Egglut is easily the best place for breakfast at the Cosmo.
899	Le Central is the lobby bar just off the reception in the Paris Hotel and Casino.  We stopped to have a Bailey's and Coffee and it hit the spot on this chilly day.   It's a gorgeous non pretentious open air lounge with views of the casino and it has an outdoorsy Parisian street feel. \n\nService was speedy and friendly.  Lots of drink options, a TV to watch if you don't want to miss a game, comfy chairs and tables if you don't want to sit at the bar and overall a great first stop if you just want to rest your tired feet.
900	I have been to English's before and enjoyed both the food and the service, however my experience on Saturday, May 11, 2013 was so bad that I'm still thinking about it almost a week later. \n\nMy sister and I made reservations to take our mom for afternoon tea over a week in advance because we anticipated English's being busy for Mother's Day weekend.  There was one 6 top when we arrived, yet we waited over 45 minutes to even be acknowledged.  After my Mom finally tracked down a server (who was putting out table settings) and asked who was supposed to be waiting on us, she responded, \"Well, I can take your order...I guess.\"  It took another 20 minutes to get our drinks and an additional 45 to get our food (we opted for salads and sandwiches).\n\nFrom taking our order, we never saw our waitress again until she saw me standing at the bar attempting to pay.  When she handed me the check, she told me I could use her pen to sign, but not to steal her pen!!! Others have posted about being judged on their attire, but we were dressed up as we were expecting to have a beautiful Mother's Day luncheon.  It was, unfortunately, anything but. \n\nI am a former waitress and I know it is not an easy job, but common courtesy and acknowledgment are not too much to ask for.
901	An intriguing concept: Food from areas that the Roman centurions conquered. Places like Achaea (Greece), Hispania (Spain), Gaul (France), Judea (the Middle East), and Britannia (England).\n\n     An intriguing menu:  Mushroom, Goat Cheese and Spinach Strudel ($10); Bricked Fired Poached Tilapia with Sage Butter, served with Coconut and Shrimp Risotto ($23);\nGnocchi in Shitake Dijon Cream Sauce ($13).\n\n     An intriguing venue: A tiny place with old world decor - red walls, chandeliers, lots of empty wine bottles on the ledge behind the banquette, and a cute little patio with an amusing statue of a centurion outside the wrought iron fence.\n\n     So what more could you ask? Regrettably, lots...\n\n     We were four, for lunch. Ken and I arrived first and ordered an appetizer of Stuffed Mushrooms wrapped in Prosciutto ($8). It did not arrive until well after our friends, Leon and Sena came in. They wanted to try the Strudel, but were told it wasn't available. Our mushrooms were three of the ugliest lumpy things I've seen in a long time. They had been cooked in the pizza oven which pretty much incinerated the ham and dried out the mushrooms However, with enough of the accompanying Aged Cheddar Tarragon Sauce spooned over them, they were fairly tasty. Sena got a panini of eggplant in tomato sauce. The eggplant was almost raw, so it was chewy and bitter. Ken ordered Mussels in a Mustard Sauce ($10) served with Endless Bread. The jar of mustard had never found the sauce. Leon asked for a hamburger with ketchup. He was told that no ketchup was served in the restaurant because it would interfere with the bold flavors of the food. I would applaud this as a policy had there been any bold flavors. Ken quipped that most of the food seemed to have its roots in Britannia. My Espana Pizza ($14) had a nice amount of manchengo and mozzarella cheeses, but was pretty low on the chorizo topping.The crust was something of a disaster - burnt on the edges and flabby in the center.\n\n     Service was poor.. With only two other customers in the restaurant, there was no excuse for ice tea glasses that were not refilled until we pointed it out, dishes that were not cleared from the table to make way for new ones, a long wait for Ken's entree to be served after the other three had arrived, and the lack of a bowl to put his mussel shells in. The restaurant also had a general air of sloppiness about it. I don't believe that chef\/owner Eric Osburn was in the house while we were there, at least I hope he wasn't. But he needs to be more aware of what's going on when he isn't present.\n\n     Hopefully Centurion will make the effort to live up to its concept, menu and venue. I'd like to be intrigued.
902	My bf had gotten a restaurant.com certificate a while back and we finally made a date to go and try out Ferraro's. I love going out to fancy dinners and splurging every so often so I was super excited. Basically, the ambiance and food were awesome, but the service was so blah that I just couldn't enjoy the restaurant much.\n\nWe arrived right on time and were seated right away. Our server came over and my bf showed him the certificate, but he told us they had stopped taking them. We said we didn't know because restaurant.com usually informs you if that happens with a certificate you've purchased. We were not rude or upset with the server at all and in fact were totally nice about it. After that little exchange, he basically treated us like we didn't exist. We had checked in on Yelp and saw that there was an appetizer offer for checking in and didn't even feel comfortable bringing it up as he had seemed so annoyed about the restaurant.com certificate.\n\nI think this sums up everything he said to us that night: \"Wine? (takes our order) Great.\" And then later, \"Ready to order? (takes order) Great.\" And once we were done with our meals, \"Dessert or are you done?\" To which we replied, \"we are super full, so ready for the check whenever.\" And that's it. When he dropped off the check after running our card, he didn't even say thank you for coming in or have a nice night or anything. Just dropped it off quickly on his way to another table. \n\nNeedless to say, I don't even need to go into details about the food, but I will say that one of my fave places is Gaetano's in Henderson, which has a swanky romantic ambiance and the food is even better AND the service is TOP NOTCH. You always feel welcome and greeted warmly by the owners, unlike Ferraro's.
903	This T & T is so much more expensive that the other t & t 's in Markham. I came here a few times, the layout is similar to other locations. Parking is easy to find, but driving here is horrific because people just push their shopping carts out on the mini crossing area without looking and I swear it takes forever for a car to drive through. There's also poles covering the pedestrians so it's harder for cars to see.\n\nWhy I rated it one star? The specials as shown in the flyers are the same, but EVERYTHING ELSE, literally everything is more expenisve. I had to go to another t&t in the same day because it was so overpriced. Fruits an be 1.5 times to 3 times the prices of other stores. Also, when you check out, you have to purchase a bag, thought from what I know, other locations just give you a bag.
904	Been here several times in the past year and I always have a great time!! The nachos are killer and the drinks are reasonably priced. This is also the only way I can get my girlfriend to play golf with me so it's a win win!
905	Get some local flavor and old fashioned banjo playing down at the Elks Club on Wed evenings 8-11pm - more details https:\/\/www.thepittsburghbanjoclub.com\/wednesday\n\nNo admission fee. You can call ahead and reserve a spot at one of the tables or grab a seat at the bar in the back. There were a dozen banjo players plus trumpets, bass, etc up on the stage playing sing-a-long classics (song book in tray at the back of the room). What are banjo classics? Take a guess and you'll probably be pretty close. \n\nThey play from 8am-9:30pm then take a break. The first half is full of retirees. Everyone is super friendly. Most people grew up in the area and give you all kinds of stories about what Pittsburgh was like in the old days.\n\nDuring the break you can buy some raffle tickets - $1 each or 6 for $5 - winner gets half the pot, other half goes towards paying rent at the Elks Club. Also at the break a lot of the retirees leave and the young 'uns come to the table. The average age drops from 68 to 38. \n\nAfter the break the group on stage was much diminished as some banjo players retired to the bar. \n\nThey also serve beer, wine, simple cocktails, and have a full dinner menu (usual bar food) with table service. \n\nI realize this isn't for everyone but it's definitely unique!
906	My dear Ritas, our love affair began about 7 years ago during the hot summer in Mentor, Ohio. Your store popped up along Mentor Ave. and not knowing what \"ice\" was, I stopped for a cool treat and my socks were officially knocked off. The Gelati as you call it became my obsession and I consumed no less than 100 Gelatis that summer. I introduced everyone I knew\/worked with to your delicious iciness in a cup and they all fell in love. \n\nThe love affair continues today even though I drive over an hour and a half round trip (yes, you read that right) to enjoy your creamy, icy, heaven. \n\nI highly recommend the Gelati which is your choice of ice flavor and your choice of chocolate, vanilla or twist custard. I can all but guarantee this custard will be the best you've ever had. It is *the* custard of the gods, unbelievably creamy and almost doesn't melt because of the creaminess. The ice flavors rotate daily, I have tried nearly all of them and notta one would I not try again. They also have a Blendini, their version of a DQ blizzard but using that amazing custard I mentioned which brings it to the next level and a Misto which is ice, custard and your choice of mixins blended together.\n\nSome favorite combinations of mine:\n\nGreen apple ice with caramel layered at the bottom, middle and on top with chopped peanuts, tastes just like a caramel apple with peanuts\n\nSwedish fish Gelati with vanilla custard \n\nMango and Vanilla custard Misto with Nerds\n \nYou can thank me later or not because you will want to eat Rita's daily, don't say I didn't warn you!
907	I have been coming to Family Doctors of Green Valley for about 4 months for their medical weight loss program.  I am very satisfied with my care and Jaimie takes very good care of me for my weekly visits.  She always has a smile on her face and always willing to answer all of my questions and concerns.
908	Love this place! Everything I order becomes my new favorite! I love the Wendy Pickle, the BFF, the \"wings\", the brussel sprouts... Of course, you'll want to save room for dessert! Love the Coco loco tSoynami!!!
909	I stopped in here after 2 days of mudding at the Bantam Jeep Festival in Butler. I came in thinking I had some issue with my suspension, turns out I just had a few pounds of mud up in there. They were super friendly, super helpful and just an awesome group of people. Thanks a ton!
910	The food was so good 2 years ago, that I came back and ate the same thing! I always (okay only twice now) get the bacon macaroni and cheeseburger. It's a thick patty with actual mac and cheese instead of a slice of cheese, and topped with slices of bacon. It was almost as tasty and memorable as the first time I had it. \n\nWe were seated immediately. I was shocked at how easy it was to get in at 11:30am on a Saturday! Our server was friendly and chatted with us and checked on us frequently. \n\nMy husband and i decided to get a fishbowl drink to share (we're in Vegas and not driving, might as well get tipsy!). We got a strawberry coconut drink that was amazing. It came with rum infused strawberries which were great to share with our friends at the table. This place has great food, a clean fast restaurant and a good staff. I'll always come visit when I'm in this city!
911	The only reason I'm giving any stars is because the location is so close to my house.. the times I've gone here for either video games, computer shit or simply a damn fan I've had to try and find products on my own. Guest service is rite down the toilet. I'll drive the extra miles if I need to go to best buy, I'll find another store to shop at or just stop going to Best buy all together
912	Two times have I gotten take-out pie from Angelo's, and two times has my mouth been happy with the choice.  As others have commented, their sauce is delicious, and the crust is perfect.\n\nA word to the wise, pizza is \"greasy\" when there is actually cheese and sausage on it.  Both of those items weep juices when heated, so it's not unheard of for a pizza containing those items (not to mention being a deep dish crust, which has oil in it) to be a little on the wet side.  \n\nAnother reviewer commented that they skimp on ingredients...if this is true, why did another comment on the grease?\n\nPerhaps it's the KIND of pizza each ordered?\n\nOn both occasions, the pizzas I have eaten had plenty of toppings that did not dribble off the crust when I picked up a slice.  This, to me, is perfect pizza.\n\nI can't comment on the service, because I've done takeout\/delivery on both occasions.
913	FINALLY!!! An L&L I can go to and not be disappointed. I don't know what it is but their food reminds me of the local spots back home. Plus the people are super nice. There's an older gentleman who cooks in the back that came out to give my little girl and another little girl yam yams! So thoughtful and the guy behind the counter that helped us was friendly and helped my bf choose a plate since it was his first time. They maintained the restaurant very well. i can't complain and will likely be back since I frequent the Costco located in back of it\n\nMuch mahaloz!
914	The pancake is not good , yelp probably won't let me post this but it is true\n\nPlus there is no parking \n\nPlus the cup is dirty \n\nPlus they didn't give me the kind of egg I ordered .
915	I love this place! It's a cool space, different wooden chairs\/tables and some chill tunes. They have awesome staff members and delicious drinks. I like the americano, or mocha lattes. It's in a great location downtown and very close to the terminal in case you need to come by bus. I've been going here quite often for studying or just to grab some coffee. It was great that they open late (until midnight) on most days.
916	This place had really good Thai food.  Their pad thai was great along with the bubble tea.  Their thai currys are excellent.\n\n It was over a bit overpriced though.  Portions were also small and they charge for extra white rice..  I would go down the street to Tree- Country.  Bigger portions for a cheaper price.
917	WOW! This place is fantastic! A home renovated into a cute mom and pop cafe, complete with an outdoor patio. The food was amazing, I ordered the hearty breakfast skillet, biscuits and gravy on top of hasbrowns and eggs - YUMMMM! The hubs ordered (some catchy breakfast name that I can't remember)-platter with a three egg omlete, country potatoes, and bacon - I wasn't a fan of the country potatoes (mostly because I have a stub nose to anyone's country potatoes except for my grandmothers) yet the omelete was perfectly cooked, the added veggies burst with favor! Bacon....everyone loves bacon, it is very hard to mess up so it was, as expected delicious. Moving forward, we noticed a table next to us being served with big fluffy French toast. Obviously, we were forced to flag down our waitress and order that as well. Our waitress was attentive, kind and always on the ball. On two occasions I was finishing my drink as she brought my replacement to the table. (In my option every restaurant should be taught this) Let's get back to that french toast, HOLY FRENCH TOAST! Crispy on the outside, fluffy and decadent on the inside. This place is served so simply, yet packed full of flavor.\n\nAfter our meal, we were just getting up to leave and a woman, who has been working the register all morning and chatting with whomever was walking by, adding laughter to the atmosphere. She introduced herself as Yoli the owner then asked us how our meal was, where we are from, what we do for a living, she seemed to generally care about what we were saying. We stayed and talked for a few minutes and left with a hug! You can't get that at Denny's! I felt as though I was leaving my sisters place after brunch. I would definitely recommend this place! Its been about a month since I visited and I have not stop talking about it....I think its time to revisit!
918	Very disappointed in the food. It had no taste at all. Even the desserts were off. I was expecting exceptional food from a name like the Ballgio but for $40 \/person it's a waste of money.  This experience has taught me that I never want to eat at a  buffet again.
919	Honestly, one of the worst hotel experiences of my life. Stayed here with multiple fellow colleagues this past week and it was nothing but problem after problem.\n\nTo begin, any floor between 1-4 wreaks of mold, mildew, and stale cigarette smoke. Even better is the smell of pot depending on the time of day. Their next issue is the fact that upon check-in I was not made aware of the fact that the pool has been out for two weeks and there is still no ETA of when it will be fixed. Also, their A\/C went out in the entire building and they tried to pretend it was an isolated incident.\n\nTheir hotel bar\/lounge is a hole in the wall with glassware that had not been cleaned to standard. My water glass had a ring in it about 2\" up and after seeing that in the water glass, I was afraid to drink my glass of coke.\n\nThere was also a vomit spill just outside the 7th floor elevator doors, giant stains on the carpets in rooms, an flooding due to poor floor design.\n\nI could share even more of this frightfully bad stay, but I think this is enough to keep you far away.\n\nThe good news is... If you get a room on the 8th or 9th floor, you get a useless horse statue on your desk.
920	I feel like this is the perfect casino off the strip! I came here on Saturday smack dab in the afternoon and was taken back by the warm and cozy feel the casino had. There were very few people on the gaming floor or in the restaurants. Lots of comfortable seating areas and the place was clean.\nThe Silverton is perfect to get out of the hot sun and away from the hustle and bustle and just relax. \nI will definitely be back.
921	If you don't mind grabbing your sub at a place where the other customers seem to be getting their midday beer, cigarettes, and lotto tickets, Hanini's is a pretty good bet.\n\nThe corned beef is very serviceable, and the gyro is enormous, tasty, and incredibly greasy.  Large selection of beverages, quick service.  It's more convenience store than restaurant so to-go is the only option.
922	Détonner parmi les innombrables bars de la faune Montréalaise, c'est dur. \n\nGrenade, c'est le fameux bar au coin de ma rue auquel j'avais jamais vraiment porté attention. Pas parce qu'il n'avait pas l'air intéressant, mais juste parce que je suis une fille de bières, et que les bars à cocktails c'est moins mon truc. Sauf que l'autre jour, je me suis retrouvée embarrée en dehors de chez moi, et je devais trouver un moyen de m'occuper en attendant que la vie passe. Le Grenade m'a tendu sa goupille, j'ai tiré dessus.\n\nD'une ambiance incendiaire à l'intérieur, la vraie explosion a lieu sur la terrasse. De grands pôles chauffant pour être certain que les nuits fraîches n'importunent personne, et de grosses couvertures pour les plus frileux #moi. Beaux cocktails, bière pas chère, et l'offensive continue avec un menu bouffe style snack bar oriental vraiment, mais vraiment bon. Ils ont même le wifi pour quand tu as du temps à tuer.\n\nBoom.
923	Fantastic food and service! Great self brewed beer! Staff is very knowledgeable about the beer and the food. Ahi Tuma was cooked to perfection. You would think it was an East Coast seafood joint. Garlic fries are a must - be sure to ask for ranch dressing to dip them in.
924	I think I'm a bit too spoiled by Phoenix's coffee culture. I really wanted to love this place, it's quiet and has a pretty good sized menu.\n\nI ordered a Large Iced Vanilla Latte and found it to be just okay. Definitely caffeine filled as I got a large size, but did not taste any Vanilla. I also wanted to try a pastry so I got an Apple Turnover which was heated up and served to me on a paper plate. The pastry tasted like it came from Costco. My coffee and pastry came out to be almost $10, kind of pricey IMO.\n\nThe shop itself is small and very quiet the time I was there- considering it was just me and two other customers sitting in silence. There was faint music playing from what I recall. The parking situation is also not the best here, it's difficult to find parking right out front of the cafe so be prepared to walk. Unfortunately, I won't be returning to this small town coffeehouse :*(
925	I really wanted to like this place since they had really good reviews . The food was mediocre . But they had good selection of food . The waitress was nice. I would recommend this place to someone , if they wanted to get something quick to eat.
926	We enjoyed the quaintness sitting outside on the little shaded porch.  If you are in a hurry you might want to skip this place but we wanted a relaxing meal so it was perfect for us.   There was no wait when we arrived close to 1 on a Sunday.  Another couple that arrived just after us had their order taken first and their food and drinks came out very timely.  They were gone before we got our food.  My husband ordered well done bacon so we pretended this was the reason our food was so slow.  We enjoyed our drinks--my husband regular coffee with half-price refills while I had a chai tea latte--and the atmosphere while waiting.  We loved our waiter who was just helping out for the day and actually is a chef!\n\nWas it the best service?   No because food was slow.  Would we return?  Absolutely!  It was just so pleasant and the food was good.  And while French may be the first language of several of the wait staff, speaking English was no problem.  We were dressed very casually while some were a bit spiffier.
927	Been looking for a garlic tuna that was comparable to how the old sushibay used to have it, and here it is. Amazing! The only difference is a fried garlic slice as a garnish (not bad, but I prefer just the sauce). Chirashi bowl is a good rec and so are the poki tacos and pork belly appetizer (order rice with pork belly bc is has a rich flavor). Service was great, nice, quick, and friendly. Going to be a regular for sure
928	I am in love with this hotel!  It's so gorgeous and sumptuous that I feel like I'm stepping into a whole other world whenever I walk in.  There's something to stare and gawk at it every way you turn.  We had a great room with comfortable beds and a nice view of the strip.  The shops are spectacular with lots of designer clothes, jewelry, etc.  You can take a short gondola ride in a built in river in the shopping area which is a lot of fun.  I've only stayed at the Venetian on one occasion but it is by far the most beautiful hotel I've stayed in.
929	From the looks of the place, they didn't give much thought to the interior. Luckily, there's a lot of passion and care evident in the food. There are only three tables inside (and one small one outside) and the walls are covered with random movie and music posters and a picture of Carrot Top eating there.\n\nThe sandwich I tried was excellent. It was a roast beef melt with a hefty amount of thinly sliced, quality beef with a rich, peppery flavor that filled a soft roll and was covered in melted cheese. It came with a side -- I chose the macaroni salad -- which was decent, but not that memorable. I ate there a couple weeks ago and can barely remember what it tasted like.\n\nThe girl behind the register was friendly and was nice enough to walk me through some of the menu items. The owner, Billy, was in the back making the food and like I said before, it's clear that he cares about what he puts out. This place might work it's way into my list of regular lunch spots.
930	Ive always wanted to visit bc it doesnt look like your average bar. However the service was horrible. It seems like its a place that only caters to their older regular crowd. There were a number of things that were rude:\n\n1. The hostess looked like a deer caught in the headlights. She provided no info about the establishment and was not at all warm and welcoming\n\n2. The older male bartender advised me and my two friends to sit at the part of the bar with no machine games, JUST IN CASE the other patrons wanted to hop games\n\n3. He was very persistent that we needed to order our drinks before we can order our food\n\n4. In an effort to be nice, my friend asked \"what drinks do you make best\" he looked at her in acknowledgment and pointed to me for my order , thus ignoring her\n\n5. As i cash out from playing black jack for 5.50. He ask me to play again so i could lose and he only has to give me an even 5. He proceeds to start pressing the buttons for me.\n\nThis place may he lovely its regulars, but it cant be good for business to treat new comers like this. \n\nNot to mentions the spinach dip was like white nacho dip with green clumps in it
931	Great food, the drinks are amazing and a good change from the standard sodas everywhere else. Sweet potatoe fries were great. Good location.
932	I purchased a drink for $4.00 and used my credit card.  The bartender accepted the card.  When I viewed my statement online a few days later, I was charged $10.00.  This business appears to be unscrupulous.
933	Amazing food and drinks! The chicken Marsala sandwich, philly goat flatbread, salads, and jalapeño bacon grilled cheese are fantastic! Great atmosphere and service! Coming back as much as I can!
934	Simply Delicious Pies is truly a delightful little Lee Road gem!\n\nI stopped in here with a friend yesterday just to take a look at what they offered. The first thing that hits you when you walk in the door is the smell. It is that magical sweet and fruity aroma that hits you like a nostalgia train, taking you back to weekends at grandma's. Even though I just had lunch, I was starting to become hungry all over again!\n\nAfter a few moments of indecisiveness in the face of all the tasty sounding options, ended up leaving with a darling 6\" pumpkin pie. It was perfect! It had a smooth texture in the filling. It was not too sweet, which I appreciated, and had a lovely balance of the earthy pumpkin flavor and the spices (a balance which a lot of pies surprisingly seem to lack!). The crust was lightly sweet and buttery.\n\nMy friend got a 6\" mushroom quiche which had a delicious cheesy filling and a buttery, savory crust.\n\nThere weren't a whole lot of pies out in her display case by the time we got there at about 1:00, but still a pretty good variety. However, you could choose to order a pie in advance in 6\", 8\", or 10\". I've got my eyes on the carmel apple for next time!
935	Mediterranean salad, sweet potato canoli and chocolate cake. Everything was good. The canoli was different but I tend to like savory. It felt like a desert. I tried the salmon and it was good as well. Salad was lightly dressed and it was good.
936	Leslie is great to work with. She is always on top of things, constant communication and sees everything through. A true pro and pleasure to work with. She just completed my refi and then a subsequent purchase. Awesome X2. Thanks!
937	The worst.\n\nAfter a day of agonizing pain I went to this CVS fill my prescription for pain and antibiotics. The lady refused citing my dentist was on the other side of town and it was late.\n\nI guess she thought I was a drug addict or something with a fake prescription. Now mind you this was for basically Tylenol and a small amount at that.\n\nI left in pain and went to Walgreens where they promptly filled my valid prescription.\n\nI did ask what my dentists office location and time of day made any difference. She refused to give me a reason. Simply saying I've never filled at her pharmacy before. Not sure why that would make a difference. Las Vegas is a tourist town and I'm sure lots of people have never been to this pharmacy in the past.
938	Would definately not return!\n6 of us ate here during spring training and there wasn't one good dish amongst us.\nThe salads were even bad.  I had the cheese walnut and fruit salad and it was flavorless, probably because it was so cold, was it kept in the fridge already prepared? The greek salad was uneatable.  The lobster ravioli's were swimming in sauce, the pizza was soso.
939	This is a great place to have lunch, dinner, and\/or drinks.  The martinis are fun, the servers are pleasant and knowledgeable, and the food is very good.  The patio is THE place to sit in downtown Willoughby in the summer.  Oh, yeah, and the name is a hoot.  Good job, whoever thought it up!
940	Cupcakes have taken over the sweet scene lately, but donuts are still hot at Ronald's Donuts on Spring Mountain. This little family owned shop doesn't look like much from the outside (or inside), but it has been around FOREVER and has an outstanding reputation.\n\nOn my most recent visit I got a chocolate donut and an apple fritter. The dough of the former is light and fluffy, with nice yeast pockets and a chewy texture. The high gloss chocolate frosting barely coats the upper half, giving it just the right level of sweetness (if you love the sugar content of Krispy Kreme, Ronald's may not be the place for you). Their famous apple fritter is practically the size of a frisbee, and has a delicious, crisp caramalized exterior. The apple filling has more texture than most, and I love the homemade look.\n\nThe icing on the cake (or icing on the donut, rather) is that a dozen donuts will cost you less than $8 (cash only) and all of their selections are vegan. Even the cream filling is soy-based, so as far as donuts go this is about as healthy as you can get. I recommend taking a break from the cupcake craze when you next need to satisfy your sweet tooth and vacationing back to a time when donuts ruled as the go-to dessert for social gatherings . As far as I'm concerned, Ronald's has been the only off-Strip place in Vegas keeping donuts alive and well, so if you love holy desserts I suggest you make your way there soon.
941	Second favorite nude bar in town! Pretty fun place to get patrick shwasted. Yeah its expensive for a drink because their are free titties everywhere haha. You can bargain for some cheap lap dances too if you are a good looking guy. My kinda place, would definatly blow some money here if i had just won a big jackpot and wasnt married!
942	THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE PIES ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nTheir pies put the icing on my Thanksgiving! Still kind of new to Vegas as this was only my 2nd Thanksgiving away from  home. So I was really worried I wouldn't find a place that would make amazing pies but, I did!!! \nOf course if it wasn't for all the reviews on Yelp from my wonderful fellow Yelpers I would have never found them! \nI ordered from Sugar & Spice and picked them up from Rolling in Dough. I ordered the double crusted apple pie, pecan, and pumpkin pie.  My oh my were they good!! I love me some sweets so I have had my fair share of pies. The apple pie crust was thick but was so great that way! Pecan was my absolute favorite. Sweet but not too sweet. And my kids would have ate 3 pumpkin pies if I would have let them! Thank you Rolling In Dough for your delicious pies!!!
943	I got a sternum tattoo by Mckay and I LOVE it! Very detailed and straight up nice guy. Everyone at the shop was real nice. \nGetting another piece by him real soon.
944	A friend that lives in the Downtown area wanted to meet here for coffee & chat. It's one of his fave spots. He reminded me over and over, \"It's very hipster!\"  Uhhh...Yeah, OK. Coffee was blah. Staff weren't all that friendly. Comfy chairs = Yes..but there's no reason to return.
945	I can't say that I would fight for a parking space at many places, but Postino makes the list. Will I ever steal a parking spot? Not at all, but I will look long and hard for one here. The wait is worth it yelp friends. Postino does a great job luring customers in and keeping them. With their incredible happy hour, I wish I could sneak away to dine on a glass of wine before 4:00 PM on a weekday and for those who can, I salute you. \n\nEvery time I wine and dine at Postino, I leave full, happy and satisfied. The original Postino location will also be my favorite based on it's location, ambiance, character, service and quality products. The wine is obviously top knotch here at Postino. Bottles line the walls and the staff knows their selections inside and out. They offer bottle specials all the time and you can enjoy a bottle at a reasonable price practically every day of the week. \n\nTheir food competes with the quality of their wine. I long for their bruschetta. You chose four different flavors and for a reasonable price under $15. My favorite bruschettas are the prosciutto and fig, and tomato paste with cheese. The tomato mozzarella is also a classic. But, it really just depends on your taste buds because any bruschetta you choose will be excellent. Many times, I got for the half sandwich\/salad combo. I like to order the Market which isn't on the menu. It comes with pesto, tomato and mozzerela. I make sure to add chicken. The Mediterranean is my go-to salad but I vary between all of their salads. You really just can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. And it tastes even better with wine. Doesn't everything?
946	I finally made it to Shake Shack! I took my brother and husband last night. Non of us had tried Shake Shack before so I was excited to get a variety of things. After seeing the photo's of the chicken sandwich I was able to convinced my brother to share a burger and the chicken sandwich with me. My husband got the SmokeShack Double Cheeseburger, comes topped with all-natural Applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce. . It was gone in less than 10 seconds. He loved it. My brother and I split the ShackBurger Double Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce. Along with the Chick'n Shack - Crispy Chicken Breast with lettuce, pickles, and buttermilk herb mayo. As for the burger, it was so flavorful and juicy. Something about this burger patty just explodes with flavor. Top that off with that liquid gold cheese.... one of the best burgers I have ever had. My brother's eye's rolled back in to his head at his first AND second bite. He said it was the best burger he had ever tasted. And yes. The Chicken sandwich was awesome as well. Thick, juicy, crunchy, and fresh. So glad I tried it. We also got 3 French Fries, including one with cheese. I recommend you get one with out cheese. Its delicious but after having it on my burger I was happy to get a little break from it with some of the plain French Fries. My husband had one of their shakes and he said it was very rich but he liked it! \n\nIt was really good all in all. Was it a little pricey? Yes! But I knew that coming in. I would also say that you are getting what you pay for. Quality food.
947	This place is the worst ever,two months ago I dropped off 15 pieces of my designer clothes. And all of a sudden they lose my Salvatore Ferragamo polo shirt.They have me fill out a stupid claim form,and make me mail out the form myself.And they're the ones that lost my shirt.I haven't heard anything yet since I mailed the form.I HAVE BEEN GOING HERE FOR 4 YEARS AND THIS IS THE TREATMENT I GET. THIS PLACE WILL NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER WILL SEE MY MONEY EVER AGAIN.I HOPE THEY SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY.
948	Another brewery has come to Pittsburgh! Have been anxiously awaiting this opening for two years. Grand opening is next weekend but am fortunate enough to be here today for a private soft opening. Have had their beers at other events and am so glad to finally have the real stuff in their own location. The pours are absolutely delicious and the brewery is amazing.\nThe flavors are incredible with a freshness that makes for pours that go down smoothly enticing your taste buds with every sip. Pure goodness on the lips.\nThe layout is fantastic. Really digging the vibe of this setup. It's relaxing, hip, modern, industrial and all of the things you want a brewery to be.\nDefinitely in my top 3 for local breweries; to the point where it's safe to say they're in the #1 slot.\nGet here next weekend for the public grand opening and plan to drink like you've never done before!\nLocated on Washington Boulevard makes it easy access in the East End.\nPS: Blonde Shag is my fave!!!!
949	I've never been happier with my nails! If you are looking for acrylics ask for Alex, you will not be disappointed.
950	Absolutely love this place. \nThe food is amazing , the service is hit and miss, but who cares ! did I mention the food is amazing!! \nMy go to dish is the red curry with fish. I don't think I have ever had fish like this before. I believe the fish is first deep fried and then cooked the curry sauce. So good! It's a little greasy, but hey! Yolo. (is yolo still a thing?) \nWe also ordered the herbal pork soup. It was a less than anticipated, just enough to share between 2 ppl. But it hit the spot on a chilly day. \nAnyway, just go! Try it out. \n**Last time I visited the restaurant with a friend; she is a vegetarian. We had asked if the popiah had any meat in it. The server told us no, but it did. So be careful if you had any dietary limitations.
951	Attendants are lazy!! Had to wait.. blow horn for them to come out while they sit there with their feet up.. asked when would air compressor be fix IDK we just order the part.. SMH you have one job to do.. wave people into the car wash so stressful I know... simply do your SIMPLE job!!!!
952	Went to dorthy 6 last night and had a wonderful experience food was great drinks were awesome and staff was super friendly! I will be back ASAP!! Highly recommend!!
953	Never thought I'd find anything better than Bookman's. But then I found.. well, Bookman's. See I been goin' to the Mesa store for years now and never complained once, but lately, I don't know, even with people bringing in new trade every day, seems like the shelves have been stocked with the same old stuff. Not to mention they've been turning down my same old box of stuff for a while now - used to be I brought it in enough times they'd eventually take it off my hands.. So I ventured out to the Phoenix store yesterday.\n\nWow. \n\nI must admit, I was a little confused at first - the layout's a little disorienting.. Trade counter's to your right when you walk in (drop your stuff off around the back of the counter) and the Cashier counter is to your left. Books straight ahead, Media to the left. The Media section - that's what the wow was for. Probably twice the size of the Mesa store. Usually I stroll through the CDs and DVDs - 10, 15 minutes maybe. I was there for an hour and a half yesterday. Couldn't believe the selection of CDs, DVDs, Laser Discs, LPs, VHS, cassette tapes, video games, Books on CD\/tape.. Other thing that's cool - they've got a toys\/games room for action figures, board games,  puzzles (so many puzzles).. \n\nI do have one other update for Bookman's fans in general (noticed the same thing at the other store) - apparently they're not sticking to that old A Trade (media), B Trade (books) thing anymore - used to be you got different levels of credit depending on what you brought it, but not anymore - it's all A Trade now, good for anything in the store.\n\nAnd yes, this store has an armoir full of porn, too ;)
954	Was expecting a line or a crowd, but was deceptively quiet. Beautiful outdoor space to eat your food, well, quiet and a picnic bench which is rare in the market. We were a bit nervous at spending $10+ for a breakfast sandwich, but it was worth it. Pillowy bun, soft spice\/heat. Messy so you'll want to sit to eat. Cashier was friendly but a little aggressive trying to upsell; it's a soft open, chill. Bathroom clean. Would go back! Free wifi
955	While walking along the strip, a Korean sign kept flashing and changing before my eyes. What was that?\n\nI could see that same sign from my room at the Monte Carlo and noticed it pointed down a quiet street, right next to Walgreens. I could barely make out the fading blue Dae Jang Keum sign but after searching for it on Yelp, I was excited to find a Korean restaurant nearby!\n\nYes, if you're Korean, than obviously you've tasted much better Korean restaurants but this is VEGAS! If you're craving Korean food in Vegas, this is the best you're going to get - without a car!\n\n$16 (including tax and tip) for seafood soon dubu that was a bit diluted but otherwise, good. She didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it which was a bummer because it was a bit too mild for me, though my spicy level is pretty high.\n\nSide dishes were good, which included some of my favorites: spicy cucumbers, pickled daikon and bean sprouts.\n\nSide dishes also included sliced hot dogs - HUH?! I didn't even touch this. I don't think anyone did!\n\nMenu was also Caucasian-Friendly and offered Salmon, Beef and Chicken Teriyaki for about $18-$20. Each came with a side salad, soup, lots of rice and the meat.\n\nService was good - they even asked my caucasian coworkers if they'd like a fork.\n\nPlace is open 24\/7 which is awesome! I wish I could find one here.\n\nPrices are obviously a bit inflated and pricey but I didn't expect anything otherwise. It's Vegas - everything is expensive!\n\nI'd honestly go back to Dae Jang Keum if I ever stay on that end of the strip again :)
956	Best breakfast ever! I had the corned beef hash with eggs,homefries and toast. The hash had crispy bits which I love. The eggs cooked perfectly. The homemade strawberry jam was AMAZING! I rarely eat jam....but I did yesterday and really enjoyed it. I also rarely clean my plate, but I did yesterday. The kids enjoyed their french toast, corned beef hash and eggs Benedict and they cleaned their plates too!!  LOL. Husband had a club sandwich and said it was the best he had ever had. Great atmosphere and super friendly and efficient staff.
957	Not good. \n\nThe service was fine. The place was cute. Cute patio on the warm days. And far away enough from Yonge and Eglinton to not be caught up in the weekday hustle and bustle. The items were reasonably priced and on par with other places in the area.\n\nBut the food was just not good. My coworker and I couldn't place it but something about the food was off and was simply disappointing.  \nI got the UB donut with eggs and peameal bacon and a side of home fries. The home fries were the best part, but they were very salty and tasted old. Actually everything on my plate tasted not fresh and reheated. \nAfter I felt hungry and dissatisfied and a bit nauseated. \n\n I always wanted to try it and I had high hopes, but I wouldn't raise my hand to come back.
958	Kiva Han is a coffee shop with a ton of personality, and that alone should be your reason to go there.  There are quirky paintings on the wall, nice furniture, a great little coffee bar, very interesting people, a good selection of food and drinks, and great music at Kiva Han.  \n\nIt's definitely a coffee shop struggling against the norms set by the larger coffee chains nearby (Starbucks is across the street).  During the summer months it can get quite warm inside, which is multiplied by the number of people that go there with their computers.  Also, the wifi is spotty - I found that it worked better in the attached large room rather than around the bar.  Third, I got a vegan burrito, and man did it suck.  We're talking stale rice, and about nothing else.  The salsa that came with is awful.  Luckily their bagels are fine, but the coffee needs a lot of work.  And for the people working behind the counter: cheer up.
959	Pretty dissapointing for Sat afternoon seems to be the same service on Sat we have been multiple times because of proximity only. \n It was wing day so we started with wings, honey garlic they were really good and quite large it just took a long time to arrive. We placed our food order after the appitizer was done because the server kept dissapearing. It seemed like there was alot of servers on we just didn't get a good one. \n This was the first time we ordered meals we usually just go for wings and again not very impressed for the price. I feel if I'm paying fourteen dollars for a burger it should not be a frozen patty. All around bad will not be returning. Calgary has so many other choices.\nSorry Brewsters....NEXT!
960	Located inside Palazzo hotel. Very fresh and tasty. Quick service and nice atmosphere. Highly recommended.
961	Fabricated hype is the theme for this restaurant chain in Arizona - they intentionally select (nearly) all locations with insufficient parking and insufficient building size to accommodate their customers.  Once you're on the lengthy waitlist along with a small crowd of others, they want you to think.... wow, this is a happening place!\n\nBut the pain doesn't stop here.  The hostess has strict but unreasonable seating rules.  Example: she wouldn't seat my party of 4 at a 4 top table because 2 people were parking the car.  Not even 30 seconds later, she seats a party of 2 at that last remaining 4 top table.  Then, of course, my 2 missing people walk right up and we have to wait 25 minutes for the next available 4 top table.  Great policy, Oreganos!\n\nThis self-styled Chicago theme restaurant offers deep dish pizza, but they're quick to point out how long the wait is for the pizza (likely after you've waited a long time just to get a seat) and so the vast majority of their pizza sales are thin crust.  Not bad, but the reputation for great Chicago pizza isn't exactly \"Chicago thin crust\".\n\nWall murals are entertaining, as are the self-deprecating T-shirts worn by the staff.  Food is very average, and the menu is quite decorative.\n\nOn the whole though, it's all hype and little in way of substance.
962	Dr Sharma is fantastic. Finding a good a primary care doctor when you move to a new city can be so incredibly stressful. I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews of his practice and gave it a shot. The reviews are all true. Dr Sharma truly cares about his patients and their happiness. Appointment scheduling could not be easier. Wait time? What wait time? Dr Sharma is punctual, and his staff are efficient. I found the doctor I've been looking for.
963	Instant is an understatement! \n\nWhen you lose your passport, all sorts of stupid bureaucratic policies get thrown at you, including having a Statutory Declaration letter notarized. \n\nI have been putting this off for months but with a trip to NYC planned at the end of the summer my procrastination was put on notice.\n\nThe secretary and the notary were sweet, friendly and even cracked jokes with me... Ikea lineups for meatballs are more stressful than this place. My service cost $20 and I was in and out of this office in less time than it took my father to circle the block to find parking.\n\nI hope to never have to go through Passport woes again but if I do I know where to go!
964	One word: incredible. I was lucky enough to be taken here as a birthday present. If you are a Beatles fan this is a must see when you're in Vegas. If you're not a Beatles fan, then you should still go because you will leave there being one.\n\nThis show is an amazing tapestry of the great songbook of the Beatles mixed with the story of their lives all portrayed by the amazing acrobatics, grace and athleticism of the Cirque du Soleil team.\n\nThe staff goes all out dressed in their very own Sgt Pepper garb and a few of the cast members come out to entertain the audience while you wait.\n\nA tip too if you're going: Try to get seats that are midlevel at the back. I don't want to spoil it but something happens during the show and when you're in these seats you get to see something most people won't.  It's just a magical experience and well worth the high ticket price. I left an even bigger Beatles fan then when I came and even got a little choked up during the last number.\n\nAll you need is LOVE!
965	I visited this place while I was in town. First of all, VERY CONFUSING FOR A FIRST TIMER. So basically they have different lines for the different types of food they have e.g. a burrito line, a taco line, etc... My girlfriend and I are vegetarians so we went to the veggie line and we both ordered soyrizo burritos. The burrito size was a bit bigger than chipotle size and we got chips and guac when we paid. It was a big pricey but alright. The soyrizo was a bit spicer than other soyrizos but very tasty! We decided to sit upstairs since downstairs was so packed. I loved the food but I was very confused by the decorations\/environment. I feel like the decorations and environment give off a more bar\/club vibe that is 21+ only. It doesn't fit in that this place is a family restaurant. I will definitely visit again when in town!
966	This is - well it's fantastic.  And I'm late writing this review but we were there during the X-mas holiday and it was AMAZING.  \n\nBut this is a freebie that you should check out regardless of the season.  Take a minute from drinking too much and trying to hit the Wheel of Fortune (I hear you - it's been so cold to me lately) and get yourself some cult-ah.  I happened to have a kid with me (my niece), but this is always good for the child-free as well.  Just a lovely place to spend time.  \n\nAnd now Steve Wynn is gone...  You can feel better going to these properties.  I know it makes me feel better knowing that the culture of sexual harassment is at least being addressed.  I still won't stay at a Wynn owned property until I know he's gone for sure....  but I think we can feel OK that the female employees will be treated better now.  But still vigilant!!
967	Went to see Miss Representation last night, hosted by Wisconsin Women in Government. Upon, arriving, asked the \"concierge\" where it was playing. \"Oh, they're over there, and they're doing everything\". She brusquely waved me in the direction I was supposed to go. Uh, thanks? \n\nNext: creepy, rude manager-dude who stood there doing absolutely nothing, and looked right through me as I waited to order food and drinks at the bar. Meanwhile, the older, richly-dressed women around me were served quickly. This was very frustrating, since I was trying to order something before the movie started.\n\nMiserable, unprofessional staff. I had an overpriced, undersized, and pre-cooked \"brat\". They had no kraut (SACRELIGE!), and the onions that came on it looked really old. I was told it'd take \"five minutes\" to make by the manager-dude, but it took a lot longer. This forced me to miss the beginning of the movie I paid almost 15 bucks to see. Hilariously, it was served in this huge- I mean huge!- round metal basket-thing that looked like it had been a light fixture in a previous life. The tiny pseudo-brat looked lost in the middle of it. It sure wasn't fun trying to return to my seat with that huge unwieldy thing, especially since the movie had already started. It actually CLANKED when I set it down. What idiot ordered those things? Christ.\n\nThe theater was nice, though. Comfortable seats, good sound, nice picture. I could see returning for some indie movies in the future, but I think I'll eat before I come.
968	I got really excited when I find out that Nestle Toll house is going to open in this outlet. They sell different kind of stuff from pastries to smoothie, they also sell crepes and frozen yogurt. One of my favorite here is the coconut macaroon! It brings me back in my childhood. The service was ok, they need to improve and smile more, they've been only open for several days.
969	I have been going here for a couple weeks now. For the most part I think this place delivers what it promises. If you are expecting a pill that you can take and lose weight and still eat whatever \/ as much as you want, this is not your place. They have not invented that pill yet that I know of. \n\nFirst, the lady at the front desk. I have been reading reviews of how rude she is or how her customer support skills are lacking. I actually witnessed some lady yelling (and threatening) her for a refund because she wasn't losing the weight. I think the lady at the front desk handled it perfect as the irate woman yelled at her for a good 30 minutes. You have to realize, this poor girl probably gets yelled at on a daily basis because people have unrealistic expectations and take it out on her because she's the first one they see. So to her, great job! keep it up!\n\nAs far as the program goes, I can say I am down 15lbs in 2 weeks. I credit this to the Phentermine. The program the Doctor puts you on is pretty much a cookie cutter solution. I don't think there is much variance here that I know of. You will get a couple packages of \"supplements\" with their name on it and enough Phentermine for a week. Luckily I respond well to this and I would assume that most would as well. As long as you are aware of what you are eating. For me, I still eat whatever I want (I'm not a fan of veggies so I don't eat them), it's all about moderation. The pills make it so I am not so hungry anymore so I do eat less and that's what works. \n\nThe facility is nice. Every one of the ladies who I have dealt with here has been kind, professional and provided outstanding service. I have never waited more than 10 minutes to get any service here. I usually go mid-day if possible to avoid any lines.\n\nOverall I would recommend this place if you are looking to shed a few pounds. Please just keep in mind, this isn't a miracle place because they don't exist. You will still need some self-control to make this work. And in the end, if it doesn't work for you please just suck it up and accept the fact that you could have done more, it's not the lady at the front desk's fault :)
970	Food was very good. The salads and baked goods are my favorite.  Especially the croissants.  The restaurant is very clean and comfortable. The young man at the register was very helpful and friendly.
971	First, the shop is SO DARN CUTE. It's perfect for a little coffee date or just to work on stuff you've been putting off all week. \n\nThe first time I went, I had a cupcake, their lemon blackberry I believe. Although they tasted good, the texture was a little dry and it felt like they had been sitting out all day. But still, I kept hearing great things and I came in again to try a red velvet the next time! Still dry. Definitely not worth it for the $$ they charge for just one cupcake. \n\nTheir coffee is great, and honestly I'll probably be back to try their icecream when it gets a little warmer. They've also re-done the menu since the last time I was there. \n\n\nTD;DR 5\/5 ambiance, 5\/5 service, 2\/5 cupcakes
972	Rude!! The girl answered the phone with an attitude. Put me on hold for 10 minutes. Honestly, if the receptionist was working in my practice with that attitude, she'd be fired. Never even made an appt or stepped in the office but I definitely won't be going there now.
973	If 0 stars was possible that would be their rating. Too smokey nasty environment and nothing other than gambling to keep you there.
974	Located in the Venetian over looking the canals. The service here is very poor and slow. \nSlow to get  drinks ordered and then the drinks. Our server seemed unhappy to wait on our large party and generally unhelpful. We sat for hours waiting for drinks and the meal.\nThey charge for chips and salsa as an appetizer.  The salsa was delicious with a nice roasted flavor. I have never been to any Mexican food places that charge for chips and salsa! \nGood guacamole \nThe black beans and cilantro rice are tasty.\nThe cheese enchiladas are OK covered with a spicy mole sauce.\n\nWe all felt the food was just average compared to most of our trips dining experiences.
975	Our airbnb host suggested this charming bistro for breakfast. we went for lunch. we can only hope the owner gets tired of the heat and relocates  to New Jersey . Creative  menu of omelets, quiche, crepes and sandwiches, great selection of hot and cold drinks, and terrific pastries. Warm friendly service, a real neighborhood gem. Go.
976	The butter chicken was awesome.  The naan bread wasn't as light and fluffy as it should have been but the portions are huge and very friendly on the phone.  We also got the Josh Rogan and Paneer.  Both good but the winner was the butter chicken!
977	It's a Bier Markt.  With so many places using the same formula, it's hard to tell them apart.  Also, the brand is also under the huge dominance of Recipe Unlimited Corporation (was Cara Operations - name change announced during this summer), who basically owns all the chain full service restaurants - including the Keg now.\n\nThe food here is not that great.  The ribs were very sweet but the best of the lot.  The pizza was pretty Mickey Mouse - a flat bread, some sauce, some cheese, one piece of sausage and one ring of hot pepper per slice.  Kindergarten kids do better on craft day.  The steak looked good but it was a disappointment as well.  Lucky there were a lot of Bier choices.  That usually saves the day!\n\nThis location is a pedestrian place.  If you drive, be prepared to despise every minute behind the wheel as you circle around to avoid traffic, obey signs, and dole out $20 to park on Portland.  They did do what they can with their subterranean location and the narrow sidewalk interfering patio.  I came down here because I \"had\" to.\n\nI personally think the food quality and creativeness of the kitchen has gone down since the take-over from Prime Restaurants.  A while back, I had a sit-down with one of the founder\/creator of Bier Markt and the story how the franchise came to life.  Very funny story but won't get into it on the review.  Suffice it say that I have seen a slide in the restaurant and I hope it doesn't happen at the Keg as well.\n\nAll in all, there are so many great places to spend your money down there.  I personally would go someplace that isn't part of the \"Borg\" Restaurant Collective.  Resistance is not-Futile!\n\n2.5 Stars - can go either way.\ncheers...
978	If you're craving some wings, this is a good option. I didn't come here often when I lived in Vegas, but when I did, I really enjoyed the food. The Hooter's restaurant is on the ground floor of the Hooter's Casino toward the far back.\n\nI always try to come when it wasn't rush hour so I am usually seated immediately. There are two sides of the restaurant, one for adults 21 and older and then the family side. I have been seated on both sides, but prefer the family side as it's more open and has a lot more light. I don't like eating in the dark!\n\nFood is good here, probably the best thing about this location. I've had the wings, chicken sandwich, fried pickles and curly fries. All delicious. Food usually comes out quickly. The girls that work there are your average Hooter girls. Skinny and boobs. Most don't have a personality, they just do their job and that's all. Some will smile, some will make conversation, but it seems like the girls are nicer to the people they think will leave them a bigger tip. \n\nWould come back again, but just for the food. Everything else is just average at best.
979	I have unremarkable hair. It's thin and straight and the natural color can only be described as blah. But Allison designed a cut that's cute, flattering and easy to style. When she was done the first time I went in I told her \"this is the cut I want for the rest of my life.\" \nHer balayage skills are on point too. She takes the time to chat and make sure she's giving you what you want and then works her magic until you walk out feeling like a million bucks. Highly recommend.
980	No. Just, no. I can't speak for the quality of the teacher because I couldn't hear how she interacted with my 2.5 year old. WHY couldn't I hear her you ask? Because I was behind glass AWAY from her when she hadn't ever had a swim lesson before! I didn't even get to take her in and meet the teacher. The teacher knew NOTHING about her but her name and I didn't even get to tell her about her anxiety. She had her doing things she had never heard of and she was terrified.
981	You know how most chicks love Michael's?\nThink of this place as the Michael's for dudes.\n\nAisle after aisle of craft beers. \nHandles of everything including Jager.\nAnd when they say Total Wine, they're not kidding. I saw wines from practically every country in the world except maybe Somalia or those really sandy, oily countries. \n\nThey even have a tasting room, which you'll want to get the schedule app'd into your Iphone like right now. \n\nIf there was ever a Mecca for the budding alcoholic, this place is it. \nWell maybe not exactly Mecca, since you'll likely be facing south after coming here.
982	I absolutely love this target! It is always very clean and organized including the bathrooms!! The customer service is excellent and people are always around to help. The food selection is on point as well. I love how this target is big and open and has a new store vibe still even though it's been there for a while. The only reason I took away a star is because sometimes the cashiers don't know how to do all the coupons and cartwheel and the parking lot is always so packed!
983	First time eating at this place in general. It was $9.99 for a sandwich and an extra almost $6 for a little bag of chips and soft drink...not worth! The sandwich itself was pretty good- got the Earl's club - it was so little but it's a packed sandwich! If I had know that there was another location with cheaper prices, I wouldn't have gone here.
984	I have shopped there but have just found out that the chicken in the fresh chicken counter is Halal ONLY! I have no problem about having a choice but there is NO choice in that counter and that is NOT right! I will not eat anything that is killed in that manner, the live bird has it's throat slit while being chanted over. To me that is discrimination selling this one kind of product & not making that along with what it means displayed to the public when they are there!
985	I went in for brunch this morning with my mom, and forgetting that every place would be slammed on a Saturday, we were having trouble finding a place that would not have a long wait. Fortunately, we went to this place last minute after calling ahead to ask for hold times to which I was replied with \"no wait time\".\n\nWe went in, and only had to wait for less than a minute for us to get a table in a full house. Our server, Ti, was EXCELLENT. She was very attentive, kind, and was super helpful when my mom accidentally spilled some ketchup on herself. We were very impressed with her service, that we gave her a handcrafted coap from our business that we run as a thank you.\n\nI had the strawberry pancakes with over medium eggs and hashbrowns. She had the blueberry oatmeal with a side of eggs. It was so delicious, and It didn't make me feel super full and bloated that starched pancakes normally would. It's a huge benefit that they make whole wheat pancakes, with decent servings. \n\nI like that they have the coffee pot and water pitcher readily available for you at the table. It takes pressure off the server and customer for when they want refills and how much of a serving they want. \n\nThe place was well lit, clean and the bathrooms were very clean too. \n\nOverall, I had a great experience and would come back again!
986	Fourth Ward Bread Company off Graham Street in #CLT is a welcome addition to the neighborhood but a LONG time coming. The space is large with lots of places to eat or lounge. I loved their blackboard wall and bicycle coffee valet station. Let me get into the food before commenting on operations. \n\nMost people know this place for their \"Kronuts\", but I agree with Kathleen Purvis\/Helen Schwab's funny video on it - they are tough and not delicious. So move onto the goodness. Kathleen says their standout offering is the pain du chocolat but I would argue it's actually the egg and cheese croissant where as Tae-Sun mentioned, they bake the egg with seasoning and fresh chives right into the croissant with pure deliciousness and provides a really filling crunch.\nFor sweets, I'd vote any of their bread puddings. I wouldn't say \"OH I'm a big bread pudding fan.\" It's usually heavy, and either too dry or too soggy. This is almost like a french toast bake but with absolutely delicious flavoring. I've tried Mocha, Chocolate, Blueberry and one other flavor they were giving samples of during their \"soft opening\" and each was totally delicious in every way. I couldn't even pick a favorite they were all fantastic.  Another great pick? Their brownies, which far outshine their GIANT blondie brownies or cookies. Their brownies are like fudge and definitely my favorite plain chocolate brownie in town. YUM.\n\nTheir roast beef sandwich is HUGE and pretty good, though there's au jus on is so sometimes the bread can be soggy. There are roasted peppers\/onions on it and it has decent seasoning but it really needs something else- like a horseradish spread or a spicy mustard. They offer 1 other sandwich and a bunch of pizza breads which I haven't tried. This town has a huge shortage of really good sandwiches (2 places I can think of), so I think they should totally expand their sandwich menu and their lunches would take off in a major way.  I'd be happy to be a sandwich consultant or taster (hint hint).  \n\nTheir coffee is pretty good, but I agree with Shalu- it's a bummer they don't have skim or 2% milk. \n\nLet's recap my five star faves here:\n- EGG & CHEESE CROISSANT\n- BREAD PUDDING (ANY FLAVOR)\n- BROWNIE\n- COFFEE\n\nBack to operations- I think they're bakers, and a friendly family owned business but clearly not experienced business owners. Not only did their upfit take forever, they teased us with signage for I swear a year until they opened. Not only that but they painted hours on the door a few weeks before they opened so there were poor sods like me who tried opening the door with no one in there. Not to mention their bizarre soft opening for a couple days and then closed back up and reopened weeks later. That's not a soft opening, that's called a trial run. They clearly need a marketing firm to advise them. Man, I'm harsh for a 4 star review! But my other operational complaint? Their hours. I can't tell you how many time It's been 8:20 pm and wanted to go there but they were closed. Argh. You want a bakery to be open for early breakfast or for post-dinner dessert. They don't have to be open 24 hours like Amelie's, but 7am -9 pm would be ideal especially since they have beer\/wine. I'd love to meet a friend for wine and dessert .\n\nI have faith they'll get more experienced and expand their menu so I look forward to coming back with a 5 star revised review. They're already MILES ahead of Nova's.
987	As a self proclaimed baklawa expert I felt it imperative to impart some knowledge.   \n\nIt's all about the layers...real baklawa is labour intensive, brushing a bit of butter on each thin sheet and then layering layer by layer.   This gives it the light but crunchy bite we all love.   Cheap baklawa is chewy because they will stack and layer multiple layers resulting in a chewy soggy baklawa.\n\nSo look for the flaky crisp layers people.\n\nClass dismissed
988	Matthew offers outstanding service! Have a venting issue, do yourself a favor and call him. There is truly no one else who can compare.
989	Only Positive things to say about Galleria in Henderson! GREAT STORES, FOOD, NO COMPLAINTS HERE! just a hole in my wallet lol...
990	As much a part of my Vegas experience as the dancing fountains at The Bellagio. \n\n   10:30 am on Sunday morning in Las Vegas. I call it \"The Hole\". You've pushed your senses as far as they will go all Friday and Saturday. By the time you land in The Hole, the mere mention of alcohol will induce a geyser from deep within your guts. Some fat girl is drinking a yard of beer at this hour and I have to look away. A group of hommies looks and sounds like they haven't been to bed yet. The cashier hollers out my order as if he has turrets. Ah, back to normal. \n\n   The medicine is a XX cheeseburger , add the egg please and a massive Diet Coke. Last stop is the gas station for Tylenol, Jerky and a lot of water. It's a long drive back to San Diego. There will be plenty of time to do the post game wrap up of the weekend on my 4 + hour drive. \n\n    Ah Vegas, till' next time.
991	What can I say. We showed up with a group of 15 and the service was exceptional. Too boot the food was delicious  and the servers were great\nI can't wait to visit again!
992	I'm not a usually a sweets type of guy - but pairing classic and nostalgic Asian flavours with desserts is a winner for me.  I think I prefer Wong's over Kekou -- Kekou is more of a crowd-pleaser but I think Wong's is more creative and less apt to 'dumb-down' flavours.  Case in point, their black sesame comes with salted duck egg.\n\nBut fuck that... I'm not here to talk about ice cream... I'm here to talk about chocolate:\n\nOn my first visit, we ordered some ice cream and I was browsing the shelves while they were preparing our cones... I noticed that they had Mi Goreng chocolate.  MI GORENG!  CHOCOLATE!  I honestly gasped... I heard the Flower Duet from Lakmé (or another equally cliche operatic aria) in my head... an idea so simple and obvious, I should have thought of it myself.\n\nFor those that don't know, (Indomie) Mi Goreng is a brand of instant Indonesian fried noodle and is a huge cult favourite.  I remember the first time I had Mi Goreng -- I was but a child but my Burmese friend asked if I want to try some Indonesian noodles - but honestly, it may as well have been Golden Triangle black tar heroin -- and I was hooked from that point on.  I had to hunt for Mi Goreng back in the day - but you nowadays you can find it for about $2 for 5-pack at most Asian supermarkets and I've even seen them at Loblaw's and Walmart.\n\nMi Goreng is basically a dry noodle flavoured by sweet soy sauce, garlic powder, fried onion oil and chili topped with fried shallots.  It's jam-packed with flavour and insanely satisfying for what is essentially a $0.40 pack of instant noodles.  I've had some really good meals in my life... and most aren't as satisfying as $0.80 worth of noodles, a fried egg and an extra squirt of Sriracha. When I've had 'real' mie goreng... you know, ACTUAL fried Indonesian noodles... they paled in comparison to Mi Goreng.\n\nMaybe it's the MSG... maybe it's the palm oil (sorry, orangutans)... maybe it's the sinful pleasure of how bad it is for you.  But I love Mi Goreng.  So... the idea of injecting the flavouring into high-test dark chocolate... FUCKING GENIUS.\n\nDespite my glee, I was wise enough to delay my purchase.  It was 35-degree day and I was still running errands in East Chinatown, so I knew it would melt before I could enjoy it.  So I made a point to come back on another day... just to buy some Mi Goreng chocolate.\n\nOn my return, the proprietor on Wong's told me that the Mi Goreng flavour is an exclusive collaboration with Onyx Chocolates and he was clearly proud of his creation.  I have to admit that I was a bit dismayed by him telling me that they replaced the MSG with their own formulation -- I get that he didn't want to make it seem like he just crumbled up some Mi Goreng packs and dumped it into a batch of chocolate... but ain't-nothing-wrong-with-MmmSoGood... I'll spare you from yet another tangent about the MSG-myth... from what is already a long ramble about Mi Goreng.\n\nAnyways -- the dark chocolate pairs perfectly with the Mi Goreng flavouring... the chocolate and the sweet soy roll into each other sublimely provide a lush bassline for the chili, onion and garlic highlights.  The embedded uncooked noodle and fried shallots provide extra texture.  The crazy thing is that my mouth felt like I just had Mi Goreng after having this chocolate.\n\nThe only downside of this majestic creation: $12 for a chocolate bar... for how good it is, I feel it is $12 good - it's beautifully created and basically the ideal niche product for me.  But I have to admit that my upbringing doesn't allow me to spend that much without feeling a tinge guilty.\n\nAnyways -- Wong's Ice Cream... damned solid Asian inspired ice creams... and some god-tier Mi Goreng chocolate.
993	Been here twice now - once on Thanksgiving Eve and this past Saturday. First time there, it was dead. Second time, it was packed and hard to walk around.\n\n3 different rooms, bar\/lounge, dance floor and game room. Cool layout, decent DJs (Kris the fist was there in November). I like the arcade games. Your typical newer, somewhat urban Phoenix bar. Not sure how the Gypsy fits into this, but whatever. I'd check it out if you're nearby but this scene is probably not for everyone.
994	Wow, silly me.  Here I was hesitant to look up Appliance Hell-hole, I mean Depot, and leave a negative review.  Sadly I'm not the first, and probably not the last to get screwed over by these douche bags.  I found them through a listing on Craigslist for a smoking hot deal on a \"SXS Kenmore Elite Fridge - $750 (2424 W.UNIV.RD)\"  Too good to be true (and it was).  480-694-9999 (business number) should have been another red flag, as the listing was posted as such:  Just completed home remodel and selling my stainless Kenmore Elite refrigerator model # 106.55603400 Fridge is in great shape normal wear.. Ice cold with built in ice maker and new water line. All drawers and shelves. Really good unit!Sears extended warranty goo until 5\/2015. \n$700 O.B.O\" \n\nSounded like an appliance by owner listing right?  Even the misspellings, obo, and of course the \"just completed home remodel.\"  I call them up and come over, low and behold it's a shyster appliance store.  The SXS must mean scam + screw over, instead of side by side.  The \"deal\" I was looking for \"had just sold\" fortunately for me they had more, so I foolishly purchased an identical one (looked like the same in the picture on craigslist) for 875, plus the warranty listed on the ad - that's their rinky dink warranty they tell you have 30 days parts and labor on the fridge.  The same day shipping they promised - delayed by two days, all on account of they \"needed a big truck with a lift gate to deliver it to a residential address.\"  Piece of crap shows up on the back of some twenty year old fixer up pick up truck!  The two idiots unload it like they were taught at the Helen Keller moving school for idiots.  They roll the fridge in, sans skirt at the bottom because that broke when they dropped it on the ground unloading it, plug it in, as I was told they would \"make sure the fridge would be running and working prior to leaving.\"  They also were willing to take my old fridge away to be \"recycled\" for free, so I figured, awesome, one less problem.  After  all I was tired of looking at it as it had a bad compressor, and the front door was scratched\/bent diagonally down the right side from me moving it years ago.  WRONG!  They leave and I notice the temp hasn't gone down, I wait an hour, two, three, I call them back and was told \"oh you need to wait at least 8 hours before it cools down.\"  Fast forward to the next day, still the same temperature, they finally send some douche bag who's supposedly their certified repair tech.  He says; \"ohh the compressor is burnt out, that's probably due to a surge in power through the electrical system; you should claim that under your home warranty.\"  The other option was they could order a new compressor and install for ooohh $500! Right then and there I knew I had been f*cked, and I mean proper f*cked too.  So here I am with a POS fridge bad from moment one, and they're bending me over the barrel.  Much like the other reviews the scum bag who sold it to me apparently goes in to the witness protection program, never to be seen or heard from again.  I go back with the fridge in my friend's truck and demand a refund, while I'm waiting for these idiots to finish their \"who's on first, what's on third\"  Abbot and Costello routine on how they're not giving my money back I look over and low and behold MY OLD FRIDGE with a sales sign for $900!  Yup same fridge, same diagonal bend and scratch down the door.  Long story short they gave back $300 cash and told me to hit the road.  Their scam is simple, they get old fridges blow a little life back in them and sell them to simpletons like me.  Save yourself the frustration and NEVER come here.....
995	great service in the office ,calls etc. Adam and Damien did a great job , done in 20 minutes. Very professional
996	I can't find a contact email otherwise I would have contacted them directly and given them a chance to respond\/correct. Alas, here I am on Yelp.\n\nThe food was delicious (The pollo Rico is in fact very rico). My seasonal marg was as strong as a cross fit-er.\n\nI just have one major complaint. Our party of 5 was seated at a long booth. They repeatedly passed things from behind me over the back of the booth. It was the weirdest thing. All of a sudden, there would be an iced tea by my ear. I don't care if it's convenient for the server team, it was jarring and odd.
997	The food was so so. The waiter was fine. For this being dicks, they were not too bad at all. I expected he full experience of sarcasm and rudeness but didn't really receive it.
998	Hands down, the best country fried steak I've ever had. It's BOSS. In the words of Tracy Jordan, I would take it behind the middle school and get it pregnant.\n\nI made a little road trip to this place after a friend recommended it to me. It was worth the 30 minute commute. \n\nThe coffee was great, the prices were reasonable, the potty was clean... I don't really have much more to state about this that hasn't already been said. \n\nYou cannot go wrong here... It's impossible!
999	After several friends recommended the lunch buffet here, I decided to give it a try. I came on a weekday at 11:30 and mine was the only car in the parking lot, so I decided to go do a quick errand in one of the area establishments. I came back just a few minutes after noon and the parking area was packed - a good sign. The dining area has plenty of seating for individuals or groups of different sizes, and I was given a seat at a table for two. Water and a basket of freshly made naan bread quickly followed.The buffet offered most of the Indian restaurant standards. I sampled a bit of everything and found most of the offerings to be very good, except for the pakora (vegetable fritters) which were on the dry side. I came back for more servings of aloo matar and chicken tandoori, which I liked the most from the array served that day. Service is very friendly and the price for the lunch buffet was very reasonable.
1000	This has been a really long time bookmark for me, and for whatever reason, it's taken forever to get here. We stopped by after a recent event, and I only wish we'd been sooner. Between 4 people we ordered...\n\nDeviled Scotch Eggs - Absolutely delicious! Between the fried sausage exterior and creamy yolk mix there's a ton of flavor and textures. \n\nPub Poutine - Just order it. The lamb is super tender, the fries are nice and crispy...and between the Rosemary, goat cheese and curry the flavor is just incredible. \n\nFish & Chips - Where'd this thing come from? This thing is ridiculously huge, but ridiculously tasty too. Nice crispy and salty exterior with moist, flaky fish inside. Oh, and the tartar sauce is actually worthwhile.\n\nMums Mealoaf - Meatloaf in burger form, I'm in. Nice thick slab of meatloaf topped with mashed potatoes, onions and Guinness ketchup. Slap yo mum delicious. Need I say more?\n\nCider Glazed Pork Chop - No kidding, one of the best I've had in a restaurant. Super thick, meaty pork chop with a slightly sweet glaze. Might even want to gnaw on the bone when you're done. \n\nGuinness Stew - Beef, potatoes, veggies. Simple, but great. This is definitely the heartiest dish we had, but lots of flavor that'll leave you warm and happy.\n\nIf only we would've had the room to try out desserts. But really everything we had was great, the service was fast and friendly, and I'd come back in heartbeat. The prices aren't bad and associated resort employees even get an additional 20% off. \n\nTL;DR - Come here. Order whatever the hell you want, it'll be good. You'll leave happy.
