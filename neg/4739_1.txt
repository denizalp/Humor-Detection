The service was good.. The food okay.. I can not eat a lot of garlic and the food is all in garlic.. I ordered the Grits & Egg and was unable to eat the item..\nWow..\nI am impressed the GM called about my experience, because of his professionalism and his concern..this shows that he cares..I will try 702 again .. I will Update my review..
