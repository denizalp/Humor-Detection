Incredible friendly, casual environment with superb service and fantastic menu.  Our table grew in size as friends unexpectedly arrived, the staff was more than gracious and accommodating.  We sampled drinks, appetizers, entrees and even some items off the menu.  Table-wide, consensus was \"Fantastic!\"
