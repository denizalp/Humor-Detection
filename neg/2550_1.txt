Super knowledgeable boot fitter at this location.  Everyone is helpful and has experience on the slopes.  Many of the staff members are younger.  They give good advice but they don't always have the older body perspective- they speak from their own mainly.  They are knowledgeable and will give you advice.  \nNo matter where you shop, do some homework- educate yourself.  It shows you care, it will help you participate in the conversations and to select the best equipment for you.
