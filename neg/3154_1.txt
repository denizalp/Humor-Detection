Wow. This restaurant is amazing. Our waiter Pasquale was fabulous- kind and informed. I won't even bother to write what we ate because it was all amazing (although I had the lobster and it was Devine). I'll just say- when the conversation stops when the food arrives and you forget to drink your wine - you KNOW it's amazing food. 5 stars all around- including a beautiful, comfortable environment.
