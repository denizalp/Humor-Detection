I went here on a friend recommendation, and my honest opinion of this place is that it's an average Thai restuarant. The food stood out as neither bad, or amazing. It was simply decent. Note that the basic pad thai might be a little on the sweet side compared to other that places, but depending on you mood that can be a good thing.\n\nPrices seems fairly reasonable too. About $8-10 depending on what kind of pad thai you get. You can probably use that as a base from which to judge the rest of the menu pricing.
