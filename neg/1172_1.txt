I had the beef and chicken combo dish with pita, and it was really good especially for the price. Also two thumbs up for the friendly waitress who suggested this dish. Next time I'm passing through Cleveland and I'm near an Aladdin's, I'll have to try their other dishes. Too bad they don't have a chain in my neighborhood in California. Oh, well. Otherwise bon appetit!
