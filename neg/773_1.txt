We go often and the food is always yummy.  Try the specials.  I love their bread!  Be prepared for a food coma afterwards.  The atmosphere is quite interesting you almost feel like this is where the boys hold their meetings although I have yet to see this.  The have a separate dining room that is usually occupied by some Shriner's type groups.  It doesn't matter anyways because trust me if you are there it's definitly for the food.
