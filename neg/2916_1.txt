This veterinary office is clean and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  They offer discounted services and they seem honest with their recommendations.  Another bonus is Dr. Askew is awesome with our pets and has over 20 years of experience.  Other low costs clinics do not compare to this one and I was more impressed with Homeward Bound than with any other full cost clinic I have taken my pets to.
