Found some great reviews on this place... to be honest the burgers were fine, nothing to like rejoice over. However getting the fries California Style, was amazing, best specialty fries that i've ever had at a burger spot, so I hook it up with a 3 star based on the fries alone. If you try this place def get them done that way.
