My favorite part about coming to Gallagher's is my favorite bartender, Cristin \"The Pirate\" Bartender. Not only does she greet every customer as they enter, she truly cares about her customer's experience while in her care. She goes out of her way to ensure that people's needs are met, their orders are timely and delicious, and she will do whatever she can to ensure that her guests are happy. She is the bomb dot com!!!
