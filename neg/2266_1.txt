Got oil change there and started asking about tires.  The guy gave me a few options and explained to me how Firestone and such places make money by advertising a cheap tire.  It is all the balancing, valve stem, warranty's they sell you one when most tires have a warranty anyway.   I ended up going with 29th street after Firestone quoted me.  I get a much better deal and my tires are still going good.
