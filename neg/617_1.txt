Expensive, but super cute place to go to. Came here with a friend and we shared a bottle of wine and a pizza. The pizza was fantastic. Wine was alright, a little pricier than I was expecting. But overall it was a cute place. Waiter was alright. He didn't seem all that interested in us though. He just acted funny with any questions I had. Otherwise everyone else was nice!
