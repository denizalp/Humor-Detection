We have visited the  ahwatukee location twice.  The first time the toppings were sparse but the wings were good.  The second time the  toppings were wrong  on our takeout pizza and they did not show us the pizza as they normally did. We did not realize until we were home and did not call them to complain. Overall their wings are better than you would get at a chain but their pricing on pizza, minimal toppings  and lack to detail will keep this from being our pizza place.
