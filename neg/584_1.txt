A busy Friday night with a Brophy HS football game at PHX college across the street did not slow down the excellent service all night. The burgers, wings, and onion rings were all very tasty. The wings had a good bit of heat (ordered med) and tasty without being stupid. Ice cold pitchers of beer on a 114 degree late afternoon speaks to the fast service. A classic joint where the food is the issue and not a cookie cutter chain.  A great patio with ping pong and plenty of misters.
