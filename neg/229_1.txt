I was recommended this by a co-worker so I went for lunch.\n\nWhile the service was very slow even by evening standards, the food was fresh.\n\nMy order included:\n\nCrunchy Spicy Tuna Roll\nEbi Sushi\nSmoked Salmon Sushi\nPrawn Tempura Roll\nHouse Roll\nDynamite Roll\nGreen Tea\n\nWhile the service is slow as previously mentioned, it is pleasant. Hopefully, on my next trip, they will be faster!
