This is a pretty good quick stop, kinda dated nothing special as far decor goes, don't expect any glamor.  I have only been here for the lunch special and I got the same item both times jus different levels of heat, Thai Rice with Pork is pretty good the Chef knows his way around the dish, the flavor compliment the meal quite well.\n\nI can recommend this establishment with no problem, but as I stated I have only had 1 dish twice and no complaints.
