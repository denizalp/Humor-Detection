No more shuffle board.. such a disappointment. They added more seating area which is cool but shuffleboard is AWESOME! no more bean bags.. maybe the drunkies just spilled too much on them . GRR.  Its a cool hang out. Non-smoking inside which is a nice change from most places in Vegas. Plenty of games to check out. Drinks a bit over priced. Good food in the cafe.  Its a nice change of pace.
