You know, this may not be a fair review. I'm comparing this to Boston's Pizza. It doesn't even compare. I had a meat slice and a pepperoni slice. These are New York style pizzas. The crust was still crispy, but the kicker was that there was a ton of taste in each bite. The pepperoni had a strong meaty taste and the Mozzarella had tons of taste in itself. If you're in Paris, check this place out!
