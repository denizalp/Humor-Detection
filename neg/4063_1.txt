Located next to the cobra arcade bar, cool venue with a modern and rustic appeal.  I ordered the almond Thai tea and mango slushee with boba.  Both drinks were refreshing and decently priced. The Drinks however are powder based, even the Thai tea had a powder base which I had not seen.  The drinks therefore taste more sugary and less natural.  Would definitely come back to this location to try the shaved ice.
