Ordered dinner here recently. Food was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Everything tastes like it was made in bulk earlier in the day (or a day or two earlier). King Pao chicken and curry chicken we Very greasy. Chicken lettuce wraps filling was mushy and lacked flavor. Even the wonton soup was bad...broth tasted good and veggies in it tasted fresh, but the wonton noodles themselves were mush and obviously had been sitting in the broth for a day or more. I wouldn't waste my money ordering from this place again.
