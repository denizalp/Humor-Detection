Really expensive but then again which buffet on Vegas isn't.  That being said one of the better ones I had. \n\nWe were there at around 330 pm so one might expect the food to be stale.  \n\nGood stuff\nOslo Busco.  \nSeafood bollingase(can't spell it)\nBeef ribs both Asian and BBQ. \nDeserts \n5 dollar pitcher of bud light \n\nThings to stay away from. \nSushi\nHush puppies
