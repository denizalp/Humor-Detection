Too big.  I once went here to buy some paint and didn't find my way out till two days later.\nGood selection but the constant jingle is awful.  I don't know how the employees stand it.  \nGood customer assistance and returns service so hats off to that.  \nThe owner's reputation in regard to politics and the environment is awful.   So I try not to shop here much.
