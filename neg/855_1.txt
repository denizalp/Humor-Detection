Not good breakfast, everything is too salty. They messed up our order and took it to different table, forgot few other things we requested. Not good breakfast meaning it's typical normal breakfast you can make better breakfast at home with less oil. I would have given 1 start but because our serve at least had a good attitude. Never going back
