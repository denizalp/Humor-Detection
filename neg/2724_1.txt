Skimpy with giving you food you pay for. Got calamari and Caesar salad. No bacon, no parmesan cheese, hardly any dressing in the lettuce. Received my food and there's barely anything in there to eat. Way to go guys! Nothing makes my day better than paying $12 to wait in line for 15 minutes and receive hardly any food. Cheers..
