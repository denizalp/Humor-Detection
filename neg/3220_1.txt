Late Sunday brunch with my husband. The service was good, we were greeted, seated promptly, and drinks refilled and checked on adequately. The food was average, at best. The Chorizo con Huevos was not good, the chorizo was undercooked. The beans taste like they are from a can. The enchilada sauce a light orange flavorless sauce (very likely also from a can). The rice was bland.  There is an attempt to compensate for the poor quality food by providing immense, cheese covered servings.  We probably won't be back.
