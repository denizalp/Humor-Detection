My FAVORITE breakfast\/lunch spot in VEGAS, their menu is HUGE, its so hard to make a decision, My favorite dish is definitely the Chicken fried steak its just amazing, and hits the spots those days after drinking in vegas and waking up around noon.  I found this place from one of my buddies whose a local, and everytime im in vegas i go here for lunch or breakfast there are no lines like the dinners or restaurants at the strip, and its good to get away from the strip for a bit.
