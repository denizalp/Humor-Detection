Been there 3-4 times. On all occasions the staff was friendly. Service was a bit lethargic though and we werent greeted and seated immediately. \n\nFood menu isnt all that great (mind you my visits were a couple of years ago so maybe they've changed since then?) but drink menu is decent.\n\nWould only visit if im back in the area and feel like having a quick pint. \n\nThey also have a patio so decent for warm weather I guess.
