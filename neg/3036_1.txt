Today was our first time to try Wildflower Bread (just moved here from PA). The broccoli soup was delicious and the chicken pesto sandwich so fresh and tasty. The manager Frank was so welcoming and we appreciated him taking the time to tell us about what they offer. Loved the hazelnut chocolate chip cookies and looking forward to returning to try the pastas!
