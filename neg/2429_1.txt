Gord and I had breakfast this morning at the Java House.  It's a place we've passed by about a million times but have never stopped in.\n\nWe both ordered breakfast ($5.25).  Gord got bacon and eggs.  I got mine with ham.\n\nBreakfast comes with a salad which we exchanged for a fruit salad (for $1 more).  It was a good hearty breakfast.\n\nThe servers were friendly.
