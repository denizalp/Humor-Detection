best coffee! Super friendly people\/employees...every time you go there, it's like your talking to an old friend...\nthey take the time to ask you how you are, and make conversation,  plus, they make frozen treats for your fur babies, or give them a doggie bone!  the coffee choices are amazing! and, after 10, you get a free one! it's a great place!
