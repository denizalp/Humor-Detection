I love this place (and I've been to another one of their locations as well). The food is consistancy delicious - I've gone fairly frequency over the last couple of years and have always left happy. My favourite is the tandoori chicken dinner but the kofta, barg, chicken break, tikka beef, and wraps are all good. And that fresh naan with the spicy dipping sauce is fanastic. I highly recommend you check out Bamiyan Kabob!
