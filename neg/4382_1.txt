Stopped here on a whim when I was starving in the middle of the day after a manicure down the road.\n\nOrdered two cheese pastizzi to go - they were so good! Buttery, flaky, and piping hot and super cheap (I believe they were $1.50 each).\n\nWill return to try some of their other food options (lasagna, other pastas, etc).
