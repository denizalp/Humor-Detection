Not too many places for dim sum in Mississaugs it seems.  This place was fairly busy on a Saturday afternoon.  Took a number and waited awhile.  Good variety of dishes although was disappointed that some of the fried dishes were cold i.e. trolley coasting for too long.  No dish was memorable. Ok for dim sum fix once in awhile.
