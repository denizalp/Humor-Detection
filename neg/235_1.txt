Not bad there with group. . . OK price ( have had cheaper and better elsewhere). WiFi was good. $15 resort fee. Old CRT tube TV with lousy signal.  Called for room service listed as 24 hr service, But that closed at 10?.  Both ice makers on floor were broken for stay despite calling front desk.   They said just go to first floor.  Lots of parking. Prob would not stay again under my choice but to be with group it was fine.
