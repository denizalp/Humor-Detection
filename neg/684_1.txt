This place sucks!!  I dropped off my dog at 1pm. They told me that she'd be ready in about 2 1\/2 hours.  I got to the place at 4pm and my dog was in the crate still waiting to get groomed.  I went crazy.  This is the owners fault.  Don't you see a dog sitting in the crate and you completely ignore her.  How about bringing it to the attention of your employees.  I got so angry that I took my dog and left.  I don't recommend this place at all.  Very bad ownership.  She lost my business.
