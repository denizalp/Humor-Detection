I'm a Chinese food fanatic and this is the best so far. I live in Gilbert (have tried every restaurant out here and this place beats them all) and drive out here 3 times a week just to get decent Chinese at a decent price. \nMust say though they used to have this really rude guy working there who would yell at all the customers but I think they got rid of him since I haven't heard or seen him around lately, Good move!
