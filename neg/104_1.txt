Went on a date with my wife last night. The food did not disappoint (awesome osso buco) but the sevice was inattentive bordering on disinterested. Ill give them a bit of a pass because they were packed for the valentines day crowd. But there are a lot of good italian choices out there... Will probably search elsewhere.
