I am so thankful to have found Dr Quan! He has helped me so much with the pain in my neck and shoulders I have been dealing with for many years. I had tried just about everything, adjustments, decompression, shots, physical therapy and nothing lasted. I have seen improvements in my posture, no more headaches and my energy level is up. Thank you Dr Quan!!
