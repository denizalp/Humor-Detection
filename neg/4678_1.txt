Went here the other day with a co-worker for lunch.\n\nStrangely enough I didn't end up getting the sushi here and ended up going Korean with their Bibimbap. Fantastic, so was their Miso soup that came with my meal.\n\nThe only problem I had here was the steamed dumplings which came out a bit watery and diluted the flavor of the dish.\n\nA-OK by my standards, another great Asian restaurant to check out if you are in the area!
