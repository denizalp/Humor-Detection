The pizza is always decent here, however, if you pay nearly $10 for a garden salad, I'm sure you would expect all of the veggies listed on their menu, and not just a couple pieces of each....and I wouldn't expect to pay all that money for straight lettuce. I can buy a head of lettuce for under $1. Why would I pay that much for iceberg? Absolutely ridiculous. So disappointed! What a waste of money! I saw the picture someone posted of the salad, and thought they were exaggerating; absolutely not! Don't waste your money
