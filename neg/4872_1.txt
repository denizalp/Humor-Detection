Great Selection of food! They even had breakfast foods when we were there at 3pm. I'm good with just Prime Rib, my husband ate just about everything there. The crab legs soaked in a bowl of butter being his favorite. Selection of desserts is insane! Beer and wine is included on the price which I believe was $35 each, we were there on a Saturday.  I used a buy one get one free buffet from myVegas slots, so SCORE!!
