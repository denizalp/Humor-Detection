This Chinese Buffet doesn't really stick out from the other Chinese buffets. It's clean, has good service and the food is decent, but there's nothing really special about it. Like the fish were pretty fresh and some weren't as much... but the food is more than edible or tasty. And the atmosphere is good also.
