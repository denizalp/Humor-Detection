What a great find! We had a puppy emergency and stumbled across this place in need of help. Our puppy had been bit and would definitely need stitches. Being a Saturday, we didn't know where to go. The staff was friendly, comforting and Dr. Wright was patient, kind and attentive.  They made this traumatic ordeal seem much less severe and took care of our little puppy swiftly and professionally.  We have been back 3 times since and would highly recommend this team for your furry children :)
