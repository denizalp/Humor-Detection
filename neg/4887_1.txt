We've been taking our cat and dog to Caring Hands for about three years and we couldn't be happier. Both of our pets have some complicated medical issues and we have always received the most competent and compassionate care from Curt and Rebecca. The staff is caring and professional and all the techs really seem to enjoy seeing our pets when we come in. The cost is extremely reasonable and the vets never recommend services or tests that aren't necessary.
