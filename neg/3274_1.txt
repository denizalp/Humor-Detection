So I'm a transplant from CA and looked this place up. By far the best decision I have made. Super friendly staff, and they are super on point with everything!!! I walked in and walked out with a tester leg and new foot set up in the same day. I cannot Express enough how absolutely awesome the entire staff is, and Michelle in particular. Michelle always keeps me informed, with texts and calls, and works around my schedule. This place is truly magnificent!!! Kudos to you guys for being the raddest of rad!!!
