Went there for the first time Friday night , service was amazing and the food was outstanding, and the margaritas, one of those babies will put you on your butt! The only thing I may have to say negative but not a complaint is the Mariachi band was so loud I could hardly talk to my date or our waiter, but the music was really good. Can't wait to go there again, real soon.
