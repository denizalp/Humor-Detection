I've had several good business meetings here.  Really the only thing I've tried is the regular coffee, so I need to try the food and the smoothies.  \n\nFriendly staff and managers and a very roomy location with outdoor seating.\n\nI'll be back regularly... It's nearly Paradise for coffee shops!  Plus I have a rewards card to use.
