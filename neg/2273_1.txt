Tables had like an hour wait even though I could see empty tables either way sat at the bar with some loud heavily drinking people but that was the worst of it. I had the truffle mac and cheese and lobster risotto. Not much lobster in the risotto but the truffle mac and cheese, changed my life!!!! Hands down the best I've ever had.
