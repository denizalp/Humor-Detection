Service was horrible - waited almost 20 mins for waiter to take our order and then he never asked how it was after he brought it. \nFood was OK - I had the chicken club sandwich which was okay, the chicken was kind of gross and way too salty but everything else in the sandwich made up for it. \n\nAlso no side came with the order, not even a small salad or anything. Wasn't impressed. Prob won't go again.
