These people have worked some serious miracles on my clothes. Not only are they fantastic cleaners and tailors, they also do repairs that make my stuff look brand new. It's not like I'm in there every week, but they always remember my last name without asking. Prices are very reasonable, too. I recently strayed to a spendier competitor while Norge was on vacation, and my wallet is crying after that bill. \n\nCash only, but it doesn't bother me.
