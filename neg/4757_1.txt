This place has really declined over the years.  About 5 or more years ago the sushi was great, but it's gone downhill.  I do not recommend going here.  I was at Shinto a couple weeks ago and the sushi rice was bland, unseasoned, and on the mushy side.  Also,  I ordered a scallop appetizer that the menu described as four U-10 sized scallops.  The scallops I received were probably U-30s, very small and definitely not worth the $7.00 I had to pay.
