I love coming here.  The food is fresh and good and you can get in and out in 20 minutes (usually......not at lunch though, it is packed).  My favorite is the enchilada stuffed with a corn bread........it is so friggin good.  The guacamole is excellent and I usually hit this place up at least once a week.
