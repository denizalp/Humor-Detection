I took my family to The Arrogant Butcher last night and, as I have experienced previously, the food was excellent! I've eaten here several times and everything I've tried has been amazing. Additionally, Ian, our server last night, was on point. He joined in having fun with my 3 year-old grandson and was not phased by me having a suitcase in tow as I had come straight from the airport. Ian was so 'on' he even anticipated when we needed drinks refreshed. Great service! I'll keep coming back!
