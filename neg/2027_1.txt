The toxic environment in my gated community, I once believed, was wholly due to an HOA board that couldn't be gotten rid of. However, as the threats and bullying have escalated over the 3+ years I've lived here, it's been made clear to me that not only is the management company aware of the toxic situation, and the harassing and bullying board members (past and present), they are complicit with and facilitate it.
