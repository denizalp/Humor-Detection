I am thrilled with the terrific service I received.  My previous service from another company was underwhelming to say the least.  Lots of areas missed, including under the beds.  The cleaners from House Spouse were much more diligent and really tackled the areas missed by the other house cleaning service.  I also had house spouse service my pool - it is finally free of algae.  The rates charged for various services are extremely competitive with other cleaning companies and House Spouse does a much better job!
