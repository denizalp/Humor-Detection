The food at this, as with most Hard Rock Cafes, is adiquate. The staff is friendly. And the memorabilia is a worthy distraction. What more do you want? As aptly stated in the movie Office SpaceÂ (1999) -  \"People can get a cheeseburger anywhere, okay? They come to Chotchkie's for the atmosphere and the attittude.\"
