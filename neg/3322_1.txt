I think basically everything has been said about Yasu, it was just incredible. The freshest fish that I've ever tasted, the most amazing chefs, attentive service. Sit.at.the.bar.people. We left full, drunk, satisfied and I think this ruined all other sushi for me because I've tasted what it could be like and literally, nothing lives up to this quality. \n\nThis place is just wow, go, go, go.
