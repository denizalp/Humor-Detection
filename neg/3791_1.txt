And they have killed it again with another great location! \nAfter frequenting multiple I was in the central phx area and decided to swing by. I was greeted by the entire team as I entered!! Food was great as well. PSA For those who are frequent choppers they longer provide on the side sauce you have to request it. All in all a very great experience. Only thing that's missing is recycling.. with all of the paper and Plastic that's used I'm not sure why this doesn't exist yet
