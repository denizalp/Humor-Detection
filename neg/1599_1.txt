Excellent burgers!! Waited for a bit longer since we ordered almost everything 'animal style', toasted buns and well-done fries. Definitely worth it though. Cashier was very friendly and patient even when we were indecisive. \nNot as busy as we thought it'd be. The line was not consistently long, food was quick and all the condiments were refilled when they were low. \n\nGreat place!!
