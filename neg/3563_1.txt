This place is scary and a dump. \n\nThere are long lines for check out and customer service. I can never find anyone to help me.\n\nI have actually done price comparisons of items I use on an ongoing basis and 50% of them were cheaper at Target and 50% were cheaper at Wal-Mart. So there is no reason to go to this gross Wal-Mart if you are doing it to get a good deal.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go to Target.\n\nAnd DON'T go here after dark. IT IS NOT SAFE!
