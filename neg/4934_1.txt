I had heard the wings were good. I had the dry rub Cajun variety. Meh! They had this type of chili there tho that made it all worth it. I had two bowls. Great stuff. Typical pub food here. Good atmosphere. Tvs at tables. Great staff. My rating is based solely on one visit. Take with grain of salt. Would go again. Just won't get dry rub wings this time.
