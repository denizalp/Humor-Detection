I would love to show you the love I ate but it was too damn good! Plus the customer service was top notch grade A like the food. The pickled tomatoes are a MUST EAT! Traditional cornbeef Rueben will leave you wanting more...it's hard to be on a plant-based diet with AMAZING food like this! Thank you
