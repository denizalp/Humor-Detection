Fabulous evening on the patio with my Fianc√©e. Excellent service from starting with a warm greeting in the parking lot to the beautiful smiles at the front desk. Our server was prompt, sweet and attentive. Highly recommend the Barrel aged Manhattan and the Caesar Salad. I had the Scottish Salmon - excellent bites of risotto with the salmon. My love had the trumpet mushrooms (only $9, really?) and the butternut squash pasta (hand rolled)\n. Topped it off with tiramisu and tawny port. \nFat Ox is an excellent addition to the Scottsdale restaurant scene. We will be regulars.
