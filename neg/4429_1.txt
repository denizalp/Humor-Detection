Upper Management should reconsider their decision to put Aileen in management at the restaurant. She didn't know policies when it came to any questions for coupons\/discounts at the buffet. She was super unhelpful. Ruby (I believe that was her name) was the only person who had any knowledge. Unlimited drinks included with the buffet was nice, but might rethink this buffet.
