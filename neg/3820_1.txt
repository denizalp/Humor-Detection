A lot of good review for this place so I was really excited to try it. The owner was there who was very welcoming and gave us some free garlic knots for our first vist. The downfall was the food, we had a peperoni pizza and knots which were both very bland in taste, they need to add some flavor to their sauce it was pretty watery and lacked taste. I really wanted to like this place but too bad :(
