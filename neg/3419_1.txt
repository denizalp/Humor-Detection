Counter rep engages in small talk, to confuse you during signing off. He used double talk to have us sign for insurance after we said we didn't need.  Customer service is a joke, you they right a ticket, the person on phone cannot serve you directly. Someone else gets tickets and sends a standard message They use deceptive billing be real careful or better yet never use them.
