I came here to buy some chocolates for my wife. The woman helping me put together the custom box of 9 was very patient and helpful. She asked if I wanted to try any and kept insisting that I take some samples. This is the way that everyone should be treated at a chocolate shop! My wife was very happy with her little Valentine's Day gift and I now have a go-to spot to buy foodie presents for all my friends and family. Very happy my cousin told me about this place!
