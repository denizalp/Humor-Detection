Called sunrise on a recommendation from my home inspector. Prompt service, friendly, but you will pay for it.. they are not cheap.. had them come out for routine maintenance on A\/C unit $159 this also includes a winter service soo I guess it's not too bad. During inspection technician found oil leaking from capacitor recommended getting new one to which I agreed $165. I went on Amazon the thing actually costs $12... :\/
