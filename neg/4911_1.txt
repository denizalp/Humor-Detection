We stopped for quick bite, something different. Young lady behind the counter greeted us, very pleasant. The place is nice and very clean. I ordered the Chicken Kabob and my husband order the lamb, food came out with salad and white rice. it was hot and delicious.  It was the right amount of portions for the money. We decided to visit them one more time before leaving to go home to NY.
