Great course! The class and the teachers offer so much to help you learn, keep you interested, and to get you familiar with everything. They even offer help finding a job! Both teachers are chill and create a relaxed environment, they understand that you are learning and will make mistakes. It is however A lot to learn and absorb so i would recommend the two week class to give that extra time to memorize and study but all in all great class I definitely recommend it if your trying to get into bartending.
