Great services and great omelet! The prices are good, not that expensive! Good place to have your breakfast\n\nCocktails are nice, I ordered Tom's cocktail. A cocktail with vodka, strawberry pur√©e, cucumber, lime, gingerbeer and mint. Almost tasted healthy, yum! \n\nThe service during breakfast was good, friendly waiters! They refilled our cup of coffee and glasses of water regularly. \n\nThe bar keepers during the evening were unfortunately not that enthusiastic. I like when someone shows if he or she loves his or her job, but they didn't it without any passion it all.
