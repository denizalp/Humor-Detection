I popped in for breakfast on a Saturday. The atmosphere looked promising, and the service was excellent. Sadly, the food was unappetizing. It is difficult to screw up a simple breakfast: scrambled eggs, toast, bacon, and potatoes. Nothing tasted fresh, and the quality was equal to a diner two blocks away for half the price. It is unlikely I will eat here again.
