We went there twice while we were visiting Toronto. The service and food was good.  I really liked the way they cook their steak very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\nJumbo Tiger shrimp is delicious and I think their Australian Pinot Noir is great for the price.\nI would not recommend the Tiramisu.
