I have been to about 80% of the fine dining steakhouses in Las Vegas. This is probably my new favorite steakhouse. The ambiance is top notch and the customer service was outstanding (as it should be for fine dining). My steakhouse salad, filet mignon, and sides were 5 Stars. You must try this out and compare. And I will admit, it is steep competition in Las Vegas where it is the small things that sets steakhouses apart.
