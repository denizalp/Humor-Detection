Friendly staff keep the lines moving while making you feel welcome. Love the pulled pork. Liked the beans. Wish they had true Eastern North Carolina vinegar-based sauce. I will be back, but I may bring my own sauce next time.\nOkay, just got a message that they have vinegar sauce available if requested. YES!!! Y'all have made this Tarheel very, very happy!
