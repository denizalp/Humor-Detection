We stopped in on a Saturday night.  For two hours of bowling, it was $75 for 4 people.  We had 3 pitchers of beer and a couple of rounds of shots ($110 +tip).\n\nThere was no wait.  The drink service was great.  We never waited more than 5 minutes for service.  The facility was clean.  After 9pm, it was 21 and over.\n\nThe shoes were horrible.  They were old, worn out, uncomfortable, and lacking larger sizes.  I would have rated this 4 stars if the shoes were remotely comfortable.
