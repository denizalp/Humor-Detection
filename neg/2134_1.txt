I love this place - it's GIGANTIC and stocked with every kind of sex paraphernalia one could want. The clinical and businesslike feel of the place takes away the taboo and normalises it so that you feel like you're just shopping in a \"normal\" store. The staff are very professional and matter of fact, and manage to ask you the (many!) questions necessary in order to find you the right product without being skeevy or off-colour in any way. Awesome!
