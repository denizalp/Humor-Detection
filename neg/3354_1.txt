Trader Joes has great ideas at a fair price for groceries, especially for young people shopping for themselves. So many unique healthy frozen options! The staff is always smiling and generally enthusiastic about their employment. The only downfall is elbowing through hoards of people to pick up the essentials. Seriously, does anyone know when this store is not busy?
