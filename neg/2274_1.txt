It sounds crazy to drive to Mckeesport for a cookie but Minerva is the BEST! Cookies and pies are incredible. Cakes are lovely and the pastries are worth the workout to get rid of them. \n\nThey have a wide selection and now take credit cards. Its worth calling ahead on the holidays. This is not the Giant Eagle, sometimes they sell out.
