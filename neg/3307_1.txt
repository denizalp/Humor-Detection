This is my favorite Starbucks in Brampton. The Staff is super nice, and actually get to know you, rather than just making polite small talk. My regular drink (iced caramel macchiato) always taste awesome, and Is made in timely fashion. \nAlso they were nice enough to hold coffee grounds for me for my garden, rather then me having to beat people to the bucket they leave out for other customers.
