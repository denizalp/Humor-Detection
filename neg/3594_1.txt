Terrible service. Burnt food. I went here with 5 other friends and the waitress served them before my food was ready and took another 10 minutes to bring it to me. We did the all out can eat wing wednesdays and only got checked on once every 20 minutes. The manager really doesnt care about what's going on hence the shorts and Pok√©mon belt. He was also rude and extremely underqialified for his position. Wouldn't recommend this hooters to my worst enemy.
