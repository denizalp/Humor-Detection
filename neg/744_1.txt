We eat \"Goop\" for lunch once a week. The lunch buffet is great. I love all the vegetarian dishes and usually stuff myself.\nWe are always greeted immediately when we walk in and our drink orders are brought to the table with fresh naan as soon as we get our plates filled and sit down.\nThe owner is very nice and we love eating here.
