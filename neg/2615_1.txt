I'm sorry but I can't really give good reviews. Went to customer service and not so friendly people working there. Some workers are not friendly. Not explaining things proper way instead make you look stupid. It so disappointing to be going in with not so friendly workers. Smh just to add to this the guy at the customer service said it's my internet that's not work good,  but guess what it's not!  we got another product and it works so perfectly. Before you say something make sure you know what your talking about.
