I was drawn in to finally visit UrbAna by attending the Faux Calligraphy workshop. The class was extremely fun and I was so happy I went. Everything in the store is adorable and the owner Ana was extremely welcoming. With so many beautiful and unique home accessories, I look forward to returning to Urbana for shopping and future workshops.
