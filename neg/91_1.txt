This is my second time coming here, I heard lots of great things so I expected a lot. Went for a lunch special this time instead of going for dinner and got a L4. Really enjoyed the miso soup and the spicy salmon. It had a nice soft and fresh texture. The sashimi on the other hand was a bit disappointing, some were a bit slimy and even had some fish scales stuck between them, none the less, some were good as well\n\nThe price was average compared to other sushi places but it wasn't that filling
