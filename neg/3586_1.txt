Definitely not happy. First off, they didn't want to tell us an approximate wait time . We we waited for 40 min only to get a bad table in which we had a time limit of 1hour 15 minutes. The drinks are not as pleasant as others rate them. These too much ice and not enough flavor. The food was not as bad thankfully. However, I have been to this restaurant chain 3 times and have not had a good experience yet.
