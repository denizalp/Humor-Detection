Imagine you're going out for food with friends and can't decide between Korean and Japanese food... Well Gals is the place for you! \n\nOne of the better places that serves both cuisines, albeit a bit pricey for certain things. Usually end up going for the lunch and\/or dinner combos, as it comes out to a better deal. The side dish with the potatoes are my favourite though! \n\nService is always pretty good, and each table comes with a service bell that gets a server's attention. Always comes in handy! Overall a goos place from time to time!
