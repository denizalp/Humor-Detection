Never Had Brazilian Food, but this was the perfect place togo first. The guy at the counter is really great, every time we go he's got a great attitude he always helps out with telling us whats what and if wasn't for him this place wouldn't be the same. Food is always great! Me an my wife get the breaded chicken it was perfect, the beans were good too.
