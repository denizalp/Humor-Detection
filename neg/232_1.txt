I've been to this place a couple times now. I know it's been good in the past, but today I decided to try the Carbonara's Colossal calzone. I really wanted a Stromboli instead, but this place like many other Italian joints doesn't offer one even though they offer a very similar calzone. The calzone was good for what it's worth. It's very big, has a lot of toppings inside, but not a ton of ricotta. Overall I'd say a 3.5.
