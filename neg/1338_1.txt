A worthy, modern successor to Players. More open space, many of the same excellent floor and kitchen staff, but still grounded and reasonable in the most West Side sense -- no outrageous prices, no too-out-there cuisine experimentation, neither too noisy nor too dead. One week since opening, and the dominant odor here is success.
