The food is amazing!! Try the lobster grilled cheese for $5 on happy hour and finish it off with the greek lamb chops. You won't be disappointed. I got great suggestions from the girls behind the bar, and was pleasantly surprised to find local beer on tap. Three Joseph James handles and a Tenaya Creek, and decent options otherwise (though my friend would have loved to have a Fat Tire). Overall I had a great experience. Great service, great food, great atmosphere.
