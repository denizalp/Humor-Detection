Overall, I like this place because they allow me to bring my dog if I sit in their outdoor seating area. Dog friendly restaurant with good eats at a good price.\n\nThe one gripe I have is that the awning over the outdoor seating area is not very good. Too much sun comes in during the summer months, making it hard to stay there very long.
