This is by far the best vegetarian restaurant I've ever been to. As other reviewers have stated, even if you are not a vegetarian you will find some delicious here! Every time I stop in, I have trouble choosing what to order because everything I've tried is SO damn good. When you come you have to order the buffalo cauliflower; it's seriously what vegetarian dreams are made of! I crave this dish regularly. Also highly recommend the Brussels sprouts.
