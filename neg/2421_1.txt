I love this place! The food is great and drinks are good a price, 3 dollar dos equis! The service is always excellent too, I love Shelby, Brooke, Hunter, the Asian guy and Sammie! They are always attentive with any questions. So if you come here ask to be in their section.  \nAlso I would recommend the burger or spinach dip!
