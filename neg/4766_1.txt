Went in Christmas day for some Mucinex D. They only had the paper advert that you take to the Pharmacy. Fun fact...Pharmacy was closed. Ended up with Ibuprofen and a box of Puffs Lotion which was $1 cheaper than at CVS. Kind cashier with quick check out. Skipped the 2 for $5 Orange Juice thinking I could find it cheaper...exhausted by the drive to CVS...really actually should've gotten OJ here. Anyway....2 stars...Nothing spectacular...nothing horrendous. Just the neighborhood Walgreens.
