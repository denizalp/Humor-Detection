My wife and I love it here. We've been going to a Morton's steakhouse since we've been married in one place or another. This one in particular stands up to the excellent quality of food we've come to expect from Mortons. The atmosphere is usually a bit noisy, but not too bad, and the staff are always professional, informative about their cuisine and quick to attend to our wants\/needs.
