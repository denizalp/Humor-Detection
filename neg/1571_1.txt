Place is overpriced for quality of food.  I love guy on DDD.  But he should stick to the show.  Wings were too big and undercooked.  A side of french fries was $9.  Also got a fish bowl of one of theor specialty drinks.  Too sweet and not enough booze.  \n\nOn a positive note, the people i was with loved their pork sandwich
