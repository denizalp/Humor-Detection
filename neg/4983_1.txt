I'm a big fan of Doan's... definitely my favorite Vietnamese place in south Charlotte. The service is always attentive and the food is on point. I'm a big phan of the pho (get it?!?). That's always my go to there and it comes out quick and hot. I think this place has usually more protein than the other similar restaurants in the queen city. I never say no when a friend wants to go... I got nothing else, it's good.
