Food was good as was service (we had full meals).  Be forewarned a fountain pop is $5.00.  We had 3 pops with refills....thus $30......that's 15 - 2L bottles from the grocery store.  Drink water.  Our waiter pre-selected his 15% tip when paying, DID NOT APPRECIATE THAT AT ALL.  Wait staff should inform patrons if refills are NOT free.
