Interesting asian\/mexican fusion theme but taste is just ok. Great place to go if you just want to fill your stomach for a cheap price.\n\nBest part about it is the snicker doodle they give you with the meal.\n\nOrdering is kind of odd but nice that you can make anything a burrito, quesadilla or just eat it alone for all the same price.\n\nPlace is bare bones, with cafeteria type tables\/benches.
