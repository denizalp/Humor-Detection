Boulangerie Kouign-Amann's version of the butter cake is served as a slice from a larger disk (different from the biscuit-shaped ones that I'm more familiar with in my home city).\n\nIt was crispy, crunchy, flaky, chewy, and almost juicy from all the butter that's in it! However, I prefer the biscuit shape as it's smaller and has a greater surface area, resulting in more crunchy caramelized bits on the outside.\n\nRegardless of shape, kouign-amanns are still fun to say, and even more fun to eat!
