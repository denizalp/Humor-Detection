First time here at Elvira's with my husband and it was delicious. We started of with the panades, fish and bean. They were very tasty, especially the sauce that came with it. My husband had the oxtail and loved it. I had the fried chicken. It was cooked perfect and the skin was super crispy. I forgot to mention my watermelon drink came in an actual watermelon. So yummy!
