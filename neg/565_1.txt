This is a cute place.  Cute decor, chairs with bunny ears, servers dressing as maids..pretty DAZZLING.  I ordered the strawberry waffle - it came with strawberries, small scoop of icecream, and a whole lotta whipped cream.  Overall, it tasted okay, prob won't order it again.  The honey toast looks interesting, I would rather try that instead.
