They don't have as much selection of costco.  I also think they are missing some of the programs costco offers such as the auto buying program.\n\nStill though, the prices are great.  I easily make up the membership fee just by buying gas.  They have great return policies.\n\nFor under $4 you can buy a hotdog, drink, and a slice of pizza.\n\nThey don't take visa or mastercard credit cards (but will take debit), but costco has similar policies so I can't complain too much about that.\n\nOne advantage Sam's has over costco is that it is a lot less crowded.
