I love Dunkin Donuts, but this particular one is horrible. I was the only car in the drive through, so they were not busy, and it was only 6pm. So no reason why they should have taken as long as they did. On top of that, all of the sandwiches were not edible because the croissants were rock hard, that you couldn't even bite through them, and I had to keep correcting them on my front order.
