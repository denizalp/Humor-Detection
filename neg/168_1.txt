This place is AWESOME!!!! Dropped my phone, screen completely shattered, died a little inside thinking I had to shell out a ton of money for a new phone. My husband found this place on Yelp thank Jesus!! Brought my phone in and it was good as new in a little over an hour!! Great service and thankful they are in the area. Bravo!
