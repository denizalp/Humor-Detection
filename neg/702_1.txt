Panko breaded fish smelled fishy and tasted bad.  They offered to get something else for my husband or a dessert. He refused both because we wanted to leave, but they ended up charging us $10.99 for an uneaten, fishy smelling bad tasting sandwich. I don't feel we should have had to pay for that - at least not full price. Sorry, we won't be back.
