This was rockin jump before. I paid a deposit for 25 guests about a month before the party. I had no idea they switched to Get Air. I was on a verge of panic. They told me that everything would be fine even with the change of management. Low and behold, one week before my child's event I called to confirm and they told me that there's no reservation under my child's name. It was a good thing that I payed the reservation by CC and complained about the establishment. Very shady! Not recommended!
