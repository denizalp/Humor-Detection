My car was estimated to be fixed in fifteen days, and actually took a month and a half. I also picked up my car yesterday and they forgot to connect the speakers. I tried to bring it back after I realized, and a lady said we don't normally take cars at this time (4:00 P.M.), when I had picked up the car 20 minutes prior; and they close at 6. Hesitant to even bring my car back to reconnect the speakers.
