What I ordered: The bites\nPlus: It came with flavouring salts and pepper to adjust seasoning to taste. \nMinus: CARTILAGE ALERT. Boneless, sure, but flexible-connective-tissue free? NO.\n\nEDIT: also... the overwhelming smell of oil was intolerable for a lot of my friends. And no, not just for the girls haha
