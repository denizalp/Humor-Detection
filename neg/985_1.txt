My new favorite breakfast spot. Hash browns were golden brown no burned spot. Bacon was crispy and delicious. I also had scrambled eggs with an English muffin. Never had a muffin so good. The service was amazing and food came out quick. At least 2 different servers came up to me and asked if I was good. The Manger came and refilled my water. Good spot to eat excited to bring the gf here next time.
