Welcome to the holy land of ice cream. Word on the street is that their recipies date back to over 100 B.C.  (jk) they sure taste like they do though. Allison and I are\nMore the happy to make this our weekly place of worship. Pick any ice cream as long as its on the menu. Sit back and enjoy in the mostly refurbished atmosphere of old soda fountain furnishings. Pretty sure everything is Made in house. Cool.
