We got the vegetarian poutine this past Wednesday evening while we were at jazz fest. The poutine was delicious and the curds were very fresh.  Our server was great and knowledgeable. We were there specifically to try the poutine so that's what we did, but would like to explore the menu more if we have the chance to return.
