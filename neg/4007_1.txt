I ordered online and was charged almost $40 and received only two items out of 6 that I ordered. Then was told by the delivery driver that there was nothing he could do. Once I asked him to call and please fix this, he told me that I had to wait for another delivery then he would come back to me. I'll never order online again because I do actually like the food... It was just unfortunate and irritating to be charged for something and not receive it.
