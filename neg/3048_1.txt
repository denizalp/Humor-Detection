The interior of the club is nice and it's neat that they have a bit of a lounge area in the basement mixed in with arcade games...\n\nHowever... I was not fan that coat-check would not let me check-in my purse and jacket together, so I had to pay double the price. And the ~$20 cover led me to expect a lot more. Nothing all that special.
