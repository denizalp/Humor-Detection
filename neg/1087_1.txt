Here is a link to my BBB complaint where they failed to resolve the issue. I will now be moving forward with small claims court.\n\nhttps:\/\/lasvegas-www.ebindr.com\/complaint\/download\/90146557\/c\/p2j86c?bid=81303\n\nRecap: in addition to everyone else's review about them scamming you over on the pricing, their technician proceeded to clean my couch improperly, resulting in my couch looking worse than it did before they touched it and they refused to issue a refund. Instead, they expected me to pay more for the proper cleaning, which even then the pricing kept changing.
