I guess I should have minded the Yelp reviews for this place... :(\n\nI was in love with their food a couple of years go when I was starving, and I always had this amazing image of chicken souvlaki in my head, but today's souvlaki was very dry, overly salty, and just a mess..\n\nThey get a bonus star for being very very nice to me!
