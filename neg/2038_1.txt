Just left BLACKOUT and it was probably the most amazing experience! We came for a friend's birthday and it exceeded all of our expectations. Ashley was our server and she was so nice and really explained everything so clearly. I've known these friends for 10 years and we learned so much about each other because we didn't have our phones or any other distractions. \nHighly recommended!!
