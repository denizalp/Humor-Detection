I had lunch there today with my fianc√©, the place was super clean, the owner was very welcoming, the service was suburb ..We ordered the combination plate & shawarma plate, let me tell you the food was delicious, best shawarma & kabob I've had in Las Vegas. The lentil soup & hummus were amazing also, every single bite was delicious. If you like Mediterranean food or want to give it a try this place is a must. Oh Don't forget to try the baklava & katayef for dessert YUMMMY !!!
