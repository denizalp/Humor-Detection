I'm impressed!  Daughter from CA had a tranny breakdown.  Found this dealer and met service writer Tyler.  He did exactly what he promised and got her on the road home...with a new transmission...in 24 hours.  And the best news is he checked for a warranty and there was no charge.  She thought her warranty was expired.  Thanks Tyler!  I'm impressed!
