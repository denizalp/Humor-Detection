Atmosphere was amazing. Idk any other restaurants that play quality hip hop and Dragon Ball Z at the same time. I had the mushroom burger and my best friend had the pork burger. We are both going back to our hotel room stuffed. Oh and that crack sauce, is Crack! AND they had board games. We played scrabble while eating our food. If you are looking for a very cool and one of a kind experience and love good burgers, this is the place to be.
