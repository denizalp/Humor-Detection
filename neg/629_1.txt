What a great find near Southpark mall.  The complimentary chips were fresh and hot and the salsa had just the right smokey flavor.  The taco and salad was the perfect lunch combo. The Paco's Taco on the house made flour tortilla was filled with shredded beef and sweet caramelized onions.  The chopped salad was filled with fresh vegetables you don't usually get - jicima, grilled corn, chickpeas - in addition to the typical lettuce and tomatoes.
