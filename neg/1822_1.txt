Yes I was a walk in but I did not expect to wait an hr before the art is could meet with us. And when my friend and I tried to leave they did pushy rush sweet talk to get us stay. We stayed and the artist was amazing and drew up the bff tatt we wanted. But the wait game or we can schedule appt later pushy tactic wasn't working for me.
