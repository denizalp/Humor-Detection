I came here for a chest waxing at my boyfriend's request while we were in town for my cousin's dog wedding and Danielle did such an amazing job. I - and my baby boy - were so happy with the work she did. Also I was afraid it would hurt, but the professionalism and bedside manner offered by Danielle put me at ease. I will definitely be back for more next time I'm in Cleveland. Danielle - please open a salon in Brooklyn, gurl!
