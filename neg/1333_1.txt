Just discovered this place, and I agree with the other rave reviews.  Terrific place, very friendly, most excellent food, and the prices are, if anything, much too cheap.  There is also a Greek grocery attached, also with great prices.  \n\nIt's right next door to the Clarion Hotel, which is the best buy in Mesa, but don't tell anybody, because I don't want it to become too crowded.
