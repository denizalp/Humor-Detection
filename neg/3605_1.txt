Although a bit more expensive than if you were to make a salad yourself, it is a great salad with fresh ingredients. My husband and I have gone there a handful of times and the ingredients are always fresh, including the lettuce (which is surprisingly hard for a lot of places that make salads!). I always ask for the dressing on the side so I can split the salad in half and save some for another meal. I'd highly recommend this place, especially if you are looking for a healthy alternative to fast food.
