My husband and I recently had dinner here before a movie and the service was absolutely amazing. Our waitress, Myrna, was a sweetheart and provided us with what we needed and answered all of our questions. Even if she was unsure of the answer, she was willing to find out for us. She definitely made our night with her personality and great customer service. Go Myrna and Olive Garden!!! Woo hoo!!!
