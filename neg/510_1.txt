Yesterday was my first visit to this restaurant which I had seen every time I went to The Colonnade theater. I am so sorry that I didn't partake of this little neighborhood place sooner. My companion and I enjoyed our meal which was served to us very promptly. I enjoyed the Bim bim Bop in the stone Bowl and my companion had the bulgogi; both were excellent and freshly prepared to order. We plan to return to this little gem again.
