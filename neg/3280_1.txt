I give it 5 stars because it's a good local dive bar. Not too busy but can get that way. Live Bands almost every Saturday night and the do karaoke I think Fridays and maybe another day. Come here a few times and everyone will know your name.  Owners are nice and Pat is the wife of the owner who also bartend's. She's nice and Krystal is also a fun bartender. If your here on band night Melissa the cocktail waitress will take amazing care of you. Tip well and you won't be waiting very long for drinks.
