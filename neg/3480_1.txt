I went back for a re-check. After recieving a eye exam with 4 letters on it, I was asked did u memorize it? How could I not, it had 4 letters! Dr Hansen checked my IOL'S, and then recited his evaluation from his memory.  He said I have 20-20, then handed me my glasses.  Lol. I'm not that stupid! I'll find somewhere else that has some compassion to have this issue corrected. Too bad Sheperd failed but they will never admit it with their god-like egos. Be careful here, be smarter than them, its easy.
