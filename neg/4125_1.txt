Very disappointed with this practice. I had gone here for several years (and they got my money for pellets) but when I was diagnosed with breast cancer they never followed up once! They were my primary care physicians, so they got the call after my mammogram and were the ones to call me to deliver the news. Never heard from them again! I think they are too focused on making money and not really treating the patient, so beware if you want a doctor who really cares!
