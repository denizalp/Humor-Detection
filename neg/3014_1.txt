In a tight bind found this place as it's right across from the Colosseum. \nThe pizza was good, quick &  large pieces. \nThey options cover everything from; wraps, chinese, build your own salad, choweder and mexican food. \nIt's Vegas prices ($7\/slice, $8.99\/taco, & so on) but still on the cheaper end of what it could be.\n\nI'll stick this Marketplace in my back pocketbook for another time!
