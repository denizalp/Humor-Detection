Stopped by for a quick meal after hearing about the new shiitake kale chicken breast. I didn't see the outrageous prices until it was too late. I got a bowl and it was about $8, my brother got a 3 entree plate that came out to about $13. These crazy tourist prices are only reasonable in Vegas. We did ask for free samples and got them which was a relief because I heard a lot of complaints about no free samples. The food was delicious as always, but the bill was not.
