The reasons for not giving them a 5 star:\n\n1. Portion size of the styrofoam burrito bowl is very small. If ure going to compete with major burrito places, the current size won't cut it.\n\n2. For the price, the amount of chicken in the bowl was extremely stingy. I love meat n im satisfied with other burrito places.\n\n3. Customer service was not the best. My first statement was \"I've never been here before\". To that, there was silence.\n\nOther than that, i really enjoyed their flavor.
