My fiance rented a car from this company and it was problems from the beginning. From horrible customer service by the gentleman at the counter, to the reserved car not being there and them telling us we needed to pay more for what they did have, to them charging an extra $80 in late charges when we specified on the reservation that it would be returned at 4pm. \n\nThere are so many other rental companies that would actually appreciate our business and treat us with respect. I will NEVER use their services again.
