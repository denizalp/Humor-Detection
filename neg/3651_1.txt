Our Friday Margarita Herd enjoyed the food here more than the drink. Steak fries, steak skewers, wings, guacamole, chips and salsa, all good. We inadvertently ordered the first round of margaritas outside of happy hour - at $18 each. How is that even possible in a boarded up development?\n\nNext week, Jalapenos at DC Ranch.
