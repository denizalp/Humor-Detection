Food, 5 stars, service, 5 stars, atmosphere 4 stars. I had the Jack Daniels steak, great flavor. The vegetables were fresh and tasty. They sat me in the bar section, which was basicly undecorated. When I go back, I will ask to sit somewhere else, which is nicely decorated.\nP. S. The food must be good, as I witnessed tons of, to go orders.
