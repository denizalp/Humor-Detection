Dennis went above and beyond what was expected of him. He remained in constant communication with me throughout the entire process and was extremely patient with all of my questions. He also worked with me to make sure that I submitted all the appropriate documents that I needed in order to ensure the best possible outcome. Buying my first house was a huge step, but Dennis made me feel comfortable about it every step of the way. I am extremely thankful for all of his help!
