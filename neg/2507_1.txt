Always a good place to visit when I'm in Vegas. The place starts getting pack around 11-12 at night on Friday and Saturday. The vibe is pretty chill and they usually have a Dj playing. There's always fun games to do with your friends. The giant beer pong cups, giant jenga, checkers, etc. \n\nThere's a lot of beer and drink selections as well. Not a lot on the tap but a good amount to get your drink on. Drinks are pretty cheap compared to the other bars in Vegas.
