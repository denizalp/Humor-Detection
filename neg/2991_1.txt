Got sat and our drink orders delivered before being told \"Oh yeah, you can only order like the appetizers, it's cool though\" While waiting for the waiter a cover band the quality of bad karaoke started up. To be fair didn't try the food but seeing as getting the waiter to get a check took forever I don't have the most faith in this place
