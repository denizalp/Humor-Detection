First time in this place, it has a thick menu of beer choices, 2 pages of snacks and food, I ate burger, it was super yummy and fresh, pretty big, with a big onion ring on top and side french fries. The atmosphere was nice, it was quite crowded for a week day, service was very friendly and pleasant.
