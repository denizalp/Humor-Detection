Recently went for dinner and not sure why it had been years....because everything was awesome. I ordered the featured halibut, served with charred tomatoes, a pesto pur√©e, and delicious corn risotto. The fish was super fresh and the entire dish was put together perfectly. My mom had the scallops with asparagus and a pea risotto, and after trying it I wasn't sure which was better! Great experience all around, can't wait to go back.
