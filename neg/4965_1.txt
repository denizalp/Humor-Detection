I came in for a fill last Sunday. Two stars because I loved the way my nails were shaped and painted. However,  she used a tool under my nail too long and broke open my skin. It's very painful and I cannot put pressure on that finger. She noticed the problem and didn't address it or apologize. This causes problems for me at work. I won't come back for this reason.  It's been three days and still bothers me.
