Heather is not only smart and personable, she is amazing with color.  The highlights blend perfectly, look so natural and last forever.  She really put her superbness over the top explaining why some hair loss was happening, i.e. massaging roots of hair especially on top of scalp while shampooing is what cleans the pores and prevents hair loss, which has stopped as a result! I'd been dealing with this off and on for several years.  Heather was the one with the answer. Throw out the Biotin supplements which didn't work anyway.  Thank you Heather!
