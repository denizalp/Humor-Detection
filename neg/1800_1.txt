Great mexican food, and great service every time. I measure the quality of any mexican joint by the carnitas. Juan's carnitas are very good - crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside. Their verde salsa is an excellent flavor addition to the pork. The hosts and waitstaff are very attentive, great with kids, and the manager stops by often to make sure the dining experience is spot on.
