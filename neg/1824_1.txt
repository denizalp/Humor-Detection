We love Trader Joe's. Fortunately we were down for the weekend and it's nice to go to a location that carries booze. The store is always well-stocked and they have excellent selections. I will say that my only disappointment is the meat selection which isn't my favorite. It's just that the other products are so superior and I would expect the same for the meat. I still love this store
