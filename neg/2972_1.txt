This is the worst service I've had in the whole entire world. It was my friend Janet's birthday today and we picked this place out to have a nice time out. I've seen 4 people come in after us and they all got their food before us. We only have a party of 4 and our server took about 20 years to give us waters. You guys are NOT invited to Janet's baby shower!!!
