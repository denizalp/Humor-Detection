We were on the hunt for good food in Vegas, since we had an early lunch and were near-starvation :) From afar, this place doesn't have an appealing exterior, but once we settled down for food, we were blown away with the amazing quality of food served - from the vegetarian (Palak Paneer) to non-vegetarian (Chicken Tikka Masala), eaten with the Naan and Biryani...we were left so satisfied, we almost thought of giving up the walk on the strip and heading back to sleep it off ;) A definite visit if you want good Indian food in Vegas...
