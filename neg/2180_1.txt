Good Taiwanese food. I used to drive over to Papa Chang's from Mississauga but with Koo Koo Chicken, less so. Their menu is not as comprehensive as Papa Chang's though quality is comparable. I like their small intestine noodle soup. And their pork sandwich. Their bubble tea is good as well. They don't take credit card unlike Papa Chang's. They have more seating though.
