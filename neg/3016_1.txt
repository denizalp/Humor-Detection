My favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison. Everything my boyfriend and I have had is seriously delicious.  Starting with the salsa, to guac, to tacos, to chile rillenos- this place is good. I also love the cheese dip they offer- omg the cheese dip. So yummy. It is also in a great location and is open late night which is a huge plus! Highly recommend this place!
