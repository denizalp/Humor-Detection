The decor and concept are really nice and the staff was super friendly.  The bottom less mimosas for brunch are a really good deal and offer variety with a belini and blood orange mimosa option.  I wasn't impressed with my breakfast sandwich.  I did however enjoy the tomato jam component of it, which really was a fancy ketchup.  I have experienced their dinner here and if I recall correctly the food was much better then. Our servers were super helpful and attentive.
