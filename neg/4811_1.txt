Lovely wife and I had dinner at FH Tuesday night and we won't be going back any time soon. It's definitely not our style of food but we found a couple promising items. Our wings were dry and had very little flavor, wife's salad had some rotten lettuce and my chicken sandwich was small with dry meat.  The server seemed pissed off too.  I guess I can see the attraction here but I hoped for better food.
