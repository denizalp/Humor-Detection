Made a quick stop before heading to the airport. Cute casita setup, loved the atmosphere they put out with the DJ and loved the fact that they were very welcoming when we walked in! I'm a black coffee drinker, but love horchata and tres leches. We had the tres leches which was GOOD but not something i would personally drink everyday.
