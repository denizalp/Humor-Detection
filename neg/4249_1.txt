I was curious about this place after hearing about it. They have some very interesting combinations that I'll have to admit were very tasty. I thought the food was above average, but you really don't get very much for the money. I really thought that I was going to have to eat again in a few hours. Place is huge and feels like a dining hall.\nThe person taking our order was very friendly and offered us tastes of anything we wanted to try.
