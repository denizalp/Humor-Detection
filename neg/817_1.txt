Ate here for about the fifth time.  Always excellent food and service.  My steak has always been cooked perfectly.  Appetizers, sides and deserts are excellent.  Hank's versus the chains like Ruth Chris is a night and day difference.  My favorite special occasion place.  Be sure and order the lobster mac and cheese as a side.
