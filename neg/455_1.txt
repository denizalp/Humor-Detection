One of the better supermarkets in Cleveland.  Heinen's has a lot of top-end stuff, and a fantastic wine selection with over 75 bottles priced under $10.  They also feature monthly wine-tastings.\n\nIf you are looking for a good lunch, their paninis and other sandwiches are good, as well.  Pre-made personal desserts are better here than at most other supermarket chains you will find.
