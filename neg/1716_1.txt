This place is awesome!  The decor is totally fun (free candy) and the tray tables at the bar are very cute.  The food is amazing and the portions are large.  I have been here several times and each time tried the burgers.  Specifically, the Baha burger has really tasty guacamole.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a laid back, delicious meal!
