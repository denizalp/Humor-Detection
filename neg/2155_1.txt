SOooo happy this opened up here in Mississauga!!! I can finally satisfy my cravings closer to home instead of travelling downtown. The katsu is just as good as the one downtown and the miso soup is also refillable just like the one downtown. The place is super clean and there's plenty of space. They also play anime on the television and they play a mix of Japanese and Korean songs. I'll definitely be back here since it's in the area!
