They give you a nice portion of food. I had the chicken fried steak which was excellent. My husband had the Marco omelet, he said was good, and my son had a ham and cheese omelet, which he enjoyed. The service was ok, not the most attentive, but would I go back again yes! affordable, plentiful, and good tasting... works for us!!\n\nWould give 4 stars  but giving it 3 due to having to ask random staff for items, as lacked quality service from hostess.
