Got there at 10:55am. Waited in line for about 45mns before seeing what we had to choose from.. The lamb neck was sold out but the Turkey and Beef Brisket was on my plate with some potato salad and cole slaw. Sat down with some friends and experienced some of the best smoked meat in my life.. Wish the line wasn't so long so it was more accessible but the adventure makes it even more special when you have the time to go..
