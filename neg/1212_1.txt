Can't say enough good things about Public School 702. This is my third time here and everything has been great. \n\nFried chicken and waffles with the green chile cornbread waffles are so good. Ahi tuna taco app was also really, really good. \n\nBrittany is a very attentive waitress and lots of fun. She is smart and very knowledgable about the menu. Trust her advice. This is one of the best places in Vegas.
