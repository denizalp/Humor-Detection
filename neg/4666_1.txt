I have been very excited to try this place. The ambiance of place is great. Unfortunately, the wait was absolutely ridiculous. After we arrived, more groups arrived. People that ordered after us were getting their orders first. Our waitress seems very new. We reached out to someone about how we had been waiting 30 minutes for our food. Within a couple of mins our food arrived. It was delicious. \n\nTry to get there before the rush to avoid delays.
