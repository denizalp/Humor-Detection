WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY ENTIRE LIFE! Had me experimenting by treating the symptoms of my auto immune disease instead of the actual disease. Had me on MANY medications at once after knowing that I wanted to take as few as possible and remain semi-holistic. After SEVERE side effects I endured for OVER A YEAR! I quit the meds myself when he told me to continue even though the side effects were insane. VERY BAD ADVICE!
