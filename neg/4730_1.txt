Great cars at great prices and super customer service. I was treated with respect,  Daniel, Tamas and Junior went  above and beyond to make sure I got the car I wanted for the right price.  They even took the car to a  mechanic of my choice for a pre-sale inspection before I bought the car. I am a satisfied customer and would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a quality car. Las Vegas Auto Sports has gained my trust and I would definately  buy my next car from them.
