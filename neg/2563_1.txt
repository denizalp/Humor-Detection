If I am gonna open a restaurant one day, this is what I want it to be. Every dish is a masterpiece. I felt guilty that I ate that luxurious for breakfast! \n\nThe Duck Cuban is  sophisticatedly flavored and presented. I love to order duck whenever it is available, and how they paired it with other ingredient is brilliant. The portion is on the small side, but I don't mind, how about ordering more flavor!\n\nThey should totally open a full restaurant and serve dinner. More please, not just crepes.
