This is a good ramen place to visit on a cold day. The portions are very reasonable and the soup and noodles taste great.\n\nI ordered the pock hock noodles ($8.95) with a side of chicken giblets ($3.5) and special fried pork ribs ($5.50).\n\nThe soup base reminds me of a pho soup base and came with veggies and meat. The giblets were spicy and crunchy. The special pork ribs were delicious! It was deep fried and had a distinct minor sweet taste to it.\n\nDef. curbed my craving for hot noodles! The service was good and quick.
