If you're hungry and in the mood for a greasy burger or milkshake, go here. But don't expect an excellent experience, it's a fast food joint. \n\nWe were seated in good time upon arrival. Table was clean as well. \n\nI ordered the Portobello 'N Swiss burger with fries with an Oreo Mint Cookies and Cream shake. \n\nFood took a little long but came out well. I'm not a fan of their fries but that's my personal opinion. \n\nSome staff members were great and some were lacking manners, but overall it isn't bad.
