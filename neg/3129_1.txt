Red Rick Painting did a great job painting the exterior of my home. I had stucco done on the block wall, repairs to patio drywall and 2-tone paint for the house body and trim. Ralph was very professional and provided a very competitive quote. Their cost to stucco and paint my block wall was far cheaper than any other quote. The crew showed up on time and worked quickly. They taped and covered all the areas well and cleaned up everything when they were done. I'm very happy with the finished work and would use them again.
