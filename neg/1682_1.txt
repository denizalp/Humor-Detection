I used to think this was a five-star restaurant but now it is a three-star the food is good but they have changed their menu!  They used to have to die for matzoh ball soup! The humus was good and we are the lamb but it's just not the same without the soup!  Big disappointment :(!  I dislike when Vegas restaurants change stuff it's the only reason i go back is for my favs!
