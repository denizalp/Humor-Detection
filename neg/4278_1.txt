This place had just okay sushi. The prices are good. HOWEVER, the service is the absolutely worse! The waitress\/hostess was unaware of people waiting to even turn in their order. When I received the wrong roll I approached the cook and his response was not that he was sorry but that I should have told him exactly what I wanted. I thought that was what the menu was for? Worse ever. Don't waste your time here. Three tables were used and all three while I was there complained about the service.
