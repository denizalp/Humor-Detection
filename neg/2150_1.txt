We ordered the brisket and burnt end for two meat combo platter,  potato salad and baked beans for the 2 sides that comes with it. We can't resist ordering the rib tips and additional mac and cheese, everything was good, love the bbq sauce! maybe except for the brisket which I find a little bit dry for my liking, but still we will definitely come back for more
