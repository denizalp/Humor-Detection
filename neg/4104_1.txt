Jakes is one of my favorite go to places to eat.  Tonight however was just ok.  I had the Shrimp and grits.  It was extremely salty and I almost sent it back. The spinach dip appetizer was just ok too.  The chips were greasy and the dip was a little dry.   My daughters chicken Cesar was average and nothing special.  My husbands Turkey burger was the best.  Wonder if they changed chefs.
