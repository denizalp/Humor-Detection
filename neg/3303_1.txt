Being near the office, this is a regular \"Starbucks fix\" location.  They have opened the place up with a more open floor plan and furniture and this has much improved things.  During the morning rush, the line up can be pretty significant, and during the day this place is always busy.  I'm still not sold on the whole free wifi thing as it means that people park themselves at coffee shops like Starbucks forever.  Especially during the afternoon, finding a seat can be difficult amongst all the studying students.
