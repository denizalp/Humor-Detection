Just an absolutely fantastic experience!!!  My husband Mark and I went to get a quote from one of those big box store and it was such a big mistake!  Good thing a friend of mine told me about this place.  \n\nOscar helped us and was such a professional.  Their price beat the \"other\" guys by over a thousand dollars.  The installers were on time and very courteous and professional. \n\nDon't go anywhere else for your flooring needs.  Carpets Galore is the best!!!
