First time here and a MUST TRY!\nIt's a little small but it's super clean and the staff is super welcoming. \nI ordered a small chicken pho and let me just say, this place has probably gives you the most meat which i am so happy about :)\nMy brother ordered a p1 and he was super happy with it too.\nWe also ordered the shrimp fried rice and its probably one, if not the best, fried rice ive had at a viet restaurant.\n\nThe service was super good too! Will definitely be back :)
