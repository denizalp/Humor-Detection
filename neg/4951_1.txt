This place will not disappoint! It is such good food with great service. It is not typical bar food but you can get it if you want. Just be prepared to have their homemade from scratch versions that will keep you wanting more. \nTheir specials are delicious like  Rib eye steaks and beer can chicken. \nAlso they have Gluten free options so GF community mark this spot.
