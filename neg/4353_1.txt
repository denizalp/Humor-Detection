Had the softshell crab sandwich and it wasn't all that impressing as everyone here makes it out to be. Too much batter, not enough crab, and a minuscule side of salad which could have easily been incorporated into the sandwich. Not to mention it's on the expensive side ($18) and it took a long time to get yet the tomato and lettuce weren't even distributed evenly on the sandwich.
