UPDATE: Just got my lab bill. Roughly 4 months later. This incompetent medical practice pulled $1000 worth of blood work. I'm stuck with $110 lab bill and per my first review, know as much now as when I first seen these idiots!!!!! If you're fool enough to come here, don't come crying to me when they take you for a ride too!!
