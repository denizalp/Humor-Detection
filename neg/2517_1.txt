Food is delicious, and the service is exceptional. The waitress went the extra mile to make it feel as if we had been going to this restaurant for years. They treated us with the utmost respect, and made it a comfortable experience. I enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan, and took some home for leftovers. Location and size to this place is a bit of a surprise since it would fit the description of \"hole in the wall\". This goes to show that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Bon App√©tit!
