I would describe this place as refreshing and full of kindness.  Randy and Dominic were both great at explaining the maintenance process.  Even before I brought my car in, they were very responsive to my quote requests for some major maintenance services.  I was offered a ride, but decided to stay around the area. (There is smoothie, as well as a donut place nearby). \n\nI am definitely coming back here!  I only hope they continue to be open on some Saturdays.
