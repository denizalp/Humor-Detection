Been coming here and New York restaurant for years. Food, service and a break from the Las Vegas madness during lunch is what the Doctor ordered. Three course lunch is the only winning proposition in town.Only complaint is the supplement  for octopus. In N.Y. there isnt an extra charge. Hopefully that will change. Also bring back the Montreal bagel and smoked salmon. Will probably pass on lunch for awhile till they update.
