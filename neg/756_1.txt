Loco Patron is awesome! We absolutely love going to Happy Hour and Taco Tuesday's! The crowd is always lively, the music is great, and the tacos and house margaritas are even better! I promise you will be happy with the service and the good eats! The crunchy fish and steak tacos are my favorite. Give Loco Patron a shot if you haven't yet....
