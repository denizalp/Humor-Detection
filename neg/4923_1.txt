We love Blue Agave.  The food is fresh, service is good.  My fianc√©s favorite meal was the steak on top of the garlic mashed potatoes but unfortunately they recently changed their menu which I was not as impressed with. Their happy hour menu is great with plenty of choices.  Even though the menu changed, we will continue to eat there...we still love it.
