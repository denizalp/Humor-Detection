Went for our first visit on Christmas Day evening. Place was packed! - about a one hour wait for a table and about 45 minutes to get served. Worth every minute!!  Best Chinese food in the greater Phoenix area.  Lots of Yelp reviews panned the service but ours was great even under very hectic conditions.  If you're looking for ambiance this is NOT the place to go.  But if you're looking for outstanding Chinese cooking I suggest you give this place a try.  You won't be disappointed.
