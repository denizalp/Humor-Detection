This place was not good. Went for lunch on a Thursday and service was super slow, (which is weird because it wasn't even close to being \n busy) and terrible food and margs. Not sure if I just came on an off day or what. Their chicken taco was so dry I couldn't even eat the chicken I had to take it off. Margarita tasted watered down. Just not sure what's going on here but I'm not impressed and definitely won't be back.
