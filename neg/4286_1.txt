My family has investment properties in the Las Vegas area and I was in search of a reliable restoration company to do some work after our tenants moved out.  I was so happy when I came across pro restoration- they were so friendly and professional!, and got the job done in a super timely manner.  I highly recommend them because they were in constant contact with me through every step of the way, definitely great as I'm out of town. I look forward to using  them  again and praise their great customer service!!
