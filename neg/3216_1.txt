A hearty meal. The wrap was big, soup a decent size all for $12.50! Bargain. They really stuff the wrap!\n\nI had the pork shoulder wrap (it's so refreshing, esp with the mango pineapple in it) and the Ravi stew. Now that was so filling! Esp with the chicken added. \n\nNot that many seats but there are tables. \n\nGreat staff and good food. Cant go wrong! Esp on a cold rainy night like today.
