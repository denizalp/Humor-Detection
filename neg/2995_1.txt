Our family goes to red lobster every month and last week's bar harbour bake was very disappointing. For $32.00, instead of 3 full sized scallops, they now replaced it with about a dozen puny little ones that you can buy for a dollar a pack at any grocery.  The size of their shrimps have also reduced to smaller than medium. The amount of pasta has also gone down, making this dish entirely not worth the money. I don't care about your cheap mussels.
