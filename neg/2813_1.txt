Typical Fox restaurant only with worse service. Food is decent but over-priced. Service is terrible. I've gotten take out here several times and they put you on hold forever, take 30 minutes to make a salad, forget to put dressing in, etc. Thank goodness there are more restaurants opening downtown so I don't have to resort to this place.
