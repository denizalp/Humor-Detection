Yum! I was trying to avoid the massive crowds at the convention center during a recent event so I popped over the Delta food court for some great lunch options. It was fairly busy at Thai Express but they kept the line moving quickly. They were helpful and friendly during the ordering process. I was pleased with the large portion and seasoning. Highly recommended lunch spot.
