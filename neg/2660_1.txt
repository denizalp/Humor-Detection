My friend and I tried this foot spa and it turned out to be a REAL foot spa refexology. Joe and April were the best! We were sceptics when we started the ion therapy part of the treatment but became a believer when my friends joint pain went away. Wear shorts. A place to go after a rough day at work. Also perfect for my mom who is not into full body massage and has osteoarthritis. Will try their full body massage combo special next time.
