Went back today... same deal. No one came to counter for about 3 or 4 minutes. I was the only one in there. Then he left 2 times. Not sure what happened, either busy doing something or locked himself out of register. Just strange...  My buddy and I go there now as a job because it's like being in bizarreo world.
