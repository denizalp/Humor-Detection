Good family run restaurant for take out or for upto 3 people. Seating area is no frills. I only come here if I'm stuck in Pickering for work. Owners daughter takes the order, she is a pleasant junior high student. She confirmed that there was no msg. After the meals my throat felt ok. I'm typically allergic to large amounts of msg
