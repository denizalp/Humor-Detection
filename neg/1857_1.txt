This place was so good!! Went here for brunch with a girlfriend and the bottomless mimosas were delicious! Didn't think I could get a little drunk during brunch lol, but loved it! The food was super good as well, I got this buttermilk chicken sandwich with a side salad and it hit the spot for sure. Our server Michaela was the bomb! She took care of us and made sure our glasses were getting refilled right away!
