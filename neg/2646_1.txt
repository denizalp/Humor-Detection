Was met at the door by Tony with a smile, handshake and introduction. I love that! The atmosphere is quiet, happy and a family like environment. The garlic knots are amazing as is the pizza. I will be coming back here on a regular basis. It's nice to be remembered by name when you walk into an establishment. Makes you feel like your business really matters.
