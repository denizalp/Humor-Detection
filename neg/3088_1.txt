The prime rib here is excellent- would definitely go back just for that. I liked how the food was organized by \"Latin\", \"Chinese\", \"Raw\", \"Italian\", etc, made it very easy to decide where to go. The sushi however looked terrible, and was confirmed by my friend to not be good at all. I would have loved to see more options in the raw section and also in the \"noodles\" section there weren't any noodles, just rice? All in all, I don't know if I would come screaming back to eat here but it wasn't an unpleasant experience either.
