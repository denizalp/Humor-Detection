I have been going here for my haircut for 3 years. Very pleased with my haircuts. They have 5 barbers. They are all good barbers and friendly. I always go with Moraima a very nice woman that does a fantastic job. I hope all my hair falls out before she retires because I don't want to change barbers again. If you want a $16 haircut that looks like a $50 haircut go here! Thank you
