Place clean and sharp looking, staff friendly, Food above average. The pastrami sandwich and hamburger OK, but nothing really that screams signature dishes or staple to this place. Food like this can be found any where with the same menu. But if you live near by, yes a great place to eat. But if you live far, not worth the trip or gas.
