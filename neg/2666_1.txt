Excellent- so much so that even my picky Chinese food expert Father sang his praises. We came here for a surprise birthday dinner for him, and we received great service and food. A dish that deserves explicit mentioning is the Shrimp Cheung Fan. It exceeded all our expectations amongst the top rated Chinese restaurants both in the city and in South East Asia. Truly delicious. We also recommend the Soya Scallops.\n\nThe price is also reasonable for its value. \n\nGreat place for celebrations but also great just for a nice Chinese meal.
