I've contacted Terminix on several occasions and have spoken w\/ branch manager via email and have left voice mails w\/ sales associate and I feel as if they do not want my business. I'm new to the area and the previous home owner of my home used there service... so naturally I thought I would continue. But there customer service is below par! It's been almost three weeks and I've yet to have any inspection or price quote. Which was all promised to me. I've never had the need for termite service and thought that they where the best........
