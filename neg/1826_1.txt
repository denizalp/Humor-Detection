I was craving a shish taouk so I came here and I was honestly disappointed. First of all, they gave me the smallest shish taouk I've ever seen and there was barely any chicken in the first half of the shish taouk. On top of that, all the chicken concentrated on the bottom were burned so after I finished the shish taouk the taste of the burned chicken remained in my mouth. But I must say, I have had shish taouks here before and they were okay and this was just one bad experience.
