The shell of the xiao long bao is thin and taste good. However not as good as in China.  The beef noodle soup. The soup base is very clean and noodle is cooked to the right consistency.  Unfortunately, they got my order wrong so took a bit longer than I would like to. \n\nNew restaurant so the layout and decor is very clean.  \n\nPrice point is average. portion size is fair.
