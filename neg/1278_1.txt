Loved the hotel and the staff (super nice and friendly)... The hotel was beautiful and had a great view of the lake, and the room was very comfortable.  My only grievances where with the piece of the WiFi ($40\/3 days) and the buffet breakfast.  The buffet was $22 per head and didn't even have an omelette station like most places in that price range.  The food was good, we just didn't feel it justified the price.
