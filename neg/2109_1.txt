I've shopped at Julie's a few times and it's really a cute shop. I'm not usually one to shop at boutiques because I like a good deal, but they usually have some nice clothing on their sale rack. I stopped in today for their July clearance sale and their prices were reasonable. Everyone was super helpful and kept checking in to see if there was anything I needed. The location is convenient in Park Road Shopping center surrounded by restaurants and other shops. Really cute shoes, clothes and accessories!
