We've been looking for a regular Friday fish fry spot for a bit now. We decided to give Avenue Club a try since they take reservations (thank you!) With our picky kids in tow, we were all in. Everything was phenomenal - the fish fry, the drinks, the chicken fried pickles! The atmosphere and service were worth returning for as well. We truly felt at home. We've already been back a second time and cannot wait to visit again.
