The best location in Calgary! Staff are all nice, little cliquey but harmless. Tons of products, and they actually do know the gear and the lines. I say that as I do my own research before getting new stuff and what they say is accurate. \n\nThe stuff is pricey, but wouldn`t matter what store you are at, that is the cost of skate and snow stuff. \n\nThey sell girls, guys, soft and hard gear. It`s truly your one stop shop.
