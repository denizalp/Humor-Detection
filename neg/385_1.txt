Its obvious Allen really enjoys what he is doing, and he does it very well. Just a really lovely guy doing what he enjoys, unlike the many grizzled and jaded Mac shops throughout the city. I brought my MacBook in and it had a nasty spill. Thankfully nothing was damaged, and after a ultrasonic bath my machine was as good as new. Without a doubt I will return, as Allen is now my default Mac go-to guy.
