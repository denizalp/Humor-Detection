Need to stop in for a fast and friendly service for lunch? You won't be disappointed. I've eaten here for breakfast which are delicious but never lunch. I ordered the Wich sandwich which by the way filled my lunchtime hunger pains. Portions are just right for one person plus Clean and friendly service.
