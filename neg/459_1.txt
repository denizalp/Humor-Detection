I have been back to Sakana for I don't remember how many times since my last review, and I am still a big fan! It is just so nice to have Sakana in my neighborhood to make up my frequent cravings of some fresh water eel nigiri and agedashi tofu! The service has been consistently friendly and attentive, and more importantly, the food has not disappointed me even once. And I will keep going back for some more! :)
