Went to this restaurant while visiting family in Surprise. We were seated quickly, but service beyond that was not good. The server entered the incorrect order, and rarely checked our table. \n\nThe food was also below par. It was greasy and just thrown on the plate. Most of the orders were served cold, and it took 10 minutes to fix rhe incorrect orders.\n\nTo top it off, we ordered 5 pies two days ahead of time. When we checked out, they did not have our order. They lost it. I was not impressed.
