Thanks to El Grito's social media presence, I was able to sample their tacos at their pop-up event in front of Underground Butcher. They feature an ever-changing rotation of taco varieties, and are masters at flavor combinations.\n\nFood-wise, I have zero complaints - I cannot wait to enjoy their tacos again! My only request would be to have non-soda beverage options, like water, sparkling water, or tea. Depending on their pop-up location, you may be able to snag an alternate drink nearby.\n\nKeep up the great work, El Grito!
