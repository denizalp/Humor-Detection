Bertha's is my current record holder of the Best Sandwich Ever.  I mean, honestly- this cafe is nowhere  near my house but I will always look for an excuse to come here. \n\nThe Roasted Turkey Sandwich is just perfection.  They roast their own turkey, put it on expertly toasted, chewy bread- then add pesto mayo, greens, bacon, tomato, Havarti and onion marmalade. It is a generous portion, but they don't stop there. Your sandwich is capped off with a  chocolate\/white chocolate chip miniature cookie. \n\nI love, love, love Bertha's!
