Awesome! We got the hummus trio with the pita bread. The Pita was nice and thin, and not greasy (the left overs were still great 3 days later). Got the Mediterranean salad which was extremely fresh and very light but vibrantly flavored without going over the top. For our dinners my wife got chicken Shwarma and I got Shish Tawook. Very generous servings, and the chicken was moist and tender. Did I mention the hummus? I would highly recommend this restaurant.
