While enjoying a night out in Vegas I dropped my iPhone 6, the screen was completely shattered. I found Akila's shop the next morning and received excellent customer service. Akila also gave me alkalized water noticing I was still hungover! He told me to return in 45minutes and upon my return my phone was back and running. I highly recommend this place, you will not be disappointed!
