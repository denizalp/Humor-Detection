I've had two meals at Hearth now, and both were quite good. Of course, the Molson Pub was the best restaurant here previously, but still. Service is good and fast, you can easily have a meal in 30 min. On tap selection for beer is poor. I had the chicken BLT which was pretty good, served with some very tasty fries. The mushroom and onion flatbread I had today was 5 stars - great toppings, delicious pesto, and crunchy delicious crust. Portion sizes were perfect. Only complaint, it can be very loud.
