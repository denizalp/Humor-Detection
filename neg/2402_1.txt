Came to this place to check out their snow ice. It was mediocre. Nothing special.\n\nHubby and wifey also tried their Taiwanese popcorn chicken meal and the only thing that stood out was the huge portion. Again, just like any their place that serves same meal.\n\nSide note: difficult to get to the place... Best to call the joint to find out exactly where to park and enter the building. Also, not baby friendly due to cramped space.
