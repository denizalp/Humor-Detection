Good eats, ample tvs and projectors, and nice beer selection. Unfortunately the liquor selection is small so if your looking to party with cocktails I'd pass. However is you love beer and sports this is definitely a bar to check out. I have always had a great time at Scooters and won't be shy of returning!
