Great work on all my windows. They came in at 7am and finished at 1pm with all the windows protected by 12mil thick security film. Although, there was some damage when they removed my blinds and put it back. A couple blinds had broken pieces laying around that I did not notice until they were gone. Also, some of the windows have bubbles in them due to debris. But overall great service. Thanks Las Vegas Window Tinting!
