Ian Green is truly the best. Until working with him, I don't feel that I've had a proper massage. He has a vast knowledge of the body and takes great care to attentively respond to what is needed. He strikes a nice balance of a light hearted yet earnest approach to his craft. I feel absolutely amazing! Highly recommend... especially to those in a physical industry. Also, the space is clean and tastefully arranged. Love the location too!
