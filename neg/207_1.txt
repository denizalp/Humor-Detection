Miley is awesome! She shapes my nails perfectly, exactly how I want,m. I've come a few times now, and my acrylics with gel polish last 3 full weeks without a chip or scratch! The salon itself is decorated nicely, very modern and clean. They always offer something to drink, which is a very nice touch. Overall great experience every time.
