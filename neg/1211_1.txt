Some great Portuguese chicken. We opted for a half chicken-- coated with their spicy sauce. The skin was so good with the flavorful, salty spice coating the exterior. \n\nThe spicy sauce provided some acidity to the overall flavor.. whenever the chicken started to get old, you can dip it into the oily blend and it adds more depth. \n\nService was fairly fast-- and it's also extremely cheap for a good bit of protein. Highly recommended.
