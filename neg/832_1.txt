This is our favorite fish and chip shop!  I find fish and chips are expensive take out to begin with, but its worth it.  We have always had super friendly dining experiences, and they are very family friendly.  \n\nThe Greek salad is also an amazing addon, but be sure to ask for dresssing on the side.
