First and most likely last time coming here. Line to the door, one person manning register. Very very slow. Was going to ask girl in front of me if she'd ever been there before. Glad I didn't as she actually works there and requested to make her own coffee. Her hair was down to her waist, not in a pony or anything and manager said ok. Gross!! Isn't that a health code violation? Only five ahead of me and I stood in line 25 minutes. Ridiculous!
