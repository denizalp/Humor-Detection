I first had their pizza when I was about 10.\nI'm about to turn 50 and it's still what I compare all other Italian slabs of pizza to.\nWhen I have the chance, I go for the pizza.    I've heard their pastries are awesome, but truthfully I'm too busy ordering the pizza all wrapped up in that red waxed paper held together by staples.    Heaven.
