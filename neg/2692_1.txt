This is such a wonderful buffet I can hardly wait to go back! You know how you take a little of lots of things thinking \"I'll try it and leave it if I don't like it\"? I did that and ate everything! Each dish was seasoned and cooked to perfection! We also purchased the all you can drink option and the champagne was flowing freely. Healthy pours refilled continuously without us having to ask\/search for a server. Definitely will go back every time I am in Vegas.
