Could have been great but not. Took 25 minutes to get the first incorrect cocktail and another 10 to get the second and then a manager to get the correct very simple gimlet to the table. Bibb salad was excellent. Cod was rubbery over cocked and not tasteful.  Service was subpar and unapologetic . Won't be coming back anytime soon
