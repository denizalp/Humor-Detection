This place is amazing!! I'm not a big fan of coffee but for this place, I will try everything on the menu and so far everything I've tried is BOMB. ET (the owner) is so cool. My favorite is the Strawberry Horchata Smoothie. I loved it so much, I regret not getting it in the Grandota size. I really do recommend Tres Leches Cafe.
