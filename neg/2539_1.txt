Right up there with The Buffet at Wynn as being my favorite Vegas buffet! Awesome seafood selection! Their oysters don't quite do it for me and the stone crab claws are bland, but the king crab legs, shrimp, and crawfish are always piled high on my plate!\n\nThe best part is their dessert selection! LOVE their gelato station and the creme brulee is a must as well. Really fun place for a group who's down to get messy =) \n\nEveryone felt they got their $42 worth! Don't forget the free shuttles to and from Paris\/Hilton.
