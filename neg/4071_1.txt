This place has so many issues. \"Luxury\" is false advertisement. If I had done more research and looked at other apartments, I would not have moved in last year. Moved recently. LOVE the new place. \n\nMinuses:\nThe address leads people to the leasing office, not the apartments themselves. \nCommon area is lack-luster\nNickel\/Dime you for everything. Monthly HOA and \"Administrative Fees\"...really?\nCharge for trash valet that they don't provide. \n...the list goes on\n\nPositives:\nProximity to restaurants and shops\nLarge apartments (mine was, anyway)\nLittle to no neighbor noise with steel\/concrete construction\n\nThere are better, less expensive places in Charlotte. Do your homework.
