So glad I was referred to Linda for lash extensions! Not only does she do great lashes she is really sweet and fun to chat with. The extensions are done well and last a full two weeks before I need to go for a fill. The online appointment booking is also really easy to use - just a few clicks and your in. Not to mention the huge recliner chair where the lashes are done is super comfortable!
