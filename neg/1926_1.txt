I attended the twerk and strippercise classes last night... not only was it fun, funny, and upbeat, it was a WORK! OUT! Everything from my arms, back, booty, and legs are sore today! \nClarissa, the instructor was knowledgeable, friendly, and super willing to work a little extra on the stuff that didn't click right away. \nSo happy to have something like this in the West Valley! I highly recommend checking this place out!!
