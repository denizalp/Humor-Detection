What a great addition to Surprise and best of all it's not to far from my house. I'm stationed at Luke Air Force base  and I've had tried many vietnamese restaurants  from coast to coast. Hands down this is ranked at the top of my list. It's clean, modern and the staff is friendly, not to mention the food is outstanding. \n\nSo far I've been there 6 times and won't stop, the food keeps calling me. The wife and kid love it as well.  Check it out, you won't  be disappointed.
