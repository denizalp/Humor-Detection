As many have stated in their reviews, pricing is a huge issue.  There are a number of items that need repair, reupholstering or another piece to complete the set, and the prices are set as if these are new items.  I do like their selection; however, go to any antique mall in the area and you can find fixed\/updated pieces - ready to go - for either the same price or less.  I do appreciate that they are recycling older furniture, but please put some more realistic thought into the pricing.
