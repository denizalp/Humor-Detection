Almost ordered everything on the menu already. The price is OK for Bellagio. I think ordering food here is slow. So I always call ahead of time to order food & go and pick it up. At times they have messed up my order or not even put it in. Grr =T They daily specials are sometimes good but it's cheaper then the regular stuff by a dollar or so. They just mix the meat and sauce up hehee. \n\nFavor is the salmon stuff, like the salmon wrap or salmon burger etc.
