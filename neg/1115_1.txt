Love their peanut soups! My favourite is the charbroiled chicken peanut noodle soup! \n\nI was very hesitant to try Vietnamese food but my friend insisted and reassured me that she would find something that I liked. She recommended the peanut noodle soup and so I tried it. I am a frequent eater of this restaurant and the owner knows who I am he hee hee
