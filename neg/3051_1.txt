It beats the one that's in the Cote-Vertu Mall\n\nThis used to be a Quiznos that failed, \nit's a bit quiet, but lots of workers show up at rush hour.\nWhen you're tight on time for work, it's hit and miss.\n\nThe location is pretty big compared to other Subways, lots of room to sit and read.\n\nThe food is the same as anywhere else, but they do fix any issues you have \n(gave me a bottle when the soft drink machine was out).
