Stopped in a couple weeks back when I was in Vegas. After visiting another shop I ended up selling my jewelry here because of the Profesional staff and the treatment I recieved. Not to mention the offer they gave me was a good amount more money than the others establishments. Happy I stopped by and highly recommended.
