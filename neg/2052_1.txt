Their Faja Pasta is delish! I have always been a fan of their chips and Chile Con Queso Dip. They always give you a large amount of chips and salsa, which I usually fill up on before my actual meal, haha. \n\nIt does get really busy so sometimes the service isn't as great or personable. BUT, its okay because the food is great!
