Went to this restaurant last night and was very impressed. It is a very nice restaurant perfect for date night. our waiter Samuel was a pleasure from beginning to end. I had the ribeye steak it was delicious the best in Charlotte in my opinion. The oak house homemade sauce on my steak was great. The oyster Rockefeller was great.  I definitely will be return
