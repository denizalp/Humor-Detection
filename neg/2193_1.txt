Getting your hair done in Vegas is always a gamble so I decided to have my highlights done at Paul Mitchell the school by a student. \nI was nervous when I arrived and they handed my a disclaimer to sign saying they are not responsible for damage to your hair. However, everyones hair at the salon looked great, so that put me at ease. \nMy stylist Jenna R was awesome and my highlights came out perfect. The prices are very resonable and I was glad I took a chance.
