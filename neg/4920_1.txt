I've been to CORE on several occasions and NEVER has the physician been on time.  Wait times over 1 to 1.5 hours each time...completely unacceptable and frustrating since I'm having to leave work and lose pay.  When asked if they can call patients to inform them of the longer waits the staff is completely uninterested.  After this last wait time of 2 hours I will NEVER use them again.
