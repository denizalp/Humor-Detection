I bought a Family Meal and a whole chicken yesterday. It was very disappointing, the ribs were not as flavorful and wasn't moist at all. The chicken was ok but a bit too salty. The side broccoli and pasta was spoiled. I had to throw it out. I don't recommend this place for a family last minute gathering. Next time we'll just BBQ ourselves.
