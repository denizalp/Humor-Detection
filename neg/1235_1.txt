Target is my go to for toiletries and cleaning supplies.  Every now and again, I see decent deals on athletic wear and cosmetics.   You get 5 cents off for each reusable bag you use.  \n\nShelves are generally well stocked. The restrooms and store as a whole is pretty clean.  There's a Starbucks and Pizza Hut at this location.   Never had any complaints with customer service.  There is plenty of parking here. \n\nThe lines can be long and slow.
