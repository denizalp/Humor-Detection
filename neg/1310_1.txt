I've been here a few times and it's very good.  I would give it five stars but it's just a bit expensive for the portion sizes (a large bowl of soup really shouldn't cost almost 10 bucks).  The soup and wrap combo (smaller versions of the regular a la carte choices) is $12 and change so it's still within reason.  The corn and crab chowder is delicious, as is the curried lamb wrap.  The red pepper bisque was alright, but I'd go have the corn soup again for sure.
