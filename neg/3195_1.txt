Very disappointed. We are from out of town & we asked the concierge at the hotel for a recommendation.  They said it would be a 20 min. Wait, but we got seated right away. That was great, but they kept calling my cell ph telling me my reservation was ready. We ordered drinks & the service was horrible.  Waitress never refilled out water, took forever to get food, etc.  very disappointed !
