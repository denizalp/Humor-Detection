I've been to one of their locations in Austin. I loved it there, so I was very excited to try the one here. Needless to say, Eureka a very welcomed addition to the area!\n\nI ordered the crispy brussel sprouts, dry aged carrot fed burger and the Smokey cocktail. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. The hostess and server were both very warm and welcoming. The experience was fantastic from start to end.\n\nI don't eat very frequently downtown, as I live in the SW area of Vegas, but I will definitely be coming here again.
