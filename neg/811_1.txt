For convenience sake, sure this place is fine. However, I have a very hard time understanding how sometimes it takes 45 minutes and other times 4 1\/2 hours. (For only a bath!) It is not fair to the dogs to sit in a crate and wait for that long. The least they can do is hire another employee to monitor dogs and let them play. I'm currently in search of a new groomer!
