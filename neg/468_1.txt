This was a fantastic restaurant! We hardly had a wait time to get in and out waiter was so nice. Checked in on us and told us about some items that were off the menu. For being a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, I anticipated the prices to be higher, but felt they were reasonable. Was too full for dessert, but would definitely had ordered from their options!
