Unbelievable. If you love and respect authentic French food, you're in for a treat. We had Octopus, the Foie Gras and Dover Sole, which was a menu special. The seared Foie was as good as any I've had in France and the Dover Sole was heaven. I don't know how I could go to any other place for date night!!!
