just saw \"sky fall\" here in full IMAX splendor.  wow.  picture was incredible but the sound was turned waaay too loud.   it was so painful many people sat with their fingers in their ears. some people complained but the staff was not helpful.  group in front of us ended up leaving. if you go, be sure to pack ear plugs.
