I found the popcorn to be average. I'm not a fan of Orville. I will say that they aren't afraid to show controversial films which I find to be courageous even though I may not attend them. I like that they've started showing older classic films on the big screen where I would like to see them....if they would just not do it on Wednesday nights!
