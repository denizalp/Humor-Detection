Adorable Parisian bakery! The decor is beautiful. Maman is vintage, quaint, and picture perfect. \n\nMy colleague and I shared the plain croissant ($2.75) and pistachio cake ($3.50). Not the best croissant I have ever eaten - flaky but very oily. The oil soaked through the bag. The pistachio cake was slightly too sweet for our tastes. The batter mix seemed uneven. The cake lacked balance. \n\nI really wanted to love Maman. It seems to lack substances based on our order. Perhaps I will come back to try other menu items if I am in the area.
