My friend loves this place. Not huge Into Thai but gave it a try. Was impressed. Place is nice and clean. Ample room and service is amazing. A had curry and rice. Good was great for my first time. Will surely return and try different items on the menu. Brought my kid and didn't see anything on the menu specially for little kids. Employee offered to specially make a bowl of rice and chicken with vegetables. Really cool.\n\n\nCheck it out.
