Wow! What an amazing experience. Abdul, the owner and chef, welcomed us with a smile - - and the best humus I've ever had! The meal only improved from there. Excellent, friendly service; delicious food; and an adventurous atmosphere. \n\nBe aware that this is not Applebee's - - if you've never had Moroccan before, then be ready for a new experience. But regardless, give this place a try!!
