Was in town for a conference and took 4 of my teachers to I Love This Bar! Service, food and drinks were great! Music and the videos were fun as well. Only thing keeping it from a 5 Star review is the servers dressed in chaps showing their ass. I mean this is not hooters is it? The servers can dress sexy without dressing like Vegas showgirls.
