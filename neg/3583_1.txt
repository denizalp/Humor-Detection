This is my first experience with Bulwark.  Lawrance (\"Larry\") was the tech that came out to spray the inside of my house.  He was VERY professional and friendly to myself and my dogs. He even took time to answer all of my questions.  It is too early to tell if the product is killing the fleas in my backyard (they said it takes a few days), but I appreciate the fact that Bulwark will come spray again if I still have a problem.  Thanks Bulwark!
