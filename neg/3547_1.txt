This started as the worst food experience ever. I enjoy paying for good service. This didn't happen here. Wait time was awful, food wasn't cooked right. Drinks weren't served in a timely manner. George tried to make it right. Unfortunately it wasn't enough. Please consider another place. We waisted 3 hrs for poor service. At center cut Steakhouse at the flamingo
