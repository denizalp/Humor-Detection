Thanks again Jeremy\nYou know your trees !!\nLove the way the tree trim\ncame out. I've got a lot of trees\non the property. They all look\ngreat. Fruit trees to Palm trees.\nJeremy was a no show to 2 more appointments he made to fix Bucks \ndrip line work. When I needed 2 lines\nto trees Buck went 4 inches underground \nand just split the line so I would see 2 \nlines coming out of the ground.\nHalf the yard has adjustable emitters \nhalf not, I have plants not getting any water.
