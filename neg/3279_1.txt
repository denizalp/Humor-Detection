Terrific food, atmosphere is calm a great place for lunch. The serving size is perfect. The waitresses are super sweet and well informed. We also had dessert which was equally satisfying. Coffee is nice and strong, iced chai latte is made with condensed cream- delicious!!i can't wait to come back again.
