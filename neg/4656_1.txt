Gotta love the Steelers.\n\nNo matter where you go in the world, you will find a Steelers fan.  I was once in Croatia (European country) and some local Croatians recognized my dad's shirt and started shouting \"Yeahhh Steeelers.\"  Dallas Cowboys may be considered Americas team, but the Steelers is the Worlds team.\n\nHere we go Steelers; Here we go.
