We went with a group of 7 this weekend. As a local, we are usually strategic at where we dine, but we had friends in town and they chose this restaurant. For two burgers w\/fries and two beers...with a tip=about $75.  Food was mediocre, nothing special.  Service was pretty swift and friendly, (with Eddie)though. However, I see no real reason to want to return!
