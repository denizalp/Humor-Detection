Ms. Dee was very accommodating and explained to me the best way to load my potatoes. I tried their loaded potatoes with brisket and was it was amazing. But the star of the show is the baked potato pie. It was heavenly! Comfort food for me at its best with a gracious hostess and a little kid that kept me entertained while waiting!
