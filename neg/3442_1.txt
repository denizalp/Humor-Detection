Saw Star Trek Into Darkness here while on vacation; the screening room was fine, stadium seating and comfortable cushions. The screen was very large and clear and the audio was louder than average (in a positive way.) Overall enjoyable movie experience, but I took a star away because the staff sucked. I'm going to be very frank: it seemed like every single person working there got super stoned together five minutes before we showed up, and then again before we made our way out.
