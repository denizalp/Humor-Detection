Worst burger joint ever!\n Don't go near this trap!  The burgers were burnt and about the size of a dollar coin.  The curly fries were absolutely disgusting as they were cold and reheated.  Then there was the half chicken which came out to two portions of breasts because the legs were sold out.  Fine!  But at least make them tasty and fresh!  The chicken was absolutely DRY and tasted like it was a week old!  Sorry this place is a disaster!  Too bad it was our first meal in Montreal and it was certainly \"unforgettable!\"
