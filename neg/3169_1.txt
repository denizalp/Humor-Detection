I have been to A LOT of massage therapists. I tried the massage envy route, went to some higher end spas. Mike is HANDS down the best massage therapist I have ever been to and there is no comparison. He knows what he is doing and walks you through each muscle and why it matters. If you need a real massage where you feel like it's helping make progress, see Mike. Like now.
