Good lunch \/ grab a coffee spot ! Nice hot bar (my veal was lukewarm though.. Ekk..). Everything else was great. Nice lunch combos with lots of variety and good value.\nFamily style, nice renos, and very clean. Def a place to keep in mind when you're in the area but prob won't go out of my way to visit.
