This is an interesting combination of Mexican and Asian foods. Get all Mexican, all Asian, or a combination. You get a lot of food for not a lot of money, but my first visit wasn't life changing or anything, just better than the alternative choices in the fast food varieties of the same types of food. If in the area looking for decently priced food I would eat here again.
