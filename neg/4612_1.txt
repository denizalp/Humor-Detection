Do not waste your money on these homes. You pay top dollar and yes you get a moen sink and faucets, but they are the cheapest grade made. Every single thing is the cheapest made. Shower door falling off.  You get a new home but you have to put new of everything when you move in. Very disappointed in this company. I would not recommend them to anyone.
