Lucki Thai is one of my family's favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas. Although delivery service is a standard 45min-60min ish, the dining service is always satisfying (unless there's a wait). The food is authentic and comes out quick! Our go-to orders are chicken satay, crab Rangoon, pad Thai. Pad see-ewe, beef\/and or chicken salad, and basil chicken.\n\nP.S. I saw another review on here that said they remember returning customers. This is very true! They always remembered us, which shows the care of their genuine customer service!
