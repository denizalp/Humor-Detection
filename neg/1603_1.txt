Some of the worst food I have had, EVER! For two we paid $30 for a measly sandwich and chips. My husband didn't like his pastrami sandwich. No flavor. I had the turkey sandwich with chips. The chips were great, the only good thing in that place. The turkey although fresh was dry, tasteless and not worth the price. I had to drown my food in mayo and mustard. The pickle on the side was a baby pickle. Wont go here again.
