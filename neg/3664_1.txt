I found this steakhouse on my fiancÃ©'s birthday. It ended up being such a pleasant turnout! I loved the rustic and dim lights the atmosphere had. Our server was phenomenal and engaged with us the entire evening. He made the experience that much better. This easy is the top steakhouse I've had dinner at. We will return for another great evening.
