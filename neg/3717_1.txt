Just tried for first time, and the food and service was beyond 5 stars. Look at this picture, very reasonable prices. Fresh, fulfilling, and I will be back very often. Keep it up, the sky is the limit for this place.  This was the lamb\/beef gyro! Look at the meat, and the jalape√±o and cilantro hummus!
