I can only speak to my experience, going weeknights  between 1030-midnight, but the gym is fine overall. Sure, the employees (kids) are either on their cell phones or sitting on desks chatting to their friends. And some of the equipment is often \"under repair\", but most works fine. Music, TV, meh. Biggest plus is it's usually almost empty at that time of night. Biggest con is the counter guys are always closing 5-10 minutes early, and when you come in the last hour, that really sucks.
