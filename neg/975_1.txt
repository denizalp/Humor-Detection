Called in to place an order at exactly 8pm, they said it'll be ready for pick at 9pm.... got there at 9, not yet ready. Ok waited, 45 minutes later still no pizza then asked what going on, they said its probably being placed in a box, then she comes back saying \"oh the guy is having trouble with the oven\". Wtf! We left. Recommendation, dont go here. (Plus staff was rude)
