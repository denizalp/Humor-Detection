I drove past this vegetarian restaurant and turned around to grab a fresh juice and salad for carryout, but would love to go back for a nice sit-down meal with a friend. Fast and friendly service, great pricing, and the juice and salad were fabulous. The restaurant is comfortable and cute, clean, and has great ambience. Looking forward to hitting this place again when I'm back in Charlotte.
