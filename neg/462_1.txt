Compared to all the competing waffle dessert places, Sweet Esc does a great job catering towards a more Asian clientele. I say this because the portion sizes are smaller, the toppings are less heavy, and the ice cream flavours offered are more unique.  \n\nI tried the sizzling hot plate waffle with earl grey and coffee ice cream, and it was everything I expected it to be. \n-8.5 rating for tastiness\n-9 rating for uniqueness\n-10 rating for being instagram-worthy
