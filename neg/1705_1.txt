Always friendly, garments always ready when promised.  I take all of my day to day clothing here, nicer items I take elsewhere because these folks don't accept all items like leather trim or special buttons.  Great deal on comforters too I think right now it is only $25 on special days.  Try them out!  It's all pre-pay and if you sign up you get email coupons.
