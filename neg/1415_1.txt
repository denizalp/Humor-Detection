I ordered the watermelons, waffles, and fried chicken and my wife ordered the chicken sandwich. We both enjoyed our meals. The fried chicken was crispy and juicy, the waffle had a unique taste that I liked. I didn't like the watermelon too much. Everything on the menu looked good. Their cocktails are also pretty tasty. I would recommend this place to all
