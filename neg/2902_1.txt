Kathy is a horrible manager first off. Her customer service is absolutely horrible. I had to look at my online order that was supposed to be ready 2 hours ago and told there's nothing she could do. When I expressed my dismay with other customers we were told we could leave. My problem was rectified by another manager named Dennis. Dennis is the man and the only reason I Will Be Back To This walmart. He greeted me and reasonably fixed my problem without the hostility Kathy had.
