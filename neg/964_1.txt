Delicious, fresh and authentic! I had 3 tacos (chicken, beef and pastor); thanks to the suggestion of another Yelpers. Made the same way my Mexican friends make it. The BF ordered beef quesadillas, which he enjoyed as well. Enjoyed the sauces on the table - verde = mild, red = spicy. \nWill definitely be back for more food! Quick and attentive service.
