Absolutely the most pathetic pharmacy on the planet! Do not waste your time there, and believe me, they will waste your time and could care less about it! I was needing a refil on a prescription and was put on hold for 25 minute's before I hung up and called again. Once more was put on hold and after another 10 minute's left on hold I gave up. Maybe I called at  the wrong time, during business hour's! Pathetic!!!
