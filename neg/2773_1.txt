I Come here often the staff is really nice. Their baked goods are not consistent sometimes hard or over baked. I have gotten 2 wrong drinks. As Starbucks have everything down to a formula so they can't really make a bad. But wrong drink yes. Average rating I would say for this store. Traffic to get out during rush hour is terrible just how this mall is set up it all bottled necks at that intersection.  Don't go in during rush hour.
