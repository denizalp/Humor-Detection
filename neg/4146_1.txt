First time here, nothing like the other oyster bar in town. But it wasn't bad. I had the Lobster Pan Roast, it was more on the sour side rather than a sweet and no spice level was asked for the dish. Service was great, they were prompted and friendly. Got everything we needed to have an enjoyable meal.\n\nComing back and trying other items on the menu,
