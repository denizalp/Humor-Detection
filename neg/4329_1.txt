This place has 3 stars as of today and it isn't much better than that on its best day.  The food is average and the service is average.  The only thing this place has going for it is its outside where it feels like you are on a beach resort.  Other than that stick to easy drinks, make reservations someplace else to eat afterwards and make sure your bar tender and waitress gives you change after paying with cash. They will try to tip themselves.
