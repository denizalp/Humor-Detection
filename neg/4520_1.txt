This place is amazing!!  Went for derby day to enjoy some southern food in Vegas and it killed.  Our server Kaitlyn was fabulous with recommendations and her service.  Although, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.  We had Lewllyn's Fine Fried Chicken,  Mac & Cheese, & biscuits.  The chicken was the best I have ever had (sorry mom).  I could not stop eating, I seriously would go to Vegas just to enjoy this food again.\n\nThank you for the quality service and amazing food!
