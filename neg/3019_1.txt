Came here for lunch the ribeye was so good.  Fried pickles for appetizer.  The reason for 5 stars is our waitress trisha.   She was fantastic.  On top of everything we never had to wait or ask for anything.  She even had four other tables ..  I was a waitress so I know what it takes to make a good waitress and she followed that  When we come back we will defiently ask for Trisha.   If you go ask for her.  She will take good care of you...
