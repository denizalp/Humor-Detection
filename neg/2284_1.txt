After seeing mixed reviews, I deceided to try it.  My husband and I ordered a 14\" original crust, sausage w\/ 1\/2 pepperoni, 1\/2 mushroom.  I thought it was very good.  The wheat dough is very yummy and I was even more excited to find out it was only 4 pts for 4 slices on my WW diet.\n\nVery friendly service.  It's not your typical greasy, cheesy pizza which I love as well.  But if you are trying to be health conscious, this is for you.
