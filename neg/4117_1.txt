The Venetian was the best 2 bed w a living space area room  so far. We had a nice few. The elevators were always ready for use. The only thing about this section of the hotel is that you have to take two elevators to get to the rooms. \n\nWhen checking out, try to do that as early as possible because it gets crazy busy! But they also have express checkout, where they email you. \n\nOverall, loved the Venetian... The shops and the food =)
