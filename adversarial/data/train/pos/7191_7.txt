The Landmark used to be such a great place for a special dinner out...what happened!!  Visited here on 01\\12\\13 with boyfriend and his father from out of town and have to say I was embarrassed at the decline in the quality of the food and ambiance at this restaurant.\n\nEven though this restaurant is located in a cool historic building, I would have call the decor \"early nursing home\".  From the faded, torn and worn carpeting; to the cheesy Muzak playing over the sound system, even the smell reminded me of visiting Grandma. Some updating is definitely in order.\n\nThe prime rib I ordered was done well, but came out cold and the quality of the cut was sub par for the price being charged.  Boyfriend's stuffed meatloaf was also a disappointment, and the obviously instant mashed potatoes on his plate were the stuff of only the finest school cafeteria fare.  The Salad Room is probably the safest bet with a large selection of items to choose from including soups and desserts.\n\nOne saving grace was the service.  Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant and right there when needed.\n\nThe Landmark is clearly relying on the name it made for itself in past years to draw people in.  If you go stick to the Salad Room.
