Gamblers General Store is somewhere I've been visiting for many many years!  It's sad to see them slowly decline over the years, but like many things in Vegas, things change over time!  Once the go-to place to buy retired dice and used decks of cards that were actually in play in every casino in town.  They at times will have used blackjack tables or roulette wheels from casinos around town, but a lot of that seems to have gone by the wayside as well.  If for nothing but nostalgia itself, I give them four stars due to many great memories over the years!
