Before I start this review, a small disclaimer.  This is a review for the restaurant just after it opened and this is for the smaller Las Vegas location outside of Bally's.\n\nI want to like this place.  Hell, I want to love it!  I am originally from the Boston area, I have watched the show from the beginning and I love the concept of the Wahlberg family starting their own burger chain.  That being said, we didn't have a great experience here even though we were really excited to try it out.  When we got there, it was fairly late so there was only one couple walking in, in front of us.  We thought, great...   no line when we were expecting one.  We sat at the bar area.  There were people walking here and there doing behind-the-bar things and saw us sitting there, but they literally chose to ignore us.  I don't know if it was the timing of our visit or they had had a long day or what, but I always give servers and\/or bartenders the benefit of the doubt.\n\nWe had to have been sitting there for 15 mins. or more before we stood up and had to find a copy of their menu that was sitting down the bar.   This prompted one of them to come over and take our drink order.  We ordered a couple of beers and thought that would be the start of good service.  Nope.  We sat waiting until we finished our beers (another 15 mins. or more) before anyone came back over to ask if we wanted food.  We finally were able to order and our burgers did come out pretty fast.  Too fast it seems, as our burgers were both very rare although we ordered medium.  We were too hungry at this point - and frankly a little scared to complain - to send them back for more firing.\n\nAgain, I want to love this place and I am a very easy-going, benefit-of-the-doubt, Elite Yelper who doesn't like to complain but this type of service was really bad.  I am sure this restaurant wouldn't hire employees who simply didn't care or didn't know how to cook so I have to chalk this one up to bad time, or employees at the end of their shift who have had a long, tiring day.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\nCool restaurant design\nWahlberg name\nOkay beer selection\nGreat food presentation\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nWait time\nCustomer service\nFood not cooked to order\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nLocation (among cheap shops in front of Bally's casino)\nRare burger meat when asked for Medium
