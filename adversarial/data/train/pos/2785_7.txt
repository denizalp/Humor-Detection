It's about time Fukuburger (pronounced \"Foo Koo\" for you noobs),  got a permanent location. Located inside the F.A.M.E. (which stands for Food Art Music Entertainment) which also houses other Asian food stands, it is a welcome site to visiting tourists and locals alike. \n\nFor those that are new to Fukuburger, it started originally as a food truck by Colin Fukunaga and Robert \"Mags\" Magsalin. Thus, the food truck theme that welcomes you as soon as you enter FAME.\n\nNow for the important part. The food. Their menu is plain and simple. Each burger has a number with a picture and a description. I have tried them all but for some reason, its always a toss up between the #4 Kinoko \"Mushroom\" Burger (which has an all beef fuku patty, grilled shitake mushrooms, pickled red ginger, teriyaki, and finished with wasabi mayo), and the #5 Karai \"Spicy\" Burger (which has an all beef fuku patty, pickled cucumbers, avocado cream, and finished with habenero kabayaki). Sometimes when im real hungry, I get both. Most cases I get one and make it a combo with Jazz Fries (fries that have some kind of gravy\/garlic sauce on top of it). Some call it crack sauce for it is very addicting.\n\nAs for some negatives of course the price you pay will be marked up. You gotta understand that the rent they pay here is probably ridiculously high based on the fact that it is on \"the strip\". So whatever profit they make is probably just enough to cover the lease and overhead. So they probably make just enough to make a profit. For lunch today I got the Spicy Karai Burger, Jazz Fries, and a medium drink for 17 and some change. That's with a dollar tip (when you do this, the hot looking chick that takes your order will scream out, \"TIP JELLY!\"). Boy am I glad that the drinks are unlimited refills.\n\nThe one other negative thing which Fuku has no control over is that there is no bathroom in the area where you will be eating. It is outside about 50 yards down. I would say thats a fail on the design by the architects. What food court does not have a bathroom right there ready to go? \n\nSome random info: Yes they take cards. Their hours vary. Since they are still practically new, there is no set hours just yet as per the Yelp business listing. Rule of thumb; they are usually open for lunch around 11 and close late on fridays and saturdays. I recommend that you call first before heading out there if you think its late already. I had the pleasure of having a burger named after me. It ended up being called the Roger's free burger special (Refer to pic. Message me if you want to hear the whole story). Which reminds me, sometimes they have specials that are off the wall but amazing like the Ronald McFuku Burger, Chicken and Waffles (the Asian version), and even a longonisa burger (ask any Filipino what that is and they will tell you. Lol).\n\nSo in closing, you will be amazed at the flavor you will encounter after eating any one of their menu items here. Also dont be afraid to track down their truck if you dont want to make that trip here to the Linq.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #166 \"Stop Fuku'ing around and get the Fuku down here!\"
