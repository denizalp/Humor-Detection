What a great concept! I thought that Korean BBQs were the only places where you can cook your own meat but I was wrong.\n\nThey use charcoal in the grills--Kingsford!\n\nAYCE Make it yourself Texas toast and salad bar with baked potatoes!\n\nCheap beer! Craft at $6 for a huge 25 oz mug.\n\nThe only downside is the meat quality isn't all that great. Prime level cuts with little to no marbling. \n\nI wish they had one of these places in Chicago because it's a great place to get some grilling in when your grill is hidden under two feet of snow. For $22\/person it's definitely worth a try. We'll be back!
