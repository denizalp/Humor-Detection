These people were terrible to work with. Steve came out to do an estimate for a remodel of two rooms I needed done and didn't listen to a word I said. He then proceeded to get upset with me when I asked for changes. I would stay away from this company. There are too many quality contractors in the valley that want your business and care about their customers.
