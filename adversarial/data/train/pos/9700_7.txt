My gf had called and she got upgraded to a suite. We were like huh? How did that happen?\n\nWell the toilets had overflooded all over the place [insert mental picture] and so yea... suite it is.\nRemember... Have people come over and clog your toilet so that you get upgraded.\nMan I am just full of great advice.\n\nAnyway. The place was okay. The room itself was big. There were probably like 15 or so of us in the room, hanging out before the boy and I went to Beatle's Revolution Lounge. There was a big space where everyone could dance, chill out, and stuff so that was nice. The hotel itself was cheesy, but it's old school so what do you expect?\n\nI definitely won't be staying here anytime soon. I don't know about you guys but I don't want to witness the toilet overflowing phenomenon. I will come over after you get upgraded and throw a big party though.\n\n:D
