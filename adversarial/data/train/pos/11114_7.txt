Okay, First I'll admit that I don't know a thing about gambling and I have never set foot into the casino side of Frank Sisson's but the bowling is pretty good. They have 30 lanes including a few five pin lanes. The prices are pretty average for bowling and it's everything that you would expect in a bowling alley -except for the lady who runs the concession. She is a throw back from the 1950s of our collective imagination. With the great voice of a lifetime smoker she calls everyone 'Hun' and even offers the occasional pearl of advice. You may be thinking that it doesn't matter who it is that sells you your kool-aid slurpy and you may be right but that doesn't make her any less memorable.
