Ok-today was my first visit to a Whole Foods..ever. All I can say is that the store itself was beautiful. The produce looked well organized and put together in a beautiful artistic way. It made you want to buy the fruits and vegetables. I was very impressed. Although a bit on the pricey side. That said I walked by the hot prepared foods in a buffet like setting. I gotta say most of it was really disgusting looking. The food looked hours old and looked like they rarely refreshed it.I was really surprised how poorly it looked. The bakery looked nice but $$..and it was a little to crowded for me overall with such narrow aisles. Would I go back--prob not,I was  underwhelmed by the \"whole\" experience.
