After visiting the original San Diego location, I've been feverishly trying to get me some Gordos - the lord answered my prayers!\n\nI assumed the strip location would be crowded and the quality diluted (only an assumption) so we drove out to this location. Paulo pretty much nailed it, you know it's gonna be good when you are the only person here not speaking Spanish. \n\nI don't like Mexican. I'll admit that right off the bat. But Tacos El Gordo is something entirely different. None of that heavy gross hangover feeling like other Mexican places. I have tried just about every taco and the spicy pork tacos are still my favorite. Each are about the size of your palm, and I always ask for more sauce. \n\nThey also have something I can't seem to find anywhere else....ORANGE ORGASM BANG BANG BANG RA TA TA. It's not really called that but they should. It comes out of a circulating fountain, foams at the top and brings all the boys to the yard.
