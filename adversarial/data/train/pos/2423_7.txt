This is called The Galaxy Luxury Theatre!! because it's a luxurious theatre... an upscale, high-end way of cinema viewing! It's one of four theatres located in Nevada with the others located in California (4), Texas (2) & Washington (2) http:\/\/www.galaxytheatres.com \nCinema viewing has never been this fantastic! Movie-going has gone phenomenally classy:\nPurchasing tickets at the Box Office upon arrival have no moviegoers lined up \nOr Purchase online, and get that reserved, assigned seating you prefer \nTickets are affordably priced ($8 per person)\nBig faux red leather reclining seats (your feet up!, body all stretched out! on the seat) with over-the-knees swivel table where your favorite glass of wine or beer and concessions can be placed in front of you for easy grabbing of your favorite swig and nosh while you watch\nComfy seats which are well-spaced between seats (oh, it would be nice to have two persons in it) \nSurround theatrical sound to really immerse yourself in the movie  \nConcession stand with your favorite movie snacks in generous sizes \nBeer or wine to purchase and take inside the theatre to your personal swivel table\nTheatre room smells new leather-like \nBathrooms are clean \nComfortably nice indoor temperature throughout.... \nAll these for an awesomely fantastic moviegoing experience!\nI had the opportunity to experience this luxury-ness on an Advance Film Screening of \"The Other Woman\" in the springtime, compliments of the film's studio production.. If there is The Other Woman, ain't worrying about it if ever it happens in life, but this theatre is \"The Other Theatre\", I will and anyone will want to see more!!
