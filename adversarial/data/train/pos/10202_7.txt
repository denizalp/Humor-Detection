if i could give them 0 reviews i would. i am in town from CA for epic training & we decided to go to a cheese shop, which is less than 2 miles away. i called twice to confirm the price and also book the cab. the guy told me it would be less than $15 considering it is only 2 miles away. we get there and the driver tells us it is $10 plus $12 for staying in Verona (pretty much getting an extra fee for not going too far). we told him we weren't informed about the fee so he calls the dispatcher who asks \"are they unable to pay?\" so pretty much, if we would've said we're unable, the fee was not required NOR were we informed we had to pay. we give the guy $25, definitely asked for the change back & vowed to never call union can, screw this cab company.
