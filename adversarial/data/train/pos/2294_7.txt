What could be considered my LIB HQ, I had quite a few meals at Flippin' Good last weekend. My order was always a double turkey burger (extra pickles, mustard), a side of fries and a water. Total: $7.xx. I know you can find some cheap eats on Freemont, but anytime you can REALLY stuff yourself for under $8, I'm a fan. As for the food itself, it wasn't half bad. Like others have mentioned, it's a step above a McD's, but probably a step down from a BurgerFi or Smashburger. Much respect for having a potato bun, 'merican cheese, fresh veggies (which you can ask them to pile on) and a legit sized patty. The Flippin Sauce on the burg' is no Animal Style from I&O or Mac Sauce, but it's not the worst. Bottom line, when intoxicated or in need of a relatively quick and inexpensive meal, this place isn't a bad place to be. Coat that stomach and rage on! \n\nNote: it takes 7-10 minutes to get your order. Prepare for that.
