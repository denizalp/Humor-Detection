I didn't really like the restaurant at all. You walk in and it smells like cigarettes and you have just go wherever and I don't like that there should be someone taking you to a table and it took the waiter about 5ish minutes to get us menus and then once we wanted to order the lady was at the bar and she was acting like she had a million customers when it was my table and maybe 3 people at the bar.... the food wasn't great . So I pretty much paid them 60 bucks to make us sick! I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.
