Visiting my wife in Monroeville and decided to give this place a try. Ordered chow mein, among other things. The food shows up 30 minutes LATE (was quoted 45 minutes, took 1:15 to show up), and the chow mein was apparently a different 'style' of chow mein, it came as just a bunch of vegetables, no noodles. I explained to the woman on the phone when I ordered it I would like noodles, cabbage, ect (like every other Chinese restaurant on earth serves it). The delivery man tells me I wanted Cantonese Chinese food, unfortunately New China does not serve Cantonese food. I wish the lady who took my order would have told me that.
