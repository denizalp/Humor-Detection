There is one simple reason to go to Slice of Sicily besides the fact that the pizza is better than Mamma Mia's: the waitress is awesome.\n\nA brassy skinned, raspy voiced spitfire of a straight-shit-bitch server will unhappily take your order, and bring it to your promptly.  You'll listen to her answer the phone with a sound that is a medley of Kathleen Turner, Diane Rehm with a touch of one of those women with a hole in their throat from smoking.  \n\n\"GOOD AFTERNOON SLICE OF SICILY\"\n\nIt's comical in the best way, and I both admire and respect this woman for running the tiny, four topped gem seemingly on her own and without regard for the comfort of her customers.  She is, in my eyes, sort of a bad ass. \n\nAlso, the pizza is not bad, the prices are fair, the salads taste fresh and the place is bright and welcoming with comfy hotel room art and a steady flow of people getting their orders to-go (perhaps to avoid my hero server).\n\nI pay attention to the service, I do, and while normally I might scoff at her unpleasant attitude and smoker's voice, for some reason I find her, and this place, a fascinating destination for a cheap pizza lunch and an interesting experience.
