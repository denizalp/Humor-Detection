09\/16\/11 TEARS FOR FEARS CONCERT.\n\nAfter attending thousands of concerts, this has to be one of the most miserable venues I've ever encountered for a show. If I could give it a zero, I would.\n\nFirst off, WHERE did the advertisements state that there were SEATED vs STANDING tickets available? They cordoned off a section directly in front of the stage, and then surrounded it with security goons. The light board was literally where it shouldn't be, in the middle directly across from the stage, but COMPLETELY BEHIND the SEATED section, so that the poor folks who couldn't get into the SEATED section (which, BTW, was ONLY HALF FULL the entire evening) were stuck trying to negotiate ANY remaining sight lines.\n\nAnd then, when it comes to getting ANYTHING to drink, forget about it. There were bars, but it was virtually impossible to walk around, due to all the pools in the way. I'm very surprised no one fell in, considering how DRUNK and OBNOXIOUS the crowd was, and the little amount of room to wander. I did not drink a thing the entire show, from 9pm until just after 11.\n\nAnd about that crowd. OMFG, WHY DO YOU GO TO CONCERTS AND THEN SCREAM AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS TO FRIENDS WHILE THE SHOW IS HAPPENING? WHY THE F**K ARE YOU EVEN THERE? Now, as I said at the beginning, I've literally been to thousands of shows, and have experienced this many times. But THIS CROWD takes the cake for obnoxiousness. I nearly encountered a fist fight between a group of drunks directly next to me, caused by an a**hole couple who shoved in front of 2 nice folks who had been standing next to me for the first 45 mintues, which, if it had not been diffused, would've ended up, in a domino effect, getting my spouse thrown into a pool, and then, believe me, DEATH BY SPOUSE would have occurred!\n\nAnd then there were the actual people WORKING the venue. NONE of them seemed to want to be there. (DO YOU BLAME THEM?) And there were \"thugs\" literally shoving people out of the way to escort \"special\" people to the SEATED section. Again, I'm surprised no one ended up in one of the pools. (I overheard someone say, in fact, \"Gee, NO ONE ended up in a pool this time!\")\n\nSo my advice is: If there is a show advertised for this venue, DO NOT GO unless you can get those SEATED tickets. It just isn't fun enough to deal with. And even THEN, expect overcrowding, chaos and a**holes, both w\/ mgmt and patrons.\n\nI moved to Vegas last December. I've enjoyed EVERYWHERE tremendously. I am a Strip patron and a non-Strip patron. The free concerts at the Cosmopolitan, the shows at the punk venues like Double Down and Beauty Bar, even the shows at the Railhead inside the Boulder Station, have all been pleasant, well-staffed and easy to have fun. This was the first time in 9 months of being a local where I started thinking maybe I made a mistake moving here.\n\nNext show: Joy Formidable @ the Cosmopolitan Pool. Can't wait. Saw them Thursday night there. And I've been there already for a bunch of shows.
