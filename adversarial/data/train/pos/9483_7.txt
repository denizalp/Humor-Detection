4 1\/2 stars for the gun counter sales help. Very informative, knowledgeable and treated me and my friend very well. They also haven't raise their prices after the Sandy Hook shooting and I appreciate them not gouging their customers.\n\nMaybe 2 stars for the shooting range. I've never seen a range handled this way. Every simple thing is an \"up sale\" and an additional charge. Is it due to having to pay young clueless girls to stand around trying to make the whole shooting \"experience\" more appealing?\n\nOne person pays to go in and shoot but to observe you must pay as well. My friend is inexperienced and wanted my help and advice on the line but I wasn't paying their BS fees to join him. On top of that you've got some guy breathing down your neck the entire time.
