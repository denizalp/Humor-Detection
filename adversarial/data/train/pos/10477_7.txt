First time having sushi in Mississauga and maybe my last (kidding), but probably I will stick to Toronto an Markham Sushi. We were their for the lunch AYCE. I will rating this according to service, atmosphere and food.\n\nService 2.5\/5: the servers seemed nice in the beginning until she asked us what we wanted to drink. I wanted lemon water and green tea. She looked displeased when i said that and the attitude changed after that. An hour into the meal we started ordering dessert. So they came by and took the plates and utensils away from us and i found that ackward because some people may eat more even though they are having dessert. The server didn't even ask if we still needed it. After they even took the ipad away and we couldnt get more dessert. \n\nAtmosphere 2.5\/5 : it was okay. Nothing special. The table the seater sat us at was still dirty. The table was sticky so i had to use water and wipe it down myself. It was loud, but it was okay because there were a lot of people.\n\nFood 2\/5: i never expect much from AYCE places anymore and usually i don't go to AYCE now a days but my friend wanted to go try, so we did. The fish in my opinion was not fresh. Very thin slices of fish on a pretty big rice. Also the rolls were huge!! Not the right sizes and taste meh. After eating i felt a little sick when i got home and felt like that the whole day. Tempura wasnt great. Beef ribs tasted like they were steamed and not grilled or pan fried. Nothing really stood out for me. In my opinion i feel that they use ALOT of msg. I was thirsty throughout the whole day and night! Gave me a bit of a headache as well. \n\nI definitely will not be returning, but this place is great for large groups because of how much space they have. Also the AYCE lunch was relatively cheap. So if you want a get together with a group and not all that into the food than this place would be good. Everything was edible, but was not the best of quality.
