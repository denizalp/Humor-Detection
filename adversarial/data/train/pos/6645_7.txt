Went to Armadillo Grill today because of the 4 stars out of 158 reviews. Our waitress gave us wrong information about the ingredients for my meal twice (I'm vegan and specifically asked if the veggie burger had milk or egg, then I asked for the street tacos with a substitute of avacado and black beans and after saying that was fine she came back and said no the black beans where only for the veggie burger and I could only have avocado on it.) So I told her to forget it and to bring our appetizer the hummus and pita bread and my boyfriends order of beef street tacos. His order came first before the appetizer. She blamed this one someone in the kitchen. She did not provide utensils or napkins and she did not bring him the refried beans and rice that came with the order. We didn't mention it and just asked for the the utensils and napkins.\n\nMy boyfriend said taco bell had better tacos than here. There hummus was nothing special however the pita bread was very fluffy and delicous.\n\nShe then came by and asked me if she could get me a brownie or something for all the trouble. ( previously I let her know I do not eat milk or eggs because I am vegan, thought that was a bit of a sick joke. ) I just ignored that and said I'm sure that has milk in it and she laughed and said that was a rhetorical question.  Yea I found that ironic given her lack of waitress skills.\n\nThen the check came. It was the wrong check charged for 2 full street taco meals and hummus with an additional charge of olives which I don't know where that came from. I brought it to her attention that I believe the order was incorrect she again blamed someone in the kitchen for the error again.\n\nI won't be coming back. Oh not to mention in the booths the light is right above your eyes as you watch the game without a dimmer or fogged sheild. \n\nEnjoy you mediocore food, overpriced beer, and fucked up orders. Read the Google reviews much more accurate experience than yelp.
