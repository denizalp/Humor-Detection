I bought a car from here a couple of months ago. I asked that they change the oil as it appeared dirty and smelled burnt. Their in house mechanic had a look and told me it was fine and I could drive it for another 6 months or 10k. I took it yesterday to my own mechanic for an oil change and was told the oil and filter couldn't have been changed for at least 20k.  I saw the filter myself and watch it disintegrate in his hands. He said he had never seen a filter in such bad shape. It was actually seized and took extra care to remove it so as not to damage the housing. Obviously they do the minimum to their cars here and when confronted they lied to my face and had I driven it like they suggested I could have and may have damaged my car a great deal. I would not recommend going here to buy a car or use their mechanic services either.
