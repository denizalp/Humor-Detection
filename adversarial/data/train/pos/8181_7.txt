We went here for Mother's Day today. It was one of the worst meals I have had, especially for the price. The food was bland, precooked and uninspired.\nAlso, the atmosphere is very stuffy and there are literally no children there (unless you count 60 year olds). Will never go here again.\nI tried not to let it ruin my day but unfortunately it did (at least for a few hours).
