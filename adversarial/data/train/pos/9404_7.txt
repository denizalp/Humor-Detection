We have been bringing our dogs here for years. Dr C. operated on our dog's hip a few years ago. We have always been happy with the doctors. Today we took our dogs in for shots. We had an appointment but had to wait almost a half hour in a room with our dogs getting more and more nervous. When my husband went out to ask how  much longer it would be he got a very snotty \"We\"ll get to you when we get to you!\"  When he asked how the sequence of who gets seen first worked, she was even ruder. I heard the way she was talking to my husband from the room and nicely asked for our dog's records.  We will be finding a new animal hospital. They acted like they sure don't need out business. Very sad!  I'm sure the doctors won't even know their staff drives away long-time customers. Look elsewhere for good customer service.
