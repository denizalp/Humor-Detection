Union is a nice, small and cozy restaurant that I would recommend. The food was good but nothing amazing. The two items that stood out compared to the others were the Elk Sliders and the Sticky Ribs. \n\nElk Sliders - 4\/5 (Very flavorful and juicy)\nUnion Salad - 3.5\/5 (Pretty plain in my opinion. Was not impressed)\nSteak Tartare - 4\/5 (Good but nothing amazing)\nSticky Ribs - 4\/5 (Very tender and flavorful)\nSide fries - 4\/5 (Reminded me of my childhood when my parents brought me to McDonalds. I might have had more than a couple glasses of wine by this time)\n\nOverall, definitely a good place for a night out!
