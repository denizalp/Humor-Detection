What can I say? MEH.\n\nIt's a diner themed to Indiana.  I'm amazed that they stay in business with that theme, but what the hey.\n\nThe food is normal diner food, good and greasy, I love that old diner feel.  They have that (in my opinion) disgusting biscuits & gravy, which is designed to make Hooiser's the fattest people on earth.  I had bacon and eggs as I'm not Hoosier, I'm just a captive there.\n\nThis place is ok, but I won't go there again.  I was brought here as a joke because I was visiting from Indiana.  There is nothing here that I can't get at 10,000 other places in Phoenix, except high cholesterol.
