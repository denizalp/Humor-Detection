So, let me start this by saying the gym and staff itself are great but the \"contract and payment policy\" really need some work. I joined LVAC 2 years ago June. I knew when I signed up that if I didn't want to go anymore I would have to continue to pay until my contract ran out. I was told when I signed up that when my contract ran out that I CAN opt for a month-to-month basis after that. \n\nThis is what actually happened...My contract ran out in June and on July 1st I got charged for another month. I called LVAC corporate and asked why I got charged again and they said when your contract runs out you AUTOMATICALLY go to a month-to-month basis if you don't cancel your membership. This is not what I was told when I join the club. By what I was told I assumed I was going to have to go in and opt in for month-to-month. I haven't used this club in over a year and they could have very well seen this. They wouldn't even refund my money knowing that I haven't been using the club. Just like any other big company all they want is your money!!!
