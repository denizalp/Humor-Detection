Let's take a minute to discuss wine etiquette. For instance once a wine glass is places on the table before you it should not be touched again by your waiter until it is removed. Also when you order a bottle of wine your server should always be the one to pore your glass. I have to say all of these rules were met perfectly tonight. \n\nI showed up to Andrews hungry and ready for a good meal. They currently have a Valentine's menu and although I'm not a huge seafood fan I still ventured out of my comfort zone and tried their tasting menu. \n\nThe starting course was oysters. Yes to my friends who know my tastes I ate oysters tonight. They consisted of oysters on a half shell with horseradish, lavender and caviar. Not something I would try again.    \n\nThe second course was an endive salad. It was interesting. I felt there was to much vinegar and the cheese was on the bottom of the plate so I was half way threw before I tasted it. The grape on the dish were carbonized which made for a neat pop of flavor. \n\nThe main course was steak and I really enjoyed it. My steak was a bit under cooked. I asked for medium and got rare\/medium rare. The flavors were great though. I loved the parsnips and the sauce that accompanied the steak itself was heavenly. \n\nDessert was fun. I honestly cant tell you everything that was on the plate but if you see the pic the round white ball was orange flavored and I need a thousand of them.  \n\nThis was a good meal. While not great I wouldn't mind coming back and the view of the river was nice as well. Service was perfect and with their extensive wine list I'm sure they have something to fit every pallet.
