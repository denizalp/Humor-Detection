For a first timer in Vegas, I'm glad I stayed at the Vdara. It was quiet enough so that I could get away from all the party and club goers, while also close to the strip so that I could get a taste of the full Vegas experience. \n\nPROS: \n- No smoking and no casino\/club. I hate smelling smoke and Vegas has it EVERYWHERE, except Vdara yay! \n- In the middle of the strip, has a bridge that connects to Bellagio and there's a tram to Aria or you can walk it. Cosmo was walkable as well. For all other destinations, we used Lyft. It was very affordable compared to taxi's. TAKE LYFT.  \n- Helpful concierge and staff. We had talked with them twice. The washer in our room had old water in it, maybe from the previous occupants. It just didn't look clean and I didn't want to use it - told the concierge, they had housekeeping fix it asap.....and on our last day, we decided to do a late check out and they were very accommodating. \n- Spa, pool and gym...however we didn't get to see nor use any. We didn't make the time for them...\n- Electronic window blinds and shades~~\n- Kitchen, washer\/dryer, and hot tub in bathroom~\n- Two sinks in the bathroom, so we didn't have to share or wait when getting ready in the morning.\n- Flat screen tvs in both bedroom and living room. Living room also had a pullout sofa bed.\n- Sliding door that separates bedroom and living room - I liked this alot since my boyfriend snores. I was able to sleep with minimal noise. \n- Very dependable housekeeping. It was in the middle of the day and we had forgotten to push the housekeeping button for them to come clean our room. I had gone back to the room to drop off things at around 1pm and just pushed it...as I was leaving - housekeeping was right outside the door! That was the fastest housekeeping service I've ever experienced. \n\nCONS:\n- Few restaurants\/shopping options. Vdara only has Starbucks, Market Cafe, and Vice Versa. The nearest hotels you'd have to go to are Aria, Cosmo, or Bellagio for more options in food and entertainment. \n- Room temperature was slow to adjust. I'm from Hawaii and anything below 70 is chilly to me. It was around 50s-60s that week and even colder at night, so I would set the temperature to maybe 75-80s before we left in the morning and when we came back at night, it still felt super cold. It wasn't till maybe I felt asleep in the middle of the night or the next day that I would feel the temperature change and get warmer. \n- No kitchen silverware\/utensils readily available, had to request often and room service was slow in bringing them up to us. Maybe because it was late at night\/early morning? My boyfriend didn't want to just put the take-out boxes in the microwave and heat it up. We brought back a lot of leftovers and having no plates\/forks to eat with in that moment we were hungry was somewhat inconvenient. \n- No detergent\/dryer sheets for washer\/dryer, also had to request.\n- Toilet didn't have a door. It was no problem for us, but it wasn't very sanitary nor visually appealing... seeing\/smelling your boyfriend there while you're showering and\/or brushing your teeth...\n- Small trash cans. Maybe Vdara didn't think their guests would use them or have much to throw away but we did. Mainly from the leftover food and other misc things.\n- Super soft pillows (maybe a PRO for those who like them). I had to use 2 and stack them up so that my neck\/back would feel more comfortable. At least the bed was firm.\n- Strange wifi problems with my laptop. I didn't bring this up to the concierge since it didn't seem like a big deal. I had wifi on my other devices (phone, tablet) and so did my boyfriend, it was just that my laptop wasn't able to connect to Vdara's wifi. I tried everything and eventually gave up. What mattered most was that my laptop DID have wifi at McCarran airport when I had to wait about 5hrs for my flight back home. \n\nWe stayed a total of 6 nights in February. Cons were all fairly minor and the pros definitely outweighed them. Check in was a bit longer than expected, but it was all good once we got to our upgraded city corner suite. Our view of the hotels and streets were gorgeous at night with all the lights in the distance. However, I was disappointed that we couldn't get the Bellagio room view though (guess it was pretty booked that week). That would have been perfect. My boyfriend is a fan of Vdara (so am I now), so we might plan to stay here again - maybe next time we'll be more lucky and get that view we want!
