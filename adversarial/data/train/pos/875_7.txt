I've been following the pictures, reviews and success of Duo for quite awhile now. How incredible is it that a gourmet authentic French Patisserie calls Markham of all places home.\n\nUnfortunately, with running Yelp for the entire 905, my bookmark list is of \"places to visit\" is nearly as long as the list of businesses on Yelp itself. And because of that I miss out on visiting a lot of businesses in a timely fashion.\n\nThankfully, but unfortunately, a recent situation on social media came up and I felt it important to pay them a visit at long last to show that I come in peace.\n\nThey have an a-may-zing selection of pastries and cakes, even in the mid afternoon when many have been purchased for the day. I went for a flat white coffee and a pain au chocolate and OMG. The croissant was so flaky that with each bite an outer layer of flakey crust crumbled right off. And unlike many fakers out there, there was MORE than enough delicious chocolate baked into the pastry.\n\nI realize that my order was fairly simple but I'm a firm believer that if you can execute the simple things flawlessly and with attention to detail then theres a good chance you're likely putting the same attention to detail into more complex endeavours.\n\nI'm a fan. I'll be back\n\nEatcrest Out
