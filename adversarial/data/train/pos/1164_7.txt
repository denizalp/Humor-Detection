Underground City of Montreal.  Some say it is the largest in the world.  We did not have enough time to explore this part of downtown Montreal.  It must be very convenient to go down to the Undeground City during the cold, harsh, winter months.\n\nThere are so many shops here.  If you are a shop-o-holic, you will enjoy discovering the shops here.  It is also a great place to exercise.  You can walk for miles here.  There are about 20 miles of walkways here.  These walkways connect complexes both above and below ground.  I read that there are more than 200 restaurants, 1700 shops, and 30 movie theaters in the Underground City.  That is a lot to see and do!!\n\nIt is free to enter the Underground City.  There are more than 120 exterior entrances to access the city, and it is connected to 10 Metro stations.\n\nI look forward to spending more time here during our next trip to Montreal!  Still much to explore and discover here!
