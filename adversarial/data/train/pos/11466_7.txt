Got here at 11AM after a long night at Surrender the night before.  The guy said we had a table in the 'party zone'.  Turns out, his 'party zone' meant the side pool.  The upside to all this was that our table was in the shade and right by the pool, which meant we had a nice hideout from the scorching sun and the sea of people.\n\nWe had a $500 minimum, and ended up spending $1000, not too bad - i just wish i remember drinking all that booze.  What we all DID notice, however, was that it was quite a sausage fest at times, but i guess that's to be found anywhere.\n\nOn added note, a surprise appearance by Tiesto, Jamie Foxx, and Gabrielle Union (the latter two of which most of my group missed) is the topping on the cake. \n\nNot a bad pool to party at - the waitresses provided additional eye candy when the guests just didn't supply.  Drinks were aplenty and delicious (I recall something with lemonade being the best, but please don't take my word for it), and theres nothing better than some 'r&r' by the pool
