Being\/Living from Hawaii one of the traditions is that you have to bring something back for family and friends when you go off island, and since this was a trip to Las Vegas, Trader Joe's is a must visit.\n\nSo you know, buying a ton of this stuff can put your check-in bag well over the limit !!!, lucky for me I was able make some creative adjustments (rather than eat the overage) to assure that the yum-yum made it to there prospective homes.\n\nThe prices are much better than Hawaii, and some of the products are unique to Trader Joe's all together.  They have a wide array of yogurt and chocolate covered items, some I've never even considered, that make fantastic gifts for your family and friends alike.  My girls LOVE the yogurt covered raisins, although they could have just left out the raisin and given me yogurt balls ( I run across the occasional chewed up and spat out raisin on the floor).\n\nVery good experience, friendly staff, not enough sugar free stuff for the nana's in the house though.
