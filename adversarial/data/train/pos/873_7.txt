Yes, it is possible to eat too much Vegas buffet and eat too many pieces of sushi and literally whatever healthy options you can find.\n\nThat's when I decided I needed some good ole fashioned breaky to slow down the good stuff that I had stuffed myself with at the buffet.\n\nHoly mother of all that is holy!!1!  The portions here are astounding!  From the monstrous hot chocolate to the chicken and waffle platter, I felt like a tiny little man in front of these gargantuan plates of \"twisted farm food\".\n\n  On my first trip (to Vegas and HHAGG) I noticed a sign that asked me to tweet my presence at this funky eatery to receive a special surprise.  Special surprise is right, I was given a PBR in a paper sack!  Quite the shift in gears from free cabernet at the roulette table, and might I add, welcomed.  I ordered one of the hashes which was brought promptly in a ten inch cast iron skillet.  \n\n\"Was this heaven?\"\nI had to pinch myself.\n\nSo much for dieting.  \n\nIt was our second trip to Vegas that sealed it for me.  I ordered the scrambles with sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and goat cheese.  This is one of my all time favorites, I will eat sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese on anything, but it felt special mixed into my egg plate that was complete with a biscuit and home fried potatoes.  As a side I had to have their bacon.  The word straight from the owner's mouth was that it comes from a company that has been in business at least a hundred years and was chosen on its merit of being some of the nicest honey cured bacon in the land.  I'm sold.  \n\nDid I mention you could wear one of their flapjacks as a helmet and tie it under your chin?  Yep, they are as big as your fat head.  \n\nHash House a Go Go has hundreds of reviews but I'm fairly certain I am the first to suggest wearing their food as protective gear.  Somebody make a Hash House a Ga Ga reference before I blow a gasket, I am in need of some good jokes.  This restaurant, however, is no joke when it comes to serving hearty portions of delicious breakfast food, and this foody is a slave to the twisted farm food frenzy for life!
