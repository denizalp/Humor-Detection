I spent my days at the CES at the Venitian, and my nights at the Holiday Inn Express in North Las Veags, hows that for Yang and Yin? You can still smoke in the casino and in the hallways downstairs, which is amazing to me, but the rooms are nice in a Las Vegasy old fashioned fake elegant kind of way. I did manage to lock myself in the bathroom of the Harmon suite for a few seconds, (see photo). What's up with pocket doors and funky hardware on four star bathrooms these days?
