Wife and I went to Luke Wholey's the other night for dinner.\nWe saw all the great reviews and decided to give it a shot.\nThe place is pretty big in size and was mobbed.\nWe were seated immediately which was a good sign.\nWaiter brought over water and menus immediately and then came back for drink orders.\nI had the broiled cod with french fries and a french onion soup.\nThe soup was pretty good, but my complaint with it was that it was almost all cheese and very little soup????.\nThe cod was ok nothing to write home about.\nThe service was excellent and the waiter was very friendly.\nThe service was a bit slow, but that was properly do to it being mobbed.\nI would properly go again if it was less crowded and I would try something else.
