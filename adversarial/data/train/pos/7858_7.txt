Great store to shop for fresh organic one of a kind items. Very busy on weekends, try going during the week so you have time to sift through the aisles without shopping carts waiting behind you.\n\nTry the eggplant and roasted red pepper spread-OMG it will be a hit at your next party. Be sure you get the things you want when you see them because they run out  like the diced Pancetta, the Spinach dip and Pink Moscato. \n\nOther Trader Joe fav's are in the snack aisle: Organic Tomatillo and Roasted Yellow Chili Salsa, Roasted Seaweed, Ciabatta, Chocolate Covered anything (cheerios, pretzels, nuts, etc) Gluten Free Chocolate Chip cookies, Yogurt star cookies, Gorgonzola crackers, Sweet chili dipping sauce, Mushroom risotto, Pre-made wraps, Apple Spice bread mix, thai chicken pizza, \"Omega Trek Mix\", etc.  All great  for party snacks. I can't tell you how many times I've been asked, \"where did you get this?  It's fabulous!\"  My response...Trader Joe's!\n\n\"Two-Buck Chuck\" coined after fans for cheap, tasty wines should be part of your repertoire too.  Charles Shaw  wine is a must have and certainly for the value you get a great tasting wine that gives you room to spend on other pricey items. Be sure and go on Friday's for the wine tasting.\n\nAlways looking forward to trying something new when I go, prices are cheaper than Whole Foods and staff is ALWAYS helpful and friendly.
