Disclosure: we're rating this solely based on our one take-out experience of Fish Friday. \n\nWe got an order of walleye with hashbrowns o'brian and salad, and cod with fries and coleslaw to go.\n\nThe fish were excellent, flaky and tender,  with the perfect ratio of batter and fish.  Even after the 20 minutes of getting home,  the fish stayed hot and crunchy. \n\nThe woman at the bar that checked us out wasn't too friendly,  maybe it was because we used a restaurant.com coupon, maybe it was an off day. I'd definitely come back and get take-out fish again.
