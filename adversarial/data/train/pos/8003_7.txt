I may not be an expert in Kushi-Age, but I am an expert in broccoli. And, the fried broccoli at Yu-Yu is a treat for floret fans near and far. I will say that I don't anticipate Yu-Yu becoming part of my regular rotation given its focus on fried foods. However, I do believe it's an experience worth having!\n\nWhen you do have the experience, I recommend sitting at the bar so you can witness the delicate preparation of each fried skewer. (In case you did not know, kushi-age are skewers of fried food, including everything from broccoli to smelt.) I think the process is art-like in its attention to detail. \n\nWhen we visited, I ordered a variety of veggie offerings from avocado to zucchini, and I thought they were all delicious, especially when dipped in the curry salt they provide. I will say that the breading was not perfect, as it fell completely off my zucchini and could have had a bit more crunch, but those were minor issues. \n\nI also ordered the tonjiru (pork broth soup), and save the gelatinous cubes, I highly recommend this. (It comes with several of the specials.) It is a hearty, winter stew with carrots and other root vegetables. It is slightly salty, but still perfect for a chilly day.\n\nNote: there are no refills on iced tea, which disappointed me because it is a delicious, roasted green tea. \n\nAside from the food, the service was attentive and quick, and it is one of the most serene restaurant environments I have experienced. I felt very, very calm eating my fried food.\n\nOverall, a unique dining experience that includes worthwhile eats. I would definitely bring a friend, a date or a visiting family member!
