I recently moved to the area and have been \"investigating\" the many bakeries nearby. I've found some excellent pastries and cakes, but so far no exceptional cookies. So I was really happy when I saw what, from a distance, appeared to be a thick chocolate cookie on display at BakeryHaus. \n\nI suppose I should have been leery when the woman behind the counter claimed that their \"Original Cronut\" was indeed THE original. When I pointed out that the Cronut(TM) was developed in NY, she then rather reluctantly said that it was \"based on the same recipe.\"\n\nOr maybe I should have lowered my expectations when she couldn't accurately explain what a petit four was, and got a little terse when my partner continued to question her. But the other person working the cash register was so friendly and eager, I still wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nSadly, that was my mistake. \n\nInstead of taking the delicious-looking cookie from the front of the display, the woman picked up something I couldn't see and placed it in a bag. It felt hard when I took it, but chewiness is not an absolute requirement for a good cookie. So I paid my money, left a small tip, and departed with my purchase. \n\nNow as you can see, I don't post many reviews, but I was so disappointed by my purchase that I wanted to make sure others don't have the same experience. \n\nThe cookie I removed from the bag was not just hard, it was flat-out burnt. I've had softer biscotti!  You could even see and taste the charring. \n\nBakeryHaus had no excuse selling that cookie without some disclaimer (eg, BURNT COOKIES -- HALF PRICE!). I think the fact that it was quite different from the one on display says a lot.\n\nI see that they've had some very good reviews from others, so maybe they were just having an \"off\" day today. But given the selection of much better bakeries in the neighbourhood, I think I'll skip them in the future.
