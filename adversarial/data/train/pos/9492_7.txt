This is pretty much the best Cleveland has to offer in terms of clubs at the moment. Sums up the city's ability to entertain nicely.\n\nPROS: Watching women fall off the bull is fun... some of the time. Mostly you'll be watching a 40+ year old manatee thrash around on the ground while chunks of anatomy flop out much to the disgust of all whilst her friends cackle with delight from the sidelines.\n\nCONS: Incompetent bartenders, horrendously bad DJs who play the worst of the worst music out right now and remix it so it's even worse than the crap you heard on the radio, unattractive women, dirty and constantly crowded surroundings... well you get the point it's just plain bad all around. No redeeming qualities whatsoever.\n\nI'd only go back if I got wasted beforehand.
