While I like the look of this place I'd say in my opinion I'd come more for a couple drinks as opposed to for great food.  Both times I've eaten here I've left underwhelmed.  \n\nThe menu was limited, portions were on the smaller side, bbq lacked flavor and the water tasted like it was straight from the sink.  The sausage was good and flavorful but the brisket not so much.  Also dissapointing was that I wanted to ask for salt and pepper but waiter didn't check on us until we were already done with our meals.
