I purchased a groupon last year for a facial.   I was encouraged to purchase the VIP program for 79.00, which I did.  When I got home, I noticed on my receipt that the membership would be auto-renewed in 1 year.   I emailed and phoned to advise that this was never discussed with me, and that I did not approve any charge on my card the next year.  I made it clear I did not want to participate again . Today, I received an email that an attempt to charge my card the 79.00 for the renewal was made.   Fortunately, the card had been replaced as I had lost my old one, so the unauthorized purchase did not go through.  I had made it clear I was not going to purchase a membership again this year.    What was done by The International Skin Care Institute is unethical.     This is a serious offense- not just dissatisfaction with service.   Please think twice before they try to take advantage of you.
