@LBSBURGER at Red Rock Casino #Vegas #nom good!!!\n\nWith the Saloon style atmosphere and casual dress its a VERY cool Vibe just missing the peanut shells on the floor and the Live band!!\n\nMy waiter looked like Seth Rogen!! The Service was outstanding-fast & friendly with flair:) The food was Great too. I ordered a Burger and some Potato Twists as you can see from the Photos  it was OUTSTANDING!! One of the BEST tasting burgers I have had and well worth the drive + price tag plus if your up for a challenge they have ONE of the BIGGEST and BADDEST in Town.\n\n I had the  STEAKHOUSE BURGER $13.00\nPEPPERCORN CRUSTED BEEF + GRILLED WILD MUSHROOM\nSWISS CHEESE + OVEN ROASTED TOMATO + MIX GREENS\nRED ONION MARMALADE + HORSERADISH-STEAK SAUCE#nom #soGood
