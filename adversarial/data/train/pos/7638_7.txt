Came here for Happy Hour last night. I've actually eaten at this restaurant 3 times before so my review will touch on all those visits combined.\nLooking at the happy hour....a limited selection of bar foods all at $10. I didn't order any but the group I was with did, most selecting the BBQ beef sliders. That looked like a decent value. Ahi tuna tacos looked small. I had 2 bloody marys at $8 each. \nI haven't ever been a fan of their food, on 3 visits it just wasn't that good or spectacular considering the price. My last steak here was over 2 years ago so things change, go with the more recent reviews.\nIt is a beautiful restaurant with a great outdoor patio seating area\/bar and some tables outside for dining as well. i love the ambiance and location. Service for happy hour was pretty good, only one waitress but she did a great job!
