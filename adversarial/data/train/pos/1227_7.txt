I came after being told this establishment had received \"Best New Brewery in the World\". Let me tell you, it must have been a god awful year for breweries. I had the IPA and the Danish Redneck. They were exceptionally mediocre. My companions ordered Gibraltar Goss (Grapefruit), it tasted like nachos. Shit you not. How in the holy hell does a grapefruit beer taste like nachos? That is some ungodly evil brewmaster dealings. A random man wandering the woods could pillage the ingredients to make better beers than this overhyped atrocity.
