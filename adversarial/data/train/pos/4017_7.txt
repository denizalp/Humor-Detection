I never quite know what to do with a place like this. \n\nDo you give them a star because they've got a computer with free internet access, or do you take one away because it's glacier-slow and chronically crashes? \n\nDo you give them a star because they've got decent rooms for a fraction of what you'd pay at other places nearby, or do you take one away because ... well, because you get what you pay for? \n\nThere's an air conditioner, but it's loud and it's a window unit, thus blocking what little light you'd get from the adjacent alley. There's a shower -- and it's clean! -- but the hot\/cold control is either broken or just finicky enough that it's virtually impossible to control the temperature. Almost every floor in the building seems to tilt ever-so-slightly. \n\nPonder that one for a minute.
