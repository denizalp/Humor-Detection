Mekong Plaza does not disappoint! When I arrived in Phoenix three years ago, I met Sam M. at Lee Lee's International Supermarket. In our conversation about must-go places, he referred me to Mekong Plaza. However because of distance, I kept putting the visit off.\n\nThank you, Karen W. for bringing me to this fabulous back to Asia experience. The shops, the diverse cultures, wafting smells of street food magically come together at Mekong Plaza. On the outside, I was excited to see a Thai Foot Massage Place. When I walked in, I was greeted with sights, sounds and smells of dim sum (Mekong Palace). We came to eat at Heng's Kitchen, but I was drawn to the Banh Mi shop, there was pho to try, my stomach and eyes were greedy, but I knew I absolutely could not take everything in. Mesa residents, can I express how jealous I am that you have access to such a delicious Mecca? I also saw the Boba tea shop, which I also noticed that Karen W. was sipping on while she waited for me to arrive. \n\nNeedless to say, I need to plan another trip to Mesa, sooner than later.
