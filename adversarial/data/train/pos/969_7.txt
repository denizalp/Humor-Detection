I now have been at La Privada for two years in April and I still can't say enough about the new management. They have followed through with everything they said they were going to do. They did a beautiful amazing job on the clubhouse which I don't believe had been updated in 20 years. The pool is next with new furniture and refinishing of the pool. My experience here with the maintenance has been spot on. Considering what they had to deal with from the past management they've done a remarkable job so far. The new crew lead by Brandi are wonderful. \n\n\n\n\nI have been living at La Privada for the past 11 months. About three months ago a new management team came in and really had to deal with big issues. They dove in and all they asked of us tenants is patience. They have done everything they promised and more. I'm so happy to be here and can't wait for further improvements. The pool, the clubhouse are going to updated starting this April. And they have added get togethers for our La Privada community.
