Music, lights, crowds, performers, zip-line, skin, booze, and sweat.  \nThis place is jumpin' on Friday nights.\nPrepare for sensory overload. Music from 3 stages spanning a few blocks.  The street was filled with drunk tourists and hustlers.  Bring your own crew and have a good time.  \nNot a great place for kids unless they like 2nd hand smoke, crass language, and 3\/4 naked bodies.  \nWatch out for flooded streets on a rainy night.
