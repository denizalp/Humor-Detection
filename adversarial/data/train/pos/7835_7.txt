If I was as slow and neglectful at my job as our server was last night, many people would have been dead by now for sure. It took him forever to sit us at the table even though we were willing to go to the bar ( that was strongly discouraged), so we were wandering around the place in a scattered pattern of a lost herd of hungry cows for ten minutes at least.\nAfter our server learned that only one of us will be eating and the rest will only have drinks, he completely lost interest in our group and vanished. Literally fell out of this planet having promised us all kinds of good things like an ashtray, drinks and food. \nThen he came back with a poison - the worst Moscow mule I ever had in my life. And I would have loved to send it back but alas, he said :\" I'll be right back\", and disappeared again like April sun in Cleveland.\n By the time an ashtray arrived, my friend finished two cigarettes (she had it instead of the appetizer) and I gulped the remainder of my drink that tasted like Lysol. \nAs a person who actually recommended the place to my friends, I felt incredibly guilty. I generously tipped the waiter hoping that my five bucks will be a downpayment for never seeing him again in case I ever decide to come back.
