*Zoomline- Super Hero Style review*\n\nI reserved Slotzilla online for the higher line \"Zoomline- Super hero style\". It's best to reserve online because slots fill up very fast. The higher Zoomline was completely sold out during my visit.The lower zipline had more spaces available. If you reserve online, show your receipt to the Slotzilla store to get a wristband for entry. Your belonging are put in a bag and attached to zipline with you. It was a cool and fun experience ziplining down Fremont Street Experience like \"Superman\". I was very nervous but it was a smooth thrilling ride IMO.I paid extra to wear a GOPRO helmet, so I could document my experience. Pictures and GOPRO video can be purchased after ride. The staff was professional and down to earth. I had a fun time flying on Slotzilla. RESERVE online ahead of time for the higher Zoomline!  *There are height and weight requirements, so check the website.* If you're looing for something fun to do in Vegas, SlotZilla is a good choice. I give SlotZilla a 4.5 rating.
