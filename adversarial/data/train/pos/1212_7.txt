When you walk in, DJ's looks like a real NY style bagel shop. They've got the boar's head meats, the assortment of salads (macaroni, cucumber, potato, chicken, pasta, etc.). I was a little concerned when looking at the bagels displayed in the baskets against the back wall though. \n\nI ordered an everything bagel with turkey, cheese, and scallion\/chive cream cheese. They do have multiple options for turkey (cracked pepper, oven roasted, hickory smoked, and something else). I went with the oven roasted. They offered me a side and I'm assuming it's because I got a lunch type of bagel. Therefore, I ordered macaroni salad. After checking out, if ordering in, you sit down and they bring your food to you. \n\nExecution of the actual bagel itself was lacking. This validated my previous concerns. The bagel was softer and less chewy than what you would get in NY. On the sandwich itself, the turkey was piled on, which I appreciated, but there was hardly any cream cheese. I guess they thought they could skimp on the cream cheese since they used so much turkey. Also, all of the \"everything\" toppings had fallen off, or there hadn't been many put on in the first place. I will say that the macaroni salad was on point.
