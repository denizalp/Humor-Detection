I'm giving this only two stars because my review is somewhat relative to the price.\nSome aspects of the service were slow but it seemed to be a problem at the bar. (too much employee chatter, not enough work)  Our waiter was fine.  I ordered one of the steak specials which at $52 for about 6 ounces of meat was fairly pricey.  It was delicious but with 2 drinks and a tip it was nearing $100.  It wasn't *that* good.   There are a few other places I can think of that are equally good for less and as my every experience at Red Rock is that they are \"strip\" and not \"locals\"... I guess inflated prices go with it.
