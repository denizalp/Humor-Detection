I went here recently with a friend because we had purchased a LivingSocial Deal online.  It was $39 for a 30 min body heat wrap and your choice of a 60 min Swedish Massage or a 90 min Aromatherapy or 90 min Hot Stone Massage.\nWe made our appointment about a week and half in advance, no problem.\nWe showed up to our appointment and no one was there.  I mean there wasn't anyone in the spa at all.  I walked around looking for someone and then decided to call the spa to see if someone would answer,\nThey did answer and came back to the spa (I'm not sure where they had been, but not far)\nThe girl at the desk was unaware of our standing appointment but was able to accommodate us anyways.\nI asked for a hot stone massage 90 min and the girl told me the massage was 60 min and heat wrap 30 min for a total of 1.5 hours.  This is not what the deal said and I had it in my hand to show her.\nThere was a bit of language issue with her and I so I decided to just drop it and start my massage.  Then she informs me that the hot stone massage is an additional $10 charge.  There was no mention of this on the website or on my print out.  \nSo needless to say I was pretty annoyed by this time but just wanted to start my massage and relax.\nThe lady who massaged me was very nice and did a pretty descent massage.  My only critique was that she was very fast and it was not slow and relaxing.  It felt like she was rushing a little (my friend said the same thing about her massage) but overall a satisfactory massage.\nThe girl at the front desk came in during my massage to talk to the lady who was massaging me and they started chatting for a couple moments which was annoying.\nI usually go to RMT type clinics so maybe this is all normal for this type of spa but it wasn't for me.\nI won't be back and it wasn't worth the money (even though it was a deal).
