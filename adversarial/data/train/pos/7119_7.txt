The Clever Koi was a point of contention between my husband and I... you see, he knew I wanted to try it for a really long time, and he actually had the audacity to go there without me one night with friends.  How dare he!\n\nI'm kidding... kind of.  I really was wanting to check out The Clever Koi since they first opened, and Jared really did go there without me, knowing damn well that I wanted to go.  But, he made up for it and took me there on a date a few weeks later... and then I went there with some work colleagues (without Jared) just the other night as well.  \n\nSo, I'm now two visits down with many more to go... TCK's menu changed slightly between my visits, but I enjoyed everything I had.  Service was attentive, food - creative, tasty and filling.  There is something for everyone on the drink list.  There is indoor and outdoor seating. The ambiance is casual and comfortable and not too loud.\n\nHighlights on the current menu in my eyes are:\n-Wood Grilled Octopus\n-Summer Corn Gyoza\n-Massaman Curry Noodles\n-Summer Corn Ramen Noodles\n\nI highly recommend sharing \/ family style if you go with adventurous eaters... it's fun to taste a bunch of different things!  Kudos to the guys behind this place... crafty, clever, and keeping things fresh.  TCK is worth a visit (or several)!
