Usually restaurants with pretentious names that invoke a fire-breathing dragon and some expensive gem turn me off... Dragons and pearls allude to luxury in the Chinese culture, and I find that most of the \"Dragon\" restaurants that I've been to (Dragon Boat Fusion Cuisine, Dragon Dynasty) have been a let-down.  I avoid buffets in general because you sacrifice quality for quantity.  \n\nThe decor is extremely elaborate and you can tell that they did not spare a dime when it came to creating an eye-catching ambiance.  When I went to Spice Route I thought the decor was amazing, but Dragon Pearl has just upped the ante.  \n\nThe hostess who greeted us inquired as to whether this was our first time, and when we said yes, we were given a brief tour with specific attention given to the \"Pearl\" which is a giant sesame ball, as well as the Single Strand Noodles.  \n\nAlthough the buffet selection is not as extensive as say, the Mandarin, the items that were offered were of good quality.  \n\nThings I recommend:\nShrimp Dumpling:  Dim-sum-grade!\n\nBeef Brisket - It ain't no Schwartz's but it was pretty good!  Probably of the meats I ate tonight, this was cooked to perfection.\n\nSalmon Teriyaki - From looking at the platter, I could tell that there were inconsistencies.  Some of the salmon pieces were cooked to perfection, while others were overcooked.  Just observe carefully and pick the right piece.  It was quite flavourful without being too sweet.\n\nGrilled Calamari - Had a nice char to it.  Yummy!\n\nCalamari Salad - Not something that I've seen at a buffet before.  Its served cold, but its good!\n\nBanana\/Cheese Salad - Topped with caramelized pecans and strawberries.  \n\nLettuce Wraps - A refreshing dish with a nice crunch from the lettuce.\n\nSweet Potato Cake - Made with glutinous rice and very yummy!\n\nPan-Fried Dumplings - A little bit on the oily side, but the dumpling wrapper was really nice and the filling was savory.\n\nSweet & Sour Pork - The batter is really nice.\n\nGrilled Pineapple - Need I say more?\n\nMussels in Black Bean Sauce - I am drooling just thinking about it.\n\nGarlic Bok-Choy Stir-Fry - A very flavourful vegetable to give your tummy a break!\n\nOther things I recommend without going into full detail are: \nBeef Stir-Fry, Wakame Salad, Salmon & Butter Fish Sashimi (pretty good quality for an AYCE), green tea ice cream and tiramisu.  The fruits weren't the freshest (specifically the strawberries), but the oranges were sweet!\n\nFish Fillet in Thai Sauce - The fish was really moist and juicy.  Mmmm...\n\nThings you can skip:\n\nPeking Duck - Crepe was thicker than I'd like.  The duck was dry.  The scallions were not fresh. Skip.\n\nHoney Short-Ribs:  Skip, wayyyyyyy too sweet and the meat was not tender\n\nPad Thai - Only dominant flavor is SWEET! Eek!\n\nMango Ice Cream - Very artificial tasting, yuck!\n\nThe service here is top notch.  Our plates were taken away whenever we left the table, our water glasses topped up when running low, but never empty, extra napkins were provided.  We also got a pot of Green Tea, and when I saw that they were serving it up in glass cups, I thought I was going to burn my lip\/hands off.  Nope.  It is a double insulated glass cup, so the cup is cool to the touch.  The nerd in me found that to be super cool!  I deduct 1 point for the fact that they weren't serving lobster tonight.\n\nThe night ends with a hot towel for you to wipe your hands and the fortune cookie that you get with your bill is one of the best I've had... Made in Chicago?  \n\nPrices are comparable to the Mandarin but there is just no comparison or debate - Dragon Pearl reigns supreme!
