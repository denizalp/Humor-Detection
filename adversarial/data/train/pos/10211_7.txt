Got in at 830 tonight, because Chili's was a complete nightmare. The hostess gladly sat our starving party.\n\nSitting, waiting. No one acknowledged us. \n\nFinally, the bartender came and took our drink AND food order. 3 waters, a sprite, and a margarita.\n\nHe was a dick.\n Cocky as hell. \nDidnt have a note pad... didnt write down our order.... he did it all from memory... uh, dude... if youre going to do that... make sure you get the order actually RIGHT.\n\nWe ordered my daughter a grilled cheese, which thankfully came out quickly.\n\n22, ---- yes twenty two---- minutes after being seated, we got our water. \n\n45 minutes after being seated, i got my Margarita. Yep. Our food came before my beverage.... and the bar was 5 feet away from us. \n\nThe food was decent. But the service just sucked. \n\nI ordered a cowboy burger..... \ni was brought out a fajita burger. \n\nWe ordered wings with buffalo sauce on the side.\nWings come, no sauce.\nHad to ask 2 different people for buffalo sauce. \n\nIf the staff wasn't so shitty, thisnplace would be great.
