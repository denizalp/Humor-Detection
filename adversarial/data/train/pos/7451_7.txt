You get what you get at the Free Zone. I have lived in Las Vegas on and off for over 10 years and can count on one hand how many times that I've actually been. Twice! That's it. Not really my scene per say but I had friends visiting from out of town and they were very interested in club hopping at all of the bars in the \"Fruit Loop\" area. We arrived last weekend on a Friday night and to our surprise it wasn't as packed as we expected. \n\nPiranha, which is directly across the street was our first stop and they of course were super packed. With wanting to take a break we ended up here and decided to have a few drinks. The bartenders here are very friendly and we appreciated the level of service from the other employees who walk around offering shots. One of the cool things is that they do offer drink specials and the pours that the bartenders give here are awesome! Drinks are fairly priced and the music was good! What else can you ask for out of a bar? We stayed a sufficient amount of time to get buzzed, dance a little vibe out the scene and exit! Will I be back anytime soon? Maybe not but definitely in the future :-)
