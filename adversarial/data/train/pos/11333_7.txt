I have locked myself out of my car three times before and the first time I used AAA, the second time, I didn't have AAA  so I searched on Yelp to look up a locksmith with good reviews because I find yelp to be pretty reliable. Well it was pretty late at night and I called 911 locksmith because not only did they have good reviews, but their office was super nearby. Now, my mom had my birthday cake in the car so obviously it was urgent to get the car open. Someone from 911 Locksmith got to my house in about 10 minutes and got the door open in about 3. Great service, fast, I was very happy. Fast forward to today: I went to Target and didn't realize I had locked myself out of my car until I tried to head back home. UGH! Super frustrating! I remembered 911 locksmith because I had luckily saved the number in my contacts and in no more than 15 minutes someone had arrived and was working on getting my door open. I made small talk with the nice gentleman trying to open my car and wouldn't you know he was the same guy that helped me the first time and he even recognized me from that one  time almost 7 months ago!! Pete was very nice, came to my rescue right away and even told me to say hello to my mom and dad for him haha. Thanks Pete!!
