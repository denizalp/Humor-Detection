In the dawn of such places as Electric Mud BBQ, I can see how this place isn't the \"coolest\" place in Toronto, and I couldn't care less. The BBQ here is better. Full stop.\n\nHay-uge portions! Each side is a meal, and if you're starving you can get mixed platters for only $20. The smoked chicken, baked beans and 'slaw were what I was all about, and I look forward to returning for their ribs and Monday night wing night! Be sure to wash whatever your pleasure is down with a bourbon Caesar. \n\nPEPPER'S PISSED: It isn't just the sauces that'll stick to your clothes. The smokiness of this joint lingers in fabrics, so be prepared to have dogs follow you home.
