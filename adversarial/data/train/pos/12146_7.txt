For me, this was Vegas Baby!! I really loved the whole look, feel, and comfort of The Chandelier. It was classy, but not stuffy! Of course you had your slot machines around, but there were no tv's in the bar which made it that much more perfect!!:) Of all the casino bars, this one you could actually have a conversation with someone and hear every word they were saying while enjoying the luxury around you and the sparkling of the grand chandelier.... There are bars for every taste, and fancy! Gotta love Vegas!
