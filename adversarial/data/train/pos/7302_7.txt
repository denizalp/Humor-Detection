I normally do not leave one star reviews, however I was in this location yesterday for lunch and ordered the rainbow trout almondine. I chose it because it was the chefs special. It was terribly overcooked and the sauce was far too sweet. This should be a firm and flaky type of fish. I usually catch, clean and cook my own. This piece of fish was mushy and had no flavor. I took 3 bites and did not eat the rest THANK GOD. This was the only meal I had eaten yesterday. At about noon today I had the worst stomach cramps and issues that I don't want to get into detail over - food poisoning. I called to speak to the manager and she was conveniently \"on the phone with a customer\" the lady who answered the phone did not offer to take my number for her to call me back.\n\nDo not eat the fish here guys- it's not worth trying to work and run to the bathroom every 20 minutes. \n\nNeedless to say I will not be returning and I will be letting everyone I know about how sick this food made me.
