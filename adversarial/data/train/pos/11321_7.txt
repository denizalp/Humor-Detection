Not too sure why everybody seems to complain about this hotel. In all honesty it wasn't bad at all except for the foul smell of cigarette and wet dog in the casino.\n\nWe stayed for 4 days and arrived at 6 in the morning. Although the earliest check-in is allowed at 8am, the bell desk was able to store our luggage until a room opened up for us. So while we waited we decided to hang out in the casino. Of course its an older hotel and the carpet is stained with the smells of cigarettes but towards the exit\/entrance to slots-of-fun the room smelt like a foul fart that pickled and didn't air out.\n\nAnyways, 8am came so we decided to check in, although there was a $10 early check in fee we didn't care that fee was dirt cheap to get into our room 7 hours earlier than normal check in time, we got a nice non-smoking room in the tower above the lobby which was nice. A King-Sized bed and the bathroom toiletries were stocked and fresh.\n\nThe only downside of the room was that we could hear our neighbors flush the toilet. \n\nThere is a great cheap breakfast buffet downstairs and the boyfriend enjoined the Krispy Kreme stand. We did get lost somewhere between the adventure dome and the midway but it was totally fun and worth it to play something else besides slots and enjoy a few free performances from circus acts.\n\nThis Hotel was totally convenient and worth the price. Plus being in Vegas you aren't supposed to spend you whole day in your hotel room, you are supposed to gallivant and explore the strip and what not so it was perfect for us.
