Did you know Celine Dion got married here? Yeah, well you're welcome. And if you didn't know, someone will tell you and then you'll overhear someone else talking about it.\n\nBut there are other reasons you should visit. It's truly a beautiful church. The altar backdrop alone is worth gawking at. The blue, purple and fuschia lights are colors I haven't seen in a church. The winding ornate staircase on one side of the church is another reason to visit and how about that immense organ in the back of the church? Uh yeah, go check it out.\n\nAdmission is indeed $5 (CASH ONLY - they accept USD), so just skip that Starbucks latte and get yourself inside the church. Good news is they give you a 20 min tour describing the church's history and background.
