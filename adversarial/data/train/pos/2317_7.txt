What a travesty that many will never have the dining experience of Rosewood Grille since the restaurant is now closed.\n\nI was lucky enough to have visited Rosewood Grille last July, and let me tell you, this place did not disappoint in food and most certainly not in service.\n\nService was impeccable.  Even though this was a fine dining institution and the waitstaff was dressed to the nine, this didn't mean you had to be, and you would still be treated like royalty.  Simone, John, and Jose were like long lost friends - they were jolly, patient, and knowledgeable.  And just thinking about all the food induces salavation.  We ordered the calamari, crab cakes, steak, and two 4lb lobsters, one boiled and one, per Simone's recommendation, broiled, was simply delicious, mouth watering, finger licking delicious.\n\nThe meal definitely cost a pretty penny (thanks J & Y for treating!!), but it was well deserved.  What a shame that the downtrending economy led to the downfall of Rosewood Grille.  You shall be sorely missed.
