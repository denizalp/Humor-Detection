I've been a MEC devotee for over a decade, and while they're not always the best price on the block they're assuredly the best everything else outdoorsy!\n\nI've been toting the same backpack and ruck for twelve years -- it's been all over Europe with me, through storms, a flood, a fire (thankfully untouched by flames!), kicked, dropped, peed in by cats(!!!), flown to Spain when I was in England, and used to strap and haul an air conditioner up to the fourth floor balcony of a walk-up.\n\nIt regularly carries groceries, laundry, parcels, soil, and, on one occasion, my friend's three year old.  It has never burst a seam, stripped a zipper, sprung a leak, or bent the frame.  It's starting to show a bit of wear inside, but the outside looks as good as new (when it's clean).  Awesome!\n\nIn short, this bag is the proverbial shit (perhaps Proverbs 14:4, but I *might* be wrong on that one).\n\nOutside of the world's greatest backpack, I've rocked GoreTex rainbreakers (stolen! blech!), runners packs (lost somewhere in Belgium!), shoes, sandals, and more.  \n\nCustomer service is ace, perks are primo, and they even have a climbing wall for you to get your Spiderman on.  Add to all this they're an actual, honest-to-goodness co-op.  Sweet adulation!\n\nOh, MEC, I love you so!
