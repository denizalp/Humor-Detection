King's Fish House is a solid bar option that's located in The District @ Green Valley Ranch!  Happy Hour has multiple drink options, for which I strongly recommend the Jalape√±o Margaritas, and great food values as well!  The Ahi Tuna rolls are fantastic, as well as the spicy wings, edamame, and the bar fries!  King's is certainly somewhere I'd return to try entrees from the large seafood options!
