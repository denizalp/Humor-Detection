We usually love coming here for their chicken wings. Despite the long wait for the chicken to be made, I never really had an issue with this place until our last encounter. \n\nWe ordered to go a 16 piece chicken wings combo. Without looking inside our to go box of chicken we drove home. We opened it and found little chicken wings the size of our fingers. I never seen anything like it before. It was like they used a baby chick.\n\nSo we called them. The lady answered and knew automatically who she was talking to when my beau said, \"why did you Give us chicken like this.\" They lady replied with, \"we're closing in 5 days so that's all the chicken we had so we had to \"use it all up\"..\" What does that even mean? Does that mean that this chicken has been sitting in a freezer for days or weeks waiting to be cooked? There's 5 days until you close, so does that mean you're just going to use old chicken? I was very confused and disturbed.  We ended up not eating the chicken.\n\nBut moral of the story is.. Always check your food before you leave the place where you got it from.
