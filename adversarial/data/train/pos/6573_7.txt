Ok  food, horrible service.\n\nAnd 3 strikes you're out..went in for breakfast giving it a 3rd chance since the place is close to home. Asked for extra crispy potatoes..received cold soggy ones. The waitress( think she was the bartender actually) apologized and brought some out that we're at least hot but still a bit soft. They forgot the toast and I waited 20 minutes for toast to eat with my dry frittata. Finally the waitress came back and asked if my toast was brought out. After I told her it hadn't and that the rest of my food was now cold, she said she would bring out a whole new order and brought me another cocktail that was \"on her\". I appreciated her efforts and she was pretty cool. I don't think the service was her fault but this place will never get my business again.\n\n***I was brought a fresh plate of food that was cooked much better and with toast. Bartender is awesome but still not going back.
