The food is bad but the service is even worse. We've been before with Groupons and weren't ever super impressed but it's always been cheap and fast so we'd go back now and again. The place has hit rock bottom recently though. We went in for lunch at noon on a Saturday and found the restaurant completely empty. We decided to sit outside since the weather was so beautiful. The female employee that greeted us (she was outside playing on her phone and rushed inside behind us) told us to sit anywhere and she'd come take our order. \n\nWe took our menus and sat at the rickety picnic table on the patio. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. Eventually, Ted went inside to try to place our order. He found the waitress on her phone - she stopped talking long enough to tell him, \"Go back to your table. I'm a waitress. I'll come take your order.\" We should have just left then. Instead, we waited outside until she came out for our order. This was the point I noticed that she had a hole in the crotch of her yoga pants and no, she wasn't wearing any underwear. Again, why we didn't leave then is beyond me. \n\nWe ordered a rack of ribs, a whole chicken, and collard greens. (There were 4 of us, btw.) About 5-10 minutes after ordering, she came out to tell us that there was a half a rack of ribs available immediately. When we indicated that we'd wait for the full rack, she coped one of the worst attitudes I've ever experienced from a waiter or waitress and told us, \"Well, you'll be waiting over 3-hours then,\" and stormed inside. FINALLY having enough (3 strikes and you're out?), we got up and left. I'll never be back. \n\nI only hope they go out of business sooner rather than later so a quality spot can move in to their prime real estate in Pecan Pointe!
