I was surprised to see a lot of people from the coasts raving about it. I would have expected people who are not from fly-over states to be disappointed as i was.\n\n1.If you think this is a high end upscale restaurant - don't come here. The atmosphere is of a mediocre sushi bar, even the bathrooms are not very clean. The staff is ok, but for what you are paying (i'll get to it) you deserve a lot more. It is noisy, small (and not in the good way) and basically every shmuck who walks in the MGM grand (should have been the first warning sign to me) can see you eat.\n\n2.If you know and value your food - don't come here. I value good food whether it is in a hole in a wall or a 3 star michelin restaurant.The food here is major meh. Sure the langoustines here are from the atlantic and they are not bad, but 60$ for 3 of them? give me a break. I had to return their \"signature\" dish - the quail stuffed with foie gras. It was bland and very meh. Meh is how I would describe this place.\nNow usually it's hard to get it wrong with the desserts. I understand why people would wow over the framboise that melts into itself, but we had 3 desserts and there is a chance the Cinnabon across the hall is a better use for your money\n\n3. If you value your money - don't come here.\nThe prices are ridiculous -60 and 70$ for main dishes and 50-60 for starters , 15$ for a dessert. And what do you get ? Sure seeing the staff at work is nice but.. the atmosphere is like a noisy street sushi bar. For 130$ per person before drinks and all, i can go to daniel in nyc (3 stars, not one), sit like a king and have the entire french experience.\nThe food? not amazing, especially not worth the ridiculous prices you pay for it.\n\nThe service? nice, but not worth-the-price nice.\n\nIf you value food, money or atmosphere - don't come here - all the rednecks around you that take the tasting menu + wine pairing (that is 260 a pop) will just make you go WTF.
