VEGANS AND VEGETARIANS BEWARE! My pregnant girlfriend and I called ahead to see if there was any Soups we could eat and the person on the phone told me that there was a Minestrone. Turns out someone mixed some old meaty chili with the So Called Vegan Minestrone and I wish I was the one that tasted it instead of my girlfriend. She got sick afterwards and all they gave us was two complimentary meal tickets. Ugggh. As if i'm going back now. Very unprofessional. Obviously knowing what' vegan' is isn't something you have to know to work there.
