Amazing! Ephraim was professional and polite. He did an amazing job on our carpets and chairs. We had agreed on a start time and he kept in contact with us because he was stuck in traffic. I really appreciated the fact he didn't just leave me hanging and let me know what was going on.\n\nHis work was impeccable. He was thoroigh, informative and accomodating. \n\nI highly recommend this company!
