Part of me knew this before I took my first bite but, this just doesn't live up to the hype.  I mean, nothing really could live up to the hype built around this place! To be fair, it is great pizza.  I just isn't \"the best pizza\".  There are numerous places in San Francisco that would beat this one out.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, at noonish on a Sunday, we were surprised to see it half empty.  I was also surprised to be cheerfully greeted by Chef Chris himself!  For how slow the restaurant was, our table service was also slow.  We did get some yummy olives to eat while we waited, nice touch.\n\nOur favorite pizzas were the sausage and the red onion\/pistachio (I forget the names).  I would actually skip the famous margarita, I didn't think the flavor of the cheese or the sauce really shined through.\n\nI think if I went back I would try one of their pasta dishes.  They serve a small entree menu, in addition to the pizzas, at this location.
