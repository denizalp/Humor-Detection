I like that its more low-key than its neighbor #1.  Younger crowd...less douchy power lunch types that yap the whole time about mergers and their Audi payment.  The Pho I like better but #1 has that awesome barbeque beef dish with the dipping sauce.  The spring rolls are better than any ive had in Cleveland too!  No beer or this place would have 5 stizzars!
