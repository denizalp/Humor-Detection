Stumbled upon this place while initially driving to the now-closed Fresh Cup. Now it's on of my favorite Chinese restaurants and I've been thinking about their pan fried noodles all week! Their Shanghai dumplings fulfill my soup dumpling cravings. Their menu is so large, I doubt I'll ever get to sampling everything. They do have a small \"tapas\" menu. Their salt and pepper shrimp tapas portion is enough for two people, but I think I prefer the salt and pepper shrimp batter from Big Wong better. I didn't care much for the rib eye bao buns, but my husband really liked them. The side salad that came along with the plate was really good and reminded me of something from Cafe Zupas. Can't wait to go back and try the other recommendations Yelpers have for this restaurant!
