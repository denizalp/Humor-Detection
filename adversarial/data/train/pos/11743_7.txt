I was here after 6:30 pm on Friday to hang out for dinner and a drink after a long day at work. I sat at the bar - where the nice bartender named ? Chris ? made me what he said was a more orignial version of a \"sex on the beach\". It was good, and I drank it quickly before ordering the half off appetizer \"guacamole\". When it came out, it was probably more than I should have eaten alone, but it was REALLY tasty and much better than most places who dont know how to make a good guac.\n\nNext I ordered my usual, a Madris. Since this was happy hour - my drinks were super cheap too - but I dont know the exact price. I came in there to order the Enchiladas Del Mar - but after my guacamole appetizer, I was a little too full so I will definately be getting it next time. I DID order the fried ice cream - and Oh My Gawsh! It was amazing. The strawberry sauce was perfect with it, it wasnt OVERLY sweet but since I'm a desert junkie - it was just my style. I have a friend there whos a server and waited around for her until they got off and we still stayed there after her shift ended. Thats how fun this place is. The other serers there are super sweet too - not bitches like the girls at Hooters seemed to be.  :)\n\nAfter a certain time they have a live DJ and he was pretty awesome too. \n\nI WILL be back, more than once. And i'm getting my enchiladas this time!! :)\n\nOh - and my total was only lke 15 bucks after all that too. I had about 5 drinks over the whole night. Cant beat that!
