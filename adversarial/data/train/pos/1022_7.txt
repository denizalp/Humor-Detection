Looked like a really cool place, but honestly worst customer service ever! They charge $5 per person to play a game. My friends and I ordered alcohol but didn't want to pay the game fee. Another friend happened to bring cards, so we started playing. At the end of our time (about 90 minutes), we found the $5 per person charge on our bill. We asked the waiter and clarified that we brought our own game. Soon, the manager (Maddie) came over and told us that \"it says $5 to play games, even if you bring your own game because we're taking up table space.\" They never told us that was the policy and this was a Monday night when most of the place was completely empty. Absolutely ridiculous. I understand if that's the policy, but it needs to be said upfront or communicated when we pulled out the cards.
