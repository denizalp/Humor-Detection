We went to Touro for the first time last night. I had bought one of those \"Community Appreciation Program\" coupon books but forgot to bring it with me. They said they wouldn't honour the discount that evening but would honour all coupons after their expiry dates so we could still use them anytime - that earns them one star because arbitrary limitations make me angry. The place is very contemporary and masculine in its decor (dark grey, burgundy) and it is a little too open concept for me. Lack of carpeting and divider walls makes it pretty loud in there. Their appetizer buffet contained meatballs and some other meats along with the salads, fruits and veggies; I think it would make more sense to have more veggie options instead of meat but what they did have was good, no complaints there. Since we were there Mon-Wed we could sample 12 cuts of Meat + Grilled Pineapple for $39.75. For AYCE I think this is very reasonable. The wine was $18 for a glass however, so they lose a star for that. Also some of the meat (Picanha, Top Sirloin) was a little overdone and the Parmesan Sirloin was blue rare in the middle, so I was a tad disappointed about that. All in all I didn't think the meat was really anything to write home about. The service was very good, Nigel was attentive and the meat servers were right there once we flipped our cards to green. I will go back with some other meat lovers in my family and I would recommend it as a different experience for anybody who hasn't tried a place like this before.
