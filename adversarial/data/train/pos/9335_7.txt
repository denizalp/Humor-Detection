More than plus size clothing, Curvaceous Consignments Thornhill offers a huge selection of accessories - from jewellery, hats, scarves, shoes, and more. I had been to a half dozen stores where I couldn't find \"help\" or a scarf for a new coat and remembered this delightful boutique.\n\nKathryn (the owner) greeted me warmly, listened to my frustrations, and understood my needs. She jumped into action, selected a few scarves and when I wasn't sure which one looked best she then made a recommendation and I purchased it. I love the natural silk scarf -- it completes the outfit. \n\nCurvaceous Consignments = personalized service in a stress-free shopping environment. Next time I need an accessory I'll visit this store first - brava ladies!
