Really disappointed at being asked for ID tonight at Bouchon when I paid my check.  I have eaten there more than 50 times in the last 10 years and won't EVER be going back.  The explanation that Mr. Adelson has required it for the entire hotel is lame.  Point of sale credit card fraud at restaurants is almost nonexistent (sort of like voter ID fraud).  I'm sorry, when you are paying $500 for dinner it is insulting to ask someone for their drivers license.  I can pay my bill at IHOP with out ID....why should I do it at Bouchon?  Decent restaurant but there are a million other options on the strip that treat you with more respect.
