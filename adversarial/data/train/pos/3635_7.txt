Haven't seen Mary Rose since my first Grubfest in the Tatami Room at Goyemon(a LONG time ago!) So we decided to drop in so we could get our brows did after Amanda's Brunch UYE...Gita and Mercy are two very nice and personable women who can thread like nobody's business!\n\nThe whole process took about 10 minutes, and wasn't even painful. I took it like a man, and still came out looking like a man! That's one thing  that FET is good about...25% of their clientele are men, and they keep men's brows clean without being feminine....unless of course you REQUEST it and wanna look like a girly-man!?!?\n\nThey don't take ANY shortcuts here, and only use the finest organic cotton thread which can break every once in a while but won't leave your eyebrows puffed and irritated.\n\nThanks again Mary Rose, Gita, and Mercy! You've turned a bunch of people into repeat customers, myself included...If you'd rather rock the unibrow or velcro strip,go ahead,  knock yourself out...People will also know that you saved alot of money like Geico by rockin' the brows caveman style!.......ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(67\/100) \"Man? or Neanderthal?\"
