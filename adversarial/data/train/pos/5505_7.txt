After playing craps for a few hours and into the morning hours, I found myself starving around 1am and went into the Wolfgang Puck restaurant at the hotel. I will admit I was drinking while playing craps so my memory of the discussion with the waiter may be a bit skewed but I do remember him telling me what were the best gluten free menu items.\n\nThey did not have a gluten free menu but the waiter was able to tell me what items were safe.\n\nI settled on the flank steak and mashed potatoes. I gotta say the flank steak was delicious. Cooked to a medium perfection that I love and flavored extremely well, I remember enjoying every bite of this dish. I cleaned my plate for sure.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't remember the whole visit at the restaurant and do not remember if I asked the normal questions to our waiter but I felt fine after the visit and didn't have any sickness problems after dining at Wolfgang Puck.
