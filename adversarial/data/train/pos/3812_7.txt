I have no manners! Lustre Bar: Thank you for continuing to welcome everyone in. The views from the top of the Palomar Bar are just stunning. I'm sorry it has taken this long to write a thank you note.\n\nYou're more than just a swank bar for happy hour fun. All summer long there were yoga sessions. Although tree poses evaded me, they offered the wonderful experience to gaze out onto the city. Onto South Mountain. While winding down at the end of yoga you're supposed to close your eyes during Shavasana. Instead I gazed upwards at the hotel. With the building stretching endlessly into the sky there was enough relaxation for the two of us.\n\nWithout a bit of tension in my body I'd roll to your bar. All yoga studios should operate this way. \n\nI can't imagine what delightful drink and food specials the cooler weather will offer. However, the summer specials were killer. $6 for a respectable draft list. $6 for red and white wine. (Occasionally I'll drink the white wines. Thank you for having some.) $6 for flatbreads. $6 for hummus. (Before 6pm!)\n\nAnd no. I did not forget the speciality cocktails you so magically mix.\n\nI just drank too many of them. \nMoving on.\n\nAlthough I never booked a cabana I enjoyed the luxury of one last night. Oof! Late night partying is crazy! The DJ on hand for the Arizona Ballet Black & White event was superb. Dressed to the nines our group was dancing. (Not very well, but we were dancing. Or maybe that was just me :)\n\nIn a heart beat I'd recommend Lustre Bar to someone looking to eat, drink and be merry in the downtown area. Parking is a cinch. Thank you for validating the first two hours at the Cityscape garage. Should I want to Light Rail it you're uber close to a stop. \n\nSo thank you Lustre Bar!
