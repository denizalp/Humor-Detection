Today was my first time ever hiring a maid service, and they went above and beyond! Olga, Reyna, and Sulay came to clean my bathrooms and downstairs, and even though I told them they didn't have to worry about the loft or the bedroom, they made everything spic-and-span. I am often tired due to health issues, so I haven't seen the house this clean in a while. I'm so grateful for the wonderful job these ladies did.
