Friends of ours invited us to join them for dinner and a night out dancing.  We have never been to Handlebar-J, but heard it was a Scottsdale institution, so we were excited to give it a try.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered:\n\nSteak and Enchiladas, $12.75\nSliders, $8.95\nCoors\n\nI had the Steak & Enchiladas and they were very good.  It exceeded my expectations.  Even though it wasn't a premium cut of Beef, it was cooked perfectly and had good flavor.  The Enchiladas were out of this world...wow!  All I can say is wow!\n\nThe Better Half had the Sliders and she was very happy with them.  The portion comes with 2 Sliders, which is perfect for her.\n\nAfter dinner, the music started to play.  We then got our groove on and danced to country & classic rock songs.  The bar also filled up and there was a nice crowd there.  We all had a blast and worked off the calories we ate.\n\nWe heard they have country dance lessons on Wednesdays, so we'll be back.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
