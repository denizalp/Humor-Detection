This golf course is very close to where I live and I am glad I learned about it. The price point for 18 holes after 3 pm was a gimme and it included a free domestic beer OMG. The club house is very nice and the pro shop wow...they have NFL team golf bags. Either people who like those teams really buy their bags from this pro shop or somebody got stuck with a bad order. The Steelers? Go Cowboys! :)\n\nOn to the course oh did I mention a cart came with this price I felt like I was robbing the place. Tee off was about 10 min early no complaints and at the end of the 1st hole I shot a +1 hey for a duffer like me I was happy now we won't talk about the rest of my game. Although I will mention I birdied HOLE 14! Did I mention I birdied hole 14? \n\nThe course is very nice and can't be beat for this price. Wide open fairways although I seemed to somehow find the edges. Every up and down was pretty straight forward and no real major dog legs to speak of or challenging traps\/hazards. Short course well maintained and fun for beginners and intermediate players...i.e. most of the general golfing public. \n\nI was a little disappointed with the slow pace of play we ran into people ahead of us a few times and kinda slowed us down. Not a huge problem for me as my golf rhythm is so erratic it doesn't effect my game. Why I should question if you should even call what I do game LOL. Did I mention hole 14 yeah had some birdies hanging around there!\n\nSeriously it was good to be out after haven't being on a course in such a long time and I look forward to going back. Thanks to my buddy who suggested it and greatful for the cigar afterward!
