What better way to spend New Year's then at one of the best party hotels off the strip (yeah I said it, off the strip!). The boyfriend found an amazing deal online and booked our room right away. \nWe arrived around 4:00pm on New Years Eve. Self-parking is pretty easy, and so is lugging your entire luggage (yes, I tend to over pack) and yourself into in the casino (hate wondering around a casino with your luggage looking for the check in desk). \nEntering into the hotel\/casino, the first thing I noticed outside of the all the awesome rock memorabilia was how clean the air smelled. No stinky smoky cigarette smells just good clean air that was moving around the casino.\n\nOur check in was a breeze, and we actually were upgraded to a (wait for it, wait for it) a suite in the Paradise Tower!!!!!!!  I was so excited that I was jumping up and down on the inside. So what do you get while staying in the Paradise Tower? Well glad that you asked my swanky friends... You get:\n\n-Exclusive check in\n-Over 460 square feet of naught fun\n-VIP lounge and spa\n-Daily newspaper at your door\n-40\" LCD flat screen TV\n-IPod clock radio\n-A fully stocked mini bar\n-Free in room WIFI\n-Premium bed with feather pillows \n-Luxurious bedding (our comforter was urber fluffy)\n-A rain shower that could hold at least 10 people\n-Prickly Pear & Verbena bath amenities (smelled like some sexy fun)\n-Mood lighting all around\n\nI especially loved the \"Do not disturb\" door sign. Our suite was pretty sound proof which was nice, except we did have a conjoining door to the next room at one point we just got back to our room from a night of drinking, I'm guessing our neighbors must have had gotten back as well. This one girl was so loud and annoying that not even the TV could drown out her voice. To make things even worst we were woken up around 8:30am to our neighbor who was awake along with her friends laughing and yelling like it was the middle of the afternoon.. Ugh, I just wanted to yell shut up, but then again I did not want to leave the comfortable bed. We just laughed it off and went back to sleep.\n\nI highly recommend staying at this hotel and staying in the Paradise Tower! It is a couple of blocks from the strip but at least you do not have to deal with traffic!
