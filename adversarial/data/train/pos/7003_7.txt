This store is located on Eastern Ave just north of Silverado Ranch. It's inside the shopping center with BJ's and right by the Kabob place .\nParking lot sucks.\n\nI went in after getting my fresh squeezed sugar cane juice at lee's in the same shopping center. I was needing some HP ink for an office jet printer and saw their sign and figured lets try em out.\nWhen I walked in I saw a lot of ink cartridges on the wall and felt good about getting what I needed.\n\nIt's not self serve and the inks are behind the counter. Lady comes out and greeted me. I looked around and the had some printers copiers for sale too. Not new but looked like repaired units that didn't get picked up. It seems like just buying a new one these days is cheaper than a repair would be. So repair uhhhh no, I'm going new.\nAnyways I told her the model and they had it $17.99 original HP. So she goes over and also pulls out their house brand packaged refill. She really seemed to push  that one and said $10.99. I'm like hmmm cuz I always go for original OEM ink because I have bunch of printers and had 1 bad experience. She sold me on their house one so I said I'll try it. So then asks me if I have the old one to \"trade in\" I said noooo. She says then there's a $2 core charge. I started laughing cuz at the moment that shit just sounded funny.. Really a core charge on a $11 item. I throw like 5 of these out in the trash. She assured me I could just bring in a core to get my $2 bucks back . I love the add on and she did a good job presenting it. The place was clean and they were convenient and had what I needed.\nAll around good experience, but let's see how the house brand performs. \n\nUpdate...cartridge was terrible and only lasted a few days and maybe printed 30 pages. I replaced it with HP original and all is good.\nI wont be back and they can keep the stupid $2 \"core' charge\n\nWould have been 4 star rating when i started, but after terrible product performance 2 stars for this transaction.
