I'm twelve years late getting the tattoo fixed I got when I was 19.  Better late than never.  As it had been that long since I got a tattoo, I needed to do some shopping around.\n\nI got quotes from about half a dozen different places besides H&S.  Most quoted $250, some had me asking the artists if they were serious ($500) and laughing as I walked out.  Then I came across a fairly new shop close to home.  When I went in the first time, I'm pretty sure I heard Call of Duty being played on the laptop on the back.  This was the first sign that this is my type of place.  Geeks unite! I was quoted $150.  It sounded good, so I went back a short time later to see two ladies as well as Eddy, whom I had originally gotten the quote from.  They were very friendly and enthusiastic.  I took a look at their work and was impressed by what I saw, so I booked an appointment.\n\nI forgot how much it can hurt get having a tattoo put on your chest, however it wasn't nearly as painful as the first time.  Eddy was terrific.  He is what the guy that originally did this tattoo should have been : A perfectionist.  I'll put up a picture once it's fully healed (and since my own ego tells me that everybody wants to see my bare chest) Until then, I'm already planning my next visit.  \n\nOh, and a bonus is that it's only a few doors down from my comic book shop.  Getting a tattoo then walking over for some new comics? SCORE!
