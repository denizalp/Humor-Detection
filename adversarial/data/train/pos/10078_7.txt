Wow!  140 reviews can't be wrong!\n\nLisa H and I were on the hunt for some quality Mexican food the other night after a Rockies spring training game and my Yelp search yielded Carlsbad Tavern.  I believe \"off the beaten path\" is what caught us.\n\nI was immediately happy with the packed parking lot; anytime a restaurant's parking lot is full is a good sign.  As we walked in to Carlsbad, we were impressed with the beautiful outdoor patio and pool\/fountain area that surrounds it.  Although we didn't sit inside, the bar area and indoor dining area looked awesome.  And of course, the patio was amazing:  great ambiance with the small pools and fountains, tiny Christmas-like white lights that were just right, and plenty of seating for diners to enjoy the gorgeous Arizona evening.\n\nAfter ordering a margarita, I decided to splurge a little and ordered the lobster enchiladas.  Holy hot dog, this dish was fantastic.  Maybe I'm easy to impress, but my gawd, deeelicious.  There was something about the sauce that just worked and brought something unique to my taste buds.  And of course, playing with the main ingredient was brilliant.  YUM-O!\n\nCarlsbad Tavern was a great find!  Aside from the fantastic eats, I can't forget to mention the awesome and friendly servers.  Everyone was spot on and timely.  Next time I'm back in town, I'll certainly be stopping by for another amazing meal.
