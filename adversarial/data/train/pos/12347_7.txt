One day Honest Ed's will be gone, and we'll have only ourselves to blame.\n\nSure, it's not the focus of the city, or the greatest place to shop...  but it's ours.  And it has charm.  \n\nBrian Lee O'Malley would have you believe it was destroyed in the great Scott Pilgrim fight taking place somewhere after the first book, and outside of the realm of the movie.  But it was not.  \n\nHonest Ed's offers everything you could want from a dollar store, with a little bit you could want from a Wal-Mart.  \n\nI'm not sure why I go there...  it's difficult to navigate.  The deals aren't very good.  The merchandise is somewhat distressing.  But it's ours.  And it's part of this city.  Normally I don't go in for the mom + pop stores, and the need to keep them around, but this is a Toronto landmark, and we've been losing so many of them.\n\nI'm all for Condos...  but I really don't want to see them there - Honest Ed's.  We need to use it, or it's gone.
