Can you say AWESOME....\n\nThis place gets really crowded at lunch time but I have to say being here on this day, even with a lunch crowd, the line sometimes being almost out the door, everyone behind the counter had great attitudes, they were able to work hard and find time to be friendly.  \n\nIts amazing the quality of service here that everyone seemed very calm and worked through each order even though the line never seemed to end.  You can tell they really enjoy their job and they take a LOT of pride in the products they put out.\n\nI met my daughter for lunch, the had a chicken lemon soup which was extremely tasty and left me wanting more when I was done.\n\nI also had a Gyro which was really good.  They have an amazing menu with a great selection and even though this is my first review, I have been here a few times and really like not only the food here but the friendliness of the staff.  They are glad to see you and they put that love into the food the deliver.\n\nIf you are in the area, this is a place you have to try...ITS A MUST...\n\nI highly recommend this place and I will definitely be back...I find it pretty easy to get to, there is a parking garage with valet parking right next to the place.  It is downtown so you know parking is limited and you most likely have to pay to park being the area but don't let that deter you, this place is worth coming to.
