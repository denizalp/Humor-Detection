If you want to be ignored the moment you walk in, this is the place for you. \n\nTwo ladies there, yes they are both busy with potential tenants but to not at least greet us and assure us that we will be helped? Come on, they did not care. We made eye contact! (Both ladies made eye contact with us) \n\nAnother person was helped before us, a young man walks in (after us) and she's all over him excusing herself from the future tenant to help this gentlemen when me and my husband are just standing there. \n\nRude!
