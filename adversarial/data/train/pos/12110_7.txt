My son played soccer with NYS when he was younger, we were so turned off by the organization because of how unorganized they were. It is also a volunteer program which at the time didn't support the actual volunteer coaches at all. Parks were changed last minute, refs didnt show up...it was all just a joke. We paid basically for the uniforms and time to play at the park. So we left NYS when he started to play baseball. \n\nWell, we decided to give NYS another shot when my son wanted to play football. Keep in mind the players are 10-12...KIDS!! So when a referee blatently tells a coach \"those kids are horrible\" explain to me how professional that is? A grown adult talking crap about kids! Are you kidding me? Ever consider, maybe this is the first time they have ever played? Just a thought.\n\nJust a peice of advice, if you are going to talk negatively about children maybe you shouldn't be around them. You never know who can hear what your saying. \n\nGood representation of NYS, right.
