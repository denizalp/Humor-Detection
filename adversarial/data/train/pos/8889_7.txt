I'm from out of town and was visiting relatives who lived near this salon. I went there looking for a Shellac Manicure. I've been having CND Shellac Manicures for over a year and I would NEVER recommend that anyone have this manicure done there.\n\nFirst off, they totally buffed my nails with a very coarse buffer. I asked why they were scraping up my nails and they said that the polish holds on better to the nail if it is roughly buffed (my salon at home does not do this, in fact thier CND rep told them not to buff at all), I wish I told them to stop but I let them continue.\n\nAfter returning home and going to my normal salon to take off the polish, my nail salon had the hardest time taking off the polish (even after soaking acetone!). Turns out Highland Nails put on a gel polish base coat like they use when you put on Gel Nails, not the CND base coat. Which explains why they ripped up my nails so the the polish will stay longer. My nails were literally stained red as well. \n\nAlso, they did not use the recommended curing times between coats - they didn't time it at all. They just stick your hands in the UV boxes and let you sit there. So, obviously, they don't really know what they are doing do they care for their client's nail \"health\". \n\nCombine this with the fact that 3 different people \"tag-teamed\" my manicure & pedicure....I would tell people spend their money elsewhere, you're paying alot for mani & pedi so go to a salon who knows what they are doing.
