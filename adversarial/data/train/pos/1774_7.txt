Good quality pizzas with great flavours! This small restaurant has great charm and the service is outstanding. Out of the 5 pizzas I've tried at this place, my favourites are the bavette pizza & the margherita, surprisingly. One comment: the homemade lemonade is a bit bland. The prices are not cheap but you're paying for flavour and quality. Great job!
