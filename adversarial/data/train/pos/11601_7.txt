This place just didn't do it for me. The waitress was too interested in selling us stuff and the food wasn't great. We started off with a sausage tower and that was worth it. Everything after was crap. I asked the waitress for something like a \"brat\" and she brought me more like a petrified hot dog. It looked like breakfast sausage. It also had condiments for a hamburger rather than a hot dog or \"brat\" which made absolutely no sense. Who just wants a toasted bun and extra long breakfast sausage? Not me! I also had their Bavarian potato soup and it looked good but really it lacked flavor and the supposed sliced sausage in it was more like sliced ballpark franks. What's sad is I could have had a better loaded sausage at Wienerschnitzel.
