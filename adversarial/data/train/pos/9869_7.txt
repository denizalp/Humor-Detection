Before we get down to it I know I'm writing a review on a strip club and half of you probably won't read it. \n\nI'm seeing a lot of people down talk the women here, from their race, their body and all other things I won't mention. Let me just say this. I LOVVVEEE black women and I felt SO comfortable last night. Everything was so judge free. I got dances from a few of the girls and they were all pretty and had nice lil bodies. They all seem to have good personalities ( which nobody probably cares about ) \nBut anyways I honestly can say I enjoyed myself. With me being a homebody and all I really was out of my element, but it didn't feel that way. \nI honestly wanted to go back in a few weeks. Hopefully the same girls are there. \nNow to the comment about not seeing white girls, I saw a white girl or maybe she was Latina, idk I was so drunk I couldn't see shit. But it was a lil mix in there from all different beautiful black women and if you don't like urban women and prefer flat backs please go else where. But I speak for many when I say \nI LOVED IT \nThanks guys
