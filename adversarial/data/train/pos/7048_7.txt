I had some doubts about the quality of medical care in Las Vegas after visiting a doctor last week who first diagnosed me with depression and then gave me a prescription instructing me to eat more hot dogs.  That just didn't seem right.  But sitting in front of the computer now, with a belly full of hot dog, I've never been happier.  \n\nAnd if a doctor instructs you to eat more hot dogs, there are few places in town serving a better frank than Chicago Tasty Dogs.  I've read the negative reviews on here, but my experience has been completely different.  This place serves up the best Chicago dog in town.  The tomatoes and onions were fresh, the relish was neon green, the pickle wedge sliced right, and two pickled sport peppers to top it all off.  And the Vienna Beef hot dog was perfect.\n\nThe chili cheese dog was pretty good--delicious cheese sauce, but the chili was just decent.  I'm not the biggest fan of the fries here, but I will say they are the closest thing to Chicago shoestring fries -- a little gritty, but crisp with a slight paper bag feel to them.\n\nFor those refugees from Chicagoland living in the desert, this place is home away from home.  The walls are covered in Chicago memorabilia.  And if you're missing the Windy City, this place will feel like home.\n\n5 stars for the Chicago dog, their hot dogs in general, the cheese sauce, and great customer service.  Minus one star for high(er) fast food prices ($9-10 for 2 dogs, small fries and small drink) and mediocre fries.
