It's that time of year folks!  Spring is in the air and Uncle Sam has his hand out (much like my free-loading Uncle Fred at every one of my birthday parties).  Whether you dread writing that check or look forward to the IRS returning your interest-free loan, it's here.  You can't avoid it.  Well, legally anyway.  The best you can do is find a good tax man (or lady) to help you keep what you worked hard for, or hardly worked for, whichever applies.\n\nI'm happy to say Mr. Holly is still in business, proof his clients are not in jail, nor destitute, and ready to assist with all of your tax preparation needs.  As per usual, I showed up with my list of 102 ridiculously anal and sometimes irrelevant questions and all were answered.  One week later, my forms were ready.  Thom's a true professional, and I would recommend him to anyone.
