So, I have to say the best club I've been to in a long time is Diesel back home. Nice mix of music, fair dress code and solid bartenders.\nI'm from Pittsburgh, but live in State College, so this was my first experience with a South Side club in awhile.  I didn't know what to expect. \nHonestly, it felt just as good and fun as clubs I've been to in New York, Miami, Washington DC and Virginia Beach.\nThe DJ was beyond efficient and played a fair mix of EDM, Hip-Hop and even some Motown.\nThe bartenders were friendly and I never felt I was waiting long for a drink.\nEven the bathroom and the attendant in there were a nice plus.\nPittsburgh's night life has improved beyond leaps and bounds and clubs like Diesel are the reason. I highly recommend it, and it will see my business again.
