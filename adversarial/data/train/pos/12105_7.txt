Pier 215 is popping out some very good seafood and sushi and a lot of other things. Its one of the better Asian fusion restaurants in town. We really enjoyed the food here. And can definitely see us coming back as regulars. More of a treat once in a while versus a once a week type restaurant. That's not a bad thing at all but be prepared to spend a few bucks if you go all out. Let's get to the food. \n\nWe ordered \n\nUni 3\/5- plain nothing special wasn't as fresh as I wanted it to be.\n\nHalf dozen Kumamoto oysters and Half Kuushi oysters 5\/5- I love oysters so these were a great treat and delicious and fresh loved the dipping sauces there was 4 that was offered all were great also a must order!!\n\nHamachi Kama 5\/5- Loved that it was a very big portion that fed me and my wife as a very well prepared piece you yellowtail collar. Absolute must order for sure! \n\nBlack tiger roll 4\/5- pretty tasty roll. Not something you've never had before but yummy!\n\nScallops and brown risotto 3.5\/5- Scallops were delicious but risotto was not cooked to my liking I would like it a little softer texture rather than al-dente.\n\nSeafood bouillabaisse 4\/5- Really good broth in this I ordered some rice to eat with the broth poured all over. The seafood was good there was shrimp,lobster, crab, scallops,mussels,clams and mushrooms and bok choy. Would order again but would like more crab in this. \n\nBig Thanks to Pier 215 and staff for the wonderful service and food. We really enjoyed the experience
