I came here for some breakfast on a Sunday.  It looked like a good place to try so I came in.  Not being able to eat wheat there is a limited menu but I settled on the Quiche with fruit and an Americano.  The Americano was decent but not as good as my little espresso maker can make at home which I had one earlier.  The Quiche was also pretty good but I could tell it was not baked that day because it was served ice-box cold!  It looks like, for the most part this place is all about freshness and quality.  They even have organic coffee.  If the quiche had been baked that day I don't think they would have needed to store it in the refrigerator.   It was pretty good cold, I imagine it would be great warm.   The fruit was fresh and I'm glad that was cold!\n\nThe rest of the food that went by looked really good.  Too bad I can't eat bread because there were a few things I would try here!  Overall cute place and I would come back here again.  I see they have some draft beers here and grass-fed angus burger.
