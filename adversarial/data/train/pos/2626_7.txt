I come to the Fry basket for both breakfast and fish, but not at the same time! \n\nNo Breakfast place that I know serves 6 huge pieces of bacon! A gigantic tasty order of  homefries. \n\nJust the one piece of Fish n' Chips is enough for me, the size and quality of the halibut they serve is nothing like any other Fish n' Chip restaurant I tried. I always change the fries to homefries.\n\nService is always friendly and lovely. Warm and cozy atmosphere and awesome food. If you like a really nice, well prepared home cooked meal, you really can't go wrong with any of the choices and prices.\n\nThe only downfall to this place is they have crazy hours and are not open late, but other then that, I like it!
