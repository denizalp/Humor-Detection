Little Darlings...where I lost my strip club virginity and also my latest fully nude strip club experience.  I remember there being more beautiful dancers in the past (especially for a Saturday) but the real reason for a pedestrian rating was the pedestrian dancing and energy I felt from the stage.  True, many of the other patrons were being stingy (Ol' man Jones would have tossed quarters of it were allowed)...but my girlfriend and I tipped and wanted more and better twerking.  \n\nDarlings does offer the best for the $ lap dances at only $20.00 per session though.  Their \"private\" cubicle style rooms (not VIP) haven't seem to be upgraded since my very first visit 10+ years ago.  $150.00 for a VIP room will get you a nicer atmosphere and longer session though.
