I have lived near this mall for a large chunk of my life, and it is probably the 2nd runner up for *worst mall ever* after Centerpoint at Yonge\/Steeles.\n\nThe mall has been under construction for a while, and I can't wait till it is completed. Over the last few years, they have finally added some stores that appeal to younger generations.\n\nFor a very long time, I recall only seeing seniors speed walking laps around the mall, now with stores such as Sephora, Marciano, M for Mendocino there, as well as Sporting life and H&M coming soon - the dynamic is slowly shifting.\n\nThe mall has come a long way but still has much further to go in my opinion. The food court could use some attention, where are the healthy options, you know for people who care about what they eat (but are hungry enough to buy mall food lol) ? Tired of seeing Subway, A&W, Manchu Wok type places in malls. \n\nI come to this mall mostly for 2 reasons -  Aldo ( you know, always free shipping when you ship to store) and to buy vitamins & supplements from S&H.\n\nCan't wait until renovations are complete - H&M I am coming for you next! (This one excites me most)
