If I ever turn into a cougar like the ones I saw last night, kill me and be quick about it.  I would rather be a cat lady than humiliate myself by throwing myself at younger guys just to get my freak on.\n\nHonestly, if I weren't with the awesomest group and helping to celebrate my best friend's birthday, my rating would be more in the one and a half to two-ish range because yeah, I've had better and I have no patience for drama.\n\nI'll give them the musack - it was a pretty good (if strange) mix and at any point you could hear Missy Elliot, Lynard Skynyrd, and Benny Benassi one right after another.  The bartenders I encountered were nothing but nice to me, although I've heard quite a few stories to the contrary.\n\nBut c'mon, $8 for a weak-ass drink?  The reisling I had at Bloom was stronger than what I had last night, and for a freakin' $8, I'm expecting at least a slight buzz.  And for a lightweight like me, that's saying a lot!\n\nThe bathroom was a congregation of drama queens crying out their boy problems while a bored attendant sat on a stool making it quite clear she wished she were somewhere else.\n\nAt least I got to spend  the night with some of the best dance freaks I know, and even did quite a bit of shakin' myself.  OWwww!
