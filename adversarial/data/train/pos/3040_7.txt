I had already had my coffee thanks to Starbucks (don't judge me), but I was in the mood for the taste of something sweet! Kat F was going on her 2nd cup of coffee, but she suggested I order a butter tart, which is apparently a Canadian dessert. When in Canada...right? And so I ordered away!\n\nKat mentioned that butter tarts can be so sweet that she often has trouble finishing them, but no problemo here! This was delish! Mine had pecans on it and tasted an awfully like a pecan pie.  My butter tart also prompted the discussion of whether they should be served with raisins or not. No raisins in this butter tart and pretty sure I like mine without, but the pecans were a very nice addition!\n\nBesides serving uh-mazing butter tarts this is a great place to get some work done. There's lots of communal tables downstairs if you're looking to make a friend or head upstairs for more privacy. There is free wifi, but you need a password to sign on (they text it to you).  \n\nMy one complaint is that the restrooms are kinda far away, which is a pain in the butt when you're 7 months pregnant and have to go every 10 min. However, tasty butter tarts made up for it!
