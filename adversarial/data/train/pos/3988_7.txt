The wife and I had tickets to the 7PM \"O\" show on a Sunday night so we stopped by Harvest by Roy Ellamar during its nightly, 5-6 PM \"Harvest Hour\" (which apparently also repeats between 9-10 PM) for a pre-show bite and drink.  We sat at the bar.  I had one of the $7 Harvest Hour cocktails.  It was good, but unfortunately, I don't recall what I ordered.  In truth, there were several regular-priced cocktails on their list that sounded pretty amazing, which I was much more interested in trying, but didn't.  We split an order of the Salt & Pepper Octopus.  It was a tasty, shareable portion of tender octopus.  It was a colorful, beautifully presented dish.  After finishing our food and drinks, we left for our show.  However, Harvest by Roy Ellamar definitely intrigued me enough to say with confidence that I want to return to further explore its food and cocktails.
