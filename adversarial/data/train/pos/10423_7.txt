2.5 stars\n\nKorean owned and operated.  This place is ok.  It's the only shabu-shabu place I've been to in Las Vegas.  \n\nThe kobe chuck was pretty good but the seafood was a little underwhelming.  Also, got the mushroom plate - fresh enough.\n\nOne thing I liked was the wasabi octopus appetizer.  It's hard to find raw octopus in Vegas.\n\nService was great.  Extremely friendly and helpful girl behind the counter. \n\nI felt it was overpriced.  $75 with tip for two not-so-hungry guys.  Eh.  \n\nI'd probably go back if fiending shabushabu.
