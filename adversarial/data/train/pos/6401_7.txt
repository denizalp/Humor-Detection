I went here over the Memorial Day weekend and was very happy to see another French cafe pop up on the Westside. We had just eaten at Baguette Cafe the day before (still one of my favorite spots), so I tried to replicate my usual order at Rosallie to compare. I got their Quiche Lorraine, which was not as bacon-y as Baguette Cafe's, but came with a generous portion of salad and featured very fluffy eggs. Not too much actual bacon in the piece we got, so I might opt for a different quiche in the future. My husband devoured his Nord sandwich (smoked salmon, cucumber, sweet onions and capers, but I was able to sneak in a bite or two and loved it as well. The salmon portion and the salad portion again was very  generous with this order. The bread paired so well with all the other ingredients and was at the right temperature to enjoy the sandwich. My husband was still thinking about how delicious it was the next day. We ordered a cup of the French Onion Soup, which I would not get in the future - watery and lacking in cheese, definitely not the hearty and rich bowls of soup I'm used to seeing, but good if you did need something milder in flavor. The Nutella croissant was a big highlight for me and so hard not to devour before the rest of my food actually came. Nutella is drizzled on the outside and there's so much oozing from the inside within the perfectly flaky croissant crust. I'm not a big coffee drinker, so I opted for the peach iced tea, which I will pass on in the future. They had a hot chocolate though that I'm curious about for next time. \n\nThe restaurant itself was very spacious, the cashier assisting us was very friendly, and the owner checked in on every table that was there. As others have mentioned, signage says \"Le French Cafe\" instead of \"Rosallie\" so it's easy to miss. If you find yourself at Jaburritos, definitely pop into this place and pick up a pastry for dessert!
