Went here for weekday lunch, and I must say this place is pretty mediocre.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food's fine, but it's just average and not memorable.\n\nGot the shredded beef tacos which comes with rice and black beans. One of the tacos had really dry, overcooked beef. They fry their tortillas, which is usually good, but at this restaurant they were soaking in oil and they were better off not frying them (specifically the corn tortilla). The flavor was lacking and overall the dish was salty. \n\nService was really slow but we were a big party. If there's a plus, the vibe and the ambience of the place was really nice. They also provide free chips and salsa.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't too bad and I was full, but I wouldn't go back.
