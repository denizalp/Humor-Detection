The food is on the overpriced side along with the drinks.\nThe sake comes out in a clear circular shape bowl. That was nice to look at, but cost a pretty penny which might not be all that it was worth.\n\nThe food was average. The service was good. I just can't see myself going back and ordering the same dishes. Maybe, if I ordered something different next time around I might have a change of heart.
