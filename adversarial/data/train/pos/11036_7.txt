\"Oxford Fruit\" is one of my nicknames actually, because I am from Oxford in England, and well, anyway.\n\nIn the heart of the overpriced and hipstery Kensington Market, this large and noticeable fruit shop with an awesome name, has plenty of good products. Their oranges and bananas were tasty and fresh, and their kale was crisp and not at all wilted or mouldy. I really appreciate that. It's certainly not cheap, but it's worth it considering the quality of what they are selling.
