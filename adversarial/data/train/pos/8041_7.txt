This f**ken place is a got dam joke. \nDO NOT BUY FOOD FROM HERE. \nDO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE \n!!!!DO NOT CALL IN OVER THE PHONE ORDERS TO THIS PLACE. they will not start your order until you get there witch makes absolutely no sense! I called in my order at 6:14pm, I get there, pay for my food, and I get nothing. So I ask. Is my order ready? Then i'm told they don't start making it until I get there and pay. SO WHATS THE POINT OF CALLING IN?
