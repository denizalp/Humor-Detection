Oh man.  When Tracey told me this was the LYS of THE Yarn Harlot, I just KNEW I had to make a trip here. \n\nThis place is really tiny, but they manage to pack a lot in here.  I wanted to buy EVERYTHING, however, Joe was standing guard, preventing me from making a purchase *le sigh*  The prices were extremely fair, and the quality of the yarns were superb.  The one girl working there was very pleasant, offering help without getting in the way.  \n\nI do regret not buying one of the funky knitting inspired magnets that were hanging at the register.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you are a yarn and knitting fanatic liek I am, you MUST make a trip to what amounts to as the Mecca of the knitting world!!
