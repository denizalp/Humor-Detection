Our family dined here this past weekend for an early dinner.  When we arrived, the restaurant only had a few patrons, so we were seated almost immediately of walking in their doors.  The waiter who greeted us and took our orders was friendly enough.\n\nI decided to order a cheeseburger and french fries along with a root beer.  I know what you're all thinking!  Here I come to an Italian pizza and pasta restaurant and I order the most American item on their menu.  To my defense, my husband chose the restaurant as we were looking for some place quick to eat before our show.  I wasn't in the mood for pizza, the pasta seemed too heavy as I wasn't very hungry and the salads didn't sound too amazing.  They all came with raw onions, (Yuck!) and their descriptions sounded as if they were all made with filler iceberg lettuce, as I like to call it.\n\nOf course I was given a Sierra Mist in place of my root beer.  The waiter quickly dashed off, and I was too tired to say anything.  A half an hour later my cheeseburger arrived very dried and sad with no cheese.  Maybe I should have ordered one of their salads, and requested no onions.\n\nThe only saving grace for this restaurant is that they brought out some wonderfully soft dough on a cute pizza plate to keep my daughter occupied while we waited for our meals.\n\n#90 \/ 100\nYelp 100 Review Challenge 2014
