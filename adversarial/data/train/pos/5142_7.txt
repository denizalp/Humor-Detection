This PetSmart is our main location, because for one it is close to our house and for two we go to the Banfield Pet Hospital inside this location and love the staff there at Banfield!\n\nAll in all I think this is a pretty nice location. I think they are decently stocked the majority of the time and staffed well for the most part.\n\nHowever there is one staff member particularly, (I wish I could remember her name) who is always really grumpy. Anytime we need help while in the store, whether it be a suggestion on dog harnesses or getting something out of a locked cabinet or questions about training classes she is always really short with us and it feels like she thinks her time could be better spent than helping her customers. \n\nIt really is a a shame. We go there at least three times a week either to visit the vet or to stock up on dog food and we would probably spend more money & time here, possibly even enrool the pups in a class if i didnt feel like this staff member didn't hate helping clients so much.
