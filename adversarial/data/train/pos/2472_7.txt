This tin foil hat is clearly not working. \n\nIt's almost as if the government mind-control spies were finally able to read my thoughts and dreams and set out to create a space that captures the purest essence of what I always wanted a bar to be.\n\nWalls lined with memorabilia.    Tiki thatch hut roof.   Ceiling covered in vinyl.   Named after the crown prince of black comedy.    Hidden enough to make you feel cool.  Accessible enough to make you feel safe.  \n\nDo you remember that scene in Back to The Future Part II when Marty McFly is transported to the year 2015 and he discovers that there's an 80s cafe?    Well.   It's kinda like that.   Except that the place is themed in a way that leans heavily towards the 1990s post grunge revival.   \n\nPerfectly priced.   A bar that doesn't require a second mortgage for a nice night out.  \n\nYou can feel the heart and soul that went into this project.   \n\nAn unpretentious love letter to the east end.
