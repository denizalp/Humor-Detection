I have lived at Grigio Tempe Town Lake for almost two years now and up until about 3 months ago, I absolutely loved it.  I live in one of the executive suites by the lake and pay almost $1800 per month for a studio.  When I moved in, I was very clearly told that it was a quiet community and most of my neighbors were older executives.  Being a business owner who works long hours, this is very important to me.  Up until 3 months ago everything was great. \n\nAbout 3 months ago a couple of the apartments below me were rented out to college students, and the neighborhood has quickly gone to hell.  These kids have huge parties 3-4 times per week, they play drinking games (beer pong) on their patio until 4:00am regularly, smoke marijuana, and have no respect for the neighbors.  At the beginning I would get out of bed, walk down there and ask them to move it inside.  They would be quiet for about 20 minutes then start right back up.  \n\nI am forced to call security in the mid hours of the morning 3-4 times per week, sometimes they show up and sometimes they don't.  My other neighbors are just as exhausted as I am, and collectively we complain to management on a weekly basis.  From what I can see, nothing is being done to correct the issue as the partying is getting worse and worse.  My neighbors and I have now resorted to calling the police when this happens so we will see if that helps the problem.\n\nI understand that Tempe is a \"college town\" but if they are going to allow this place to turn into a dorm room, their prices should reflect such.  I am exhausted and extremely frustrated with management's lack of action in correcting this issue.  At this point, I do not recommend living here unless you are a college student who doesn't mind staying up until 4:00am most nights
