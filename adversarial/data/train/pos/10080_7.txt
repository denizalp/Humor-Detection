I use Superb Maids every month (sometimes twice a month if necessary), and they are the only cleaning service i fully trust! It's easy to book with them also, you can go to their site and you can book directly from there. No need to call to confirm, they're right at your door @ the exact time you need them to be there. They use eco-friendly cleaning products, which is a ++ for me. (Let's all help Mother Nature, shall we?)\n\nWhenever they come in to clean, my house looks like a model home. Lol thank you Superb Maids!! You really are SUPERB ;)
