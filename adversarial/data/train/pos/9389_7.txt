SHAZAM!!!  \n\nAlso:   Best. Cupcakes. Ever.    \n\nIn celebration of my husbands 41st birthday last weekend, I asked my mother-in-law, who currently hails from Vegas, to transport 48 cupcakes from Las Vegas to Joshua Tree, across the Mojave Preserve.  She was road tripping with her girlfriend Pat a la  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, except that instead of the ether and the bats, there were cupcakes.  Lots and lots of cupcakes.  \n\nWhen pressed to answer the question \"what kind of cake do you want for your birthday this year), my husband suggested this bakery, which he called \"the best bakery in Las Vegas.\"  How he knew about it, I still have no idea, considering his lack of a sweet tooth, but I'm eternally grateful to him for making the recommendation.  After perusing their website and poring over the photographs on their flickr page, I was hooked.    I called the bakery and ordered one dozen each of the following flavors:\n\nChocolate loves vanilla (Chocolate cake topped with vanilla buttercream)\n\nApple cider (Cinnamon swirl cake topped with apple cider buttercream and dusted with cinnamon and sugar)\n\nHop Scotch (Vanilla cake topped with vanilla buttercream dipped in butterscotch ganache, their #1 selling cupcake)\n\nPucker Up (Raspberry cake topped with lemon buttercream; Winner of the Las Vegas Weekly 2010 Vegas' Best Offbeat Dessert) \n\nI also picked a desert-themed cupcake design that I found on the bakery's flickr page:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/retrobakery\/5053618397\/\n\nAdding the design to each cupcake upped the price considerably, but it was worth every penny.  They warn't cheap, but they shore were purdy.  I was happy to discover that the emblems themselves were also delicious and didn't detract from the individual cupcake flavors in any way.\n\nOverall, I loved every one of the flavors we picked.  The chocolate loves vanilla was the most surprising of the quartet because they managed to make something VA VA VOOM out of something tried-and-true, and artfully so.  During the party, I tried an Apple cider cupcake, which I thought was a little too sweet to finish. The next morning, however, I had absolutely no trouble eating any of the other cucpakes, one right after the other, so the Apple Cider Incident could have just been a fluke moment of non-hunger.  Overall, my favorite flavor was the Pucker Up - holy man of moses, the tart and tangy flavor of the lemon buttercream was so perfect to cut the sweetness of the buttercream and the exactly right flavor to complement the raspberry muffin part.  \n\nNow, my little group of friends may choose to live in bumfuck, California, but they hail from all over the globe and have done their share of time in major cities.  What I'm trying to say is that we have eaten some freaking cupcakes in our lifetimes.  These were NOT our first cupcakes, if you know what I mean.  Been there, cupcake.  \n\nI think you get my point.\n\nAt an opportune moment last Saturday, I was finally able to grab my husband's elbow and make him stand still long enough to blow on some candles and pick a flavor.  Most everyone followed suit.  What happened next was remarkable.  The fine lines around people's eyes began to fall away.  Several people began to giggle.  A few people stared furiously at their paper plate, chewing vigorously, trying simultaneously to savor the moment and also make room for the next one.  In ten minutes or less, ten people were skulking around the table, eyeing the choices, selecting their next victim.  Others were surreptitiously looking for tupperware, tinfoil, a cloth grocery bag, anything remotely cupcake sized into which they might fit one for the road.  The \"mmmmmmmm\" sound was punctuated by people saying things like \"OH my GOD\" and\/or \"where did these COME FROM?  TELL ME!\"   Several people snagged business cards, others started brainstorming and scheming about who they might know in Las Vegas and what they would be willing to do in exchange for some cupcakes.    In fact, since the Great Cupcake Unveiling, tourism to Las Vegas from Joshua Tree has increased by 150%.  I'm already planning on asking my mother in law, who is coming back out here in a few weeks, to bring us another two dozen.  \n\nWhen you live in a town full of shitty grocery-store-brand cakes and no mom-and-pop bakeries, finding just the right cupcake for a 41-year-old man's birthday party can be challenging.    Lucky for us, there's Retro Bakery, purveyor of fine party cupcakes and cakes for any occasion.
