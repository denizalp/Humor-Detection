I'd give this place a big fat zero if at all possible. \n\nFirst off, I called in the morning to see if or when I could stop by to view their facility. Ted, who I later found to be the owner, answered with an annoyed 'The Learning Curve' and that was it. \n\nWhen I stopped in, (yeah, I know...shoulda gone with my instinct) Ted greeted me (if you'd call it that) and we discussed what I'd be needing. Being an RN, I only work 3 days, so told him I'd need 3 full and 2 part-time days because I'd like some sort of structure & socialization to be maintained for my son. He rolled his eyes and huffed because it threw off their tuition and pricing. Apparently they're doing some 'special' where you get $25 off fulltime and $15 off parttime...that's brain surgery to figure out the discount given my situation, huh Ted?  \n\nWe walked around their facility and he showed me what class my son would be in and met the 'teacher'...omg. Apparently I was unaware that not washing your hair and having visible tattoos is acceptable these days. \n\nThe whole time, he's going on and on about how great they are because they have unmatched security and technology and video surveillance, how they have such a huge play area for the kids (ok, it was decent), and blah blah blah. At this point I'm shooting myself for not just walking out after my initial impression of the guy. He's not once even tried to pretend he likes kids, faked a smile, or inquired about my son other than how old he was. \n\nDon't waste your time.
