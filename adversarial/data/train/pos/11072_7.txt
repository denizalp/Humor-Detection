If I could give this place \"Zero\" stars I would! I was there with my girlfriend on 01\/28\/16 after a round of golf. Having been there before and knowing it was a Steelers bar, and my girlfriend visiting from Pittsburgh, what better of a place to take her. \n\nWe sat at the bar at approx 5:00pm and it took several minutes to get someone's attention, although the place was not that busy and the bar was not full. \n\nFinally a snotty girl comes yep and asks what we want, and practically throws the menu and Happy Hour menu at us. We ordered a couple drinks before we looked over the menu. I already knew I wanted the Fried Chicken and my girlfriend got the Bleu Cheese burger. \n\nSince all I eat is the breast, I asked for just two breasts, that's all. The bitch bartender says \" well that's not how it comes, you either order a half chicken or or a whole chicken\" I told her I don't want a whole chicken, just two breasts, I'll pay extra, just give me two breasts\" She says Nope can't do it, either whole or half, that's it! So I said \" Forget it, I'll have Spaghetti, which was $2.00 less than the half chicken. \n\nThen they brought out place mats and silverware and set them down where we were at. We got up as my girlfriend wanted to get some photos near the Steelers signs and banners, and while we were away, they picked up the placemats and silverware along with our 1\/2 empty drinks and removed everything from the bar. When we returned to our spot and made inquiry about our spot, they said \" Oh we thought you left! \" Who the hell orders food and then just leaves. \n\nThen some 25 year old female manager comes by and asks what the problem is, so I told her. She was absolutely no help and gave me the card of the owner \"Danny\" and said to call him if you have a problem.\n\nI called Dan that night and he pretty much told me \" well that's the way we serve it and there's no exceptions\" I asked him if a current Steelers player came in and wanted just two breasts what would happen? Dan said he wouldn't serve it that way to anyone - Bullshit! I felt like he was telling me if you don't like it go somewhere else! Next time - that's what I'll do. Go to The Horny Toad for chicken in the future!
