The fact that I'm here all the time makes it a shame that I had it at four stars. This is my favorite place to be. The food and the beer are always great. All the bartenders are awesome. They're personable, engaging, and don't make you wait for a beer. \n\nMy tastes have changed in that I pretty much always get the barbacoa chicken, double chicken, now. The seasonal beers always keep the selection fresh. Sweet sin chocolate ale?! This place is amazing to me.
