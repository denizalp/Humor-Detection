Stopped in at Andele, because the rating was good - and were promptly (ahem) disappointed.\n\nThough they do offer a variety of sauces, the rest of the meal is not impressive in any way. Perhaps there are not a lot of Mexican choices in the area (and I don't think there are), but surely there has to be something better than this. Though the salsa selection is decent, the chips that it is served with were not impressive in any way.\n\nEven the decorations on the walls were not particular interesting.
