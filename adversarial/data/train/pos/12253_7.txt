I am used to religious hospitals being greedy  profit hungry places, but this place takes the cake. I thought phoenix children's was greedy, but this place is greedier.\n\nThey CHARGE for parking.  What the heck. Finding free parking is hard.\n\nThen their fees for services are insane.  Wanna know why health care is so expensive?  Probably so places like this can give the doctors gold plated toilets.   \n\nAvoid at all costs.
