This place seems like a nice sports bar with a small arcade inside, but unfortunately we won't be back. We stopped by here while on a walk with the intent to grab a quick bite to eat. This place is new so we decided to check it out. \n\nAfter walking around inside for a bit, and checking out the games and seating area, we went up to the front counter to order. We were told that we had to be carded in order to do so, despite it being 2 pm and we had no intention of ordering alcohol. We were told we had to be 21 just to be inside the business. Since one of us didn't have our ID we were forced to leave. \n\nWhat a ridiculous policy for a place that brands itself as a restaurant\/bar. It's also ridiculous that this was the policy even though we look well over 21 and weren't going to sit at the bar or order alcohol. No wonder they had almost no customers. Will not be back and would not recommend!
