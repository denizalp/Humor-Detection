My friends and I read the yelp reviews so we were so eager to try it.  We went last night with hungry stomachs and boy, were we disappointed or what? I don't know if we went in on a bad day or what happened. Most of their nigiri were unbelievable bad. Tuna, salmon, super white tuna, sweet shrimp and uni. None of them I would eat another piece. I refused to eat the uni because the color was brownish looking, very scary. I mentioned that to the waiter and explained it to her the reason I could not eat it. Another waiter came and explained to me the head chef has told him that's how the uni looking like recently. He came and showed me the entire piece to prove that they weren't giving me the old ones. I appreciated they took time and explained. However, I would still not eat it since it looked really awful. \nHowever their rolls and cooked stuff were not so bad. The only thing I would eat from the place is hamachi kama( the yellowtail collar) , that was pretty good and most of the ayce places don't include that. \nThe service was not bad considered we had 11 people and that's the reason I gave two stars. If it weren't for the service, I would have given one star. Won't be returning anytime soon.
