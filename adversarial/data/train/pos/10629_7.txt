Hurricane Bay.. Wow I have got to be honest.. So a friend invites me to go and I'm like, \"Umm.. okay..\". So we show up and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"WTF?\" It's in a SHOPPING center next to a nail place. Also, it's in North Phoenix. I had no idea North Phoenix even had clubs. So we walk in and I'm like, \"Wow this feels like a chessy banquet hall.\" The bar was very easy to get a drink from (plus!) And the drinks were seriously well made. After getting over the cheesiness (and taking a few shots) I made my way to the dance floor with my friends and had a blast. This place reminded me of partying with random co-workers. No one was really dressed up, which was actually cool. The music was surprisingly good and everyone there was very laid back. It was such a mixture of people from young to older and all ethnicities. This is a place that you are almost forced into disliking but just cant :) I wouldn't put it on my top hang outs but if a group decided to go, I'd go!
