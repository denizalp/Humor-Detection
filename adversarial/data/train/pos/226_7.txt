This was my first trip to GRPG and will also be the last.\n\nService:  Most of the staff walk around clueless and huddle up together for chat time.  Their tone, demeanor, and body language reflected on how much they really didn't liked working there.  There seemed to be no management or supervision at all.  I really don't want disgruntled employees handling my food.  Lots of good people looking for jobs out there...\n\nFood:  I ordered the fish and chips (20+$$$)  2 bites is all it took to realize that this tasted like long john silvers's fast food garbage.  It had no seasoning but it didn't lack the oil it was swamped in...very foul!!  The \"chips\" were thick rectangular potato wedges that tasted fine but nothing special.  Our waitress didn't seem to care and was not surprised at all, Hmmmm...makes ya wonder.  She seemed to care more about taking the plates away immediately as though my friend and I came there to scam them out of lunch. My friend ordered a rare and expensive beer that was supposed to be served in a special glass, but that didn't happen.  I wonder if they serve wine in shot glasses...after this experience it would not phase me one bit.\n\nThis place is a tourist trap using Gordon Ramsay's name and prices but clearly not his standards\/quality.  The staff's \"costumes\" are hideous (maybe that's why they seem so disgruntled).  The noise level of this place is equal to a club, hope ya like to lean in and shout to one another!
