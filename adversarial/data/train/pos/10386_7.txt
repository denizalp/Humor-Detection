My family's house has beautiful ivy covering most of the brick on the front that took years to grow. White Shark has been calling my mum bugging her to clean her windows for a year or two, finally she gave in.\n\nThey cleaned the windows by ripping the vines off the house, leaving an uneven mess of dead dangling vines and exposed brick, like a really bad haircut. Even though I was home and had introduced myself to them, they did not bother to ask to see if this was an okay thing to do. In the process of the 'cleaning', they trampled the front garden, destroying a number of plants. Then they had the audacity to write on the invoice \"cleaned your vines away, free of charge!\" They even put one of their signs on our front lawn without asking.\n\nEvery day for a week we called them explaining what had happened, and they said \"oh we'll get back to you\" or \"someone will be out today\" My mother finally had to speak to the president to get anything done.\n\nThey are going to replant the garden, but the vines will take years to grow back. Even then they wanted us to pay to have their mistake fixed!\n\nVery disappointing.
