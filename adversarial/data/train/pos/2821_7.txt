I used to take my tot here a lot. Like \"5 days a week\" a lot. Every entry on my credit card statement is play day cafe. That was last winter when the owner was okay for parent to follow tot upstairs during weekdays when it's not busy.\n\nThis year, however, the staff informed me adults can't go upstairs, or only allowed in the front where the big slides are. I stopped coming here period.\n\nThe problem is two folds for me: \n\n1. Safety: my child has encountered bullies here before. Her head was pinned to the ground by other kids who were maybe a year older than her. This is the intentional behavior. Not to mention the un-intentional frequent incidents when older kids just pushed younger kids around when they rushed through the tunnels. \n\nSo you understand I need to by her side upstairs.\n\n2. Child's developmental need:\nMy tot is still at the age that she wouldn't go anywhere far without the caretaker. So essentially I paid a premium fee for her to utilize 50% of the facility.\n\nYes they have a \"monitor\" staff downstairs. But that  doesn't take care of either condition 1 or 2.
