Maaaaybe my husband and I were here on a bad day.\nWe were visiting from LA over Thanksgiving weekend, stopped by Green Tuesday late afternoon (11\/24). I was super excited, because traveling and veganism don't often go well together unless you meal\/snack prep for your road trip (which I obviously didn't). \n\nI was extremely disappointed. \nFirst of all, the girl that was working the cash register that day is probably a master of resting bitch face. I went up to order, said \"Hi\" and she just stared at me without saying anything. Even when I asked her a question, she grunted. There was barely any interaction between us, she was your typical emo-vegan-Urban Outfitter clad hipster. Okay, that's probably not fair of me, but she really pissed me off. \nFurthermore, a lady came in while I was ordering claiming that she left her car keys or something at the counter. Resting bitch face girl couldn't be bothered. \n\nOKAY, enough ranting about customer service. \n\nFood. \nI got the Thee Green Salad, and my husband got the No Harm Chicken Parm Po-Boy.\nMy husband took a bite of his sandwich and didn't eat the rest. But I'm not a fan of vegan, imitation meat, so I'm not surprised.\n My salad was boring, they were pretty stingy with everything but the \"fresh greens\". Plus, I asked for no tortilla strips, but there they were... \nBlehhhhh.
