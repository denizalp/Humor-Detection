We came here for thanksgiving with the whole family. We had reserved seats so we were seated quickly. The restaurants did not seem busy, but the service was a bit slow.\n\nWe ordered a fair bit of food, and they all came in little bit at a time, which was spaced over an hour period. In my opinion that is quite slow. As in filipino dinning you usually have your rice accompanied with your main entrees. We received our rice first - and then got our first entree 15 minutes later, then our second entree 15 minutes later again, and then the 3rd and 4th being spaced at least 15 minutes apart. \n\nThe main entrees were great, although the servings were quite small. The appetizers we ordered were great as well, our family really liked the kare kare wings. The desserts on the other hand were a bit of a let down. Their cakes were so dry, the ube with ice cream was weird, and the leche flan was nothing special.\n\nOverall, I'm not totally convince that I can recomend Roc's grill as I didn't truly like it or hate it. I think I would come back again for the kare kare wings, but nothing else.
