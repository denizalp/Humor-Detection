A nice Starbucks to grab a drink and sit outside at on a lovely day. I adore the patio at this location and that Jamba Juice is right next door. I have spent a few nicer afternoons chitchatting with friends outside. Inside is a welcoming space good for group meetings (though, only really enough room for one group) or a few small study groups. Customer service is professional and friendly here. I think this might be one of the main hiring locations so it is to be expected you will receive the great, solid, service expect from a Starbucks.
