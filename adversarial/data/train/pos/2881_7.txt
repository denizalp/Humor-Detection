I just joined a gym! With all the gluttonous eating I do, it's probably a good thing. Oh and all the baking and the cooking and the general love of food....\n\nAnyway, my boyfriend and I noticed this Plant Fitness was opening up last month and we decided to see what it was all about. Unfortunately last month they were still under construction so we could not actually see the inside of the gym. We decided not to join based on the fact we couldn't actually take a tour of the facility. This was unfortunate because they were doing an amazing deal $1 start-up fee and $10 a month. $10 a month!! That's crazy cheap for a gym. Anyway, my boyfriend just so happened to see that this month they had extended the deal! We went in yesterday and signed right up.\n\nThe gym is welcome to all types of people. I get the feeling it is more of a family oriented place. It's not for grunters or body-builders. The majority of the gym is for cardio with body-building and ab workout equipment dispersed around the outside. There is also a 30-minute workout center which you can do when you gotta make a quick trip to the gym.\n\nI really like their mottos they have here. One sign said \"We're here to kiss your butt, not kick it... unless that's what you want!\" I love it! This is because I honestly HATE HATE HATE going to the gym and exercising. I will admit it! I really do not enjoy it. BUT I know I have to do something to stay active and keep the pounds off. It's a trade off I guess. I eat like a Roman elite and then I have to go work it off. \n\nI hope Planet Fitness stays this way, because I have a feeling it will be a very good gym for me and my boyfriend.
