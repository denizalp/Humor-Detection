This Cracker Barrel is very clean, well ran, good food and some very good employees.  The breakfast here is better than \"The Good Egg\" and also better then \"Denny's\" in my humble opinion.  \n\nSome recommendations:  Moma's Pancake Breakfast ~ You get three buttermilk pancakes, two eggs cooked to order with your choice of any fruit topping or syrup. I usually go for the hot fried apples with an extra side of their maple syrup as a filler.  This is served with smoked sausage patties, turkey sausage patties or thick-sliced bacon.  This is a HUGE breakfast full of carb's so be prepared to walk it off afterwards!  \n\nAnother recommendation is their Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast ~ You get two Eggs cooked to order with grits, gravy and buttermilk biscuits, oh ya, and get their  Apple Butter to go with the biscuits. It also comes with your choice of fried Apples or hashbrown casserole, go for the hashbrown casserole and their country fried steak.  This is enough food for two people!!  \n\nYes this is a chain, but this Crackle Barrel is worth it.  They are consistent  with their execution in preparing their breakfast dishes and their services is very good.  Maybe I will see you there!
