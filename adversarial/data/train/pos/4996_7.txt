Ah, McDonalds, how you suck! However, this location isn't so bad because of the late hours so we can visit after the bar.\n\nThis review is for the fun times I've had in this location - especially nights after the Cameron House!\n\nSometimes there's live entertainment - courtesy of common drunkenness. Good times - especially after 2:00am!\n\nThe food still sucks! Four stars for the entertainment only!
