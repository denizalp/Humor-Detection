I don't know how this place got 5 stars from those 3 people! I am so upset ... So my boyfriend & I decide to come here after a long day at work to unwind but the doors are locked. I pushed the door bell and after a little while we walk away thinking it's closed but then a lady comes to the door saying \"what you need?\" I ask if they're open so says \"yes.\" We walk in and she says \"you want 30 or 60 minutes\", I ask for 2 60 minute massages then she says something to her coworkers in her language have then sighs, looks at my boyfriend & I then says \"CASH ONLY\"\n\nWell just coming off work I forgot to get cash because normally most massage places take card. She then has the nerve to say \"you go to ATM down the street and come back\" .... UH NO BYE! Worst customer service WITHOUT even smiling how rude. If I could put 0 stars for this place I would.
