(This is going to be a really long read, so here are my quick tips for enjoying Gelatology: absolutely avoid being full before coming here, sample all the gelato flavors, try not to mix intense flavors with subtle flavors, make sure to use a gelato spoon instead of a broader white plastic spoon, get larger cup sizes.)\n\nYou might say that Downtown Las Vegas's loss is the Southwest's gain, but the big picture is that everyone in town can rejoice over having Desyree's gelato again (or for the first time, for some slackers).\n\nDesyree Alberganti was the driving force behind the renowned Art of Flavors, which Yelpers may recall is ranked at #2 on Yelp's list of the top 100 places in the entire country to try in 2015 (thanks to a stratospheric rating average from 2014's reviews). After her sad departure from that business due to \"unavoidable circumstances,\" she has opened her own place in under half a year.\n\nAnd what a place it is. It should be highlighted that the shared parking lot is much larger than that awkward triangular area outside AoF. The neighborhood here has a much safer feel too. As for Gelatology itself, it seems much more welcoming inside. The music is significantly more \"top 40\" than the old radio-station piggyback, and it blares not too loudly from a centrally located speaker. The interior decor has much brighter colors than AoF did. Part of the wall in the seating area is brightly colored in a way resembles some frozen yogurt shops, and the chairs are cushioned instead of just hard and wooden.\n\nPosters on that wall explain Desyree's vision for Gelatology. I originally had no idea what she was doing with the cumbersome name, but it clicked when I read that it's based on \"gelotology,\" an actual term for the study of laughter. I'm a big fan of wordplay, and it perfectly represents the enjoyment witnessed when Desyree and her employees interact with customers young and not-as-young alike. The logo is cute too.\n\nThe menu at Gelatology now includes takes on sundaes, shakes, and even pastries (displayed in a case next to the front door). The dessert paninis aren't around yet, but a little birdy told me that they will be back and better than ever. The gelato case holds 18 flavors. A quick glance at old AoF photos suggests that it might be a slight reduction in options, but it looks like each slot holds a unique flavor now (whereas there were occasionally duplicates in her former shop). Therefore, the selection is either the same or barely decreased.\n\nI was actually quite underwhelmed during my first visit due to various circumstances (being full from dinner, getting free samples of many things, feeling a bit rushed by my companion, not using a gelato spoon), but my taste buds found familiar and new treats today. After this second try, I'm now fully confident that the same consistent, creamy gelato base is back and perhaps better than ever.\n\nA breakdown of gelato flavors that I've had so far:\n\n- I loved the brand new flavors of apple fritter (a great take on typically heavy donut shop fare) and mille foglie dulce de leche (bits of the pastry also known as \"mille feuille\" or \"Napoleon\" lending its ubiquitous flavor).\n\n- Rosemary creme brulee, an iteration on elements of old favorites, is also a success in my book.\n\n- The cookie butter and pistachio have the same great flavor as always, as does the chocolate sorbetto. This chocolate actually now has an airy texture that you typically don't get from a milk-free dessert. Desyree credits this change to having exact temperature control, unlike at her old digs.\n\n- Espresso chocolate w\/ caramel is nice, but the coffee can get drowned out in a cup w\/ other strong flavors.\n\n- Personally, I could go without the bomboloni (my companion's choice), and the dark cherry gelato sample seemed very light in flavor at the time.\n\n- No envelope-pushing savory flavors yet, but I'm sure they'll make an appearance soon enough.\n\nThe new products are at least worth exploring. The house soda, which has a dark tart cherry flavor, is actually a pleasant and refreshing beverage. It's not bubbly like some would expect from the name, but the flavor is balanced. It's my favorite new offering thus far. However, the baked goods have yet to impress. The palmier (aka ventaglio) isn't as buttery as I'd like, and both the Nutella biscuit and the dulce de leche and coconut flavored \"alfajor\" seem to offer more in texture than in flavor. I haven't tried the mille foglie or the tiramisu yet, but I will eventually. Those two seem to be the most promising.\n\nFortunately, Desyree's gelato still has a combination of value, consistent texture, sugar balance, and variety\/innovation that isn't quite met by Las Vegas's other best gelato shops. Add in excellent hospitality (\"customer service\" being too formal) and you get a winning recipe. I just wish it wasn't so far from me! I'd know I'd be here all the time if I could reach it in 15 minutes or less. I suppose the inconvenience is best for my pancreas...
