The experience wasn't so good for us. My family of five went there bc of the rave reviews on yelp and surprised by how so many ppl liked it there. They charged $5 adults, and $2 child, then they nickel and dime you for everything else in there. I realize it is farm so you expect the smell, but the whole place in general was so unkept. Everything in there seemed so filthy, I could not believe they were allowed to sell food in there. Being in there for an hour I had a bit understanding on how avian influenza may have came about. Close quarters, excrements, close direct contact animals...etcetc.  Also for a halloween theme event my wife and I didn't feel they didn't put in much effort. I have to emphasize again how unkept the place felt (to me).  2 redeeming value the farm had, imo, the horse ride my seven year daughter loved it and I've heard they were a rescue shelter for unwanted animals which I think is pretty cool... I hope the owners make some major renovation or hire management to clean up the place, would hate to see a place like this closed for the public and people losing jobs and income revenues and such....
