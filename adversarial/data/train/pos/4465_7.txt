I was going to give it three stars, but the perfunctory check delivery without even a \"HEY, F*CKERS, ARE YOU DONE YET?\" pissed me off. \n\nThe food was OK. I mean that. It was fair. I was not blown away. The flank steak with a fancy name was flank steak with assorted mushrooms. I had higher hopes for the accompanying bits like the \"garlic custard\". Custard my ass. \n\nMy dining partner thoroughly enjoyed her dish. Or maybe she was just being polite. She's polite. \n\nWe had some starters too. I can't remember what they were, because see above re: OK\/fair. \n\nThe cocktails were also unremarkable and inoffensive. My first was way too sweet, but some people like sweet. \n\nDraft beers were ok, but I think their draft system is putting out too little CO2. \n\nSo, food-wise it's deserving of a solid three stars, as noted above. HOWEVER, our server was a complete dick. He was inattentive and generally attitudey. I get it, we're lowly paying customers, but Jesus Christ dude, try being slightly personable. Give me a little info about the entrees, deliver starters to each diner at the same time, don't drop the check at our table in passing assuming that we were done spending money. The fact is, we weren't. However I'm more than happy to take my remaining dollars elsewhere and will ensure that future dollars don't end up in your employer's coffers.
