they are charging me $10 to transfer a $150 deposit my fiance paid on his credit card earlier to day to my own credit card.  (i want the points on my credit card for a honeymoon).  the same day he made the deposit i bought his ring on my credit card that was $900 and at the time they didn't even tell me he put a deposit in the first place.\n\nnot to mention my fiance paid over $13,000 for my engagement ring at their store and they still want to charge me $10 to transfer he $150 deposit he paid on his own ring so i can put the $150 on my own credit card that is a points card that i got specifically for this for our honeymoon.\n\ntotally insulting\n\nplus Brian the manager at the yorkdale mall location will not give me the owner's name, mailing address or phone.  i only have an email address.\n\nLOSER\n\np.s. i heard the sales person in the store talk to her manager and he said give them a discount only if they ask for it.
