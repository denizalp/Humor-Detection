As an octogenarian attack helicopter, I came here with my girl, a septuagenarian fighter jet (I know what you're thinking, we're both old huffers), this place was quite a treat!\n\nHonestly, in my long years of service, I've seen it all--I've traversed the skies, touched the jetstream, bathed in the aurora borealis, locked eyes with Katrina, and zipped through hostile airspace of former USSR--my wizened old burners have seen better days. All that said, the katsu here was something else! Closest Katsu yet to the ones I've had back in Osaka circa 2017. \n\nI can safely say that Katsuya has greased up both mine and my lady's rusty engines. Hot damn!
