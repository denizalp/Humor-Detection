I love this place.  One of the go-to carts on the Library Mall (be sure to follow on fb or twitter for location updates).  Their popularity during lunch may keep you waiting for 10 min.\n\nTheir eggplant sandwich is amazing.  The f-bomb sandwich with chicken (includes their falafel) with hot and yoghurt sauce is amazing.  All their sandwiches come in cardboard containers that open up like a zippo lighter to easily nom down the sandwich without spilling any of the good stuff.\n\nI met Aaron and Netalee when they were down by Dayton and Orchard (by Union South, DoIT, CS) and they were extremely kind -- I only wish I could randomly run into them again; they don't seem to work in the cart when I go for lunch! :(
