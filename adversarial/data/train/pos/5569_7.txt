I needed a haircut and a quick Google search for local businesses brought up Vanguard Hair. After reading the glowing reviews on Yelp I decided to give Vanguard a try. I was not disappointed! Julie hung my coat up for me when I arrived and Diana's interest in my needs was very sincere. I wasn't offered any drinks, but I did notice agave nectar at the bar, which is great for the health-conscious. My favourite part was the wash; I hate standard hairdresser sinks because they hurt my neck, but Vanguard's sinks have a nice head rest so I didn't strain my neck. I received a 25% discount because it was my first visit, so I paid $37.50 for a great haircut! They also charge a $1.50 'green fee' which goes towards the pick-up of salon materials for recycling. Diana - at my request - recommended some shampoo and conditioner for my hair that was damaged by a not-so-great perm. She was knowledgeable and honest about the products. The place is a little tricky to find so keep your eyes open for the sign on north side of Wellington; you can get to the parking from the driveway in front or the sidestreet. The underground parking certainly is a plus. This salon is Redken exclusive.
