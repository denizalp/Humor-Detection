Somebody on Facebook mentioned Taylor's as a good place for seafood on the West side, so I checked out the Yelp reviews.  I think I had realistic expectations going in, sort of a blue hair place, nothing fancy but good bang for the buck.\nI ordered a cup of New England clam chowder (it's a chowder house, right?) and the grilled Mahi.  The chowder was okay, a good amount of clams, but it had an odd flavor to me...cheap sherry maybe?  It's basically just potato and clam and I personally like some bacon, celery, etc.\nThe Mahi was definitely strange, I expect a 'grilled' piece of fish to be simply cooked over some sort of open flame.  It arrived scored on top with no visible grill marks.  It also had a sort of teriyaki sauce on top that, frankly, ruined the fish-it was hideous.
