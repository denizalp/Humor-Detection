If you're not in the mood for Vegas-style buffets, go to noodles. If you don't want to wait in lines, go here. The meals offered at this eatery is simple and satisfying. I jumped for joy when I saw Congee on the menu! wohoo! never mind if they charged $14 per bowl.  I got my \"sick-man-soup\" fix.  \nThe siu mai was fine. But for a place that's supposed to just serve noodles, they need to fix their Singaporean curry noodle dish.  This is just too bland for me.
