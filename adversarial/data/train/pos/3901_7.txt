Great reviews from everyone else but I was disappointed. \n\nWhat happened? Well for one was bad service.  To begin with our waiter Sam was great! He was right over to greet us, bring our drinks and inform us of the steak choices.  For the rest of the evening, we didn't see him until he brought dessert menus.  Usually I like to be checked on during the meal. Several others came to our table to refill drinks or bring the meals.  Sam was no where to be seen.  We had to ask another waiter to find ours so we could get the bill.  Very unfortunate.  \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the Alaskan Cod. Our table chose to share the sides of Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes & White Cheddar along with Mac & Cheese.  The cod was very very small.  The flavor was ok but could've been better.  I realize it is a steakhouse but I've had much better.  The potatoes did not have any garlic or cheddar flavor in them.  It was the first time I've had to salt and pepper potatoes at a restaurant.  I will say the Mac and Cheese was really creamy and delicious.  \n\nThis dining experience was less than average all around.  I was really hoping for excellent since we made a special trip to dine with them.
