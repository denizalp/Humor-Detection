Yelp staff were fantastic in putting this fun and foodie event together! Vendors were gracious & what a great way to get an overview of the local shops. Passport was ideal & an informative way to see the sights & shop! We enjoyed going into all the locations & sampling their goods and checking out their services. Such a enjoyable event!
