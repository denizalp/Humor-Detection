They got everything a Korean needs here. What more can you ask for? Nothing from me it's great \n\nToo all the people that bitch about the smallest things, get a life and worry about bigger issues. \n\nRemember this is not a huge chain of grocery stores like Frys. So if they want to charge 50 cents for using your card for under 10 bucks then so be it. You don't need to shop there. Fees add up and I understand and we live in a world that people will by a pack of gun using their debit card. Ok my rant is over.
