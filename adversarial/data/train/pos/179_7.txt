And what were the food critics of Travel & Leisure smoking when they voted Chou's \"Best Chinese Restaurants in the US\"? We've been hearing about this place for a year or so, everyone \"RAVES\" about the food. We finally read about it in the Travel & Leisure and gave it a shot today for lunch at 12:15 PM. Coming from NYC and dining at the best tiny holes in the wall, our expectations were high especially based on previous reviews read.\n\nCustomer service was very friendly, though a bit slow. Now onto the food review, I knew we were in trouble when I ordered hot tea and I opened the lid to see if the tea was ready and it was a tea bag instead of tea leaves, additionally the water that was delivered to the table had a horrible taste to it. We order:\n-  Hot and sour soup for 2, may have been the best part of our lunch, good, but didn't pack a punch on either spicy or sour.\n-  Beef Pies, what's all the hype, took a bite and got a mouthful of greasy juice, ground up mystery meat which was wrapped in a fried pancake.\n- Steamed dumplings with pork and napa cabbage, again OK, these may have been the best choice out of all the dumplings, they came out hot and were OK tasting.\n- Fried pork buns, horrible, doughy and the filling had no taste.\n- Orange Chicken, OK tasting, a little heavy on the batter and was not orange tasting enough.\n\nAll in all not a repeat visit in our book and certainly not a Travel & Leisure's \"Best Chinese Restaurants in the US\" vote from us.
