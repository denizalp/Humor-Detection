UPDATED STAR RATING to 5.  After thinking about it, and looking back, it really was a 5-Star experience. Nothing is ever going to be perfect, but this night really came close. Memorable, and all my guests genuinely had a great time.  \n\n============================================\n\nI thought I would just provide a update from my initial review on general cost since it wasn't really specified in my original review. \n\nAnd would also likely be helpful for people that are doing high level research for wedding venues. \n\nThe overall cost came up to about $155 pp. with tip and tax (remember, this adds about 30%). Now costs have probably increased overall due to inflation from 2011. \n\nThis is definitely higher than the average generic banquet hall wedding which can range from $80-$120 for ones with those late night buffets, but in line with other more 'niche', premium wedding places.  It helped being Asian that almost all guests give money as a gift, as that helped with our cost. \n\nBasically, the cost is the average of 'niche' places which is around $150 pp.  Graydon hall I believe is closer to $200.  \n\nThe venue rental fee itself, was about $2500 for the largest room and about $1500 for the one downstairs in the same building, and $1000 for the smaller 2 houses located further back.  \n\nThere is a minimum amount that needs to be spent (something like $10,000), which will easily be met assuming you have at least ~70% of the room capacity.\n\nFoo\n\n1) Oh'Deurves Per Item $3.30 x 3 items\n\nTotal All items $9.90 (we ended up with alot left over.  Would have done maybe 2 as alot was left over).  Everybody raved about them.  \n  \n2) Appetizer: Salad garden salad $8.50\n  \n3) Main: herb crusted and roasted beef tenderloin $44.00. This was the more expensive steak.  \n\nThe certified angus beef striploin medallions $39.00 was the one included in the package. (there are other meat choices I believe)\n\nFish was also available, which was about $30 I believe.  A vegetarian was also in the low $30s. \n\n4) Dessert sorbet trio $14.00.    This was also more expensive. We wanted something refreshing to finish off since it was also during summer. \n\nExample of less expensive, average Desssert:  tahitian vanilla bean white chocolate crème brulée $10.50 which would be included in the set package.\n\n\nSo my FOOD ONLY a La Carte was: \n\nTotal  $76.40\nHST  $9.93\n15% Tip  $11.46\nTotal Food before Alcohol  $97.79 per person.  (it was actually cheaper since ~1\/.3 was maybe fish)\n\nThe ''PACKAGE' cost would have been: \nTotal  $67.90\nHST  $8.83\n15% Tip  $10.19\nTotal Food before Alcohol  $86.91 per person\n\nRemember, you can also choose a la carte that will also look like this.  Kids menue is cheap with Chicken fingers and fries at $12\n\n5) Fruit dessert and coffee at the end of the night came up to about $750 total assuming 100 ppl.  There were definitely less people who took advantage of that so you can lower your headcount significantly by then. \n\nWe also spent about $330 on cocktail hours champagne ($110 per gallon for the alcohol, and $55 for non alcohol).  Total, 2 gallons each.  We probably could have cut back on this too. \n\n\nNow, On to Alcohol. \n\nWe did NOT Get this. Just showing for general purposes: \nAlcohol FLAT FEE BAR - SEATED MEAL EVENT $33.00\nHST  $4.29\n15% Tip  $4.95\nTotal For Alcohol  $42.24 per person\n\nAll places price it like this.  Even generic banquet hall alcohol price portion is like this.  They ASSUME average about $5.50 per drink x 6 drinks per guest per night. For about 4 hours.  Shut off a portion during dinner.  I don't remember if the wine was included.  This was for the basic (you don't get premium drink choices.. vodka is Smirnoff vs Grey Goose). \n\nWhen I looked at my guest count, 150 ppl, 100 would have been light to no drinkers (older, drivers, etc).  So for every person that doesn't drink, another person has to make up for it with 12 drinks.  \n\nThere was also a serving time limit of 4 hours.  So you shut off for an hour or so during dinner. \n\nI went with a la carte.  You order the drink. They do inventory, and charge you afterwards.  i didn't want a limit on the hours available.  And decided to offer more premium drinks (you get to choose what is available on the drink menu for people to choose). Premium drinks really do go down easier and less hangover the next day.  \n  \nTotal, came up to about $42 pp before tax and tip (This also included bottles of white and red at each table).  Now this is where a few had alot.  People were at the bar during dinner hours. All night.  It added that continued energy.  \n\nthis is where if your guest list likely won't drink extensively, and you don't offer premium drinks, it can really be low per person for the A La Carte.  Maybe even mid $20 pp.  \n\nIt definitely added more work, but it really added to that Non-Generic feel of the experience for ourselves and guests.  \n\nIf we really wanted to, we could have cut back on certain things, be more efficient, and brought the cost down another $25-30
