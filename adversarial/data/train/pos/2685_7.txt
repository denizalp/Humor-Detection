OH. MY. BIG. FAT. GREEK. WEDDING.\n\nThe Greek Grill is FAN-Tsatziki-TIC! \n\nSeriously, this is the most wonderful tzatziki I have ever tasted. Mr. Rosie S. agrees. \n\nWe ordered catering for dinner after rehearsals. They delivered to the rehearsal hall downtown (Queen & Yonge) and everything was hot and delicious, even after sitting for 15 minutes after being delivered. \n\n*Round of Applause*\n\nWe had:\n- Tzatziki\n- Hummus\n- Village Salad\n- SO MUCH PITA\n- Chicken Souvlaki Sticks\n- Pork Gyros\n- RICE GALORE\n- Lemon Roasted Potatoes\n\n*burp*\n\nEveryone loved it. I will dream of this tzatziki for life.
