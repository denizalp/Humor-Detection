Finally managed to snag a seat at the ever busy Manic. Service seems to have taken a slide from my last visit, as I was thoroughly ignored for two minutes. (One usually expects to be ignored for no more than 45 seconds in a too-cool-for-school cafe like this.) \n\nThe americano was quality (and served in a mug heavy as a cinderblock), but I am now disillusioned about my desire to chill here. Seating in the back seems strangely hot and humid and I could swear I was feeling the onset of malaria back there. No wifi either. What gives guys?\n\nOTOH: my wild blueberry scone was a delicious and crumbly adventure. I'm still undecided about this place, so three stars it shall remain.
