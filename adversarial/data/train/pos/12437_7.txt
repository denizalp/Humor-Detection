Wasn't sure what to expect - last minute reservations on Open Table for our b'day steak dinner coupled with 1star to 5 star reviews from my fellow Yelpers.\n\nLove the Beverly Hills location.  1st time at the LV one.\n\nOur server Bobbie was a doll.  He was funny, attentive & accommodating.  My 1\/2 of the group got there on time and sat at the bar for a bit.  Bartender lady was very nice & makes some strong but flavorful drinks (friend ordered Washington Apple shots).\n\nMy medium rare ribeye came out perfect & sizzling on that hot platter of butter.  Sides of baked potato & asparagus were spot on.  We were even served a comp side of mushrooms (pretty good too!).\n\nI guess we were lucky in that fact that all our food was delicious - so much that we couldn't eat dinner.\n\nOnly item that was a little off was the chopped salad.  I had it in BHills before & it was delicious!  I split it with my b\/f...it was - dry?  I mean there was practically no salad dressing at all...not even lightly tossed - I got the flavoring from their bacon bits.  That was the only downside to the meal - it looked pretty...just tasted like a carnivorous rabbit's food.
