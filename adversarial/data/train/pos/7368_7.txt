I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in this vet service.  They are only concerned with making money, not treating sick animals.  Due to moving accounts, I didn't have enough cash and no ATM card yet to make a payment until my husband came home late that day.  My puppy was whining and crying in pain with a UTI but we were refused service.  When I asked if a 2 month old pup could go long with a UTI, the receptionist said she had no idea, but it didn't matter if we couldn't make payment immediately. My husband and I retired early -- we have more than enough money to afford a pet, but she wouldn't even consider helping poor Maggie.  Thank God for Back 2 Basics Vets and Dr. Laura down the street.  They saw Maggie right away and treated her and even gave her something for the pain.  I would definitely NOT refer anyone to Deer Grove Vet Clinic!!!
