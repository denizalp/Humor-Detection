Ok guys.  Please go somewhere else.  They fleece you from start to finish.  Management charges girls more, they rip u off.  Lap dances are 20-40 each and girls and average.   At other clubs like sapphire, all dances are 20$ and the girls are better looking and sooo much nicer.   The girls last night were predators.    Seriously though, I know the girls are out for money, but god, pretend you interested in visiting w us!Girls try to charge you more if you look like you have money.   Free limo ride is not free....you have to tip.   After we got there and bought a bottle package online and included tips.....they told me I had to pay more gratuity because they took some money out is the gratuity for a service change.   \n\nBtw.  If you get a free drink, you don't have a Guaranteed seat.  \n\nSkip.  Skip.  Unless ur desperate and can't go anywhere else.
