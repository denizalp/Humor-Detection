Rumour has it this is where the bagel was invented.\n\nWell technically polish Jews brought the recipe over from Europe, but as far as the North American bagel is concerned, St-Viateur Bagel is considered to be ground zero of the bagel phenomenon.\n\nThe quality of their bagels are consistently excellent. They're cheap and plentiful. You can waltz in here in the middle of the night and get yourself a bagel, or twelve.\n\nThe secret to the distinctly sweet flavour is that before Montreal style bagels are baked, they're boiled in honey water.\n\nThis bakery is strictly a bakery, mind you, there's nowhere to sit. There is another St-Viateur location on Mont Royal with seating and service if that's what you're looking for.\n\nOverall one of the staples and mainstays of Montreal cuisine. Not to be missed on any trip
