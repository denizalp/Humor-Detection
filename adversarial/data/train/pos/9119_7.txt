Brio what happened!?\n\nKnocked a few stars down because our waitress never took our drink order...and it was 117 degrees outside!\n\nFood as usual was fabulous especially the Lobster Bisque my favorite and my husband's halibut was devine, but my steak dinner off the lo-cal menu was under cooked and salty:( but tender and juicy.\n\nLuckily we were smart enough to ask for water when we came in but on days like this...leave the pitcher! \n\nShe never came back to pour us more water, we had to constantly hound her all night for drinks!  \n\nShe never took a \"drink\" order, she didn't ask us if we wanted wine, soft drinks, juice, blah blah blah.  \n\nWe had our appetizers served and we were still sucking on dry straws from the tap water she gave us 20 minutes ago when we sat down, WTH?  No no no!\n\nNo bueno! \n\nI think she was new, she was very sweet but seriously no drink orders? \n\nVamp up the service people, especially on hot scorching days!  \n\nNo excuses!
