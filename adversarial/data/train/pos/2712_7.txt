If you have never been to Venice, Italy, come to Venetian hotel, just to get a little taste of it first!\n\nLove all the painting on the ceiling. Love the grand lobby area. Casino is totally crowded, a lot of action happening!\n\nMany good restaurants in the hotel. Love the Canal Shops. While you are shopping, don't forget to check out the gondola~ Great picture spot!!
