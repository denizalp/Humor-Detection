Great food and equally great drinks (beers and mixed).  Really flavorful burgers. So many ways to customise and a variety of meats to select from-turkey, chicken, bison, salmon, and more as well as a variety of toppings to make it just right for individual tastes. Waitress are sweet and attentive as well as management- hopefully this stays even after the newness goes away.  Parking can be tough -may have to do side street or across the street as their personal parking lot is very small.
