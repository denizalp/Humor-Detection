I purchased lighting for our new home from them and boy do I wish I hadn't. Yes they have a huge selection of lightening, sadly though don't stock most of it. This leads to my first complaint, charging retail prices AND passing freight charges to the customer without disclosing the information except for fine print on the receipt. Secondly, when we found a large scratch in our new fixture we received a very condescending attitude from the customer service staff upon calling and asking for an exchange. If it weren't for the 25% restocking fee I'd return the merchandise and shop on-line for a 25% discount including the shipping charges. So much for supporting local business. \n\nBottom line: Beautiful showroom - ugly customer service, hidden freight charges, and silly return policy. Shop elsewhere.. unless the service changes if you are buying a $1,000 light for your bathroom...
