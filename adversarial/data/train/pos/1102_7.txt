Okay suuuuure, the team is a \"Factory of Sadness\" filled with fans with low expectations. It's beginning to be painful. But what about the stadium?\n\nStarting with the good...\n\nThe seating was nice. I most likely found it to be extremely nice because it was snowing\/raining for the game I went to and we were under an awning where we were protected from the lake's fiery spit.\n\nThe bad...\n\nI get it, it's crowded when entering. The security's way of dealing with this was to split males, females and families. Problem here is, once you stop people from entering they stand right inside and wait for their party. Security comes around and yells. This is what went down. Security: \"Sir I am asking you nicely to move forward\". Fan: \"And I am telling you nicely I am not moving until I have my kid\" More scuffle, more security trying to be BA. Cop comes over, agrees with fan, stands and waits with him, causing more people standing in the area they wanted cleared. What a mess. Don't cut off groups of people and expect parents to just move up and leave their kid behind.\n\nThe ugly...\n\nWell, besides the Browns catching ability, the worst of all was the food service. I ordered a coffee. They were out but gave me a hot chocolate instead. Oh, did I mention it was in a fountain drink cup with no lid. It burnt my hand due to how thin it was and was hot for about 2 seconds because they \"don't get lids\". Ordered a hamburger, they were out of buns. Ordered a hamburger with a hot dog bun, kid points at burgers and says... I wouldn't eat those things. Brings us a chicken finger basket and fries were cold and chick looked like it had just sat around for some time. Long story short, get food before you go and spare yourself the time and frustration of the over priced food.
