Smoked meat sandwich. Pickle. Fries. What a meal! Everything was perfect. Meat piled high on rye bread with mustard, plate of perfectly cooked and seasoned fries, and a nice sour pickle. If you want a light lunch, split the sandwich with a friend. It's really not as big as it looks in the photos! \n\nWe waited in line for only a few minutes before being offered seats at the counter. \n\nThe whole time I'm sitting there wondering what animal smoked meat comes from, but not wanting to ask. It's not any of the reviews on Yelp that I could find, and I've never seen it in Portland. I was way too afraid to ask, and it took a fair amount of Googling to find out that it's corn beef that's been slowly smoked and heavily seasoned with a variety of seasonings. It's delicious is what it is. \n\nGreat service. The guy who helped us was hilarious. At the end of the meal he asked us if we were ready for dessert. 'What do you have?' 'More meat!' We may not have been ready then, but we sure are now!
