Well groomed and well maintained park and facilities. There's even a portapotty available in the parking lot.\n\nSeparate section for small dogs (and their owners :oP).\n\nThe loop is small compared to Prairie Moraine but there was still enough furbuddies for our puppers to sniff and romp around with.
