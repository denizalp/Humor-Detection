Top notch casual local watering hole in a part of Charlotte called \"Fourth Ward.\" It is inside the 277 perimeter and not far from the skyscrapers of Uptown.\n\nIn addition to a number of great local brews on tap, they have an excellent menu of bar grub that's better than most places. The burgers are top notch and even on a busy night, did not take long to appear.
