DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT MOVING IN...I move here about a year ago, and i did everything in my power to leave as soon as i could. So lets start : \n1.- They broke into my car and stole everything (notice the car was parked inside the garage ). they didn't do anything about it.\n2.- They broke in to my roommates car and stole everything (they did nothing again) we track the phones and realize that they were located across the street (siegel suites ) we let the police know and they told us that this type of crime happens here for the past three years and they haven't done anything about it.\n3.- someone on my floor was held at gun point and robbed.\n4.- management changes all the time so you never know who are u dealing with.\n5.- police and ambulance will disturb you everyday at night time because there is always something happening at siegel suits (across the street )\n\nlast I spoke with management (tony) wasn't  the best person to deal with he got this attitude and he thinks he knows better. all i wanted was my deposit and get the hell out .\n\nconclusion\n \ni will not recomend this place to anyone specially if you have kids it is a very dangerous area.\ni you are a women don't even think about it it is not a save place.
