As it would happen, choosing The Mission as a place to pre-game the evening's events was the best decision my crew made all night. (For my sake's anyway).\n\nThere was the ambiance....\nThe ambiance here envelopes you, much like that first wave of warmth you get from a vicodin, scotch and Red Bull blast. In fact, this place is so warm and cozy, it'll make you feel like you're back in the womb flipping off the ultrasound technician.\n\nThe service...\nPerched at their communal high top, a long and double-sided table adjacent to the bar, our server was more attentive than a lion tamer with a big stick. This made it an absolute certainty I would lose the first of my five senses in a very short period...hearing.\nThe weird thing about those communal tables is how you never know who you're going   to sit next to. Who do I get?\nA gaggle of what I can only conjecture were church ladies whom, at my merely uttering (90 decibels) the word 'FUCK', would violently, and in unison, snap their heads in my direction. Now this was fun.\nYes, my prodigious cursing made for quite the theatrics as, with the same precision of Old Faithful, five heads would whip about on cue giving me the skunk-eye.\nWhat a hoot.\n\nThe Food....\nThe food was, well, I'm not sure. It looked and smelled good, but I was down to three senses by the time we finally ordered. Sadly, taste, much like Elvis, had left the building at that point. Good thing for our dates who were quick to inform us (routinely droning on throughout the meal) about how delicious everything was. (Blah Blah Blah)\n\nThe bill for four of us came to two hundred twelve dollars before tip. We had drinks, some very cool looking appetizers, enough chips and salsa to feed a small Ethiopian village, a bevy of drink, and some entrees whose names I couldn't remember if my life depended on it.\n\nAs I said, pre-gaming at the Mission was the best decision we made all night. \nWho could ever know that with one well-timed (and perhaps highly audible) \"FUCK\", I held the awesome power to control my very own Women's Synchronized Scowling Team.\nFor at least one night of my miserable existence, I WAS omnipotent.\n\nThanks Mission.
