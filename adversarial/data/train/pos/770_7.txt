New tables?  New decor?  New washrooms?\n\nThe new Calgary Court is like a girl from high school that you haven't seen for awhile. Back in the day, you kinda liked her, but it wasn't anything too special.  \n\nFast forward one year later, you bump into her at the mall, and she's strutting a new outfit, new hairstyle, new makeup and you are suddenly mesmerized.  That, my friends, is the new Calgary Court.\n\nAs James C mentioned, if it is a late night and you aren't digging the bar food scene, Calgary Court is a pretty solid bet. Service is still pretty bad, but the food is decent.
