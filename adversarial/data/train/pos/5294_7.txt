I looked up delivery pizza on Yelp.  Among the many places, Lucky's Pizza was listed.  It is relatively close to where I was staying and has at least one good review, and so I called.  The phone was curtly answered, and I identified myself. I then asked for an order to be delivered.   The immediate reply was \"we don't delivery, buddy\"!    I was shocked.  I then asked this person what he just said? He repeated it.   I asked if he worked there or was an owner or manager?  He said he worked there.  I then said that \"you never speak to a customer in that way\".   His reply:  \"Do you think I give a shit\"?!  He then hung up. \n\nRest assured that if this is the kind of attitude that is tolerated by management, the quality and likely the safety, of their food is highly questionable.
