Hop Topic is the store where everyone bounces around on one leg. This is not that.\n\nI don't like mall stores but this is one I do like. Probably the only one. OK no, I like Lush, Body Shop, VS, and others. But Hot Topic might be my fave. It has a few edge and sexy things, lots of great hair dye (some of which I've used), and this particular location has plenty of everything, really nice employees, and plays some pretty cool music too.\n\nThe only reason it doesn't get 5 is the high prices.
