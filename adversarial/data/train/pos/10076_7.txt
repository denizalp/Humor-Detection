This place seems to be getting a bad wrap, and to be honest, I don't understand why...\n\nConveniently located on Living Arts Drive, directly across the street from the new Sheridan College Mississauga campus and at the base of the condos where TD Help & Advice Center and Union Burger are. It's literally a 5 minute walk away from Celebration Square.\n\nFamily owned and operated, the husband and wife team that run this place (helped out by their adult kids) are incredibly hospitable and friendly.\n\nThe design aesthetic is a beautiful hybird between a take-away spot and an elegant sit down restaurant, the cool thing is that the owner used to be an architect and designed the space entirely himself. Super cool! Even better - they've got Free Wifi so if you're taking a working lunch (or taking a break from school-- this is the place).\n\nOne word that describes their food offerings is; value. You get so much for so little that I don't honestly know how they get by. The mixed grill platter has so much food in it that two people could easily share it an be stuffed!\n\nTheir specialty rice is something called Cinnamon Rice, which is totally different and equally mind blowing! I'm not usually a 'rice person' but this was so different I had to finish my plate.\n\nFor the 'on the go' person, I'd highly recommend their shawarma sandwiches and\/or their mediterranean philly cheese steak sandwich. Both pretty darn tasty and good bang for you buck!\n\nCheck this place out and tell them that Kris from Yelp sent you ;)
