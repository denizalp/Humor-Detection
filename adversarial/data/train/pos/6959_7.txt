Honestly, people...for an economy car price, we're getting middle class luxury at this joint.\n\nHubby and I received a postcard in the mail for a special 3-night deal which worked out to be $52 a night for 2 double beds.  Wow...we jumped on that mutha right away.\n\nChecking in was a breeze.  Our person was friendly and offered us upgrades when asked.  Nothing monumental but I upgraded us to a room with a fridge, pillowtop and a nicer view for $10 more a day.\n\nSame thing I noticed in other nicer hotels - it's definitely smokier than before.  They must be cutting back on ventilation to save energy??  Also, we happened to be there during a very busy week - some sort of high school basketball tournament so there were kids everywhere.  \n\nThe rooms are clean, the beds are comfy, the shampoo\/conditioner stuff is brand name and the maids do a great job.  You can't ask for more (other than to be ON the strip) but for $62 a night, who's complaining??\n\nThe Hilton continues to be one of our go-to hotels in Las Vegas.
