This place is a hot turd, dumped in the middle of a lame neighborhood of Las Vegas. Thank god I dont have to pay to live in this dump, and I am only here 2 months for work.   No reason to be here, the hallways smell like a bingo hall, and ass. the elevators are slow and terrible, this is a roach motel, seek another place, specially if you dont have you're tetanus shots yet.
