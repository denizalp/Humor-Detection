I would love to leave a great review, but I'll never know if it was any good or not. We had reservations for our anniversary, but the doorman wouldn't let us in because we had our EMPTY souvenir cups with us. When I told him they were empty and we had a reservation, he told us we could leave them outside if we wanted. He was rude and condescending. Needless to say, we cancelled our reservation upon not hearing back from staff we scheduled with. I guess not everything goes in Vegas...don't bring in your empty cups to a fancy bar!
