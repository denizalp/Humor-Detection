Had to get new tires for my fake stepdaughter, who was driving on completely bald tires in the front...the back was bad.  I think he said they are supposed to be an 11, and the fronts were a 2, the backs were a 6?  Hazardous.\n\nI go to Discount Tire at home, so this seemed to be the best option from her house, convenient if she needs service, and I know that she will be back for more tires eventually.\n\nAlso we thought this was a way better option that going to Costco.  She's not the Costco member, she's a kid.  So getting in and out with someone else's Costco card, albeit a family members, seemed like a hassle or possibly impossible.  And Costco SUCKED, we called and called and called, finally transferred to managers, and they took our number for a tire guy to call us back.  Discount was NO HASSLE.\n\nGot the 4 tires, signed the kid up for her first credit card to get 0% financing, to build her credit (she's not the one paying the whole bill, but to learn how credit works, etc)\n\nI am sure she will get great service when she returns without her Dad and Dad's Girlfriend.  I am sure the Discount Tire guys don't mind a Rebel Girl coming in for service LOL\n\nShe was in and out in an hour, total.  We left her there so we could go to the pool at the Wynn because that's how WE roll.
