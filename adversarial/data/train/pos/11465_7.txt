This place was amazing! We were in Montreal looking for apartments before our move there this summer and chose this place based on location and Yelp reviews. Although expectations were high, the restaurant exceeded expectations! We loved every. single. dish. What's more - portions are big for tapas and priced very reasonably.\n\nI started with a cucumber mojito. The small pieces of cucumber were like bursts of freshness in my mouth!\n\nThe sorocco salad was made with extremely fresh vegetables and was topped with a generous portion of manchego cheese. The croquetas were crunchy on the outside with warm melted cheese inside. I have never had calamari like those here! The pieces were very meaty and cooked well, with breading to compliment, instead of overpower, the main feature. \n\nIf you want one recommendation from the menu, definitely go for the fried cauliflower! I was worried we were getting too many fried items, but the cauliflower was not deep fried. It was cooked perfectly, with generous amounts of truffle oil.\n\nWe finished with the churros and, although good, I would highly recommend the house made cookie, which was served to us to sample. To call it a cookie does not do this dessert justice, in my opinion. It starts with a layer of dark chocolate, followed by caramel, and finished with a short bread cookie type base. \n\nWe received excellent service from the owner of the restaurant who spent time welcoming us to Montreal and telling us about all of the things he loves about the city!
