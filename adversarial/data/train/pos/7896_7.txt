I love  visiting walmarts of America as this spirit-lifting\/self-esteem boosting exercise you can do while looking for discounted towels. \"You is smart. You is kind. You is imprortant\" I repeat myself with  fake Southern drawl and smile. Where else would you see a bearded woman driving the motorized shopping cart and feel good that you are not her? \n All Walmartians I ever encountered on my infrequent visits would always surprise me with proud knowledge of their wallmart deals and discounts. But staff at this joint is disappointingly clueless. I came with my cousin looking for Google Fusion tablet - his birthday gift. He checked online before us coming over - it was available at a good price. We did not bother to call. \nIn the store that was havering like a bee-hive with customers and clerks,the electronics counter was absolutely desserted. It took us about 10 minutes to beg a lady in a stained Tshirt eating candy at a jewelry counter to help us. Unwillingly she agreed.  However we lost her focus once the word \"tablet' was pronounced. \n She first said something like :\" Hmmm..you need pharmacy?\" and then started to offer us some headphones. All of this was being done very lazily as if she was still sleeping and we were disturbing her lethargic state of mind. Finally my cousin found what the Tablet on the counter and asked her for the key to unlock it. Needless to say she left and never came back. Instead an older much more energetic guy showed up with the key gently reporoaching us :\" Always always call the store and ask them if they have what you need? What if were out?\". I vividly pictured the phone conversation with a girl in a stained Tshirt and smiled :\" Sure. We'll call.\"\nAnd then we walked ,tall and proud ,through a crowd of busy Walmartians holding a tablet like a Prometheus torch- above our heads towards the exit.
