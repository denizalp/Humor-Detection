We will try again in the future but essentially \"only\" set back $60 for a pitcher of margaritas and a round of drinks for two. Of course we ordered eats but food never arrived! \n\nA bit surprised there was not a tequila menu; although we luckily didn't drown our sorrows, nor our wallets, waiting on the food. Unfortunately just wasted our time...waiting and waiting.
