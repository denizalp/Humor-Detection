Horrible.\n\nMy friend and I ordered take out here last night and were less than pleased.  She got 2 red enchiladas with rice and beans for $9 and I got the #7 with a subbed machaca taco for $10.  \n\nNo cheese or onions in either of our enchiladas.  I mean nothing.  It was literally a wrapped corn tortilla in \"sauce\".  I am writing this sarcastically because the \"sauce\" tasted like a red salt lick.  So crummy.\n\nMy taco was the only good part of my meal.  Enchilada, see above.  And the chili rellano was still frozen in the middle!!  What the hell?!!  So I am assuming they don't make them in house.  And so damn salty!\n\nAnd now I get to enjoy my evening running to the toilet every 5 minutes.  Never again.  Family run business?  Yeah OK.  I will go to jack in the box next door, at least their food doesn't make me go into gastrointestinal distress.
