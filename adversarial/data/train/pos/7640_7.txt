6\/23\/16\n\nHave always enjoyed browsing at this market by The Herb Box.  I'm not much of a fan of cold pre-made foods, such as salads, pastas, and other foods that you take out and re-heat at home, or at work, but I do like to see what kind of pastries and other desserts are available.  Certain selections are available at half-off during happy hour (used to be from 4 pm till closing).  I did stop going a couple of years ago after I noticed that the happy hour selections seemed a bit dry and not as fresh and tasty as those I've ordered while dining at the restaurant.  This afternoon's selections looked great, but I didn't ask the rep behind the counter whether or not happy hour specials still existed.\n\nOn this visit, I found new products offered at the market-- Wild Tonic Jun Kombucha! [1] https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=SKHKKSu_BENmCc1df2z3Lw&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  These are organic fermented teas made with honey.  The website lists about 11 flavors, four of which are sold here:\n\nBlueberry Basil\nLavender Love\nTropical Turmeric\nRaspberry Goji Rose\n\nI tried the Lavender Love, and I fell head over heels! https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=q0x-m0-lNVpdJwjTQFEHGg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  It contained lavender, honey,  and Jun Kombucha tea, as well as prickly pear flavor, rosehips, jasmine, and hibiscus.  Its lavender floral aroma and taste was softened and balanced by the honey, and I adored the effervescent quality of the beverage!  I had brought the bottle with me into the restaurant to enjoy happy hour Korean Cauliflower and had a discussion with bartender Rachelle about it.  I even offered her a taste since she's never tried kombucha before.  I mentioned that The Hash Kitchen offered kombucha on tap, but I didn't get the brand name-- just that Whole Foods is the supplier of the kombucha.  I just looked into the Wild Tonic website and found that its products may be found in eight locations within a ten-mile radius of where I live, and among these locations are WF on Mayo Blvd. [2], and THK!  I am definitely going to buy a growler so that I may try these flavors on tap.  I tried both the Raspberry Goji and the Tropical Turmeric at THK months ago, so now I know I may buy bottles of these and enjoy them at home.  My fave is still the lavender!\n\nSpeaking of new products available on tap, the market also has (cold?) coffee brews!  I didn't get to try them, nor get any info, as I was focused on the Wild Tonic products at the time.  Rachelle at the bar inside The Herb Box actually told me about the coffees on tap offerings.  \n\n[1]  I have found joy with these kombucha offerings!  Not only are these probiotics great for your gut health, but they're organic and contain only 80 calories per bottle (40 calories per serving, and two servings per bottle).  After I finish the contents, I plan on reusing the beautiful blue bottle as a water receptacle.\n\n[2]  Visited WF today (6\/27\/16), and it does NOT carry Wild Tonic kombucha among the myriad brands of kombuchas inside their dedicated cooler (across the bakery).  I only know of one other restaurant\/market that carries Wild Tonic's products, and that's The Market by Jennifer's in Phoenix.
