Great Burmese food in the Gay Village. \n\nMy husband and I happened upon this spot for a late lunch. They have a diverse lunch menu. The lunch deal includes a lemonade and a spring roll, both of which really hit the spot. \n\nOur main dishes were very different but both very good. I would say the chicken dish was a little more unique, but the coconut curry with noodles was also very good. \n\nThe people who work here were very nice and interesting to chat with about the Burmese population in Montreal, which is minimal.
