I have to stop here to fuel up because it is convenient.  I live downtown, and I commute to Milwaukee every morning for work.  In the morning I swing through BP to gas up, but sometimes it doesn't work out as easily as it seems it should.\n\nI pull right up to the first pump, and it's out of order, swing all the way around to the other side to gas up, and that one is out of order as well...  I leave....  \n\nAnother time I pay for my coffee and gas inside, sit my credit card on the counter and forget to pick it back up.  Luckily I remember where I left it before I pull off, so I walk back into the station and it's not on the floor, not on the counter - I ask the guy behind the counter and he says he hasn't seen anything.....  \n\nHmmm.....  \n\nI get in my car and call to cancel my card immediately.\n\nDickface.  \n\nI WILL be inconveniencing myself by stopping to gas up somewhere else.  You guys just lost someone who fills her car up with gas EVERY OTHER DAY!\n\nYou lose.
