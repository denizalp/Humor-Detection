I went to Access Medical Center and met Reva Frey to get botox. Lana, receptionist,  was a delight. Dr. Pollard made me feel welcome. I've been doing botox for years and this was my first experience since moving to Vegas.  I had an amazing RN in CO do me for 10 years so I knew how much I needed and where. \nReva came into the room. She seemed rushed. I explained I'm in the medical field and have been getting botox for a decade. She acted offended when I said I wanted to see her mix the botox,  as I know some places can over dilute to make more money. I should have walked out then!! I told her where I wanted botox and she argued with me.  Argued! She said above the lip wasn't safe? ! It was then obvious to me that she didn't have the extensive experience I was looking for.  I should have run!! She was rude, overconfident and arrogant.  She put way too much in my forehead and I got eye droop on the left side!  \n\nI called 7 days later when the botox kicked in and my eye lid was down over my eye.  Lana was empathetic but told me to go get medicated Visine?! Are you kidding me! ? \n\nGo with your gut! Won't make that mistake again.
