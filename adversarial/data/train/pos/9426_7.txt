SHOULD BE NEGATIVE 100 .......this has to be the worst salon ever. i went to get my hair lightened and Philip Amodei was my consultant he quoted me a price of $200 which i was fine with it thats why i proceeded to continue.... he promised me he was a color specialist and a master at what he does.... what a joke. i had black at the ends of my hair so to get it out he bleached my hair with 40 volume bleach 3 times under the heather needless to say my hair still looked awful and he could tell i was not satisfied so he said he would put another color we picked red he colored my hair once again my hair had been processed so much at this point that it wouldn't even hold the color my hair was now orange he said he had a water color and it was also red so he would try that and it wasnt damaging not that it mattered at this point my hair felt like mush.... when he was dont i noticed the color was not red but pink so i told him and he got upset and said am i implying that he is color blind well duh buddy you kind of are if you cant tell from red and pink. i refused to pay and he said \" oh this must be a las vegas thing to go get your hair done and pretend you dont like it so you can get a free service\" what a jerk of a human being btw my hair all broke off i had HEALTHY hair down my back and now i have a pixie hair cut... he is a nightmare and i want to let everyone know about my awful experience. i ended up going to robert cromea inside mandalay bay and butch did a great job cutting my hair he saved whatever was left of it
