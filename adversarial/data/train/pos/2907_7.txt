After my bad review, I got a personal email from the owner acknowledging my comments and sincerely apologizing.  Wow, that was the first time this has happened to me.  I didn't respond, but instead just made my way back in, anonymously.  \nSo, I still love the crab cakes and Mary and Nikki are even better than before and this time the whole place seemed to have a better vibe.  Was it my review?  NO!!! LOL.  Maybe I just spoke too soon on a new place in town.\nBeing an older crowd in Fountain Hills (I am 15 years younger than almost all of my neighbors) it is an odd thing to have a DJ spinning on a weekend - but as fuddy duddy as I am for my age, doesn't mean it isn't just what the doctor ordered for some.\nJohn - thanks for reaching out to me.  I wish you the best with Fountini's and just know that you haven't lost my business.
