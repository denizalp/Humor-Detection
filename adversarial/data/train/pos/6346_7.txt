Ok, so to answer Aimees question, the low reviews are probably a reflection of the crappy service!\n\nProducts are displayed as a color scheme, which is visually inviting, well for me, and I believe that certain pieces in your clothing collection can be pulled of if its a store bought cheapie! \n\nThis store is cheap... really cheap, I once spent $80 and left with a dress, a jacket, a pair of shoes and accessories, which could also be relatable to forever 21 as far as it relates to merchandise quality. \n\nBut the service is the store SUCKS, I mean, JUST REALLY SUCKS.\nIts a good thing I have alot of patience.
