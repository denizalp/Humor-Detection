My husband and I were staying in Scottsdale for a few days and, after days of exploring and adventuring, we were too tired to do anything but see a movie by the time the evenings rolled around. So we made our way to the RoadHouse Cinemas to catch up on some flicks. We liked it so much we went two nights in a row!\n\nFirst, put your feet up in an incredibly comfy recliner chair. Then, order some eats. We recommend the \"children of the corn\" popcorn and the soft pretzel for starters. My husband wasn't the biggest fan of his chicken sandwich, but I really liked my burger. I thought it was great. Juicy and perfectly cooked. And the fries with the garlic aioli on the side are fantastic. I also had the brownie sundae one night. The gelato was great. I'd probably ditch the sundae portion of that in the future and just get that by itself. \n\nThe process is easy, they drop food off while you're watching the flick and your bill 30 minutes before the movie ends. We got their early enough both times that we were able to give our card before the film started so check out was a breeze. \n\nThe chairs are incredibly comfy and everything, from the lobby to the bathrooms, to the screening rooms, are clean and welcoming. It's not the cheapest night out (tickets were $13.50 plus food and drink if you're so inclined) but it's a really well-rounded night out and a really fun experience if you're a movie goer who likes all the bells and whistles.
