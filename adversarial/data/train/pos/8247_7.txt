We've had our pet stay here a few times and will now, most definitely, be going elsewhere. The facility is large and very nice, but they nickel and dime you for everything! You have to pay extra for a potty break after 6pm! You have to pay extra for medication! I can see charging for real extras, like personal play time or extra treats, but a potty break that early and giving medication when they are feeding them anyway? I'm a fair judge of what is reasonable and this place is not. One more thing, they charged us an entire extra day of boarding when we arrived 30 minutes late due to traffic. If they had offered even a late fee I would have probably not even written this review. They lost more than a few customers today.
