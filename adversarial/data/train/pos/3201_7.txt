I was given the nice opportunity to go to the soft opening of this new show. The story line is basically about a \"fat, handsome\" panda who is madly in love with a peacock, but then a king vulture swoops the peacock up and kidnaps her. This forces the panda to venture and learn the ways of the shaolin kung fu to fight the vulture and save the peacock. Here's the quick 411:\n\nSchedule: TUESDAY-SUNDAY: 7:30 P.M. \n                 MONDAY:DARK\nPrice: $48-$128\nSeating: 1,300 \nLength: 1 hour 45 mins\n\nThe good thing about this theater is that you get a pretty good view of the stage anywhere you go. However, when trying to optimize your show experience, you want avoid the sides since the bamboo plant will block some of the view. The best seats of course are the orchestra seats or main floor seats (I think they're section 2 in the map). If you bring your kids, I would suggest isle seats as the performers are going down those main isles fairly often throughout the show.\n\nWhile I think the story plot sounds a lot like Kung Fu Panda, I did not mind it so much. The lack of Cirque du Solei touch definitely makes up for it with their highly engaging show with the audience. It made the show much more interesting and fun. Their performance acts included acrobatic pandas,traditional chinese dances from the female dancers, jumping monkeys, dancing soldier statues and drums. Big props to the pandas wearing those heavy costumes and still managing to do aerial tricks.\n\n**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE FAMILY AND CHILDREN.\n\nIt's very interactive with the audience, humorous, with fun variety show tricks that gets a lot of the kids interested. It's filled with colors fun special effects from their interactive light displays and special effects. You get to do fun photo opps with the pandas before the show as well. \n\nI think the only downside to their theater is it's smack dab in the middle of the Grand Lux and their bar lounge. The hallway into the theater is very very narrow in which the will call reception desk is in as well. The whole thing is just designed with very small space and you can really tell. With only one stairway that basically fits a width of 3 people long, you tend to wait for a while to be seated as well as leaving. The small confined space you're in makes you feel stuffy and anxious for sure. \n\nEither than that! The show was fun and I would definitely bring kids to watch this show.
