I really like this place. I travel a lot see a lot of different styles and types of restaurants and this one I would have to say is probably one of my favorites. The food was good you get to cook it yourself, if you like spicy the miso spicy broth is what I like definitely try the shabu shabu. The sushi roll great also..
