You know you are at the right place for breakfast when there was a line waiting outside before it was opened. What a lovely place to have breakfast at. We were here right when it opened at 9a.m. The food was delicious and their dessert is simply amazing. Their Crossiant was to die for. It was soft, fluffy and buttery. We ordered a egg benedict with ham and another one with salmon. Both of them were equally delicious. The presentation for the dessert was great, but a bit too sweet for my taste. Cream puff was perfect though. Overall, I enjoy every minute of it. \n\nI highly recommend people who haven't been here to give it a try. I'll definitely come back here again.
