OMG, have you seen the chicken nachos at this place?!  They are huge, and, according to the manager, they are 5,000 calories!  \nWe did not have them, though.  We just saw numerous orders pass our table throughout the afternoon when we were there to watch the 49ers beat the Seahawks--yes!  \nLocated in Town Square, Miller's Alehouse is a great place to watch sports since you're surrounded by TVs.  Service is great and it's non-smoking!  I had the chicken fajitas and a bowl of lobster bisque, which were both satisfying, although the bisque was not as hot as I would have liked.  I appreciate the fact that they offer up a light menu even though I didn't order from it this time; it's good to know for the next time, and there will be a next time, I'm sure.
