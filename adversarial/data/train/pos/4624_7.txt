I love to go to resale stores thrift stores yard sales and all places where  I can find deals  and treasures. This is a cute store the staff is cool but the prices on used stuff here are outrageous. I seen a few used items that could be found at kohls and and Ross. These things were used but sold at full price. Wth! Don't get me wrong there are really good quality items here. I just will not go back. Lol I seen girls going crazy over used thong bikinis. Just saying.
