Rolling with a crew of 40+ people deep, we ended last weekend with EBC featuring Zedd on a Sunday afternoon. EBC is the only dayclub I've ever been to in Vegas, but no doubt both times were pretty awesome. Great music and great crowd make this dayclub the place to be.\n\nFrom what I can remember, the good:\n- Spacious and awesome lilypads: worth the extra $$$ if you've got a big group\n- Free guestlist for women if you know who to contact\n- Complimentary drink vouchers for women - pretty stiff!\n- Great headliners. Are you gonna stay the night? ;)\n- Bathroom lines move quick, even women's\n- Cute girls and guys. Summer bod, anyone?\n- Sandals accepted and encouraged! We ain't about that stiletto life here\n\nThe bad:\n- $25 for locker\/storage bags?! DAFUQ, but you get to keep the drawstring bags. $5\/each time to access the clear plastic bags, on top of the $25 fee is ridiculous\n- Pool water is full of body liquids, liquor, chlorine, etc. Jungle juice you shouldn't be drinking\n\nCan't remember much other than an awesome time as we danced and drank for 4-6 hours straight in the pool. Trappy Birthday to our August babies!!!
