I knew when I called Slice of Sicily for closing time (8pm for dine in, 9pm for carryout, closed on Sundays) this is where I wanted dinner.  When I asked for information a somewhat ear piercing, tone varied voice loudly gave me answers.  This was the real deal New York style pizza joint I was craving.\n\nWe arrived for a family dinner night about 7:20.  A few people were watching Dancing with the Stars while waiting for their to go.  Trying to transform a four top into a five top, a skinny, grey-haired  woman shuffled over to assist.  This was Donna, my new favorite Phoenix waitress.  We get seated, open the beers I brought (BYOB) and start ordering.  We shared some fried mushrooms and zucchini.  Decent but nothing special.  Pizza wise we got a meat lovers, veggie and white.  All three were great!  Fresh toppings, thin, crispy crust and cheesed to perfection.  Take note of the wall mural.  The farm house scene is very entertaining.  I had a small obsession with real wreath added on the painted door.  \n\nDonna definitely enhanced my visit.  She was sassy towards my bro-in-law considering he was outnumbered by the women surrounding him.  I liked that and so did he.  She gives it to ya straight.  Donna and my Mom hit it off.  I hope they become friends.
