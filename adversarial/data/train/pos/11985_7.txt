I have completed 2 of the the 26 month contracts with LVAC since moving out here in the late 90's. I did it once in 2000 and again in 2006. After that, I would renew every year by paying the year in advance upfront for a good price. Well in December of 2014, I missed the expiration of the deal by 4 days and they then refused to honor the deal. \n\nWhen I called customer \"service\"(the Maryland Parkway location), they pretty much had a \"tough sh*t\" attitude about the whole situation. They said my only options were a) renew for a 3rd - 26 month contract(I don't think so) or b) wait to see if they would send another renewal offer. The representative literally told me to just keep checking the mail and see if they decided to extend the offer again. Suffice it to say that here it is, over a year later, and that offer never came. The gyms are large and well equipped, but the service is completely pathetic! I have patiently waited to see if I would ever receive any kind of fair offer, short of a new contract that anybody who fell on the planet in the last 5 minutes could simply walk in and get, and it just never happened. Nice way to insult someone who was a loyal and paying patron for the better part of the past decade. Thank you so much. (*sarcasm*)\n\nThe facilities are awesome, yet the service and the attitude of the company simply sucks!\n\nI have been extraordinarily patient in giving LVAC the benefit of the doubt before posting this update, but after 14 months....time is up..\n\n1 star.
