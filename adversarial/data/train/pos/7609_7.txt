\"NO THAN-Q !\"\n\nThank-Q Rental made my wife cry on our wedding day.\n\nNegative stars if I could, for them and Doug Quelland!     \n\n\nThank-Q Rental made my wife cry on our wedding day.\n\nDon't use Thank-Q Rental , and DON'T EVER VOTE FOR DOUG QUELLAND !!!!!!\n\nThank-Q Rental made my wife cry on our wedding day.\n\nAfter seeing a dirty old 'white' tent at the facility while setting up the rental, saying I don't want to rent it if that's the way it looks, and then being promised that a new tent would be used, they sent a nasty, dingy, grungy, dirty 'white' tent to a daytime wedding ceremony at the Fountain Embassy Suites.\n\nThis place made my wife cry on our wedding day.\n\nWhen I contacted them that morning, with plenty of time to do so, they said they'd try to get a replacement out, but never did so, nor did they even call back as promised.\n\nThis place made my wife cry on our wedding day.\n\nWhen I contacted them after the event, I was coldly refered to some legal mumbo jumbo on the back of the contract -- basically told 'tough luck'.\n\nThis place made my wife cry on our wedding day.\n\nA little while later, DOUG QUELLAND, owner of Thank-Q Rental shop, a coffee shop, and a local politician with a ridiculous handle bar mustache, happens to show up at my front door because he's canvassing the neighborhood to pump flesh for the (then) upcoming election.\n\nThank-Q Rental made my wife cry on our wedding day.\n\nI revelled in the opportunity to speak directly to the Q himself, and upon my beaming invitation, this man entered my home, sat on my couch, drank a cool bottle of water, and proceeded to kiss my ass and lie to my face about how he would thourougly investigate this incident with the store and how he would be contacting me back directly, himself, very soon.\n\nThank-Q Rental made my wife cry on our wedding day.\n\nOf course, I have not heard a single word from the man since he stepped out of my house.\n\nThank-Q Rental made my wife cry on our wedding day.\n\nI wish I had the time to sit on the street corner in front of his rental store\/coffee shop complex and protest with a big sign that says\n \"NO THAN-Q !\"\n\nThank-Q Rental made my wife cry on our wedding day.\n\nDon't use Thank-Q Rental , and DON'T EVER VOTE FOR DOUG QUELLAND !!!!!!\n\n \"NO THAN-Q !\"\n\nThank-Q Rental made my wife cry on our wedding day.
