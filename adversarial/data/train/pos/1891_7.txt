OMG! How cute and convenient is this little juicery?! I walked by today and saw it across the street with a cute decorative window and I HAD to cross the street to see for myself.\n\nThe old man working is super kind and greeted us right away; he's very soft spoken but you can tell he is a friendly soul. There were free samples and you can try a bunch before you commit to buying them.\nThey have SO many options, and there was this amazing one called 'maleficent', which is completely black with lemon+agave nectar+alkaline water+some sort of charcoal. COOLIO. Since it was buy 3 get 1 free, I got a pink mylk one (milky strawberry\/nutty drink), this strawberry\/beet one and the maleficent one, of course!! The free one I got is called 'flu shot' and I can literally taste the vitamins swirling on my tongue ... so orangey and grapefruit filled! Loved it - would definitely enjoy this if I was sick! There are also full day juice cleanses, which I do wish to try here one day.. tried once and got lightheaded and weak LOL. \n\nThe shop itself is super cute and has comfy seats with wooden tables. Adorable! It definitely reminds me of LA and the juicerys they have down there. It's nice to see toronto finally catching up, with such a convenient location. I'll definitely come back!
