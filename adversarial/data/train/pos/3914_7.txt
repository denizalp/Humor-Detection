Take \"Subway\" subtract everything boring and crappy about it (and healthy), sub the sandwiches for poutine with dozens of topping options and you got poutineville! The atmosphere is modern and less \"hip\" than banquist. Red and black walls, full bar, chandelier. Upon arriving they hand you a long piece of a paper with options for your potatoes (get the house special potatoes!) different cheeses, meats, veggies and sauces! Most toppings run between 1.25-2.00 depending on the topping. A poutine after adding about 4 toppings usually averages around $12. I really enjoy \"designing\" my own poutine. Great concept!
