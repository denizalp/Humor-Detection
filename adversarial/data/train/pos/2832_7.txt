I would love to rave out this place. I have been waiting to try since it started to build over a yr ago. \n\nWhen i approached the restaurant\nI noticed all the staff outside smoking. Once inside i was alerted that they were the ones also handling the food. Everyone reeked of cigg smoke. \n\nI order kung pow chicken and wasn't pleased. It wasn't kung pow chicken. The sauce was not correct nor were the ingredients. \n\nEveryone working there seemed confused and lost.
