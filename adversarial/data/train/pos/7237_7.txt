Something about temperatures in the -30s makes me crave Mexican, call me crazy, and this Montrealer's quest for authentic eats of this ethnicity is endless so when I saw Shirley's review I bookmarked it and headed east. I can second that the service was super friendly and chill and the food was delicious - I had a green salsa vegetarian dish that was dreamy and spicy and good. The decor is casual, but not too brightly lit and grocery-store-esque as at Roi du Taco. The tv is on and the Latin American families tucked into the booths seem happy. Will return for sure.
