No. This place is not ok. We should've known from the moment we arrived to check in. I'm we were at the front desk, when a run-down looking woman came in and starting shouting and ranting about how the men staying in room 103 are soliciting women for sex. The man at the front desk rolled his eyes and gave her a thumbs up....\n\nOur room wasn't just not pretty. It was falling apart - peeling paint, a fold out couch in the living room that had fabric that had tears, scratches and holes. Everything was worn down and not taken care of. I don't consider myself a very picky person. I'm totally willing to put up with some slumming in prosper to save money. But this place was unacceptable and left me feeling dirty.
