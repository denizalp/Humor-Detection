I remember when this movie theater just opened! It was our favorite theater to go to during the summer. Decades later, I still like going here for movies, assuming I can get a ticket. They operate on a reservation system which I like since I can reserve my seats in advance. But, this also means that you will have to prepare way in advance if you want to see a very popular movie. The ticket system is all automated and there are various kiosks where you can buy and reserve your seats. There are even automated concessions booths here. I like the addition of Coca Coca Freestyle stations so you can make your own custom drink.\n\nThe seats themselves are really comfy, made of leather or pleather with wide armrests. I love the reclining option with the footrest. You push a button to the side of your chair and can adjust as much reclining action as you want.
