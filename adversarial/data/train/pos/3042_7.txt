I feel like everytime I am in Vegas and need a late night meal, Planet Dailies is the spot. I love this place! It's always open, service is friendly and it's always good!\nIt's located inside Planet Hollywood, it's never too busy when I go so you don't have to worry about getting a table. Although to be fair, everytime I've gone it's been after 12AM... but at least you know if you go that late it won't be too busy ? LoL
