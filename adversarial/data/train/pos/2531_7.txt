Long line but seamless process. Rental was covered by Las Vegas Collision. About 10 people in front of me this morning but wait was only about 15 minutes. They put me in a rental and I was on the road quick. Ryan S was very helpful. Nice waiting area with plenty of seats. They have a laminate on the counter showing which Exotics they now offer! From Bentley, Lamborghini to Tesla check out the prices!\n\nThank you Enterprise! See you to return the car in a few days.
