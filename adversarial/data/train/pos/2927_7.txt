Whatever you do, don't buy any electronic devices from this shop. I have recently bought ecig for over $80, and since day 1 I started to have problems with. At first the battery would just shut off during inhalation like its low on juice, and after 5 sec would show that there is actually 75% in it. That was really annoying since every other time I go use it it would shut off on me. On next day, I couldn't use it at all since ohms would just stay at 9.9 and it wouldn't work at all. I went back to that place to see if they can exchange it for me. They said we know nothing, all sales are final. Have a good day sir! So, if you need to buy tobacco from them go ahead, for any other products stay away!
