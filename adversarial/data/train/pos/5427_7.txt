5: Food- Tuscan Kale Salad at an airport? \nI'm on board! I don't see this type of thing often... but when I do, I usually go for it. \nIt was almost on the verge of being too sweet, but felt like a good choice rather than a cookie or a big bag of nuts... \nTuscan kale, berries, pickled onions, shaved fennel, diced green onions and ummm.. a sweet vinaigrette hit the spot! \n\n5: Customer Service- a few sweeties behind the counter prepping food and taking my money. What a treat. There were no kale salads in the cold case in the front, but they made one for me. Yea. \n\nThere was bit of a line around dinner time, but it worked, because Southwest gave me time to eat in between flights. Yea. \n\nWould I return? Yep. They had a cashew butter and jam sandwich, the simple salad looked good too and hmmm... \nI know there were other options I would have shoved in my mouth in a heart beat, just give me some more time and I may update this review. \n\nK. Happy travels!
