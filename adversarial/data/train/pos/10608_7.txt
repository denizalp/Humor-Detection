As I pulled into the parking lot for a planned Sunday brunch, I wondered why there were so many people hanging around their cars chatting. Or were they waiting for the yoga place next door? Nope!!! They were all waiting for a table at the Pfantastic Pannenkoek house. So I joined the queue and waited and prayed that the pancakes would be worth it.\n\nThey were. I ordered the Mediterranean which is a savoury pancake with chicken, olives, spinach, feta cheese, tomatoes and onions. (The tomatoes and onions come raw). It was good as was the apple and bacon pancakes my kids had. I also ordered tea which came with a spicy cookie that I loved so much, I bought the whole box.\n\nService was ok considering how busy they were - all the tables were full for the 1+ hour I spent there waiting and eating.\n\nBonus points for being family friendly and having very clean fisher price booster chairs\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the pancakes, I may never be a regular here because of the wait times.\n\nEdited to add: I came here a second time (midweek 1pm) and the service was still excruciatingly slow. The pain of the wait is not worth it and takes a star off this review.
