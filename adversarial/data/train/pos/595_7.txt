Came here for lunch on Friday. Wanted to try their hummus because many reviews here said their hummus taste so fresh like it's made to order. I love hummus so I had to come try their hummus.\nYes, the hummus tasted so fresh and delicious. So much better than my usual Trader Joe's Mediterranean Hummus. It came with their home made pita bread. Amazing.\nI ordered 2 Skewers Lamb Kabob. For some reason, there were two different kinds of lamb chunks in the dish. The ones that were so tender almost like ground lamb meat ball and the ones that were very tough and chewy. The tender ones were so juicy and delicious, but the tough ones I didn't enjoy. It tasted like just plain lamb meat with no flavor. I left the tough hard lamb meat to go and gave to my dogs. They really enjoyed it so I'm happy. (There was no spice or salt on the meat. Just plain so it's OK.)\nMake sure you ask for the garlic sauce. Their garlic sauce is delicious and goes with any kind of meat (chicken, beef, lamb and even vegetable) They don't give you unless you ask for it. \nThe older guy that was working here was very attentive. He said he came from Boston to help his friend's restaurant. How nice.\nI'll come back to get their fresh delicious hummus but I will not order their lamb again.
