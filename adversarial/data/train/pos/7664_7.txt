This is one of the cutest little apple orchards I've ever been to! I absolutely​ love fall, it's my favorite season, and of course I have to stop here every year to buy all the fall things my heart needs.\n\nThere's a barn\/house where you can buy all kinds of locally made foods like popcorn, jam, candy, etc. They also sell a ton of varieties of apples, which you can taste, and vegetables. I love all the different country-themed​ decorations​, especially​ the Christmas ones, so cute! They also have a bakery in which they sell heavenly homemade pies and desserts, my favorite is the berry pie get it with whipped cream! \n\nOutside there is a beautiful flower garden that's great for pictures, although the whole place is definitely​ photogenic and aesthetically​ pleasing. They have a huge apple orchard, but you can't pick the apples, unfortunately​. There's also a big corn field and some cute little hay barrels and photo ops that kids love. \n\nIf you're looking to get into the fall spirit, Beckwith Orchards is definitely​ the place to go!
