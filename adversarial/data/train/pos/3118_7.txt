I first came here on the soft opening and got the vegan ramen. Everything was kind of just okay -- toppings, flavor, noodles. My main gripe was that the soup could have been warmer. But the service was friendly, we were asked about our experience by management on how they could improve, and it's also vegan ramen so I couldn't penalize this place too hard.\n\nI came by again to give it another shot. I asked for extra garlic to add more flavor, and I received a bowl of lukewarm ramen with definitely no extra garlic. My friend's was also lukewarm, which made us both sad. There's nothing more unforgivable to me, someone who enjoys their food at a temperature that rivals the sun's, to receive a barely above room temperature bowl of soup.\n\nI'm over-exaggerating, of course, but Shinya definitely has some bumps to smooth out.
