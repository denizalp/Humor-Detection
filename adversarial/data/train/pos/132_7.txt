Needless to say, Earth Fare is a welcomed addition to the North Charlotte area.  The grand opening is successful as the place was crowded this morning.  Earth Fare offers everything for your kitchen and tummy!  I sampled fresh, warm challah bread (then had to purchase my own), a creamsicle smoothie, and delicious pesto margarita (sp) pizza (my new favorite). In addition, there were breakfast and lunch items, as well as an array of fresh fruit on the self-serve bar (6.99\/lb).  The staff assures me they will always have fresh items available...hope that stands true.  I also located a nice display of $6 or less wines (red and white)!  I look forward to frequent trips to this location whether it's for a quick bite to fill my tummy or to fill my refrigerator.  My gripe: The parking lot is rather small for the size of the store.  Hope they make space for more parking very quickly.
