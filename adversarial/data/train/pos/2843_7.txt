We stopped into this newly opened restaurant this evening.  This location was formerly the Bridgeville Tambellini's, and it was interesting to see how they re-vamped the place. One of the features here is that they have 50 different offerings on tap, along with many bottled choices, and also a full bar.  I started off with a seasonal pumpkin ale.  For our meal, we ordered the Railyard French Dip, and also a Build-Your-Own Burger (over greens).  There are a lot of very interesting items on the menu, and I look forward to coming back and trying some of them.\n\nUPDATE: Stopped back again the next day for lunch.  Started off with a Lancaster Milk Stout, and had both a Scotch Egg and the Poutine for my meal.  The Scotch Egg has an unusual twist here in that it is made with a lamb sausage (from local farm Jamison Lamb) instead of the traditional pork.  It was very good, and was served over a cucumber slaw that was very picklish in taste, and I thought it was delicious.  The Poutine was also a little bit non-traditional in that it was served with scallions, meat, and an egg on top of the gravy and fries.
