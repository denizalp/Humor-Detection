Stay away!!!  Yes it is inexpensive, but you get what you pay for.   READ ON!!!!!\n\nThis is a hard review to write.  I gave them a one, yes a one because the at peak lunch time, the sushi bar was empty for the hour we were there.  The sushi chef made no effort to replenish it.  In fact, when he did make a roll, he did it slow and only one at a time.  I stood there for ten minutes while he looked at me.  He made a roll and the four people waiting each got one piece of it!!!!  I asked for my favorite, Unagi (eel) and he looked at me like I was crazy.  \n\nI think it is a requirement for the sushi chef as well as the servers to be rude.  Everyone at the table laughed at the nasty attitudes.\n\nOn top of the above, the server, did not bring our drinks out until we asked for a third time, then she never refilled them.  We were half way through the meal and she brought the bill.  WTF?
