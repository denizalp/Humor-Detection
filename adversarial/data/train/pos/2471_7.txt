Came here for a moms night out and had a blast!\nIt was 9.25 for shoes and 2 games..after midnight its 1 buck a game.\nThey were doing 2.00 drinks...of everything!\nSo I had many drinks...bowled poorly.\nHad a hotdog & french fries. They were ok..what do you expect..its a bowling alley.\nI had to cushion the booze!\nI will come back when I can for sure!!
