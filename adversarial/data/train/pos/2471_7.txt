Looking for a reasonably priced place to linger over a late lunch? Ryoji iz your place. \n\nMassive horseshoe bar on the right, cozy leather armchair tables on the left. Sushi bar-style table down the middle of the bar side. Big patio. No matter what type of seating your heart desires and your butt enjoys, they've got you covered. \n\nThe price point is the clincher for me. Ramen is ramen and it shouldn't be expensive. Ryoji respects this simple truth. Their pork ramen is my favourite (add some rooster sauce!), and their fried chicken sandwich (I forget the proper name) is also quite tasty. \n\nI'll be back for dinner and drinks. College St is going to get all wild, Ramania style, one night soon. I can just feel it.
