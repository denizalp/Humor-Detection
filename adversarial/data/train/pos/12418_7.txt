The name says it all. The wine choices here are incredible. You don't just get a couple of Pinot Noirs to choose from, you get an aisle of them to peruse.\n\nAfter you have worked your way through all the refs, the whites, the roses, the sparkling wines, the fortified wines, and the champagnes, you then can hit the beers and ciders before finally working your way through the spirits.\n\nIf you are in a hurry, make sure you know what you want to buy and where to find it before entering. Then head directly to your desired item, grab it and head for the cashier. Do not be waylaid by the deep discounts or novelty items in display. Do not be tempted by that $120 bottle of wine that is on sale for $80 or six for $400. \n\nYou should be able to find what you want here, or at least a good substitute.
