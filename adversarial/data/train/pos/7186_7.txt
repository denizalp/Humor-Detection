Hi Shana, i appreciate you reading our review but the fact of the matter is that this is the exact picture that we received when we asked for an update. It would be disingenuous of me to take this review out given these circumstances. My wife and i were a bit perplexed of the picture (but along with the other problems cited on our review above) that's what we received. We strongly think that the service was not up to par, Thanks.
