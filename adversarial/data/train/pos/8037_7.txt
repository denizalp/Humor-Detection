Normally I don't like macaroons so the fact that I kept buying one after the other here tells me that this place is AMAZING!!\n\nthey have ice cream inside the macaroons which is what drew me in the first place.\n\nThey had coconut, mango, espresso, caramel, etc.\n\nI think the lady was laughing not at my French, but at the fact that I would buy one, turn around eat it, and then buy another one.\n\nI spent a good $20 trying all their flavors and going to the extreme here.\n\nWhere else can you find ice cream inside an amazing macaroon for only $2 each?\n\nBest food find of my whole trip for sure!!
