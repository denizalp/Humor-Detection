For the man: Five Stars\nFor Me: Three Stars\n= Four Stars\n\nI always loved popping into their original location next to Sunflower market and used to find great shirts and club outfits and shoes I slobbered over but were never in my size.\n\nNow with this location essentially down the street from me, I pop in just about week or so to check out their shoes (I zoom right to the back-amazing clean sneakers and shoes from like Urban and other big dept stores), then their highlight items in the front from like Marc Jacobs, Banana Repub and some local designers. I stopped looking at dresses since I ride my bike all the time and I hate wearing bike shorts-reminds me of early 90s Sassy magazine photo spreads. I can't wear any of their pants since its stops at like 11 and I have too much pudding in my trunk. i did manage to score a green skull hoodie for like $14 bucks and a black yellow stencil style punk shirt that said \"TreeHugger\" all sex pistols like-goddamn love to wear skulls and eat tofu treehugger I am! Other than those items-no dice.\n\nHOWEVER-the magic really happens for men. I brought my bf here and we scored on jeans and shirts! Great paper and denim, and Levi jeans, vintage cowboy plaid shirt, Banana Republic and J Crew waffle and cashmere style tops in neutral colours. We found a great hat as well. He has a pretty popular size so none of the shoes really spoke to us-but great skater shoes for sure.\n\nThe accessories are stellar in the front, but just not much of a jewelry person.\n\nWe sometimes get tempted to stop in here, but he has enough clothes right now...but to score jeans? Killer.\n\nOh, and double bonus-Bike Saviors is in the same building! Stop by on Wednesday for ladies night workshops!
