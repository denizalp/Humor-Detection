This bar just isn't very good. The service is subpar and the menu merely average. But, perhaps worst of all is that it's karaoke night EVERY night. I guess it's just not my thing. \n\nThe place is loaded with two varieties of cowboy hats: the type worn by people often seen on the back of a horse or tractor and the type worn only at the bar by people who couldn't tell the difference between a horse and a tractor. The funny thing is that apparently neither type is worn by anyone who can sing.
