They're inching on \"meh\" territory now...\n\nTook a friend and shared my praise for Bei.  We had overly bland service (I'm sorry, were we keeping you from something honey) which turned into bizarre service.\n\nAs we were down to merely nibbling on food, my dining mate ordered another cocktail.  Apparently we were expected to chug the drinks, pay, and then get the f outta there in 3 minutes.  Because as we continued to talk, every little item on our table was meticulously rearranged, talked about, and eventually removed.  Hours before they were to close, and with plenty of other folks in the restaurant (it was maybe 8:45), we both had to move around the waiters coming to take the condiments off the table, as if they were cleaning up and we had clearly overstayed our welcome.\n\nIf we hadn't just ordered drinks (cost money and can't be taken as to-go drinks of course), or it was late and near closing time, or if the place was packed, we'd have absolutely left.  But then, we also wouldn't have ordered more drinks. Altogether, I was embarrassed to have recommended this place for so long, when it left a majorly bitter taste in our mouths.\n\nRa may be corporate but at least they aren't dicks.
