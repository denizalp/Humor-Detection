Friendly, great food lovingly prepared!!! \n\nI stopped in today for a quick bite at the new Du Cafe on O'Connor. I had a fantastic Americano coffee and  delicious coconut cookie. The owner is super nice and took the time to explain how the food was made and that she only uses the best ingredients. Refreshing approach and really differentiates her from all the fast food options close by. If your looking for great, high quality, yummy food is a relaxed atmosphere its a great spot. BTW, lots of games, chalkboard, toys for the kiddies.\n\nEnjoy!! I did.
