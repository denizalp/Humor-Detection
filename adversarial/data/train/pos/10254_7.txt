Dear Michael Boychuck,\n\nyour salon is beautiful and i am sure you are a fabulous stylist. the customer service is great, and all, but you have this one stylist who is truly an ass. i think his name is juan and i was given to him by the front receptionist to trim my hair which was a Victoria beckham bob. hes a freakin ass. he gave me a bowl cut and didnt listen to me at all. he was a stylist with an ego... and i left unhappy, paid like 150 for a freakin trim from hell. DO NOT EVER LET JUAN CUT UR HAIR. i blame the front desk to for giving me to him. i was so unhappy, i came back the same day and asked for extensions in the near my face because the asshole cut my whole head to one legnth. everyone knows victoria beckhams hair is long in the front and short in the back...but its a bob!!!\n\njust so you kno, JUAN IS A HAIR EXTENSION SPECIALIST. i think that asshole cut my hair off so i would get a full head of extensions. well i got a little in the front and made him cut me a bob, which he still couldnt do!!! They charged me like 110 for a pack of extensions and made Juan put them in for free and re cut my hair... I STILL FREAKIN HAD TO PAY. JUST FOR THE COST OF THE HAIR BUT WTF? asshole still couldnt cut my hair right... i ended up going home and trimming it down myself. he even told me \"personally i think it looked great the 1st time\" I Told him, you dont have to live with it, and it is not what i wanted. worst experience ever.\n\ni love the decor, but please fire that guy! he's an ass and thinks he know everything. #1 listen to your customer. \n\nBOWL CUT DOES NOT EQUAL BOB! F you JUAN! I HATE U!
