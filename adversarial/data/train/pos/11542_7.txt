Charming family-owned restaurant that only uses fresh, local products...ah, just kidding. It's a McDonald's. It's in your hometown, it's in my hometown, you can't sneeze in the continental U.S. without hitting a McDonald's. You know what you're getting. I won't lie -- if (I guess I should say \"when\") I'm hungover on Friday or whatnot, I'll pick up a cheap-ass iced coffee that's so big it could drown a marmot.
