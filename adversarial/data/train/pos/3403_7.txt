Wow. I'm astonished at the bad level of service. I had a good sized print project to take to the print department but no one was available. There was 3 employees and 1 manager standing at the checkouts LOOKING RIGHT AT me but no one acknowledged. So I crossed my arms and stared at them in a very impatient gesture so they would realize that I was waiting for THEN, but nothing. Are you serious?! U had to send my mom over to ask then to help me. They git in the Michael to call for help only to eventually have the manager, who saw me waiting, come over. OMG. So rude. Would not acknowledge me, say hi, or can I help you, or sorry for the 20 minute wait. Would not even look me in the eye or answer questions.  I took my biz ekswhere. Truly ridiculous way to treat customers. Will never go back
