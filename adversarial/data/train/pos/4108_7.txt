This place is terrible. The OBGYN area is nothing but women with hella kids probably on Medicaid. Unfortunately, I have to come here for my pregnancy or pay my 2800 deductible to see my normal OB. \n\nThe wait times here are fucking stupid. I checked in to see my doctor almost an hour early, to which the receptionist said they were on time and would probably take me early. Now I'm here 30 minutes after my appointment time Still. Fucking. Waiting. I get to enjoy hearing kids screaming, my favorite thing. Let me add that I've been here already almost 3 hours because this is the only place I can get an ultrasound done. \n\nThere is a lack of customer service, and it's actually super dirty in the waiting areas. Mostly because people bring their dirty little fuckers and because the receptionist don't clean. Or EVS doesn't come check the areas. \n\nI get that this is a community type medical center, but fuck! I had to take 4 hours off from work just to come here, I didn't expect to be waiting THIS long. \n\nAfter I give birth, I'm done. It seriously isn't worth it. Also, you don't even know what doctor will be delivering your baby, because it's the one who will be on call at the hospital they tell you to go to. Wonderful! You get what you pay for. A bunch of fuckery.
