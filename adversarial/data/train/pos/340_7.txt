THEE worst service EVER! Went last night for the Valentine's Day Special and we will never return to this location again. Called in advance to see if they took reservations and was told \"no just come in.\" Bad idea! The wait was 20mins even though they weren't busy half the restaurant was empty. Not only that, people are walking in with reservations! \n\nOnce we were seated at a table with no serving ware we waited 17 mins for someone to take our drink order. Then the waiter comes and asks \"what are we eating?\" No introduction. No specials were told. Hell to this day I don't even know his name because he failed to tell us! \n\nOur order arrived in a timely manner although we didn't have anything to eat it with (still no serving ware) My water was now empty and I'm parched so we order the bottle of champagne. Wrong! Champagne served in wine glasses and there wasn't a chiller provided so the bottle sweats on the table and we're drinking warm champagne. Smh. For some odd reason an order of white rice came out with our meal and it didn't belong to us. It sat as we began to eat and the waiter returns with a bashful smile and says \"Uhhhh yeaaaaaa this isn't yourssss\" then proceeds to do a slow motion James Brown slide as he takes it to the correct table. Yes, he took it to the table as if it were a fresh bowl prepared for them. \n\nIt's a shame that the food is great but due to the service I'll visit a different location and tell my friends to do the same.
