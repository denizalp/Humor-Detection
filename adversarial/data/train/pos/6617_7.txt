It was like some warped social experiment to see how long tables would wait to receive their order before cutting their losses and calling it quits. Maybe the Psych Department at ASU rented it out for an afternoon and we were the guinea pigs. \n\nInstead of going on a subjective rant, I'll try and let the facts of our experience speak:\n-We did not see our waitress the entire time.\n-Some guy took our order to \"help out with the food order.\" He seemed like a manager since he was the absolute, only person in the restaurant moving quickly and with purpose.\n-We waited 40 minutes with a couple glasses of water and no food. \n-We flagged down a waitress (unknowing if it was ours or not) occasionally to inquire, and were placated to wait \"just a little longer\" each time.\n-Eventually, we had to leave hungry because it was a work day and we were under time constraints.\n-Two other tables that came in after us were served long before this 40 minute mark.\n\nObservations of how other tables were treated during this 40 minute tease (and it's grim):\n-A four-top next to us spent 10 minutes settling the bill, because of an mind-blowing break down in communication that resulted in black books going back-and-forth-and-back-again a ridiculous number of times.\n-About eight plates were sent back to the kitchen because the orders were wrong.\n-The hostess had a reuben with pasta salad and spent a couple minutes wandering aimlessly for its home, asking numerous tables if it was theirs. (Not the only incidence of this happening.)\n-We observed two other tables of business casual individuals leave before their food had a chance to arrive, for (what we can only assume was) the same reason that we had to.\n-The hostess had to ask a four-top of people that already had drinks and some food to move to a different location in the restaurant in order to accommodate another party that just entered.\n-People began to pile up at the door to be seated and had to wait it out. Some just left.\n-The hostess began seating people with the warning that \"The kitchen is like, really, super backed up right now, so it'll be like, 30-40 minutes to get your food. Is that okay?\" (Would have been nice to get that warning and avoid the experience.)\n-The wait staff just kind of ran around like (well-intentioned) chickens with their heads cut off. Lots of panic, not much action.\n-Several tables were left un-bussed for a pretty long spell.\n-There was one woman (seemed like management) that just kind of moseyed all over the place without doing anything other than fill a couple water glasses.\n-We didn't see the manager again. (Probably a good thing since the kitchen was so backed up, but placating a restless public would have been smart too.)\n\nWhy I don't understand the clusterduck:\n-It's prepped sandwich ingredients.\n-It's prepped scoops of mayo-based salads on the side.\n-Or it's a quick fry drop away from a basket of crispy fries.\n-It's prepped salad ingredients.\n-It's prepped soups.\n-And it's breakfast items, which require a minimum of time on the grill: no elaborate egg strata or baked french toast here. \n\nI'm going to commit a cardinal Yelp sin here by saying the following, but I've worked at delis before. It's slop and drop. Something might require a bit of time on the grill, but for the most part, assemble and go. If you've been to Waffle House you've seen the breakfast version. If you've been to Miracle Mile, you've seen it deli-style. It's practically cafeteria line-order fare. \n\nFor the prices of the offerings and the extraordinarily poor service, I just don't get why anyone comes here for lunch. (And it's only open for breakfast and lunch.)\n\nGet yourself some veteran hosts, servers and line cooks, Stan.\n\n(They get an extra star because I ate breakfast there once-- like most of the reviews on here-- and it was pretty good.)
