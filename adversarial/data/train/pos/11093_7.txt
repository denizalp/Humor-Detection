What isn't to love about a restaurant where the beer and wine menu is twice as long as the food menu?\n\nMy aunt decided to visit me in sin city this past weekend and this was the first restaurant on her list that she wanted to try.  We arrived at about 3 on a Saturday afternoon and there was only about a 10 minutes wait.  We were seated by the very sweet host.   We were seated on the side near the walkway\n\nTruffle Chips - They are huge!!  They are about 1in x 1in x 3in.  I heard they are boiled, baked, and deep fried to give it that wonderful consistency.  The Truffle Chips are special because they drizzle it with wonderful scrumptious truffle oil and top it off with truffle shavings.  There are also two dipping sauces one tomato based and the other has a creamier consistency\n\nPub Lamb Burger - This burger comes with a good sized lamb patty that is cooked to order.  Topped with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes.  It was wonderful!  You also get a side of their giant chips.  If you are a beer drinker I recommend pairing it with a bottle of Delirium :)\n\nI took off one star because of the tight seating situation.  My aunt and I were seated near the edge of the restaurant and we could barely get in and out of seats.  I'm not sure if all parts of the restaurant are like this, but it was pretty uncomfortable.\n\nI really enjoyed my experience (minus the seating issue).  I can see myself coming back in the future if I have more visitors, but I will be sure to try and sit in a different section. \n\nTIP: \nI recommend parking at the self parking near the Forum.  Once you come off the elevators turn right and you will run right into the Pub & Grill\n\nBust out your Total Rewards Card (the players club card for the Harrah's Casinos) and save a buck or two on every item.
