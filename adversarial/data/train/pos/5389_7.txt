Every time I've been to this food court -- no matter the restaurant -- I'm always disappointed by the crunch factor of my rice. This is culinary 101. Learn how to cook and hot-hold rice! \n\nAnyhoo, aside from my crunchy surprise, the food was tasty. I had the General Tso's chicken and the ginger orange chicken. Both were nummy -- they also have packets of Sriracha so don't forget those! My only complaint with the food is that it isn't hot. Lukewarm at best. \n\nOh and beware of the mixed veggies! They're good, but they add mushrooms to them! I hate mushrooms! Thankfully they're big so the nice lady was kind enough to pick them out for me when she was boxing up my order.
