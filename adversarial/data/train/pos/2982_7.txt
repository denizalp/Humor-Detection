When in Vegas, we always love to dine out and this place was on the radar of one of our friends from Nor. Cal.  This place with over 1,400 reviews was all the buzz of the town. It's pretty much go BIG or go home for this place and their menu went big with the Steak and Lobster Pho. \n\nAlthough we didn't get any of that, we as a group of 16 that came in at 10pm was easily accommodated.  Even though we sat in 2 split tables, I thought the service was excellent. They came back for water refills, drink orders, and was not hesitant about splitting checks due to our large Cali family that meets once a year in Vegas. I also appreciate that even though we had as a group of 16, they didn't automatically charge us the 18% tip and thus, we gave them 20% since we appreciate that kind of service. \n\nAs for the food, here's the sketchy part. Some items I do feel was a little overpriced. Ordered a Pho Tom for $11.99 and it came with about 5 shrimps. So value wise, it was not great and taste wise, it was just okay. \n\nHowever, the Oxtail Fried Rice was excellent. It comes with a perfectly cooked egg on top and though it was $16, it was terrific. Also ordered the Spicy Hue noodle soup. Their shank was excellent though it was sliced thin and there wasn't enough of it. It is spicy, maybe a 7 out of 10. The broth was excellent as well. \n\nLove the flavors here, just a little torn about how much you get for the price. But I would definitely come back here, perhaps with a large group again so we can share other items from the menu. The shared parking lot at night took a little effort, so you have to be a little patient finding that spot.
