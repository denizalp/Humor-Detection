Woods Family Sandwiches has done so well for themselves in Henderson that they've now opened a new location on the East side! Specializing in Boar's Head meats, cheeses, and spreads, the sandwiches come on fresh French rolls in 6 and 9-inch lengths or your choice of a wrap. Salads, soups, and sides round out the menu.\n\nBread is nicely soft, protein is generously portioned and high quality per the brand's reputation, and the combination of flavors on the Blazing Buffalo Crunchy Sub (buffalo turkey, crispy fried onions, lettuce, and bleu cheese spread) worked well together. Definitely spring for the larger size, as a buck more gets you 50% more sandwich ($6.99 vs $7.99). \n\nBreakfast, combos and daily specials are available. There is no shortage of sandwich options in this area, but the value and service (family-owned and friendly) make this spot stand out.
