This is the 2nd time I've been here. Where do I start?? Ah! How about the chandeliers ! Such a gorgeous bar tucked in the middle of the Cosmopolitan casino upstairs. \n I ultimately came here because a friend suggested I tried a drink called the \"Verbena\" . How this drink works is that you chew on this flower for 15 seconds. It then numbs your whole mouth and then you drink the cocktail. My goodness. First timers this will probably will catch you off guard. But once you try it for the 3rd time , I must say it feels pretty good and taste great! I definitely suggest trying this drink at least once in your life! \nI do have ONE COMPLAINT and that is how bad our cocktail waitress was. I've never waited so long in an upscale bar to get a drink ! My ice melted into water in my cup and she still failed to come to get our 2nd drink order.  Booo.  I'll be back but I'm crossing my fingers I won't get her as my waitress again. Lol
