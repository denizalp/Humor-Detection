Summer is approaching as we all shed our pale office skin. We all need a little help here and there to look little more refreshed.\n\nTami was so sweet right off the bat. She made me feel really comfortable and the preparation was great, better than other places I've been to.\n\nFound her on groupon and she was located in the back of a nail salon. She was such a pleasure to work with. I was fully aware of how to prepare for a spray tan but she was the only one that helped me fully prepare for everything!!\n\nLast year I found a groupon for a spray tan in costa mesa and felt like it was terrible attitude like I was just another cattle in line and then looked an oompa loompa afterwards. For Tami, she made a mixture that enhanced my skin tone. \n\nI definitely recommend her, I wouldn't be phased by her being located inside a nail salon. Will definitely come back with some friends!
