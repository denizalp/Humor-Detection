Just moved into Juhl.  I recently moved from San Diego and had a place in a high-rise similar to Juhl.  Been very pleased with the facility, amentities, and staff.  The staff has really been awesome, always helpful and available.  Sokha, specifically, has been fantastic - she continues to be great with answering my questions and making my transition smooth.  Everyone staffed there brings a smile and a positive attitude - very cool!  \n\nExcited about my condo and look forward to morepositive experiences at Juhl.
