YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(331\/365) \"Sweet Deals On Black Friday\"\n\nThere are a few boutique sneaker shops around town, and when I think of customized shoes, a couple of things come to my mind-one of a kind designs not found anywhere else, and of course they'll cost a pretty penny, especially if it's owner is Hip-Hop Artist Nas!\n\nWalking around at the LINQ on Black Friday evening, we came upon Midnight Run, and something just told me to go take a peek inside. Now anyone who knows me knows that I love me some Adidas Originals, Puma Suedes, and Puma\/Adidas gear too, so I browsed around not expecting to buy anything and I came across some sweet kicks that were a perfect fit too!\n\nAside from fitting perfectly, they were rediculously priced at  only $20 a pair! What a steal these were, and I was happy with my purchase, and the fact that I didn't have to deal with lines or crowds on this Black Friday!  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  4
