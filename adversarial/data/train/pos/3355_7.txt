Sunday August 14, 2016, 10:00 AM AST:  You have one job!!! Waffles!  Make them good. Make them affordable. Make them available. No one is raving about how good they are. Everyone is claiming that they are overpriced for what you get. But the main problem I see is that people want waffles at waffle time which is daily 6:30 am until 11:30 pm. So with all of the overload in advertising they company NEGLECTED to advertise that for some strange reason they are closed in Sunday!!!  Forget heading over after Church! Forget packing up the kids for a special treat. Waffle love is closed on Sunday...wasted my drive, wasted my time, wasted the family time and there are all these sad kids now. Well earned  and deserved 1 star.  I was at your door and your place of business was closed. First hand experience!!! Thanks.
