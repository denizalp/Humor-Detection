We went to Peperoncino for a 50th Wedding Anniversary party.  This restaurant was wonderful. They went above and beyond. The food was delicious. The pasta was hand made and the sauce was absolutely perfect.  Service was great and friendly.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Thank you Ida for the fantastic meal and a great time. My family loved everything!
