My go to for organic and local because it is just so convenient.  This market is steps from the Ctrain and perfectly located in the eclectic neighbourhood of Kensington Sunnyside.  Today's mission was plants for my deck planters. As I hoped they had a beautiful selection of local herbs sans pesticides for a great price.  Of course being a hot day. I couldn't resist checking out the local gluten dairy free ice cream either.  Got some advice on a good sunscreen and managed to barely avoid the bakery (this time). Staff are friendly and knowledgeable, selection is limited but always what I'm looking for and priced competitively with other similar markets.
