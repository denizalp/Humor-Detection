My fianc√© and I walked in to Rubio's at 8:34 pm 02\/06\/16 and were greeted half-heartedly. The cashier came out to take our order and had a bitter attitude from the start. Instead of being helpful about healthier menu options he was snappy and I didn't appreciate it. I understand the store closes at 9, but I didn't think we were late enough to cause such irritability. As we walked away, I heard him say he was going to lock the door because \"it's 8:30\" and I assume it was his manager who said \"no, we're still open.\" We sat at a table as the manager cleaned up around us and proceeded to belch out loud. Absolutely disgusting. Thankfully, the food was decent but I do not recommend coming into this store anytime past 8pm unless that's the kind of behavior you'd like to deal with. What a shame.\n\nAlso, the manager then proceeded to literally sweep our feet as we sat at the table finishing our food. Absolutely rude and inappropriate. I'll be contacting corporate tomorrow to complain about the poorest customer service ever received at Rubio's.
