So I had heard from a couple of people that this was the best Chinese (American\/Chinese) in town. That is not true at all! I tried a sampling appetizer, dumpling, sweet and sour chicken, among other things and there was simply no flavor nor originality. The decor of the place is nice, that must be what people are mesmerized with, so much so they forget to pay attention to the screams of agony from their tongue! I do not recommend this place.\n\nA good note is the waitress was great and the decor is fun but that's is not what I go out to eat for...
