Whoa, a good plate lunch place in the desert! \n\nIts not exactly Hawaii's plate lunch but nothing wrong with some reinterpretation for mainland taste (mashed potatoes as an option instead of rice, or chicken katsu with brown gravy; huh?)\n\nThe teri steak, teri chicken, and kalbi are just as good as any back home.  All are deeply marinated, lightly charred, cooked well done, and served messy over rice and mac salad. Win!  The Portuguese bean soup and oxtail soup are also both good but can't top the best back home.  \n\nThe plates are large. \n\nPrices are EXTREMELY high.  At around $10 per plate, its even more expensive than most Hawaii plate lunch restaurants.  Unfortunate since you can get so much more for your money elsewhere off the Strip.
