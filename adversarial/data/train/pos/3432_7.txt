If you come and watch this show and not smile or laugh at all....... you're weird.\n\nSeriously the best (and only) magic show I've ever seen. I was super excited to see his performance because I had watched his journey on America's Got Talent. The show will give you all the feels, it'll make you laugh, cringe, smile, maybe even cry...from laughing so much.\n\nDon't hesitate to buy tickets. The show is truly a great night out!\n\nPS, we sat in the booth section which was very comfortable! Otherwise, there's tables and individual chairs. It's a small theatre and he has big screens so you can see from anywhere you sit.
