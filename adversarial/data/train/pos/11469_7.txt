I don't know why I'm not a bigger fan of this place.  I guess because it's always decent, but never great.  Oh yeah, and the service is USUALLY slow  (today was an exception at least on the latter front.  In and out in 45 minutes).  If I was a real stickler, I'd deduct another star for the ridiculuous number of speeling mistokes on the memu.\n\nThe beer selection here is enough to keep everyone happy; I had the Fullers London Porter, my friend balanced out the universe by having Stella Legere.  We both went for the pork tenderloin, having tried it before and been very pleased.\n\nThe pork was savoury and came swimming in a delicious mushroom gravy which kept it moist.  The fries were tasty and the veg was nothing to scoff at (although standard fare and nothing more).  My dining partner and I were both disappointed with the portion size (I counted four motuthfuls of meat on the whole plate) and when we brought this to our server's attention she was good enough to bring out a second helping on the house.  Still, I remember the portion being a significantly larger last time (even after the topup) and am not sure what the future holds for this plate.
