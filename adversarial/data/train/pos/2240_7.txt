A twenty minute foot massage. That's right, I said twenty minutes! In all the years that I've been going to mom and pop nail salons, I have never had such an extensive and amazing foot massage to accompany my pedicure until I happened to walk through the doors of Ocean Spa and Nail. \n\nI came across Ocean's doors by total chance. I needed to kill some time in the area, saw a nail salon and thought...you know? i could probably use a pedicure right about now. I walked inside in a \"just ok\" mood and I walked out with a happy hop, skip and jump in my step! Upon arrival, I was greeted immediately by a man at the front desk. I peaked inside and everything looked clean and nicely decorated. The pedicure chairs looked heavenly and the staff looked friendly, so I decided to give them a shot and I am so happy I did!\n\nMy pedicurist's name was Vivian and she was as sweet as can be. While I sat in a blissful massage chair that made me float into a land of Nirvana, Vivian did an excellent pedicure and was so sweet and friendly along the way. The atmosphere was pleasant and soft spa-like music played in the background. \nThe pedicure lasted awhile but it was such a spa experience, I didn't even care, especially after a twenty minute foot massage! It was worth every cent of the $25. The pedicure pricing starts at $25 and goes up to $45 depending on the level of service. I would have liked to get a manicure but I didn't have enough time. Next visit though, I will make sure to plan accordingly. \n\nPayment note! You can pay with a debit or credit card, but they only take tips in cash so be sure to have some cash on hand, otherwise you'll have to pay Fry's Signature Marketplace's ATM a visit next door like I did. \n\nSo if you happen to be in this area or driving distance to it, it is definitely worth the visit. I will drive from Old Town solely to come back to Ocean Spa & Nail.
