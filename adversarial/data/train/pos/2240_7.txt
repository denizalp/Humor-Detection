Not joking or hyperbole: this was the worst hotel experience of my life. The room was super basic, smelled bad, and looked like it was decorated in the 70's. Worst of all,  they started doing construction with a JACKHAMMER at 7:30 AM in the room next door. I was stunned. Will absolutely not go back, despite it being very close to my office and fairly inexpensive.
