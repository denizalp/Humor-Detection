I am going with a not bad on this one. Definitely not great, but not bad. I'm in Phoenix for training and the rest of the class went to panda, I went to get real food. The server got my order completely wrong, but as time was an issue I didn't make a fuss. I ordered lasagna but ended up getting some sausage pasta concoction. Sweet. When I brought it up my server was even more awkward. \n\nThe little machines on the table to pay sucked. Sometimes I just want a person to run my card. \n\nEverything else was normal. My salad and breadsticks tasted exactly the same as every other visit ever. I wanted dessert but didn't get any. It was all lackluster and to be expected.
