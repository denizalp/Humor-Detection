Well, I have to say that I never would of thought of coming here on my own. But, My girlfriend had been here before and really liked it.\nSo we give it a try then.\nIt is located in a shopping center,right on the end. There is a decent amount of parking. The fun thing is you can bring your own booze in. Either beer or wine.\nYou do not see that in many places, so I like it.\n\nThe food is really fresh and quite good. I am not a huge fan of healthy food, but I will do it for T's sake.\nI do like it here though, not too bad at all. It is a bit small in here. So it can get crowded fast. It is clean ,and the staff is fun and nice.
