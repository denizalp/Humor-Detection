Decided to try the Cleo here for dinner. My husband mentioned they got good ratings here so we headed off the strip to check this place out.\n\nWalking in everyone greeted us politely. Very friendly. We just had buffet that morning and wasnt pleased so we were hoping dinner would be better. Turns out it was.\n\nI understand that they served tapas here but its a tad bit expensive. You definitely get what you pay.\n\nLamb Shawarma: super good. The meat just melts in your mouth. Im not a huge fan of lamb but this restaurant has turned me into one \n\nVenison Sausage: this is my first time trying anything venison. My husband told me before its very chalky or grainy when hes had it previously. But the sausage here was amazingly delicious. No complaints and I'd have it again if it was offered. I cant describe the taste of it but it was definitely worth trying.\n\nBone Marrow: honestly this is also my first time having Bone Marrow. Technically Ive had it at a buffet before but this tops it off. I love how buttery and fatty the taste came out. So far im convinced anything ordered here will meet anyones expectations.\n\nLast order is the specialty mushroom flat bread. Since we had ordered all small plates I was worried my husband and I were still hungry.  So we decided to order the flat bread which actually filled us up. Very delicious and full of flavor. The plates seemed small but it was actually a lot. The bill at the end came out to about 73 bucks. Totally worth it for the two of us.
