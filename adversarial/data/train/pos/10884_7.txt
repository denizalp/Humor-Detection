I would give them no stars if i could i gave them my info to run my credit only (ford motor credit) i now have 10 hard inquiries on my credit report.  when i found out and was told no big deal by the sales man. Don't trust them I'm still  looking for a new car i have had 3 ford focus in the past. Its time to move on if i cant trust a ford dealer at all i will move on to a different make.
