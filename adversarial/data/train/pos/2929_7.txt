This place has tons of shit but no one that wants to help \nanyone or provide decent customer service.  \n\nThey do offer price match both print and online. So if you can get a better deal else where see if they can beat the price.  I would give a better rating but the service is the biggest issue.  Especially when you have a bout 200 sales associates on the floor.  Customer service 101 smile, make eye contact, and say HELLO!. Easy as 1,2,3. Have a training class it might benefit your top and your bottom line MR. FRY.
