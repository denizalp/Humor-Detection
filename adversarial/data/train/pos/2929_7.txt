\"Feeling hot hot hot...Feeling hot hot hot! I almost feel like singing the rest of the song for this review, because it was hot in there. I imagine that all warm summer days  will lend to this overheated state. Because, while beautiful, this studio rests at the top of a three storey building downtown and their primary cooling mechanisms were ancient fans propped in open windows. I personally like hot yoga, but it is important to know what you are expecting when you go into a class. \n\nThe class itself was run by a lovely instructor and her faithful companion. Before the class began Rosie; said instructor; came around the class and met each student, making herself aware of any special needs as well as each persons yogic level. She was sweet and kind, and I would go back to any of her classes. After meeting everyone and getting a feel for the class Rosie led us through flow after flow after flow, asking us to deepen and to listen to our bodies, while constantly giving alternate options for poses, both to increase or decrease range of motion as necessary. \n\nI particularly liked how at the end of class during the \"lay like the dead\" portion of the class, she and her delightful counterpart made their way around the class centering each student and massaging the back of your neck for a short time. I'm not sure if this is normal in all non-moksha classes, but it helped bring the attention into the body and the places of remaining tension.\n\nAs a note, there are both blocks and straps available for free, this definitely was a bonus for most of us newbies. Side note, I wonder how much longer I get to call myself a yoga \"newbie\", TBD.\n\nBottom line...I'm finding more and more studios that I like and don't like, I will put this in the \"like\" category, but probably won't be back for a while.
