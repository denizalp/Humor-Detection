We paid for Jolly inspections to come out to our house on two separate occasions before we purchased our home.  Since we moved into our home we've had to replace our hot water heater and also update the code violations on the hot water heater.  The hot water heater leaked sediment when you turned on the hot water. The pool heater was not up to code and was leaking gas and that was another code violation that had to be fixed as well as the master control panel that was not working properly. All of the faucets in the bathroom had the hot water shut off prior to us moving in because the hot water made the Faucets drip and that was not caught on the home inspection as well. All of the electrical outlets in the house had to be replaced because anything that you plugged into it would fall out. Not happy! We should of been notified prior to moving into our home of all of these issues.
