Meh. \n\nThe Buffalo (a place in America) wings were very good but had absolutely no heat.  The Viking (a guy from Norway) hamburger had absolutely no flavor--NONE!.  If this is what food is like in Norway, I understand why so many Norwegians moved here.  Furthermore it explains why Vikings were pissed off all the time.\n\nDid I give it too many stars for a meh?
