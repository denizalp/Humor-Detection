I'm surprised the mint here doesn't have a bigger ego because it definitely deserves a superiority complex. It's shit hot. Firm, velvety and over-the-top full 'n luscious. I've never seen fresh mint like this. And since it's mojito and tropical fruit salsa season (ask me for my recipe), there's no better time than to hoard the herb. Extra emphasis on the H in herb.\n\nI'm disappointed that I only recently learned of Fruit King's existence, but I'm happy to have found a herb supplier. If you're looking for ataulfo mangoes, apricots or avocados, they can be had much cheaper across the street at The Other Fruit Marketâ„¢ but for herbs and all sorts of other greenery (chicory, arugula, frisee), Fruit King trumps them all and is dirt cheap to boot.
