I have been getting my lashes done by Mai for nearly a year now. She is a true professional and the best at all that she does. I had micro blading eyeliner on my top lid and it is so natural and highlights my eyes perfectly. I have recommended Mai to so many friends and everyone loves her. You can't go wrong with any of the lash artists there. They are all great and so friendly and professional. Plus, they are open 7 days a week with one of the girls always there! If you want beautiful lashes and a very friendly, professional, relaxing, clean, atmosphere, this is the place for you! I highly, highly, highly recommend Mai and any of the girls. I'm obsessed!
