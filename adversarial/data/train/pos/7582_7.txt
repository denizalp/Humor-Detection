Yummy chicken salad sandwich. The bread was really quite good. I do not usually like apricots but i enjoyed the bread that had baked into it; apples, walnuts and apricots. The servers were very nice.The restaurant is very small and in an old building in the historic area of Glendale. I adore old restored houses\/cottages. The only negative is the place is a bit pricey for lunch. Maybe it is a better place to go for dinner? 19 dollars seemed a bit much for a sandwich lunch and a drink. I do want to go back and try the Perogies though.
