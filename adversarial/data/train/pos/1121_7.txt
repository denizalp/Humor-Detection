This Comic Book themed restaurant in Yorkville means HULK SMASH your wallet . Figures.\n\nFinally visited Figures after being in my list for a while. Food is ok overall, but the experience was unremarkable - nothing spectacular to justify the high price. All dishes are tapas style so they are small portions. My favorites were the Arctic Char and Canadian Lamb, and they were the most worth it too in terms of portion if you decide to go.\n\n7 foodies split 8 dishes plus I had an $18 cocktail (cheapest they have is $16 ). My bill before tip was $50, and I felt like I only ate an appetizer that dinner. A kryptonite to my wallet .
