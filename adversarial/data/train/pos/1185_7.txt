We come here about once a year.  Kids like it a lot.  To me it is like Cici's and Chuck E Cheese had a baby.  John's has more food options and better games, even rides, bowling and mini golf.  Food is not great.  They have soup, salad, pasta, pizza, bread sticks, chicken, desserts.  Lots of options at least.  There's a bar that serves beer, wine and margaritas which you might need after being here for awhile.  Every time we have been it has been busy, like a madhouse.  Dirty tables everywhere.  I think the clientele is a big part of the problem here which John's can't really control.  Kid running around putting hands in the food, acting wild.  Many of the adults not much better, making a mess, not caring.  It's unfortunate because really that is what keeps us away.  Prices aren't bad and the kids love the rides and games.
