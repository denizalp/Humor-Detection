To me, Momofuku is the typical Las Vegas over-hyped restaurant. Very small portions for insane prices. I mean pickled vegetable for $15? What has the chef been smoking to charge these prices? \n\nWe had the bite-size, $14 buns (Pork Belly - hoisin, scallion, cucumber). They lacked sauce, crunch and left us wondering again about the mental state of the chef. Their noodle bowls again seem small for the price and not much to crave for. \n\nI say if you're coming from the part of the country that doesn't have picked veggies or noodles and you're stuck at Costmo and can't walk anywhere (maybe broken legs and hands) and are dying of hunger, then spend some money at this place. Otherwise, there're plenty of better places.
