After being wow'ed by the delectable shortrib chipotle mac-n-cheese served at the neighboring Elite event, I decided to show some love to CPK by ordering a full plate of that incredible entree, and not just show up for a complementary drink.\n\nHowever, the entree I paid for paled in comparison to the delightful fare I had sampled a mere hour beforehand.  The shortrib was tougher, and didnt fall apart and melt in my mouth like the free taste did.  The chipotle taste was spot on, but the beef was a letdown.\n\nSo, I left with the hard learned lesson that perfection is hard to replicate
