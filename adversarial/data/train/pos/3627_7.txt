blah blah blah- Crazy Horse this- Crazy Horse that. \ni seriously think this place has gone completely downhill. \ni've been coming here since 2004- and every time i've been back.. the girls look worse and worse. it's turning into Cheetahs! ewwwww! \n\ni know most strip clubs have a certain \"stench\" (yup, they do!)- \nbut this one really takes the cake. the smell of bleach, cologne and piss.. sexy! \n\nthe girls really know how to hustle- but it was getting a little desperate. we spent 40 mins in there and raced to the next strip joint.
