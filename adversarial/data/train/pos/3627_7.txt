Is it the best pizza I've had? Not at all. \n\nIs it the best in Little Italy? I sure hope not for the sake of Little Italy's culinary integrity. \n\nThat said, the pizza is good. There's nothing wrong with it at all, and the union of the ingredients make it pretty delicious. However, it doesn't compare with NY style, so I'm not sure about that parallel that several Yelpers drew (the slices aren't giant enough to warrant folding, crust isn't thin or airy enough...to name a few issues).
