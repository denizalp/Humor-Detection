My frugal meter died here!  I was with a group of people, and they told me to live a little.  Why the heck did I listen to them?  I was living quite well with my money in my frugal pockets!  Why, oh why did I stay and eat here?  I don't care if I did ride with them here!  I don't care if they are the only buffet with lobster, not worth the price.\n\nThis pricey eating trough has a variety of eating genres for dinner.  There is an Asian section with sushi and other traditional dishes.  There is a Baja section with fajita this, tortilla that, nacho chips here, and nacho cheese there, to name a few items.  There is a Mediterranean section that has a variety of items, including hummus.  Of course you have to have your carving section with the turkey, ham and high end beef, cut by a chef to your liking.  \n\nThere are truly many options to this buffet, but the price makes me ill just thinking about it!  Too much for even unlimited.  I realized too late that I was crazy.  For a few dollars more, I should have opted for the 24 hour, 6 buffet option.  This buffet is included in the list.  Had I purchased that, I could have eaten at this buffet at night, rested, ate at another buffet in the morning, did some afternoon activities, then ate at another buffet that afternoon, then rounded off my night with another buffet for hour number 23!  Run-on sentence, yes, but very logical still, frugal glee yes!  You live and you learn.  \n\nThe food on the buffet is decent enough to do the meal deal.  I don't understand gelato, but there is multiple flavors of that, along with many types of desserts to round off your meal.
