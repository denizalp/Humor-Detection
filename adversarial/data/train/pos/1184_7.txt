Sorry to say that I'm very disappointed.\n\nWalked out of the airport to the shuttle pick up island and took the first one that approached us which was Executive. It was $6.50 one way with option to buy round trip. I was flying back solo so I decided to buy the round trip. Got on board and noticed the sign \"Tips are appreciated as it is part of our wages\" I have no problems giving tips at all but for some reason when I see signs like that and it seems to be expected it irks me.\n\nSo out of five stops we were the last, and that's fine it is after all a shuttle not a taxi. My only complaint was the actual ride, I felt like I was on a roller coaster and more then once felt like we were going to crash in to something. \n\nGot to my hotel and forgot about the whole thing.\n\nNight before I was leaving I called the number on the token they gave me, which by the way is your ticket\/receipt. My flight was leaving at 8:45 so they scheduled my pick-up at 6:30, what a nightmare specially after a late night.  I got up and got down stairs on time. They told me that if the shuttle didn't show up after 15 minutes to call. I called at 6:45 and they told me the shuttle would be there shortly. 7:00 I call again, \"Oh the driver says he's 3-5 minutes away\" BS. It was 7:15 and after 45 minutes of waiting I was fed up. I had seen four shuttles of the same company (not Executive) drive by to pick up other people on time. Finally I asked the last shuttle I saw if I could catch a ride with them. I lost the $6.50 that I paid for the Executive round trip but at this point I didn't care. \n\nThe shuttle that took me to the airport was 50 cents cheaper, not tip sign, and a smooth\/professional ride. So of course I gave the driver a good tip, it was well deserved.\n\nDon't by a round-trip fare!
