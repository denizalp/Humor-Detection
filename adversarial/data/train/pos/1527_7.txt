I stopped in here one day to kill a couple of hours.  Like I suspected, it was mostly junk, but I did manage to find a couple of useful things. \n\nThere's a booth where an Asian lady does alterations for jeans and pants for 5 dollars a pair.  I found a magnet for my dishwasher that says clean\/dirty...what an invention! and I also found some awesome eucalyptus massage products that seem to work pretty well.\n\nOverall, its a pretty cool place to go if you feel like rummaging through a bunch of junk to find some not so necessary bargains!
