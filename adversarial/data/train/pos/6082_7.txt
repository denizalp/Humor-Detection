After breakfast, we headed to the grand opening of Glendale Park 'n Swap. Located just north of the other Glendale swap meet, but completely indoors, this may well be my primary swap meet in the west valley.\n\nThe first thing we noticed as we pulled into the parking lot was the entire building and outside vendor lots were surrounded with fencing that was topped with razor wire. Yikes, no stars.\n\nTo our surprise, the $1 admision fee was waived over the weekend. Yippy! One star.\n\nBounce houses in the parking lot and inside, most attended by terrific eye candy. Schwang! One star.\n\nA solid mix of crazy crap and only a small proportion of junk from China. Solid. Two stars.\n\nWe all purchased items today. PnS hosts Auto Row on Wednesday nights (4-10 p.m.) and can accomodate those wanting to set up a yard sale inside (only $10 in September). We were so satisfied, we plan to return in the near future. In fact, we barely noticed the razor wire atop the fence as we walked out.
