Your tastebuds are going to be happy! The flavors here are big and delicious. We ordered three dishes, and I am pretty sure we must have appeared to have not eaten in days given the rate of consumption combined with the fact that there wasn't even a morsel left on any plate. \n\nThe only things that were lacking: brown rice and vegetables in the panang. The Thai waitress let us know that in Thailand veggies in panang is just not how it is done, and I appreciated learning this. We decided not to add veggies just to experience the unadulterated dish, but I still kinda missed the vegetables. What can I say? I am a sucker for bok choy. \n\nHowever, these are tedious complaints because the food overpowers you with scrumptious. We had panang with tofu, pad see ew and the traditional Thai basil chicken dish (Thai name escapes me). We requested to get our chicken sliced instead of ground, and they were happy to accommodate! Of the three, I actually think the Thai basil was my favorite. Lost of basil and teeming with a perfect wok singed flavor. Spice levels were executed well. \n\nAll three of the dishes were recommended by the waitress, so I definitely suggest taking her guidance! Service was super sweet and quick. \n\nIn conclusion, I would love to eat my way through Penn's menu! Need to plan more trips to Henderson.
