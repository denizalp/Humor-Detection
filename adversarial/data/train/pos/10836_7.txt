I arrived late... 7PM last night. Had booked 'best room available' online through bookings.com (Huge mistake) should be called 'bookings.not!' . Asked if upgrade was available when I arrived at the hotel and for an additional 30.00 a night I got my 'upgrade' ... I didn't care about the price.. I wanted the nicest room they could provide me with. The view was beautiful!  I put my things in the room and left for dinner with my sister in the hotel  (150.00 for two at the hotel steakhouse.. No drinks) Came back to my room so tired... I went right to bed. \nWoke up this morning and in the morning light realized my room was disgustingly unsanitary and I had just slept in it...It had never been cleaned from the previous 'guest'. There was blood in my bed... I saw this first and thought I was hurt.. Realized it wasn't mine and started looking around  there was dried 'cum' on the ottoman, right next to cocaine on the floor and table(see pictures). The room was disgusting but I had clean towels and soap? I had several managers come to my room and they agreed it was disgusting! Promising to do a 'deep cleaning ' because they were 'sold out' and could not provide anything nicer. I told the manager I would be back late so they had plenty of time to clean it. When I got back my bathtub was still disgusting and at midnight had to have soap scum cleaned out. This happened in the HRH Tower... Nicest area available!!!! I hope I don't get sick :( \nStrongly recommend if you are staying here to check your room for unsanitary conditions !!! I took pictures...
