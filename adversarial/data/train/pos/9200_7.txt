My manicure started chipping 4 hours after I got it.  Now that it's the next morning, it has chipped (VERY noticeably) in 11 places!  \nI could go into detail about how incompetent the front desk girl is, how the nail tech kept leaving for 15 minutes, or more without a single word to me, how half of her polishes are 99 cent brands, how she overcharged me, or how she rushed through the services, but the quality of work just about says it all.  \nThe front desk girl had said that none of their groupon customers are coming back for second visits, and I can totally see why.   I feel ripped off  having paid half price.  Why would I ever come back, and pay double for a manicure that doesn't even last through the day?\nIt's a shame, because the salon really is cute.\n\nAlso, as far as the \"Champagne Saturdays\" the other reviewer mentioned...Flawlace never had a liquor licence,  so that's definitely over.
