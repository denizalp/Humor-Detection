Having been such a fan of Teaxluxe in Cambridge, MA and Providence, RI, I was so stoked to see a tea place had opened up in Tempe. Unfortunately it happens to be in the Tempe Marketplace aka Suburban Exile, it is near the bookstore and the Night Gallery for ASU and some nice seating outdoors to make up for it.\n\nWhen I first entered, I felt intense deja vu-like this place looked exactly like Tealuxe from the dark wood paneling, counter set up, tea menu, sophisticated booth seating with large mirrors and tea sets for sale. I mentioned it to the barista and she informed me the owner actually moved here from Boston and based it off Tealuxe-wha!\n\nI was so stoked, I felt like I was in a special Twilight Zone episode where you get to go home again...only instead of Harvard Yard outside the doors you get kids with drooping diapers running in a dirty water sprinkler in a mall-well, you can't have it all.  \n\nChai, soy based too, boba, loose tea, delcious cold tea of the day, I wish they had the same food at Tealuxe, where they served crumpets, salads and perfect little sandwiches and coffee cakes instead of the usual muffins, tarts, etc, which is their only docked star.\n\nOtherwise a fantastic place to relax to read or surf the net and sip perfect tea!
