2.5 Star\nCame here when my friends and I were craving for Vietnamese food. I got Bun Dan Biet. It is dried vermicelli with grilled pork, grilled shrimp and two spring rolls. Their spring roll was probably the worst one I've had. It super doughy and thick. Fillings were bland. Grilled shrimp was fresh and huge. Grilled pork was also great with BBQ flavors. They gave great portion of vermicelli. However, we tried to order Banh Xeo, Bot Chien and Banh Beo but they did not have anything...I mean why would you put on menu if you dont have any item. Bun Dan Biet was great with the fish sauce and I def got full because of the portion. They were also out of meat spring roll. I think they should improve on replenish their inventory before open.
