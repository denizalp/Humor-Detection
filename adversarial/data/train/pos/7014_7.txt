I love going to this location of regal cinemas. It's not as crowded as red rock.\n\nI highly recommend signing up for regal crown club rewards, I am always getting a free pop corn or drink and after a few movies you can get a free movie too.\n\nI usually buy tickets from Costco which are lot cheaper and they count towards regal points.\n\nThe concession stand has all of the regular things but recently added Samosas which is my favorite Indian snack. Also this location plays a lot of Indian (Hindi) movies which being Indian, means a lot to me. \n\nCleanliness is an issue sometimes, esp with bathrooms. But other than that, this is a great location for movies.
