This sport bar opened a day ago. A friend wanted to check it out for lunch so we headed over. It's not hard to find. Look for the sign out front and the big brass bull over the entry way. We were greeted by friendly staff and seated immediately. It was lunchtime on a weekday and there were only about a dozen people there. Our waitress was Shannon. She was cheerful and knowledgeable about the menu and answered all our questions. The place is nicely decorated and had like 20 television screens. \n\nI ordered a soda and the \"Freaking Hot Wings\". Shannon said they were the hottest ones they had. You can tell a lot about a place by the hot wings they serve. I've had some that were silly hot and tasted awful. No bones about it, these weren't all that hot but had a nice flavor. They were juicy and tender. The sauce they were coated in was tangy without a vinegar after taste. I got a dozen for $10.00 which was a reasonable price. They have quite a few flavors to choose from. Next time I may try another flavor, but I am interested in working my way through the burger menu first.\n\nThey scored a 3 in my book as the wings were lacking some serious points on the Schoville index. Just a bit hotter would have suited my taste. I also thought the wait was a little longer than it should have been for just a dozen wings. This won't detour me from a return trip
