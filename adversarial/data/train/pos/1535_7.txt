This place is my favorite place to satisfy my cravings for chat. My favorite is the samosa chat. If you like spicy, for me personally I can't handle spice too well, then try the Papri Chat. I always pair my food with the chai they brew in house and it's free! Perfect place to experience good Indian food away from home. Also, this place is an awesome place for groceries, they sell fresh produce as well!
