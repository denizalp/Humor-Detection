The whole time I was in here, I could barely think cause my inner cute girl was squealing like a little bitch the WHOLE TIME. Imagine me watching Cute Overload.com and drooling over baby pandas farting and baby kittens in elf hats mewling and little sloths so sleepy they fall off of sofas...now times that a thousand and I think my bf wanted to seriously strangle me.\n\nSO CUTE SO CUTE SO CUTE SO CUTE SO CUTE SO CUTE\n\nMy first impression after being in Frances Vintage was \"Wow, this place is really sparse and not all crammed with crap\" and \"good light\". Jason K was there at the display\/cash register and I immediately saw Junko Mizuno (google image her) figurine and grabbed my BFs arm. OMG. I started nerding it up with Jason. Okay cool, as a chick I would find stuff here. \n\nI do agree the guy clothing was much cooler than the womens clothing (Jason, do you have a lady to help you in that dept.?).\n\nWe really enjoyed looking at all the books he had on display, some pop surrealism, graffiti, vinyl toys, and general culture books that we lingered over for a long time. \n\nI also loved the display of medium vinyl toys and that bunny rabbit smoking? Put me over the edge. It was like a billion kittens in elf hats at once. I had a cute meltdown. I started grabbing. I dropped a toy in delirium. I wanted it all. I was like Veruca Salt in Willy Wonka. \"I WANT the golden bunny with the cigarette, daddy, and I WANT.IT.NOW.\"\n\nI calmed down. I took a few breaths. I almost bought the cute little Junko Mizuno key chain figure for 7 bucks (and I still do!), but I was overwhelmed and my BF had to escort me out the door, and murmured we would be back, back when I can handle it.
