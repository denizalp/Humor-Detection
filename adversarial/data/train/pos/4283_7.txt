This review isn't for the maids they actually do a wonderful job this review is for the owner Brandon. He started making me uncomfortable the second time I received services for my house cleaning. They couldn't find my house for some reason so he starts blowing my phone up while I was at work texting me like he is a friend it was really awkward. They finally found my place but then forgot to pick the cash up I left for them on counter so he starts texting me again after work. What kind of a business texts their customers instead of calling? The third time was a disaster because there was some miscommunication because he only communicates with his customers via text message. I was getting really irritated with Brandon at this point but I didn't want to screw the ladies over (I even left them a nice tip) so I had them come even tho Brandon was arguing with me over text message again while I was at work (he even called me after I specifically asked him not). I finally had enough of his unprofessionalism and decided to discontinue my service when he started texting me the next day giving me a nickname like we are friends. When I told him I wanted to discontinue my services and to please not contact me anymore he responds that I am rude and unprofessional and not yo contact him or his company again. Brandon really needs to work on his attitude and pick up the phone and call his clients instead of texting them.
