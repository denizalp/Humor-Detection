I love a family ran establishment, ran by such a sweet family where it is apprarent that they love and take pride in what they do! Gabby one of the family members\/co-owners took great care of our table. I asked her what her recommendation was since it was my first visit. She recommended the Chipoltle Shrimp dish(which you can also get with chicken), came with cooked to perfection rice and beans. The sauce was spicy and full of flavor, had mushrooms which I thought was unusual but the taste was amazing. Once my daughter and her dude tried the sauce they ordered a side of it to dip their food in. They are regulars that come at least once every few weeks and now I can see why. I can hardly wait to return to try their crab enchiladas, my daughter's favorite and hopefully save room to try dessert. This is definitely the place to go for authentic and great mexican food with fabulous service!
