Sometimes I see an Instagram post from them, apparently black out, and then somehow end up driving to Fort Mill. Yeah, they're that good. \n\nCupcrazed has some every day flavors like red velvet, classic carrot, and chocolate buttercream. Along with it, some creative as hell options. Frosted animal cracker, sour patch kid, Girl Scout cookies, white chocolate Kit Kat- seriously, they come up with some crazy good cupcake ideas. It's all delicious. Make sure to follow their social media, they post the flavors there each day at 10am. On Tuesdays, it's all $2. They also do cookies, brownie cups, cake pops, and other treats. You can also make custom orders. \n\nNote: sometimes they do run out (also, that's not their fault if it's a crazy, busy day). I recommend calling ahead near closing time just to make sure. And again, check their social media. They'll post if they run out! \n\nOwner Heather has won both Cupcake Wars and Rewrapped on Food Network. She really puts her heart and soul into this business. She's heavily involved in the community (a big supporter of RAIN). \n\nCupcrazed will open its second location this Spring and it will be in Charlotte. Look for it behind Parktowne Village (near Park Road Shopping Center).
