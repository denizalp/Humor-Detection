3.5 to 4 stars. This is a great place for lunch if you are a vegan or vegetarian. But even if you're not, you can still get some good, tasty items here. They actually have quite a variety of items from salads, to small pizzas, to sandwiches and other entrees. I had a few of their salads before and they were all very fresh and good. I've had their pasta and so far, they are very light tasting. Maybe not as good as their calorie-ridden counterparts, but what do you expect? For my most recent visit, I tried their Frisco Burger, which is a Chicken sandwich with spicy peppers and lots of cheese. This sandwich is very slippery so you may end up using your fork and knife for this one. They do upsell you on options that seem to be $2 each, such as upgrading to baked fries instead of the standard side salad. But perhaps the best thing that they carry is their desserts. Many are gluten-free (if that matters to you) and their cookies are wonderful. They will even heat them up for you to enjoy on the premises if you like. They're a bit pricey, $5.50 for 6 small cookies, but they are worth a try for sure. The food does seem to come out slow. Sodas are by the can. \nBut most importantly, the service has been consistently outstanding. I usually go during lunch and the young man who I always see is extremely friendly and very attentive. Whenever I'm not in a rush during my work day, I'll come here.
