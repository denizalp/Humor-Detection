One star because I have to... \n\nNever, will I ever step foot into this place again. I knew it the moment I stepped foot into the hotel that the club would probably be \"funky\". I didn't like the colors, the patrons, or the tacky go-go dancers in the hotel casino. I can't totally explain it but the vibe\/atmosphere seemed pretty tacky and low-budg. Honestly, I'm not surprised to see all the negative reviews. \n\nI was with a group of girls, and we walked all the way from The Bank in The Bellagio, so we'd thought we'd at least check it out. There were tons of lines outside to get in, well if you could call them lines (people were packed outside in a disorderly fashion). Somehow we eventually finagled our way to the front and one of the bouncers let the 5 of us inside -- without having to pay -- thank goodness! \n\nOnce inside we proceeded to pay $17 per drink, per weak drink that is. Mind you, I didn't \"call\" my alcohol. So for all I know, I could have been drinking Smirnoff (gasp!). The upside of this was that it was already late in the night and my taste buds weren't so finicky. We walked into the main dance floor where men were standing completely still and in awe,  gawking at the poor dancers on stage. Off to the left there was a lame group of people burning money, dollar bills at that. Side note: If you want to impress people and think you can do so by the act of burning money, then have the decency to burn something more than a 1 dollar bill. Which by the way, isn't it illegal to burn money? \n\nMoving on to the crowd, literally I don't know where some of these people came from. That's all I'm saying about that. \n\nOn to the music\/sound system. It was so horrible that even if I could tolerate the madness, it seriously made it unbearable to be there. The sound was scratchy and not too clear, and it was super loud and shaky. So much so that we all joked about how we felt the shaking in our throats even! Jeez. When asked about the sound, we were told it was a top of the line, super expensive sound system. One of the \"best in the world\" in fact. Uh, OK if you say so. \n\nPoint is I don't mind paying $17 a drink if I'm having a good time and if the drink has some kick to it, but can we get a decent crowd, and decent tunes over some good equipment? \n\nSorry to be so harsh, but sheesh! \n\nP.S. You were warned!
