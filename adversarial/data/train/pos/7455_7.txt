Bad Customer Service\nMe: I would like to buy a $6 smoothie with my groupon that is good for $10, will I be able to use the remaining $4 at a subsequent visit?\nEmployee #1: Yes, I think so.\nMe: Ok, thank you\nMe: My wife calls and asks me to buy something for her.\nMe: I get back in line and then ask a new employee if I can buy a $5 bowl and use the removing portion of my groupon.\nEmployee #2: That is not how it works, your groupon can only be used once. \nMe: If I had known that I would have used the whole $10\nEmployee #2: Sorry, would you still like the bowl.\nMe: No\n\nI am disappointed that they did not offer to at least take 3 dollars off a bowl on a subsequent on the next purchase when they knew what had just happened and I was given false information by employee #1.
