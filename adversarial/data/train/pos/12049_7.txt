Absolutely horrible. This is the worst company i have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. It took over two years for them to correct a very simple issue....caused by their faulty install work on my tiny 860 sq ft house!! Lies, excuses, cheap and unlicensed  labour. The list goes on and on. I eventually had to call the BBB for a refund of over 3000$ and the only reason this guy gave me a small part of my money back(total bill was over 9000$) is because the BBB told him that if he didn't, they could not close my file and he would always have a lousy rating with them. Then, unbelievably, about two months later, Vincent, the owner of this sinister company confronts me in a Home Depot parking lot and threatens my life!!!! I had to call 911 and have a restraining order placed on him. If you want to be ripped off ,lied too and then physically threatened...then this is the company for you. I will spend the rest of my days telling everyone i can about this joke of a company. Truely the worst experience of my life. What a sad world we live in.
