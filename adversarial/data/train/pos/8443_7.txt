I used to patronize this little bakery at the 104 street Farmers' Market in Edmonton, so I was THRILLED to find out they sold bread here in Calgary too, at one of the natural food stores.\n\nSo you can imagine my delight when I realized there was also a bakery here. Shrieks and demands to 'stop the car, stop the car!' may have even happened.\n\nI ran in, despite the fact they were clearly about to close, and started rummaging through the racks to determine which delicious, delicious bread would be mine. I was hoping to find their AMAZING Mediterranean Sourdough (which I once referred to as 'what the angels get to eat in heaven'), but sadly that is baked on Fridays, not Thursdays. \n\nThere was some amazing looking apple caramel bread, but since Chuck B is allergic to apples, I decided to be nice and get the multigrain sourdough. \n\nAnd it's amazing! Dense but light tasting, crunchy crust, fluffy inside. It is just the perfect simple bread to put with... well, hopefully everything and anything I have in the house! \n\nThe price for the breads seems ridiculous at first, but it's actually really worth that much (about $5-7 per loaf). I find that, due to the lack of fillers, Prairie Mills' bread fills you up FAST. So a loaf can literally last me a week. Not only that, it also STAYS fresh that long, especially if you have a bread keeper bag. \n\nIf you just want something to throw together sandwiches on? Don't bother going here. But if you want a delicious, beautiful, AMAZING bread for a special occasion or spoil-yourself rotten treat? Prairie Mill's got your back.
