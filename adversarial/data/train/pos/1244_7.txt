CLASSY.\n\n\nneed i say more?\n\ni really dont-- that one word explains it all, but ill elaborate just for the sake of those who dont believe me. the suite was HUGE, way bigger than what i expected-- living room, master bedroom and two bathrooms! the tub was heavenly after a long day of walking around the strip & the flat screen right in front of the tub wasnt too shabby either ;] talk about relaxation! \n\ni also liked the whole modern look of the room, it was kinda like spending the night in display room at ikea. i likeeee ;]
