We lived here as renters for 1 year and could not wait for our lease to be up.  The community is made up of a lot of middle aged people living back in high school....they think they're \"cool\" and if you're \"in\" with them (I cringe when I write this because they are such desperate losers) they might invite you to the pool on Sunday...oh wait the pool is open to all residents though...\nAnyways if you were never popular in high school and are hoping to be accepted by a bunch of morons then I highly recommend moving here :). We didn't put up with their BS so we were on the not cool list ;). Basically we have lives outside of the Villas at Stonecreek which is frowned upon :) \nIf you crave drama then you will love it here.
