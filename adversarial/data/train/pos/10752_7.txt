Time to rave about one of my favorite Vegetarian restaurants! \n\nHeck, Veggie House is one of my favorite restaurants in general. Chef Kenny's creations are seriously some of the best of both Chinese and Vegan cuisine! I've tried several different dishes here, and they have all been nothing short of amazing. On my first visit, I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp. I was a little skeptical at first, especially once my meal came out. \"Looks like shrimp... Tastes like shrimp... But it's not shrimp!\" How he is able to replicate the exact taste and appearance of real shrimp is the beyond me. What I am able to tell you is how much I loved my meal! The shrimp's sauce was so creamy and had a hint of sweetness. His vegetarian twist definitely did this popular Chinese dish justice.\n\nSince we practically live in Chinatown, this is a usual spot for me and Hubby to dine. He always orders the Kung Pao Chicken, which is another excellent choice. I would also recommend the Hong Shao Tofu and General Tso's Chicken- Two of my favorite Chinese dishes. The texture of the chicken (tofu?) is so spot on, it's crazy! You will definitely have to try this place out for yourself to see what I'm talking about. And don't worry my fellow meat lovers, I guarantee these vegan dishes will keep you coming back for more.
