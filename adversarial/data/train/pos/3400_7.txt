I LOVE PC!!! PC ginger ale is one of my favorite and it's constantly on sale here for 88 or 99 cents. Also, this location now has a Joe Fresh, which supplies me with 93% of what is in my closet. Other than that, Loblaws is more expensive than a lot of the stores like No Frills or Fresh Co (hearts all around!!)\n\nPay attention to the 50% off pink triangle stickers though, you can get some awesome deals and this sh*t isn't even expired! I bought the most delicious quiche the other day....nom nom
