The WORST service ever!  We showed up early on Thur night for dinner with some family and when we entered in, we literally waited over 10min to be acknowledged.  Add to that that when we did get acknowledged, it was by some guy that hurriedly told us that they were closing early (it was before 8 and they close at 9) that day and couldn't serve us.  *Are you kidding me??*  We were all really hungry and would hav never expected to be turned away that early for closing plans.  The door outside said 9, therefore you should stop allowing customers at 9, not an hour before - Truly disappointed and peeved.  Never going back!!
