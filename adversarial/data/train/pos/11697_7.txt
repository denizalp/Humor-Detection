Actual rating 4.5.\n\nWhenever the No1DP and I travel together one of our favorite activities is to relax, catch up and either enjoy the scenery or people watch over a good cocktail. After drinking together in at least quite a few bars over the last four years, we've classified our favorite bars into two types:\n\n1) A bar with a well-known cocktail program where the stars are the drinks themselves, almost every (or every drink!) has blown me away. Usually a drink or a bartender's skill stand out as some of the best I've ever had. Chandelier and Vesper at the Cosmopolitan are examples of #1.\n2) A bar that serves solidly good drinks consistently but what makes the bar\/lounge stand out is the ambiance or everything else NOT related to the drink. Parasol Up\/Down is an example of #2.\n\n---\nWhen the No1DP goes to Vegas he stays at the Palazzo or Encore because the conference negotiates a block of rooms at a rate more favorable than a regular tourist and the room quality itself is good. If the No1DP and I want a cocktail and he had just gotten out of classes and\/or it's my first day in Vegas the last thing he would want to do is trek to our favorite spots because the walk\/taxi would simply be too much. Parasol Up\/Down is our solution as it serves a good drink without the need to cross across the street.\n\nParasol Up\/Down is the Wynn's flagship bar. Though they serve the same menu it is separated into two areas - the upper level with cushiony red chairs surrounding the bar while the downstairs area, accessible by escalator, is smaller while allowing customers to glance at what's going on in the Lake of Dreams. No1DP prefers Parasol Down because it's smaller and quieter, while I like Parasol Up because of the cozy chairs and more opportunities to people-watch.\n\nWhenever you get seated you'll be provided with complimentary nibbles. I've been here twice - the nibbles were different but one item is usually salty, the other item is sweet and at least one of the items contains nuts (usually the sweet). And by nibbles, I mean more like a small meal if you choose to devour your entire plate. Luckily they'll provide you with refills.\n\nBartender service may be busy but they are attentive if you want them to be. When I mentioned that one of my drinks was just not mixed to my liking, she didn't hesitate in making me another drink. That other drink I liked much better.\n\nThe No1DP and I have made a small dent in the menu. Drinks here are definitely not cheap as is normal in a bar inside an upscale Vegas hotel but are comparable in other hotels of the same category, eg. the Cosmopolitan.\n\nDRINKS\n- Wynn Margarita (Wynn Select Patron Anejo Tequila, orange liqueur, fresh lime juice, yuzu puree, agave nectar, $17). For Vegas this is actually quite good. Yuzu lemon is a sweeter lemon than its Western cousins. Maybe this sweeter lemon is the reason I had more affinity for this drink than a lot of the other margaritas I consumed not in SD? The drink was mixed perfectly, highlighting the bartender's skill.\n- Pear-a-Sol (Parasol's Signature Cocktail - Absolut Pears vodka, Belle Paire Pear Liqueur, pear puree, fresh sweet & sour, $16). The No1DP liked this because it manages to capture the essence of pears in the drink. I'm missing out because I just don't like pears. Sorry, I've tried, maybe it's the bitter aftertaste that is throwing me off?\n- Lychee Blossom Martini (Grey Goose L'Orange Vodka, SOHO Lychee Liqueur, fresh sweet & sour, lychee puree, $16). One of the better examples of a lychee martini as the vodka is strong but I can still taste the lychee. \n- Cranberry Mojito (Finlandia Cranberry Vodka, cranberries, freshly muddled mint, fresh lime, white cranberry juice, club soda). This is a seasonal drink. Bartender mixed it well. This is not a traditional mojito recipe which substitutes vodka for rum but the cranberries muddle out the mint, which has put me off in regular mojitos. Club soda makes it a vodka tonic. \n\nSince the No1DP and I make it to Vegas every year for the last four years and been here for the last two we look forward to making more of a dent in the menu while taking in the ambiance that is the opulence of Las Vegas. Even in the fast-paced bustle we consider this as one of our favorite places to unwind.
