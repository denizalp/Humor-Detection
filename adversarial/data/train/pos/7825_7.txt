I'm a little bit country (I can sing along to \"Country Boy Can Survive\"), and Shepler's is a whole lotta country. While I don't stock my wardrobe here, I do enjoy swinging by from time to time just to inhale the smell of fine boot leather. Things I appreciate: \n1. You can hum along to country tunes.\n2. Exceptional customer service that stands behind their products. We were able to swap a faulty pair of boots we had purchased in Denver with no hassle!\n3. Unexpected bargains on unique pieces. You can find some men's shirts on sale that you won't see everywhere else. \n4. Boots! I have yet to purchase a pair for myself, but boy do I love browsing (and smelling).\n\nFor everything country, this is my spot.
