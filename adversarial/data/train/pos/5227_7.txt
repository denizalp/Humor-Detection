Terrible experience:(...\nI am agreed they have a lots of handy stuff  for good price, but customer service and attitude just terrible... They advertised broken iPad glass repair, and it was reasonable price for after market glass $50. So I trusted to repair, they promised warranty as well.\nIt took a week, screen was wavy and scratched, which is understandable, but the problem was that WiFi wasn't working after all. \nWhen I came back and told about problem they pretend they are all busy first,sending to different reps, and keep discussing about me in their native language. Definitely nobody want take responsibility for that.\nFinally another guy looking like just a friend of someone shows up and all together they told me they only \"took out glass and put it back\", no excuses or even trying to check if it's their fault or not. So\n they told me they can fix it for extra $40. and second later was busy with another customers, like I don't even exist there. Completely unprofessional. \nFirst thing I been asked when I called professional Apple service after this, was if I \"replaced screen before\". They fix it for me for another $75, and told me that WiFi antenna was completely ripped off and people who repair screen, shouldn't be in business at all... I am agree, I am in electronic business as well and know well about iPads and service, so had no doubt in a first place the antenna was damaged. They took no effort even politely speak and help, just \"get lost\" attitude...
