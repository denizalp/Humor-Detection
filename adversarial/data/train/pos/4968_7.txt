Fantastic, friendly service! Everything about my visit here was pleasant and amazing :-) :-) :-)\n\nThe front desk reception was polite and friendly, the waiting room was comfortable...but most importantly, they fixed my dent in no time flat. DC explained everything to me in a very patient, understandable way and made me feel completely at ease with the whole process. As a chick, I always feel like I'm getting hosed whenever I do anything automotive-related...but this experience was completely the opposite.\n\nI will DEFINITELY come here again! These people are on top of it!!
