This was the lamest IT'SUGAR location I've ever been to... Especially in comparison to the other tourist-y sweet shops like Hershey's and M&Ms World. \n\nIt's small, it's lackluster, and nothing really stands out. There's an adult-oriented area that just seems out of place and crude. General selection of candy and chocolate is minimal. Prices are outrageous, even for Vegas. It's also quite stuffy, but so is the rest of the Grand Canal Shoppes. \n\nForgettable experience. Not worth making a detour for, but fine for a quick candy craving or if it's on the way.
