On both occasions I've had my bike serviced at The Bike Clinic -- once for a tune up and once for a flat tire -- I wasn't very happy with the service. Prices are average. Staff seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves than helping me. Given that this is the closest shop to my house, I'd love it if it was better, but as it is I won't be going back here.\n\nWithin a couple weeks of the tune up my bike wasn't running properly again and I had to take it to Sweet Pete's (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/sweet-petes-bike-shop-toronto) for a proper tune up.\n\nWhen they fixed my flat they broke the new non quick release skewer I had just bought. Fortunately, they replaced it, but they gave me a quick release skewer, which I had just gone to the trouble of replacing since I don't want my tire stolen.\n\nNot an awful bike shop, but there's much better places out there.
