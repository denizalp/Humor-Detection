Rating DB's against every other sports bar in the area and it is great! There's a great vibe, bartenders and servers are very attentive and sweet, and the food is awesome. We came for dinner on a Thursday night and ordered the pizza roll ups (so good!) and sandwiches. I ordered the veggie sandwich with fries and everything was great. Lots of TVs and some games. This is an excellent choice to hang out or get some food, I will be back!
