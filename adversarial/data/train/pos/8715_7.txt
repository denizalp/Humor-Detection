By far the FLAKIEST and I mean flakes-stuck-all-around-your-lips-as-well-as-all-over-your-lap level of flakiness pie that I've EVER had. The crust is so deliciously buttery, yet you can eat an entire pie by yourself without feeling guilt or too greasy because it's so light and flaky. \n\nAlthough located rather unfortunately far for me, I have no regrets having traveled all the way here to try this place out. I tried the braised beef rib pie and my boyfriend tried the coconut curry beef pie. Both were generously filled with soft, tender meat and marinated in delicious sauce. The fries were mediocre (would not order again) but I would definitely come back for their pies if I were in the area.
