That's a bil ole whoppin WTF for lunch. \n\nI've been to Village for all 3 meals before and lunch is definitely the worst. Dinner is average, and breakfast is the best. \n\nBut lunch this time around was so pathetic. The selections are really heavy on the meat. Veal, roast beef (which is dry and inedible), pork, chicken, sausages, everything. I'd normally love a meat-centric meal, if it were actually good. But the quality of the meat was just horrible, and it's not like it had been sitting out for a few hours - we got to lunch just as they were switching over from breakfast. Meat and bread?! What kind of peasant meal is this?! Though I'd probably have difficulty laying out a strong selection for lunch. What are you supposed to serve anyway, sandwiches?! Lunch should be dinner, but lighter.. and with eggs. \n\nThe desserts were also pretty lame.. I was excited they had French macarons but the creme brulee was more flan than creme boo. The one thing I can say is that the coffee was good, and unlimited. \n\nI'm not liking their fluorescent blue lighting in the main room - if you can, get seated in the tiny dining rooms off to the side with warm lighting and French accents. Warm lighting is important to a healthy appetite!\n\nGo for the breakfast, ONLY!!
