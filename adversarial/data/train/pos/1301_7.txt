If you've been waiting to try this place I suggest you try and see for yourself what Delhi Indian Cuisine is all about. I've only tried 2 other Indian places in my Life both were in Vegas The first was India Oven and the second was Mount Everest. India oven was ok. Wasn't a big fan of that restraunt but then again I was also younger and not interested in broadening my horizons and trying different things. Mount Everest was really good their sweet rice was really yummy but they don't serve Garlic Naan anymore :( at lunch I believer so in comes Delhi. \n\n\n\nWe came at about 2 and there were 2 parties of people besides us eating here. They have the standard share of Indian offerings my favorite was the Chicken Makhani. It's probably my favorite Indian dish. It's super good especially with the garlic Naan. Free mango lassi with check in so that's also a plus. \n\nOnly thing I will skip next time is the Galub Jamun. It's a dessert. Little balls of I think bread in a almost diabetic coma sauce. It's wayyyy too sweet for me. \n\nI hope you last Delhi India cuisine. Just put the sweet rice on the buffet line and I will be extra happy !
