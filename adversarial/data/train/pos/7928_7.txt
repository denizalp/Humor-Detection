What a nice little modern stationary store! Wouldn't have found this spot without the Yelp app, as its tucked into a plaza I rarely go by. Store organizes display cards by occasion (anniversary, birthday, wedding, birth, etc) and has plain note cards\/envelopes organized by color. Quirky cute style of cards and products is reminiscent of what you'd find on Etsy or Pinterest.\n\n In addition to the cards, Paper & Home also has some small gifts and fragrances available for purchase. Besides the walk-in sales, they also do design and special order invitations, such as for weddings or events. \n\nSmall store is cute to browse for a few minutes, and service greets but doesn't pester you. They had a small but good selection of cards out front and center for upcoming Fathers day. I believe mine will be pleased with the one I selected, but I was torn between two good ones.\n\nBonus star for Yelp check-in offer: free letter press card, no purchase necessary.
