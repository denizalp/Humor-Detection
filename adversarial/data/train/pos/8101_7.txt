Are you a Hot & Juicy person or a Boiling Crab person? That is the question! \n\nI am currently Team Hot & Juicy. \n\nMaking sure that I don't come here as often as I use to, allows me to look forward to coming back. The garlic smell that lingers for about 24 hours on your mouth and nails tend to steer me away from coming. But other than that, this place is amazing. \n\nThe flavors just pop in my mouth, I love it. I usually get shrimp hot & juicy medium. With a side of rice, Cajun fries, and extra butter. I usually get the sauce from the shrimp and put it in the butter and use that as an extra dipping sauce. bomb! I can drink that spicy butter all day! It is very UNHEALTHY but hey, YOLO right? \n\nThe staff is pretty Attentive and with another location opening up its not as busy as it used to be before. This location does have limited parking space though which can cause some trouble for me. \n\nAnd for some reason their raspberry ice tea is amazing. It's probably just regular ol' raspberry ice tea you usually get everywhere but I think with all the spices, the raspberry ice tea just compliments everything lol!
