Updated to say we went again last night (in the hood craving smoked meat) and after our appetizer, the server cleared our plates and took our *dirty* cutlery off our plates, complete with gravy and food bits attached from the plate, and plunked them down on the table for us to reuse and possibly get norovirus.\n\nIf you don't know that it's not hygienic to put cutlery that's been in someone's mouth on a table that you wiped with a dirty cloth, and then expect them to put that same cutlery back in their mouths, you're gross and shouldn't be serving food to people in a restaurant. \n\nThe burger was salty, onion bun burned and the knish was also way way too salty. The salad (once again, why am I so stupid?) was a bowl of boxed salty croutons with a cloyingly sweet dressing.\n\nThat's it. I swear. Not going back.
