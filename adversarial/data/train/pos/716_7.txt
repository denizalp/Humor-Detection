First of all, I have always loved Yelp because it never lets me down! So when Yelp says it's good it usually is pretty accurate.\n So I came here because of the \"Yelp Top 100 restaurants\" lIst.\nThis place was voted #30 in the nation!\nLet's just think about this for a second.\nThis is the 30th best place in the nation to eat!? Wow, I gotta go.\nAfter looking at the pictures on Yelp I was a bit sceptical I must say, but Yelp has yet to disappoint!\n\nI just went to the #10 place on that list \"Little Miss Bbq\" and had to wait an hour to get in, but it was worth every minute! Amazing! Best food I've ever shoved down my face!\n\nSo around noon, an excited and optimistic me walks in to a relatively small place with lots of Detroit memorabilia on the walls and a very friendly girl working the counter. (Her and the staff are the only reason it gets even 3 stars)\nOne person in front of me in line.  (Not a good sign)\nShe said the Coney dog and hamburgers are what they are know for, so that's what I got. I also threw in some chilli cheese fries. \nDogs and burgers are cooked on a flattop and cheese out of a can. Kinda disappointing for the 30th BEST restaurant in the nation, but Yelp has to be right, right? Anyways, food came out fast and correct.\nSadly, it was what I thought it would be. Just normal chilli dog and the burger was good but extremely average. My friend made the comment about the chilli, \"reminds me of Sonic chilli\". He was spot on and that's not a good thing.\nRemember I'm coming to the \"30th BEST PLACE TO EAT IN THE NATION\"!  This isn't the 30th BEST PLACE TO EAT on Broadway, let alone nation!\nAverage might be a stretch, but the service and friendly staff gets it there.\nIf you want a normal strip mall sorta lunch, are from Detroit, have lost all your taste buds in a horrible fire breathing accident from those crazy circus days, you happen to break down on front of this place, only have a few minutes to eat before the tow truck gets there and are really into extremely average food. THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU!\n\nI've lost all faith in humanity and Yelp if this is the \"30th BEST RESTAURANT IN THE NATION\"!\nI'm now questioning everything I've ever been told in life.
