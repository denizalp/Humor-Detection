Ahhh...\nQuaaaa.....\nThe spaaaaa....\n\nThe syllable \"ahhh\" is about all I can manage here.  I went to Qua yesterday just for the Roman baths - which were only $35 mind you.  For your precious $35 you get access to the chlorine-free mineral baths which are hot tubs in three temperatures- warm (98 degrees), feckin hot (108 degrees), and  I'm freezing my ass off (70 degrees)  Couple that with lovely rainfall and this huge shower in the middle and you start off as an invigorated happy camper.  \n\nBut next you hit the cedarwood sauna which bakes you at a cool 190 F.  It's dry heat, so it's bearable and it really helps your skin detox after washing for months in Chicago acid rain (bka tap water).  There is also the option for the regular chlorinated hot tub.  After the sauna, I sat in the herbal steam room for a bit and cleared my sinuses then finished off in the arctic room, complete with blowing snow.\n\nPost bathing, you can take a shower in the luxe bathroom, which is fully stocked with beauty products and curl up in a comfy robe while enjoying a cup of tea prepared by the \"sommelier\".  All in all it's a wonderfully relaxing experience, except for the fact that it's clothing optional...in some cases that can be a little jarring....
