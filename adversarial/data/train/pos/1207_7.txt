So, I was introduced to Skechers by a very dear friend of mine. He bought me a pair, which I must say were and still are very comfortable. I have worn them daily to work. Being the type of person that gets hooked on a particular brand of shoes, stepping into these was a huge feat. Being a nurse comfort is my first idea when purchasing shoes. Not only for my feet but my back as well. \n\nI purchased a second pair of Skechers recently at one of the outlet stores. These particular shoes were suppose to be better than the last pair and made to target the pressure points in ones foot. Yeah right!  While in LV I came upon the Skechers store on the strip, right across from the Wynn. I took myself and my sore little feet into this store. I spoke with the associate in regards to purchasing a better pair of shoes. She inquired as to why I did not like the pair I had on, an I discussed my concerns with her. In the end I did purchase another pair of shoes. The same style as the ones the love of my life had gifted to me. Who would have known a man could know just what would make my feet feel good?  Ha ha never doubt those that know you best. \n\nWill I return to this particular store?  Perhaps in the future I might. Will I purchase another pair of shoes from an outlet, I really can't say. What I do know is I am in awe with the way my feet feel on a daily basis. I have also come to see that these shoes have lasted longer than the other brand I usually purchase. I will be investing in Skechers again. The prices are reasonable, the quality is great as far as I am concerned. Perhaps my discount Skechers were just of low quality.  Tis why they were on the cheap side?!? \n\nAs for those discounted Skechers I left them at the store in LV. The associated stated they would make a welcome gift for a homeless person.
