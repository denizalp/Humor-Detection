If you literally want to die, or care VERY little about your life- by all means visit this Walmart.\n\nI swear to you this Walmart has given me mental issues. Every time I pull into the parking lot my hands LITERALLY start trembling from the fear of entering this awful hellish pit of horridness. \n\nSince it is the only Walmart near Central Phoenix, there are no alternatives. There have been days when I HAVE to get something from Walmart (I avoid it by all means believe me) and EVERY time I go in to the temple of doom, I come out more mentally damaged.\n\nLet me start off by writing a list of why this Walmart is so AWFUL:\n\n-The parking lot smells like pee and rotten meat.\n-The parking lot has the craziest cars in it with the most ridiculous car decals on them. For example: \"R.I.P ______\"... only there are 7 different names on the car!! \n-There are thugs in the parking lot who will stare at you! They are just standing there, watching people, it's like.. Really?\n-People ask you for money from left and right in the parking lot. It's like, I'm resorting to coming to Walmart, do you think I'm shelling out dollar bills?\n-When you enter the store- it is horrible. \n-People fight at this Walmart! Couples cussing each other out accross the bread isle, dirty kids running around without being supervised by their parents (kidnap danger!), meth heads, weirdos, gross people, crazy people ect. One time I was in the dry fruit section and this guy threw a can of cashews at this girl while saying, \"Well then, f* you b*!\". No one did anything...\n-The lines are SUPER long and they have VERY few cashiers. No other Walmart is this bad. I am always in line over 20 minutes at this Walmart!\n-The employees are AWFUL. They will literally tell you they do not care. They are scary looking and often try to intimidate you.\n-People are selling CDs and magazine subscriptions INSIDE the Walmart!\n-People harass you for money INSIDE the Walmart and will call you a b* if you do not give them money (happened to me while I was buying scented candles) *tear*\n-Security literally ignores  you when you approach them about people harassing you at Walmart. \n-The employees talk to each other about inappropriate things in front of everyone (even kids). \n-Everything is dirty and disorganized.\n-Weirdos follow you around the store.\n-You literally feel that you will get mugged or raped while walking to your car, especially at night (scary feeling!).\n\nSo now, instead of dealing with all this trauma, I go around to my beloved Target on the other side of the shopping center. There is a security guard (sometimes 2) at the door. The shoppers are normal people. The parking lot is the complete opposite of the Walmart one. The store is clean and organized. The employees are normal and are actually nice to you. \n\nOverall, BEWARE of this Walmart! If you find yourself here, RUN AWAY. FAST.
