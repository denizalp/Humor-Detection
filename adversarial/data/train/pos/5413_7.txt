Happy hour review only.\n\nBrio Tuscan Grille's first location in town is at Town Square, and that outpost is far more accessible to me normally. However, some friends and I had just wrapped up our first stop of a happy hour crawl at another Tivoli Village destination, so I was more than happy to take a short walk over here.\n\nHappy hour here is Mon-Fri 3:30-6:30pm, and we were able to find one of those U-shaped booths in the bar area to enjoy a comfortable meal. I was disappointed to learn that they have only three beer options ($5 each), and I didn't feel like trying any of what they had on hand or partaking in the other drink options ($5 martinis on Wednesday, $5 wine glasses with expanded selection on Thursdays, $5-6 cocktails), aside from fun and surprisingly coconutty sip of my friend's Cosmopolitan.\n\nHowever, the food menu ($4-6) was more than enough to keep me entertained. I was pleasantly surprised that there are more options than at sister restaurant Bravo Cucina Italiana, which is located near me in Henderson but never truly impressed me for some reason. I enjoyed pretty much everything which we shared at our table.\n\nMargherita Flatbread ($4): very crispy, cracker-thin flatbread with fresh, traditional toppings. Fun, but not very filling.\n\nBuffalo Chicken \"Nachos\" ($5): potato chips cut not-so-thinly with a surprisingly amazing supporting cast of sauces, cheeses, and of course Buffalo chicken (mildly spicy at best) made this the one that I'd pick as my favorite out of the meal. I didn't even order it, but I'll strongly consider doing so next time.\n\nWarm Margherita Dip ($5): a very creamy cheese blend with delicious tomato compote on top and crispy, charred ciabatta to play vehicle. Another to add to my reorder list.\n\nBeef Carpaccio ($5): plentiful plate of thinly-sliced beef with mustard aioli, a mix of greens including arugula (my fave), and capers. Parmesan cracker to boot, although it's a bit awkward to break for sharing.\n\nBlack Pepper Shrimp ($6): shocker of the menu simply due to huge potion. Amply sized shrimp atop squares of crispy eggplant, all in a black pepper cream sauce. Would've been my fave if it had been just a touch less salty.\n\nI'll definitely have to find an excuse to visit the other local Brio now that I'm aware of what I've been missing out on, but this one is a good alternative if you're anywhere in the vicinity and would be happy not to wait at all to find an open seat for happy hour.
