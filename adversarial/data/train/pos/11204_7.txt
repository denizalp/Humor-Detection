The Magic Noodle is the holy grail of noods. Nay, of all foods. Hand pulled noodles are hard to find in The U.S., but it wasn't just their fresh noods that shined. They had the best broth I have ever had in my life. It was so good we went back two days in a row, even skipping the dayclubs in Vegas to get these soups. No regrets.\n\nYou can chose between 3 types of noodles, the OG hand pulled noodles (long spaghetti like noodles), knife shaved and the thick noodles. I personally love the thicker noodles because you get a doughy taste to them.\n\nMy favorite dish was C4, the spicy Szechuan beef noodle soup. The beef was so tender and I love their broth, but you can also add vinegar and more spices if you want! Also a must is the onion pancake appetizer. I will be making the trip back to Vegas solely for this restaurant.
