I can't get over how aesthetically pleasing this restaurant is!!!!\n\nGorgeous, open, and inviting. Bright colored decor and such a great atmosphere.\n\nSpecials:\n- Happy Hour; Mon - Thurs, 5PM - 7PM, $6 small bites and $6 drinks (wine, draft beer, and well drinks)\n- Half Off Wine Bottles; ALL DAY Thurs!\n\nI came here with one of my girlfriends on a Thursday for Happy Hour. We sat at the bar and shared a bottle of Davis Bynum Chardonnay (since all bottles were half off!) My friend ordered the wood roasted eggplant spread and I ordered the cheese and salami board. She didn't care for her eggplant spread but I love charcuterie and thought this board was well worth the $6! A few meat selections, 2 slices of cheese, bread, and an apricot or peach like chutney\/jelly. All of it was delicious and paired perfectly with the Chardonnay. \n\nThe bartenders were nice and attentive - no complaints there!\n\nI really enjoyed my overall experience and look forward to coming back. I'd most likely come back on a Thursday to enjoy a bottle of wine and small bites!
