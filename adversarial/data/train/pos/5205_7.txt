I am not a fan of noise, too close for comfort seating, or tables that are too small to comfortably have drinks and entrees on the table.\n\nThe menu is not for the faint hearted ... brains pig ears etc.  \n\nThe huge pork chop is very good and  definitely enough to share as a full entree ... the waiter knew we wanted to share the pork chop and order other sides didn't offer to have the double pork chop de-boned and cut in half in the kitchen ... not one of my finest culinary moments trying to make into 2 portions (on the tiny table)\n\nDo not go there if you have theater tickets ... we had 5:45 reservations and ran over to the Benedum for a 7:30 show ... \n\nThere are much quieter better restaurants in the theater district.
