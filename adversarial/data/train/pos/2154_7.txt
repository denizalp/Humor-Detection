I love spaghetti and meatballs. I love bread and oil dip stuff. I love pasta in general. \n\nI cannot stand being charged over $10 for 2 meatballs, sauce and noodles. REALLY\nNo matter how good the price should be much less. \n\nI would have preferred the kids portion but the server balked at me for ordering it. So now I doubt I would be back. \n\nI had S.A.M.B the meat balls were good, not mushy not over firm not over spiced etc. The sauce was good nothing special. The noodles were noodles. \n\nThe service was fine. Nothing great noting horrible. \n\nThe kids ate their meals but neither of them were over excited to go back.
