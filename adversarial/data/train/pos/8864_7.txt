Ok, I admit that it was tough giving 5 stars to a place that inspires fear & creates actual physical discomfort - but that is because mammography sucks, not the place.\n\nLet's face it, getting the ta-tas squeezed and flattened for digital imaging is just not on my list of favorite things to do but now that I have passed the big four-o it is a yearly requirement.  Since both of my grandmothers had breast cancer,  I am super nervous about my genetic odds... so I suck it up and make my appointments annually.  \n\nThe employees here are really friendly and efficient.  The facility is beautifully appointed - from the waiting rooms to the changing rooms and the actual imaging rooms. They are super fast and get you in and out quickly.  \n\nSo ladies, when it is time to take the girls in for their screening, I definitely recommend Charlotte Radiology Ballantyne.
