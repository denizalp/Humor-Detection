Horrible customer service ! Every time we visit Las Vegas, this is the go to place to get breakfast before we leave. However, because of this incident, we won't be returning.\nThey even manage to give us the wrong order. We had a hair in our bowl of pho. We asked for two small empty bowls, never got it until we went up to the manager herself and asked... Again. We even asked for three plates of onions. We asked three times, and all those three times, we were ignored. We didn't get it until I had to get up AGAIN and remind them. \nWhen I asked the manager for the waiters name, she hesitated and said his name was \"Phat\". Which was probably a fake name. \nThis place claims to be number one, but I beg to differ on their service and food quality.
