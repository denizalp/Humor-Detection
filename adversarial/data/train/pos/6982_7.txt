Hector was great.  I have been coming here for over a decade & the touch-free automatic drive-thru is awesome.  I love the rainbow colored soap that sprays the car down.  So pretty.\n\nAll of the employees & owner are very nice & quick.  They take pride in the business that's probably why they've been around so long.  I only use the automatic wash on the very end.  It's very open & airy feeling so I don't feel claustrophobic lol.  \n\nPlease remember to tip them cause they work hard.  I do the $13.99 touch-free wash so after tipping it's a good deal.  Also w\/ your Yelp check-in you get a free car freshener!  I got a coconut one since it's almost spring & I want a tropical feel in my clean car lol.
