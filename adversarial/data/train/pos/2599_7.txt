Came in search of vegan bread.  Figured Whole Foods was they way to go.  Found the parking to be a bit tight. Not the fault of WFM but the greedy developer of the shop center.  Upon making entry, the smell of the place was glorious.  It was mixture of oils, bakery, veggies and granola.  The boy and I roamed around the store in search of vegan bread while I spied the expense and goodness of clean eating.  Eventually we made our way to the bakery section.  The lady behind the counter was friendly and offered up a French vegan loaf.  She even sliced it up for me and with that we were out the door.
