The one star is for the meat plate... which was fine. Had my boyfriend and I left after that plate, this experience would have been... fine. \n\nWe did not try any of the tapas plates and dug right into the paella, after our server assured us it would be more than enough for the 2 of us. Honestly guys, my bf and I are not big eaters. We weren't expecting or wanting to leave stuffed. But we paid $34 for a plate of glue-y rice with a handful of shellfish in it. And it wasn't that good. I didn't want more of it. But I did want the scallops or shrimps we paid for, rather than the 2 we got. They advertise this dish for up to 3 people, so I'm not sure what kind of math they're using but if you've ever fed 3 adult humans, you'd have to know this doesn't cut it. \n\nUnfortunately, they were just as stingy with the wine pours, I've worked in the service industry long enough to know what a 5oz pour looks like. My $13 glass came with about 2.5. Guys. WHAT? Did you run out? \n\nPerhaps if the bartender hadn't been so busy keeping his fedora on straight and throwing his coworkers under the bus (halfway into my BF's Bloody Mary, this guy came over to let us know the girl who made the drink had done it wrong, and there was supposed to be another pepper in it. The BF had no complaints about the drink and this interaction seemed really petty, unnecessary and made us feel like we were in the middle of a sibling quarrel)\n\nReally glad we didn't order more, and know now to avoid this place at all costs. In all, we paid 100 bucks for a decent meat plate, a sip of wine, a pepper-less bloody mary and some grainy gut sludge that smelled like fish. Hoping the next restaurant to take this space has something better to offer.
