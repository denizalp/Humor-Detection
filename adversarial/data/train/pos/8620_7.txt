Dylan was the nicest and easiest mattress sales representative I have ever come across.  In fact, I have NEVER shopped for a mattress myself, until this past week.  I first visited the big and fancy Mattress Firm in Scottsdale...wow the prices and the cheesy sales people were enough to traumatize me!!!  I came across Dylan's mattress store while I was waiting for my hair salon to open.  He was so informative and pleasant to deal with!! He was able to show me his mattress selection that closely mirrored those at Mattress Firm, yet were half the cost!\n\nThe best and most exciting part of our experience at Mattress Brothers was that we received our new mattress within 5 hours of purchasing it, the same day!!!  I can't wait to sleep on it tonight!   \n\nDon't shop at the big stores.  Support local business and take a look at Mattress Brothers.
