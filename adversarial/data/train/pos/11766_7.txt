If you visit Vegas not that often, and the purpose is not really to gamble, get a better place. The renovation project has changed the old building into something more presentable. The interior is still \"minimalist\" and the design gets old fast. \n\nThe casino floor is crappy due to lack of traffic. The food places are decent. \n\nIt is a good place to avoid the crowd.
