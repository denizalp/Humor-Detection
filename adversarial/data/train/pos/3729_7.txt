While the shoe quality is excellent, their ordering practice is extremely poor.\nTwo pair of shoes were ordered on 12\/30\/13.  \nThree calls were placed after assurance of delivery on 1\/3\/14.  I was told bad weather, death, very busy time of year, lack of help....\nI was told the order was not placed until 1\/6\/14 on 1\/14\/14.  \nPlenty of opportunity was given for this company to fess up and simply state they were incapable of processing the order in a timely manner.  \nI was offered a refund.  Another irritating factor,   Foot Solutions processed the credit card immediately on 12\/30\/14.   Unfortunate they were not as speedy on delivery.
