I like this place, don't get me wrong. I just haven't been wowed to the extent that I have expected yet... \n\nEveryone proclaims this to be the best Thai in North America. I can't even safely state that it's the best thai in that particular strip mall... Hard to compete with Komol. The prices are a tad better and I enjoy the spice element a lot more at Komol. \n\nThey specialize in Northern Thai dishes, so it's a good idea to steer clear of the typical Thai dishes you might order and branch out. \n\nI plan on giving this place yet another try. I tend to think that I might have succombed to all the hype and therefore my expectations were raised to an exceedingly high level, but after several visits I can't safely say that is the case. \n\nI look forward to another test drive of this place. Any recommendations on what to order are welcomed! Haha.
