I do not get why this place gets good reviews.  Pizza tasted like the pizza slice I remember having at the public pool as a kid....sauce was over-spiced with oregano.  Crust tasted like it was pre-made.  Just horrible.\n\nI wish I could say the service made it better....it did not...the girls behind the register were bored and disinterested in answering any questions.  There are a dozen other decent\/good pizza places in the area are worthy.  Save the effort trying the \"new\/hot\" place.
