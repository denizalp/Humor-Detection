OMG I had no idea there was a summerlin location 5 minutes from my house!! One of the managers Jennifer had informed me that instead of me driving 30 min to southern highlands.... There was also another location BY MEEEE. My life is saved, everything is so good and the location and building is so cute! Our food came out in a timely manner and everything was cooked to perfection. I am not going any other breakfast place ever again.\n\nAlso, my server Chelsea is the bessttttt she was so happy and positive and made my whole experience!
