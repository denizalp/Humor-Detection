I have eaten..\n\nEVERY.\nSINGLE.\nBRUSCHETTA.\nFLAVOR.\n\nI plan to be buried with them. They are that good.\n\nWhen i'm rich and famous one day, I will dine on nothing but Postino's bruschetta until I balloon and can no longer fit through my door and need to escape through the bay window to satiate my bruschetta needs.\n\nThat tasty.
