Excellent customer service. Went in to see about recharging the air conditioning in my car. Amber was very knowledgeable and friendly. She came outside to help us with the recharge. She informed me about some other minor things I should keep an eye on. I've been driving the car for a few days and the air conditioning is doing great.
