My 300th reviews for my 2nd UYE event!\n\nThanks Bijan V for organizing this UYE. If not I would have never ever cross my mind to try out Persian food or even coming to Pomegranate Restaurant. And of course fellow yelpers that makes the evening enjoyable!\n\nThe Pomegranate Restaurant itself is small and cosy. I have to say the decoration is really exotic. I really like all those rich colours they used in everything. The blue ceiling, the colourful tables, the textiles used, the plates that decorated the walls! (good for interesting, colourful photos!!)\n\nIt was really nice to have enough people so we can share the dishes! As I always have lunch alone and ended up it will take me a couple of times before I can tried out all the different dishes in a restaurant, but with all these dinnermates, I got to have a taste of everything!\n\nSince I was not the one that ordering I don't really know which is which item in the menu. \n\nFor starter, there are 3 spreads with the bread. I really love the bread. It is freshly baked! I am eating the spreads because of the bread! \n\nThere is also this greeny moldy looking yogurt drink that has mint and rose petal water. It is salty tasting with an acquired taste. Some complains it tasted like toothpaste. However, I find it goes really well with the lamb dishes, it naturalized the \"lamb\" taste and the other strong herbal tastes in the meat dishes.\n\nFor 4 main entrees we shared, 2 of them are stews (chicken and lamb) and 2 of them are lamb shanks. They all comes with salad and rice. I do enjoy the taste of the stews, the favour is really complex... with all those spices and herbs. The lamb shanks though are really tender and juicy and cook to perfection.\n\nEven as a non lamb eater, to my surprise even I enjoyed the lamb dishes!\n\nFor desserts, we have the persian tea... which go well with the super sweet desserts! \n\nThe services is nice and friendly. Though we cannot stay longer to relax because our table is needed for another group of later dinners.\n\nThe day bed at the back of the restaurant seems like a really relaxing neat place to have some finger food and a drink or 2 with friends!\n\nI have to say that the Persian spices and herbs does need to be get used to! I was burping the whole night! :) or was it from the cabornated green drink that I drank almost half a pitcher?\n\nBURP! BURP! BURP!
