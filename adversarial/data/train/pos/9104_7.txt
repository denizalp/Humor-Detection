Yes, Sage is better than your average complex, but wanes in comparison to other \"luxury\" residences.\n\nThe leasing office looked great, and they have a wonderful gas stove that you cant use.  The pool to the back of the office looked refreshing, and indeed proved to be, when I jumped in.\n\nThe unit I was able to walk through was nice and clean, but for some reason, there was no ceiling fan in the 2nd bedroom.  From what I understand, you can furnish your own, or pay Sage $100 to install one of theirs, which I'll assume they keep after your lease has ended.\n\nThe biggest downside I noticed with the parking situation.  They DO NOT have many spots for guests, so if you plan on having many\/any friends over, you might need to get yourself a shuttle service.\n\nThe couple of times I've walked the property, there was a stale stench of cigarettes that hung in the air... and that's definitely something I dont look for when deciding where to live
