Everyone raves about this buffet, saying it's the best one in Vegas. I've been meaning to go for a few years now, but it's never been convenient until this last trip. When my friend said she wanted to have a lunch buffet before hitting the pool (a bad idea, in my opinion - ha), I immediately suggested Studio B! It was supposed to be epic. \n\nIt wasn't. \n\nThe buffet was small. Maybe this is because it was brunch? My prime rib was dry and unappetizing, and the crab selection was a joke. The pieces were small and rarely refilled. It was still crab, so I ate my fill regardless, but I was disappointed. The rest of the food was subpar, though the desserts were decent. \n\nWe did have two mimosas each, so that was nice, and the price was lower than most other buffets. Even still, I don't see myself driving back out again. I'd rather go to Bacchanal at Caesar's.
