Overpriced! And it looks nothing like the picture on their screen. My friends and I all ordered the lobster mac and cheese. It tasted pretty decent but the portion was small and we got sick of the Mac and cheese taste pretty quickly so we needed to go to chipotle afterwards to satisfy our appetite :(
