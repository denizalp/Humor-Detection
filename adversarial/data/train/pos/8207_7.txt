Located in Harrah's, it's literally an oyster bar in the casino. Not gonna lie, I was a bit skeptical but the meal did not disappoint!\n\nI got a dozen oysters for $30. Less than $3 a piece so it's not priced too badly. I wish the oysters were more plump though. I felt like the oysters I was given were the runts of the bunch. They were delicious but I do wish they were bigger.\n\nMy boyfriend got the seared scallop pasta. SO GOOD. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the pasta was in a really delicious sauce as well. The sauce itself also had little bay scallops in it. If you love scallops, this one is a must try!
