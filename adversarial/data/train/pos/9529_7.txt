Nice place for lunch.  Service was good.  After we finished our plate someone was by to take it so we could get a clean plate for our next round.  Many have describe the food that is available but you do have to walk the whole line to figure out what you want to try.  Lot of Asian and Sushi, Salad Bar, Soups.  Tried some of the Asian and found most to be hot and OK.  Tried a couple of types of chicken and shrimp and the chicken was not so good, a little on the tough side while most of the shrimp was good except the coconut that was overly breaded and covered with a overly sweet sauce.  The Sushi was good.  Many different kinds and not to bad but the spicy tuna needed a little more spice and tuna.  Did not get to the desert bar but many did and it looked pretty interesting.
