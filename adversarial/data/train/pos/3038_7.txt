Can't Wait to go back\n\nDecided to head out at the last minute with some friends to hit a happy hour.  After reading my Yelp reviews we made the decision to head towards Wink 24 and I'm so glad we did.  \n\nThe charcuterie board was  a great snack as was the  caprese crustini.  Our favorite dish, by far, was the Cuban Panino. We enjoyed happy hour last the food and drinks we ate amazing food and the service was excellent.  Can't wait to go back.
