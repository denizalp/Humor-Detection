First of all, am I alone in thinking it's extremely odd to walk into a  restaurant on a Thursday night at 5:30pm with a lighted \"Open\" sign in the window, to find the restaurant is completely empty and, after loudly saying \"hello\"  2 or 3 times, you find you have to call them on the phone in order for someone to come out from the back and discover that someone is inside the restaurant and would actually like to eat dinner there? Well......\n\nI should have just emptied the cash register and gone my happy way.\n\nBut no. We sat down and ordered.\n\nSo, am I also alone in thinking that when you order the Jicama-Cucumber Salad, maybe they shouldn't serve it to you if  \"the chef apologizes that we don't have any jicama today\". Just sayin'.  But seriously.  The waiter set the plate of shredded iceberg lettuce covered with slices of cucumber drizzled with dressing and said exactly that. \n\nThen, the main course arrived. I ordered the special enchiladas.....\n\n....Awe forget it.  I was going to describe just how horrible this meal and this experience was, but I can't bring myself to waste my time. \n\nWe were there until 7:00pm and nobody else ever came in the place. They must know what we didn't know yet. \n\nAll I have to say is:\nTake a pass on spending your money on  \"La Mestiza\".
