I tried to stop in last night but they close at 6p:(  But I made it there today:)  Cute little shop with homemade cupcakes.  Yes, I said homemade because they reminded me of my mother's cupcakes.  Remember growing up and coming home from school and having fresh baked cupcakes for a treat.  Exactly...  I tried the vanilla cupcake with the cotton candy frosting, I didn't even sit down and it was gone instantly.  YUM!  I cannot wait to try the vanilla\/vanilla-its sitting in the box calling my name.  I am trying to ignore it, I don't know how much longer I can wait.  The flavors vary daily.  I printed out the menu and circled the flavors I want to try.  I am looking forward to the salted caramel!  Oh, and the iced tea is fresh brewed.  Delish.  I can't wait to eat what is in my bakery box and go back for more flavors.  And it was so great to meet Rachel the owner, who actually runs the store herself.  Did I tell you this is my latest and greatest find???  So close to the house...  It's Ok, I might enjoy life a little more with a few cupcakes!
