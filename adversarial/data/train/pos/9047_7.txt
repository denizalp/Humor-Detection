Although I've had Sweet Republic ice cream and sorbet in other venues, today (Sweet Republic's 3rd birthday) was the first time I was able to have the ice cream in the store itself. It was nice to be able to sample different flavors - especially since a number of them are quite unique - before choosing the one I had today (salted caramel). Audrey W, who was also there today, told me to get jalapeno avocado but they ran out of that flavor; apparently it's very popular. All the flavors I tried were very good, and after watching my friend and fellow yelper Jacob P. win the toffee banofi sundae eating contest this afternoon (he finished a humongous serving in about 3 minutes), I know I'll need to try that flavor next time!
