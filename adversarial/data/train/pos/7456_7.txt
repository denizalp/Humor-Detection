While visiting i encountered this! A Male employee inside Womens bathroom hollering for the women working in there. She comes out they stand in front of womens bathroom entrance talking in Spanish blocking entrance! So rude. I would not want to b in the bathroom and hear a mans voice or at that being blocked. Then the man worker stands in the mans bathroom with another man worker ogling the women walking by and making comments.
