Moving here from DC, maybe I just expect too much as far as service, but I feel like my expectations in this case are standard. \n\nTheir food is delicious, there drinks are yummy, I have just been consistently disappointed by their service. Even if they are semi busy, the waitresses seem to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Though, the bartenders have their act together. \n\nI came here on Monday evening...around 6\/630. I ordered the Fajita wrap...I took two bites, and then noticed there was a small brown hair in my fries. My hair is long and black, so clearly it wasn't mine. When I told the waitress, she very professionally exclaimed \"shit!\" and came over. \n\nI told her, I lost my appetite and just asked for a new order to go. I waited until my friend finished her meal, and then asked for the check. My waitress plopped mine down in front of me. Seriously? I ate human hair at your venue...and you're going to charge me for that? You've officially made my shit list.
