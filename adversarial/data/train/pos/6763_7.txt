Strange, strange, strange.  We call for a reservation for 6:30 or 7.  We're told that they can only seat us at 5:30 or after 8.  We get there for 5:30 reservation and the place is empty.  Server was lovely.  Soup and salad course were fine.  Friend had crab cakes for dinner.  They were over cooked and under sauced.  I had free range chicken.  No special flavor.  Pretty ho hum.  Server was sweet and friendly the whole time...but there were many other staff members just walking the floor, clearly with nothing to do.  What about that evening rush???\n\nWe retired to the bar section to enjoy some live jazz (which was really good, I have to say), had a drink, and left.  When we got home, my friend had a voice mail message accusing us of ditching our bar tab.  1) We don't do that.  2)  We paid over $100 for dinner.  Why would we ditch on $25 bar tab? 3)  The bar server specifically looked at my cash and asked if I wanted change for a large bill.  She can't forget that moment.  4)  What restaurant calls a customer, basically to accuse them of leaving an open tab?\n\nThey offered us a complimentary dinner.  We will not take it.  But, that experience has definitely marked us for Remington's.  Never to be recommended to anybody.  Ever.  Sorry, Remington's.  Keep a better eye on your own staff, perhaps.
