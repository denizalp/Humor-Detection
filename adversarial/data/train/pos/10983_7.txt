My first-ever review for Mandarin, despite many visits over many years...\nCertainly the best of the canadian-chinese buffets in Toronto, offering an inconsistent range of dishes ranging from truly horrific sushi, to typical freezer-to-fryer fare like panko shrimp and deep fried scallops, to very good dishes including their spicy chicken, bbq ribs, batter-fried fish, deep fried wings, prime rib of beef, and crisp airy freshly made waffles.\n\nMy most recent visit left me very disappointed in the sad \"holiday special\" dry roast turkey with truly weird-sweet transparent cornstarch gravy as well as the hot crab legs which were puny, overcooked dry, and grey-fleshed.  The cold crab, also much smaller legs than ever before, was acceptable in favour, yet still not up to par compared to recent years.\n\nOverall, there were plenty of solid dishes to enjoy, great service, and I got my money's worth, but do something about the sushi, crab legs and turkey or Mr. Owner, contact me and I'll teach you how to roast a turkey and make proper turkey gravy. ;-)
