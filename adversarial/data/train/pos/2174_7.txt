I've been here about 3 or 4 times, and will def go back again. I really wish they could up their service a  notch.It is the only that drags it down to a 3-4 star experience. It really bothers me when the servers come with an attitude. Just tone it down a bit, be a bit more friendly and seriously it would be good for business. Heck I might even tip more.  =) \n\nI cant complain about the food, every time we have been here the food has been delightful. Just the kind that makes you want to really go back again and again and again. \n\nAlso the bar tender doesnt know to not drown your single malt with ice, so make sure you specify !
