I was looking for a place as close to my house that could give me a pedicure as I was in a hurry. The reviews and proximity helped me make my choice. I called and they were able to get me right in. I arrived and they quickly got to work.\nThey immediately offered me water and brought me a small bottle, but after my feet were soaking for a bit she asked if I had been here before. I said no, so she informed me that they have wine. It was Friday and after a stressful work week I couldn't say no. The red wine was a little sweet, but you'll never hear me complain if I'm being offered red wine. Also I realized later that the wine is complimentary... A deal you can't beat! The pedicure was great... It's been a few days and my toes are still very happy... I'll definitely be back!
