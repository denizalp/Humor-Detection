AMBIANCE: 4 - Novecento is a pizza sit-down\/take-out with a gluten-free option! Though I wouldn't recommend the gluten-free option (my preference, not allergy) because it wasn't particularly tasty and they totally weren't that prepared to make it for me! The restaurant is a pretty good sized place with quite a few seats. I would say if you're visiting at midday\/nighttime, it has sort of romantic lighting inside hah! \n\nSERVICE: 4 - A unique take on food ordering, basically you assemble your pizza and take a number to your table. Sort of like how you order at Greens&Proteins. The employees were very nice and respectful, they were willing to explain their take on pizza and what it was.\n\nFOOD: 4 - Their pizza was wood-fired and a bit expensive for the size. Things definitely kept falling off my pizza and it was hard to eat; but that doesn't mean the pizza wasn't good! It was really tasty!! I'm not sure if I'm okay with things falling off my pizza though, that was really..not fun. On the bright side, they use completely fresh ingredients and start from scratch; you can see them flattening your pizza dough in front of you! \n\nAgain, not a fan of the gluten-free dough, seeing as it was really burnt when it was given to me--I don't know how the other dough is like because that was my first time! The soda was unlimited and located on the far inner part of the restaurant. \n\nAlso, we took advantage of the check-in offer, which I recommend! The cannoli was delicious! A tonnn of chocolate chips, but delicious nonetheless!!! The other choice for the check-in offer is the cappuccino! \n\nA little heads up; It's a bit pricey for what it is (mine was $12 for a 10 inch), so if you're a big eater, come prepared to spend a bit! The taste of their pizza redeemed them for a star, I wasn't expecting it to be good when it was sliding out of my hands. I really hope that next time, my topping stick to my dough!
