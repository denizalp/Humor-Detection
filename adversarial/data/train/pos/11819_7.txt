With 4 other yelpers, I attended last night this high temple of meat. \n\nOn entering the sanctuary my wife and I were greeted by the other sacrificial lambs. On the wall hung black tablets outlining what torture we could be subjected to. Our 5 person altar was soon approached by a priestess who outlined the measure of the pain we were about to endure. She, however, gave us choices as to the types of gastronomic purgatories we could enter. We played our role and responded by ordering sweet, sweet tantalizing tortures from the menu.\n\nThe large charcuterie board (or was it a rack?) was a symphony of sinfully displayed meats. They were arranged in order from milder to strongest. All the charcuteries were home made with the exception of the chorizo. They were all delectable especially the mousse, and the pate (which was a lot like a good rillettes de caen). An offering of fresh bread flanked the viands.\n\nWe followed this up by torture disguised as oven- roasted marrow filled bones. These were decadently delectable and oh so good.\n\nWe were almost speechless at the goodness, but thankfully next came Tongue en brioche. It almost looked like a pastry. It was tender, tasty, moist, and totally awesome.\n\nAnd what would be gastronomical torture without a horse? Ask Sancho Panza (he used a mule?). The Horse Tartare finally loosened the lips of one of the diners to say \"this is the best sandwich I ever had\". I concurred and thus we had achieved full penance, after that confession.\n\nA couple of other diners proceeded to the bread pudding, and I was told it was awesome. At long last the high priest presented us with the reckoning: a reasonably priced meal. We had expiated our hunger, and achieved sweet penance. \n\nAll you sinners out there, get thee to the Black Hoof. Salvation awaits!\n\nIts not a five star but its certainly 4.5!
