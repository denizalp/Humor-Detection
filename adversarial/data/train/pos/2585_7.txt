\"How come ya ain't got no brothas up on the wall\"--Buggin' Out\n\nInsert a name that ends in a vowel.  Insert a \"family history\" story on packaging and\/or website.  Insert some dude in a track suit and pinky ring sitting in the corner.  Insert bottles of stagnant olive oil in decorative bottles on shelves and you have basically every Italian place on Clevelands East Side.  To me, they are all the same.  Good, but nothing too exotic.  From what I remember they eat a lot more seafood in Italy.  Here its pasta, bread, red sauce, covered in cheese.  Mix and match how you wish. Here we have gotten pizza, subs and salads.  All have been fresh and OK.  Pizza has been better in past times than this time.  Girls working the counter are always super nice and friendly.  They serve beer too which is cool.  I think they serve wine but I cant drink wine without feeling like a putz.  They also serve Peroni...which is the Italian version of cat piss.  \n\nBacco, tabacco e Venere riducono l'uomo in cenere!
