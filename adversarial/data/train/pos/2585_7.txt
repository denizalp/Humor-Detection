Love this place, \nSince I moved the the valley about six years ago. I have become a frequent visitor to this cell lot. There is always enough room, you can actually see the update board from any location in the lot. There are bathrooms, even though it's an outhouse. It's better then nothing. They also have the airlines \"800\" numbers posted for your convenience. Just come in, find a parking spot, recline your seat, turn up the radio and take a nap!
