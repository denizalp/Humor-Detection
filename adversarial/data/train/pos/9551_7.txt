Another restaurant of the LGO family that I love....\n\nI'll start with it was Cinco de Mayo and my husband just wanted some good nachos. So... off to yelp app on my iPhone and Chelsea's was one of the restaurants close by. It was settled, done deal... that's where we're going! \n\nWe love Chelsea's. Great atmosphere, great service, great food, love the Howie burger, and awesome drinks. \n\nBut.... tonight it was all about the nachos and the margaritas!\n\nOn the menu the nachos are called \"Nachitos\"... and trust me, there's nothing \"-itos\" about them. They are absolutely HUGE!! So good... I swear there's a whole juicy rotisserie chicken on there. And the guac... yumm!\n\n5 stars because I really like this restaurant. The patio is great if you can score a seat there. \n\nBut 10 stars for the manager holding on to my iPad that I forgot last night in the booth. ( Think 3 strong margaritas............... ) That is SO awesome...Honest mgmt -- THANK YOU!!!
