If you are in Phoenix Metro come to the stand, treat this place like a Michelin rated restaurant - if you are within driving distance... COME!\n\nThey have one burger, The Standard. I always add cheese and bacon to mine and used to add guac back when this location still served tacos. The fries are a must, with stand sauce and you gotta wash it down with a shake. My favorite is the Banana Stand.\n\nBe aware, if you go HAM like I do you're gonna be dropping 13-17 dollars but it's worth it in my opinion.\n\nThis is hands down the best burger you could get from a drive-thru, ANYWHERE. I would put their burger up against any burger place, with a drive-thru, in this country.
