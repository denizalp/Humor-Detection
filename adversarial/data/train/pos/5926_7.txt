Food was subpar. Meant to give it zero stars but that's not an option.\n\nWe went on New Years Eve at 9:43 p.m. Our waitress, Amanda, blonde girl, was the rudest waitress we've ever encountered. My friend asked about the pita dip but decided to get the potato skins instead. Amanda didn't repeat nor write down our order but we thought she knew what she was doing - but apparently not. \n\nOur food arrived and the pita arrived. We told the guy who delivered it that we didn't order the pita. \n\nNext thing we knew, Amanda came and said \"Uh, you ordered the pita dip. I know it, otherwise I wouldn't have written it down. I know you did or I would have suggested you get two orders of potato skins as you can't just use half of a potato...\" \n\nFirst of all, that makes absolutely no sense. She was being incredibly aggressive so suddenly as we were having pleasant exchanges prior to that attack she did on my friend. My friend explained to her what happened and Amanda kept saying, \"No, I know what you said. You're wrong. You ordered a pita.\"  \n\nIt was loud and Amanda probably didn't hear my friend say, \"It's ok, I'll get the potato skins instead.\"  That is NOT how to speak to anyone. We were baffled. She was the most aggressive, rudest, most repulsive waitress ever. We had such a terrible experience that it's totally turned us off this mediocre place. Totally overrated. We didn't complain to the manager because it was NYE but she was the WORST.
