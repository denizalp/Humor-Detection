Typical Chevron Gas Station. \n\nGotta love the super cheap gas prices in vegas...im talking like SUPER DUPER CHEAP GAS PRICES. \n\nIts a tradition for me to fill at this station because I refuse to fill my car up with those random\/unheard named gas stations\/companies.\n\nMy first stop in vegas is Lees Liqours....this is my 2nd.\n\nUNTIL THEN!! ^-^
