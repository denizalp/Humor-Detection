I have been here 4 times and every wait exceeded an hour. On my arrival of this visit I was informed they don't allow any beverages in the waiting room. I threw my Starbucks away and sat for an hour! \n\nThe only reason I continue to come here is for Dr. Roberts.  5\/5. I think she is a great Doctor but wish she worked at a different facility. \n\nIf you enjoy wasting your time, reading magazines, and sitting around then this is your place!!! Bring a phone charger!!\n\nI had the worst blood draw of my life here. She dragged the needle against my arm when she pulled it out--resulting in a 2 inch scratch. Lovely!
