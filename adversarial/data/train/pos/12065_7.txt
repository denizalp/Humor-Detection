Had a car accident at the end of the year . Called Adam S Kutner because I was in so much pain . Got me in to see a dr on New Year's Eve. Couldn't really find a office open do to the holiday some how made it happened for me . 5 months later feeling so much better and closedown my case . Really good experience with all his staff.
