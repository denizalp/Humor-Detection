I'm going to be pretty generous with this bar because of one thing...it's not their pretty decent customer service (Ask for Cassie as a bartender, she's kick ass), it's not the food (aka I've never eaten here...unless of course if you consider beer a food group, but thats a whole nother topic), it's not the great wide variety of people, ethnicities, and ages you'll mingle with, it's not the funny wheel that you spin when your wasted...It's the wait for it...Fudgesicles that they serve FOR FREE in the little ice cream freezer behind the main bar near the kitchen entrance! Seriously Junky, GREAT idea. I luv fudgesicles, so when I'm tossing back a few with my friends I love to sneak away and go grab some ice cream. Alright, there it is! The secrets out...your welcome Scottsdale ;)
