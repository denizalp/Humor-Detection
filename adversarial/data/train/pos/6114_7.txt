This place is awesome!!! I had no clue it was even here except for the ad I just saw on yelp for their anniversary Glitter Bomb party! What a great time! They had bands, food and about 19 beers to either sample or have a whole glass. What more can a woman ask for???\n\nMy goal was to sample all of the beer. Came close but no cigar. I won't get in detail but there were some definite highlights. First let's start with the Glitter Bomb. Now it was advertised as a sour table beer and that it was. I like to think of it more like a palate cleanser. But more notable is that it was glittery for sure. My friend even made the comment that it looked like shampoo because of it's iridescence. Also loved the Belgian Quadrupel and the Belgard tweaked with coffee.\n\nAs far as food... They had a taco truck (food looked amazing but the line was too long for my patience) and a Rick Moonen table that had amazing chicken pot pie bites and tater tots with tartar sauce. Yummers! Would I like to have seen more food? Of course! But this was a beer celebration and not a food festival so get over it already! \n\nNow that I know this is here, I am super stoked to go back and learn more about their beer when it isn't so busy. Also learned there is another brewery and a distillery nearby as well. So happy our amazing city is broadening it's horizons!
