My first impression of this place was clean but it turned to the worst. I don't know if this guy was racist to Asians but when I came in at 10:30 this morning asking for a couple magazines.  I got the WORST customer service I've ever received from a guy named \"mark\". he came off rude and very \"snappy\". DON'T come here. I recommend not buying anything from here if your Asian.
