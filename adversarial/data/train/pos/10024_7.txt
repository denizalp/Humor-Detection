Great spot for breakfast at a very reasonable $18.99\/adult. Creating my own omelette was my best choice. Filled it with many ingredients. Looked like a feast to feed a whole family. But hey, I was very hungry and I did eat it all. \n\nThere's a wide variety of food to choose from too. From salads, fish, sausages, pastas, meats, etc etc\n\nThe service is great too. From the people up front to the food preparers to the bus boys. Everyone has a great attitude and that makes for a great experience!
