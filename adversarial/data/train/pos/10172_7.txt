I know this is a REALLY girly place for a guy to review, but aside from me wanting to buy everything that's not painted white, pink or pastel -- I heart this place. \n\nIn addition to the housewares and vintage finds, they have a ginormous crafting\/scrapbooking section.  I buy paper and supplies here from time to time for my craft projects.  I could probably get the same things at Michael's or Jo-Ann, but I'd prefer to support indie business - -especially when it's right in my hood!
