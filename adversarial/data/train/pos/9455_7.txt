So, promptly at 8am, Zach and 2 guys showed up as scheduled to move my s#it.\nThey didn't send me some mamby pamby powder puff types. These guys were built like they came fresh from the prison yard gym and I was all \"He!! yes\". \nI mean, they weren't felons or anything. They were quite nice. But they would probably hold their own in a medium security penitentiary. (I'm just saying.)\nBack to business...\nThese guys were efficient, quick, and lifted stuff that made me feel pity for their future spines. In other words, they busted tail.\nWithin 2 hours, these guys had taken a 3 bedroom, 2nd floor apartment, condensed it into a truck (which makes you realize your stuff is just crap) and unloaded it into my new home.\nThey could have drawn it out, milked my money and I would've paid, but would also have noted that here. But they didn't. They worked hard and most importantly, had integrity. Which is why I don't think they had been in a prison yard gym. I should stop talking about prison. \nAnyway....\nThis company hires well and I will recommend them to anyone who needs movers.\nOne last thing: TIP YOUR MOVERS. They work hard moving your dusty, dirty crap you call possessions and try not to break anything even though it's mostly worthless to anyone but you.\nI tipped 25% between 3 guys and they seemed happy about it, so I recommend at least that. \nNice guys.\nThanks!
