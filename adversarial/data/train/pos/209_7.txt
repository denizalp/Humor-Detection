After having a negative experience with one of the managers here, the owners reached out to us personally.. Al and Kathy I believe... and not only did they rectify the situation, they went above and beyond for us. Al talked to my boyfriend on the phone and profusely apologized and was just extremely genuine. They also gave us a giftcard for more than we paid for our meal. We will absolutely be back. It is very refreshing to have owners who care and really want to make things right. We totally understand things happen and when those people take ownership and make it right, it goes a very long way!! Thank you Al and Kathy!!
