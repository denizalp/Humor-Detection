We went on a Friday night to start our night.\n\nWe were carded twice and they wanted to hold a credit card through our dinner!  The waitress said that was restaurant policy.  I am in my mid-30s and am way past the \"dine and dash age\".\n\nThe menu has changed dramatically since the last time we were hear.  The food selection is basically wings, burgers and pizza.  \n\nVery disappointed to be treated like a punk kid and will not be back to this establishment.  \n\nI'd suggest heading across the parking lot to Flying Saucer.
