One star all around, but I'm bumping it up to two because if you're a Total Rewards member and are a local, it's $11 to eat lunch here. But oh my god, I paid $11 to eat this crap? The shame.....\n\nFirst off, there's no bar service until 2:30pm on weekdays. What, the Rio doesn't like money? You're telling me I have to choke down these low-quality ingredients SOBER? Needless to say, I was furious. \n\nNothing stood out as good to me except the gelato, which is pretty hard to screw up. Everything else was old, gross, preservative filled or not food. It's like Golden Corral (a restaurant that we in my family affectionally refer to as \"The Pig Trough\") but in a casino. \n\nI went a few years back for dinner. Nothing else stands out except that we waited two hours for a table (it was the day after Christmas, I suppose) and that the food was plentiful if not edible. \n\nSave your pennies and go elsewhere.
