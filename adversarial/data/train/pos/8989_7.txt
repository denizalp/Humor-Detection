The best way to maximize your buck while maximizing your food in both variety and portions is to dine at the casino buffet.  Buffet La Bonne Carte is pretty darn \"bon\" with a good variety of eclectic dishes that can be served a la carte or self-served at the buffet line.  In my opinion, it's the best place in the casino to get a good heaping of everything without sacrificing quality for reasonable prices.\n\nFor the budget conscious, coming here is practically a must.  The list of casino establishments are all too much at times - L'Entre Mise Deli is overpriced, simple food, Nuances is overpriced, gourmet food, and Via Fortuna doesn't do Italian any better than Olive Garden would in the states.  The Buffet's menu will change daily and the food is lavishly good during dinner and during my favorite time, brunch.\n\nA majority of the menu will be French and American inspired cuisine, and at a fixed price of $15.95 (lunch), $25.95 (dinner from Mon-Thurs) , $34.95 (dinner - Fri\/Sat) and finally $19.95 (brunch).  My favorite time is brunch since the breakfast food is scrumptious with good presentation and generally available in all kinds of varieties.  Plus, if the party is here long enough, it'll transition into dinner time where the food is smashingly amazing.\n\nPlenty of locals will frequent this place and the lines will be past the elevators for the dinner showing on the weekends.  A gripe I would have is the customer service is nearly non-existent (since everything is self serve) and they serve no breakfast (opens at 11AM).\n\nThat's what the casino gets for not having a hotel.  Either way, I'm so down with this place for Brunch and Saturday night dinner.  It's a great alternative to the small restaurants back in the city.
