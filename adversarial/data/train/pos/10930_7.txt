Stayed in a Pyramid deluxe king room on lower floor... It was BASIC, no frills, no wireless internet service (although we were told that connection could be made in the tower rooms & center of pyramid). The shower tiles were dated & carpets seemed a bit worn. There seemed to have been a flood in the bathroom as the door was warped and \"crunched\" at its base. On the bright side, the air freshener dissipated the outside cigarette smoke & any other odors.  The bed was comfortable and we awoke feeling refreshed to a new day\/night of gambling or gourmet dining.\n\nThis was our first time staying at the Luxor, although we've been to LV many times & stayed on the Strip. Luxor seemed less \"crazy\" than the other larger resorts, even with its Egyptian theme. Most of the crowd seemed like they prefer the new City Center and further north. We liked its location because it was central to Mandalay Bay & New York New York.
