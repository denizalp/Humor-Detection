The Orchid Cafe is located inside the Double Tree hotel, there is coupon in the entertainment book for this place as well as two other restaurants in the hotel.  I usually go to Alfredo's which has excellent steak but have not tried this place or the other restaurant which is a Japanese place...\n\nAlfredo's was closed on a Saturday night...\nSo... We decided to try this place a try since we had a coupon and was already there.\n\nThe places looks like a joke, you are basically sitting in the walkway of the hotel. There really isn't a proper setup to eat either. Tiny tables with couches and some chairs. How am I supposed to eat my dinner on a couch with a table that is much lower then where I am sitting?\n\nAfter being ignored for 15 minutes and having 10 waiters standing around in front of us finally someone came over. We asked about the steak assuming it is the same kitchen as Alfredo's and the waiter responded \"IS STEAK, TASTE LIKE BEEF\". \n\nAfter that we decided to leave, this just is not a place to come for dinner, maybe for some drinks if you are staying at the hotel but do not come here out of your way!\n\nI'll stick with Alfredo's!
