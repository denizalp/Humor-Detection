what you'll find here in it's massive spacious airy warehouse is vast selection of well made fairly priced furniture.\n\nhhhmmmm, but they aren't perfect. you can expect a couple of phone calls to sort out delivery and you may need to follow up as well. but in the end they are very nice, helpful and have an honest approach. \n\nif you have any issues, they will take care of it immediately, with a get it done right attitude. it's almost and old world charm you don't see at most shops.\n\nsome how this attitude makes up for some of the other hiccups! we are super happy with our sofa.
