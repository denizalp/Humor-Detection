Reading your reviews, I expected a smelly, run-down dive that was all sorts of crazy. I saw nothing of the sort. It looked pretty clean for a dive, had some awesome seating, and a decent tap selection. It's such a small bar, but they do a great job of utilizing that space. The crowd is pretty cool, too. If only it weren't so inaccessible, right in the middle of an ugly part of town, with very little parking. I won't count the horrors of CenPho against it.\n\nChug some PBR and wait for all the hipsters to migrate from Trunk Space.
