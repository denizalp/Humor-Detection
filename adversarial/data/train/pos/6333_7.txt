With the rate I got from www.hotels.com it was definitely worth it.  Like many have said, it is farrrrr from the hot spot of the strip, but it is do-able.  Especially if you road tripping it is definitely worth it.  Modern decor with a family touch.  I found it really great that they had a entertainment room ( which was free) where they had a pool table, television, ping pong table and even dvd's that you can check out ( free of charge).  Yes we are in vegas sooo why would you do these things... its to relax!!  Especially if its thunderstorming full of heat in the dearest LV lunch hours are probably best stayed in the hotel.  I didnt have enough time to go to the pool or bbq. \n\nThe only downfall for this hotel is:\n\n- Further down the strip\n- The walk to the parking ( in the heat) was a drag.... but do able it was not 500 yards as some people had claimed it to me.\n-  All rooms do not have ventilation not even the restroom..... :\/ which made it hard to breath at times.
