Kamakura wouldn't be a great Japanese restaurant back home, but it's pretty good for Champaign, and my heart lept to see Katsu, Udon, Soba, and so many other thigns that remind me of home.  Te setting is a bit too 'Orientalist,' and the food average, but I'm definitely coming back, because an approximation of the food I'm used to eating in California is better than none at all.
