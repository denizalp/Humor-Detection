Yet another restaurant following the tried and true formula for urban eateries--(1) pick a concept; (2) find a single syllable word that is an example of your concept (I think the proper name for this literary device is synecdoche); (3) open in Central Phx (preferably between the 7s); and (4) charge way too much money for whatever you are serving.\n\nThe concept here is fine, I guess.  I like toast as much as the next person.  But to feed my wife and me cost me about $30.  For toast and coffee.  I guess my sad little piece of toast had an even more sad and little piece of smoked salmon on it.  I also bought a pretzel to take to the Dbacks game later that afternoon.  I never imagined a pretzel could actually be worse than the bland styrofoam thing they call a pretzel at Chase Field.\n\nAnyway, no thanks.  Hopefully the downtown allegiance of hipsters can tame their collective hard-on, find a new place, and Toast can become something worth eating.  \n\nI have no problem being price-raped by a local indie eatery, but they best come with their A game, or at the very least, a reach-around.
