We decided to try this new concept while waiting for our son to finish soccer practice. Upon arriving our server greeted us at the door holding the door open and told us about the popular items. This was our first time here being referred from a fellow Yelper. From there our experience fell down the toilet. We arrived and the place was completely empty. We should have noticed and now understand why. We noticed after our server took our order the cooks and manager were having a conversation with a young woman no customer talking about what extract words \"What s#$& are we doing this weekend\" Our server had to call twice \"order up\" before walking the ticket over to the cooks.  The food came out and was fresh and hot. Food and Ambience reminded us of Steak N Shake missing the positive professional vibe. While we were eating we noticed that the cook and manager left. We had finished our food and while waiting for our check two other customers came in. Our server left to go outside the backdrop (herd the door chime) to call the cooks and ran back in to start cooking the food, drop the fires, and make the shakes.  He first finished preparing the food and two to go orders and while ringing up last order the last customer to receive their order commented this happened the last time no one was here helping you, while the kids played in the back.  We finally were  tired of waiting 15 minutes after finishing and took the check to the counter to prevent him from doing any further running around. Needless to say we will not be back but it is concerning that staff running a good concept can ruin an image in a matter of 30 minutes. Note to owner you are going to have an open kitchen be sure the staff knows we can see and hear everything. Hire kids that have passion and care. Disappointed as I was a strong advocate for paying fast food employees more.
