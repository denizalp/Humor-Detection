I'm sad.\n\nOkay, so our friends got married tonight, and we were starving! (9m wedding). The wait for little Italy was almost an hour. So, we decided to come here.\n\nOrdered drinks...Which were amazing. I had a small margarita, and the bride had a large frozen one......which is about  the size of my blender.\n\nNo, seriously. It looked like a \"big gulp\" cup. She didn't even finish it when we were done with our meal.\n\nOur food took forever. And it wasn't even that busy. We were seated in less than 3 minutes, and got chips and salsa.\n\nI don't know what it is with green salsa and I lately. But yuuuumm. \n\nI ordered the slow roasted pork with caramelized pineapple.\n\nWhen our food came, there was just one piece, YES, ONE piece of pineapple that was so delicious. But it was smaller than my pinky finger. I've had better pork from robertos, or Baja fresh. Pretty sad when this taco plate was $16-$17. I devoured it, no doubt, but it was 10 o'clock and I needed dinner.\n\nDrinks are great. But, :(
