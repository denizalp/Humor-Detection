This is a favorite of ours when we don't want to spend a lot of money but still go out and have a nice time.  The employees at Floridino's are so friendly and welcoming, you'll feel part of the family immediately.  Just as an example of how affordable this place is, the last time we were there we had a half order (6) original pizza muffins, 2 bottles of Stella cider, 1 Sun Spot draft, and one 12\" pizza with sausage and mushrooms.  Total before tax and tip was $23.25.  Can't beat it.  I can see why they've been around as long as they have, and get as busy as they do.  Good food & drinks and always great service.
