Four new parents and two babies (one very fresh, one looking quite the giantess next to the very fresh one) sat around in the east end trying to figure out what to have for dinner. The newest mom wanted pizza, so pizza it was! The newest dad wanted to try weird, unheard of pizza, so weird, unheard of pizza we had! \n\nThe thing is, though, this prairie-style (whatever that is), thick crust 'za is actually quite good... and not weird at all. It is more of a flat bread covered in goodness than a pizza, in my opinon, but it was still great. Heaps of cheese? Check. Hot and fresh? Check check. My only issue is that we wanted some sides, like wings which are on their menu, and they were out. Who runs out of one of their few menu items? A bit cheeky, but I still like Pizza Thick.
