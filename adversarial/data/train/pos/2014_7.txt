The food was good - easily worth 3.5 stars.  But the service?  Ay-ay-ay!\n\nWe went here last Sunday to celebrate an occasion - so there were about 20 of us.  We were promptly seated in the reserved area in the back, and given a prix fixe menu. The waitress sat down at the head of our table and announced how tired she was.  Then the train jumped the tracks.  \n\nWhen it was my turn to order a drink, the waitress seemed nonplussed that I'd asked what beers they had on hand, and promised to get back to me.  It took a while, and then she could remember only three of them.  \n\nBy the time we got to order our food, everyone else's drinks had arrived... but mine.  (I just wasn't ready to capitulate and have sweet tea or water like everyone else!)\n\nAbout 20 minutes after ordering, the food started to arrive (still no beer).  ...and that's when the manager came out to say they'd run out of what was on the prix fixe menu, and would we mind ordering something else?  (Mind you, they knew we were coming FOUR days ahead of time, and THEY were the ones that came up with the menu.  HOW could they run out?!?)\n\nWhen I went to place my alternate order, I told the waitress that I wanted my beer FIRST, and then my food.  (Silly me... it took another 10 minutes to get the beer, and 20 after that to get the food!)  Seriously, there were folks in our group that had finished dessert before others got their entrees.\n\nOkay - now that I got that out of my system, let me say that the Jambalaya was very respectable, and the apple cobbler was terrific!  I just couldn't believe the waitress waited until she'd served dessert to ask if anyone wanted her to put on a pot of coffee.  (Sigh...)
