RIP OFF. SCAM. CR*P! I paid $300 for what was promised to be an absolute top to bottom detail. Here's what I got: a glorified car wash. There was still dirt in the corners, the armor-all stuff was sprayed on the instrument panel, there was debris around the edges of the side-view-mirrors, and nothing bore the evidence a genuine detail. I even told the owner how much sentimentality I had toward this car, that I was expecting it to *shine*. The jackass barely looked at me again once he got my money. \n\nDON'T BE A SUCKER. DON'T FALL FOR THE LIES. I'm kicking myself for not researching better and being more careful with the businesses with whom I entrust my money. NEVER AGAIN! I will trust no one. Learn from my experience and DO NOT GIVE THIS GUY ONE RED CENT!!!!!
