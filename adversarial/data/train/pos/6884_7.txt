Sometimes you eat at the three star restaurant and other times the three star place eats you. \n\nI like to try restaurants with a 3 star or 3 1\/2 star average. It does two things, reminds me of why I eat at four and five star spots and that sometimes the masses are wrong. In this case, the masses were right.\n \nStopped at Yummy Sushi out of convenience. The first sign of inferior food should be the name, \"Yummy\". I went in and fully intended to try sushi, but instead ordered the spicy ramen with added pork for an extra $2. I also ordered the steamed beef dumplings. \n\nThe Ramen broth was actually very good. A nice amount of spice and a decent depth of flavor. A few off putting things, chopped red bell peppers (I have never seen this type of pepper used in an Asian styled soup before), and the ramen noodles tasted like they were from a $.25 dorm room favorite. Beyond that, the pork was tender and the other veggies in the ramen were decent. Nothing to recommend so far.\n\nThe steamed dumplings were a little chewy and flavorless, but when drowned in the provided sauce, they were meh.\n\nHIGHLIGHT: The service was crazy fast and super attentive. If it wasn't for this, you would be reading a two star review right now. If I could, I would give a two and a half stars, but I'm nice and always round up.
