What an awesome way to going to the movie and not know what it is until you get there.  After all there are a lot of movies that were made in Arizona.  \n\nWhen we got there we had Short leash for dinner and a glass of wine or beer. Then we all went into the movie theater to watch the secret movie and the movie was Wayne's World.  I have not seen this movie in years.  It was fun watching Wayne's World again.  \n\nThank you Lindsay and Film bar for an awesome evening at the movies.
