I came here yesterday to find some gift boxes and you can't go wrong with Dollorama. Some items are $2 but the majority of goods here are a buck. Here are things I think you should buy at a Dollorama versus other stores because the products are the same and you are saving money:\n\nWrapping paper (especially during the holiday seasons, you can get the big rolls for a buck)\nGift accessories (gift bags, bows, ribbons, wrapping paper...why buy wrapping paper for $5.99 at a Hallmark for example, when the same product is a buck?)\nBirthday related things\nArts and Crafts (boxes, crayons, etc...)\n\nThis location is small, so the aisles can be a bit tricky to move through when there are lots of people, but you can find everything from household goods (I saw some cute plate mats once) to gardening items to personal products. Once, when I was looking to buy a small Colgate toothpaste for travelling, I glanced over to see Pregnancy Test kits for $1...I'm not sure how accurate they would be, but you can only imagine the mark up other retailers put if in reality costs are actually that low. My point is that for certain goods, you can't go wrong at Dollorama. For example, I never buy my cards for $3.99 or more at Hallmark anymore because I can get the same product for $1.\n\nThis location is in the Yonge and Sheppard centre and although it doesn't accept credit card, they do Interac (but I believe you have to buy a certain amount of goods) and of course, cash. Come and check it out!
