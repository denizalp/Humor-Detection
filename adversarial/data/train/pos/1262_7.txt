Where can you find the largest museum to an single American artist? Well if you believe the brochure, it's Pittsburgh. The Andy Warhol Museum lives up to its name and while it may be a huge task displaying both the breadth and depth of Warhol's career they do a decent job of at least introducing most of his mediums. I loved the wall paper section, appreciated they showed some current Warholian inspired artists, liked the introductory display on the first floor, thought $15 admission was the steep side of reasonable, overall liked the musueum but am still not in love with Warhol. Which would be weird since he's a)dead and b) not my type, sorry andy.
