Went to Hakkasan during opening weekend on 4\/20 and everyone was either stoned or they've figured out a way to atomize happy vitamins and management was having Molly air pumped through the venue. \n\nDespite the fact that HS' design isn't very innovative and one of the main hallways reeked of incense (good looking out on 4\/20 I guess), my first night at Hakksan was an excellent one because everyone from the staff to the patrons was unbelievably nice, to the point where it started getting creepy. Within ten minutes of getting past the horrendous line outside (one of the few downsides), the following happened:\n\n1) Every bartender at one of the bars on the EDM floor proactively introduced themselves to me (which, by the way, was only possible because they didn't pack the place to the point where it felt like I was on a train car full of refugees seeking political asylum like they do at a certain club whose name rhymes with the word 'Narquee').\n\n2) A bouncer decided to give my friends and me a mini-tour of the main entranceway and provided a detailed verbal layout of the place for us to follow.\n\n3) A random patron decided to buy my group a round of drinks just because (and I didn't wake up the next morning in the desert sans pants).\n\n4) Some big Mexican dude who resembled UFC heavyweight champ Cain Velasquez kept checking in on me to make sure I was having a good time and had enough space as I aggressively elbowed him in the back of the head every third fist pump or so (and it didn't seem like he was being sarcastic).\n\nAll in all a strangely great experience. I somehow doubt they'll be able to keep this up for very many weeks but hey, enjoy it while you can.
