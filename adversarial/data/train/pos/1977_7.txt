My friend runs a room here at the Hot Box, and invited me to perform a spot here.  Not one to ever turn down an opportunity to perform, I figured this'd be a great place to try out some new material.  I knew that this was a place that let you light up and enjoy the smoke of the weed, so this'd be the first opportunity that I had to see what doing comedy in front of the stoned would be like.\n\nThe Hot Box Café is found in the back of the pot-paraphernalia shop Roach-O-Rama (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/roach-o-rama-toronto), and has booths that run the length of the café.  The décor is, well, pretty much what you'd expect from a place that lets you smoke weed.  Pretty eclectic, but yet fairly understated all things considered.  The back patio is enclosed and quiet, making it a pretty nice place to sit back and roll up.  The menu at the café is, surprise surprise, snack-based.  Some sandwiches are available, but they cater more to the munchies crowd than offering a full-blown meal.  Not necessarily that big of a deal for me, but if you're so inclined, go to the hot box and have a seat and a snack...preferably around 4:20.
