All of the positive reviews below, to this point, are based on either coming to hang out and drink\/eat or taking a tour, but not from the standpoint of being an actual overnight guest.\n\nAs a place to grab a drink\/coffee, socialize, network and have a bite, this is a great spot.  If we still lived in Pittsburgh, we would definitely be visiting from that standpoint.\n\nI preface all of this with 'I get it'...Ace is trying to be the hip\/cool\/party hotel....I get it.  Walking in, the first impression is that everyone working at the Ace looks right out of a Portlandia sketch...as though it is an exaggerated version of what they think people at the Portland Ace look like (it isn't...been there multiple times).  \n\nWe stayed for 5 nights from 12\/27 - 1\/1.  The rooms themselves are really cool, well-appointed and fabulous-looking when you walk in...especially, if you haven't seen\/been to an Ace-like hotel before.   Design is definitely favored over practicality.  We did not spend a ton of time in the room and while it is great for a one\/two night stay, I would not go back for a longer stay as it just is not comfortable from a long-term visit point of view.  \n\nOur two biggest issues with our stay:\n1)  The doorstops on every door in hotel (or at least on all of floor 5), which regulate how fast\/slow the door closes, are so loose that each time someone enters\/exits a room, a thunderous boom resonates through the floor and literally vibrates the room.  It seriously sounds like someone is slamming a door with all of their might each time a door closes.  Couple that with some folks coming in at 2\/3AM and some leaving at 7\/8AM and it makes for a very poor night of sleep as there is no way around the booms (even tried earplugs and a white noise app).\n\n2)  NYE (again....I 'get it'...it's a party night)...people just openly partied in the hallways and not just partying, but really amateur screaming, yelling...like they belonged at an undergrad rental in South Oakland.  Around 4AM, a group moved into the room beside ours, jacked up the music\/bass and went on with...just random screaming.  We called the front desk twice before someone was sent up to ask them to bring the noise down (it took 5 minutes of security pounding on the door before they could even hear it, to open up).  Security came to the group with a very meek, wishy-washy..'uh...could you please, possibly turn the music down a little?'.  They did not even do the obligatory gesture of turning it down while security was there.  Security left and nothing changed.  After another steady 30 minutes we asked to either be moved to another room or we were just going to check-out.  To their credit, they did move us to a quieter room, where we got our total of 3 hours of sleep for the night before we had to leave for travel.  However, it really just ruined NYD as we were totally exhausted.  While we appreciated the gesture of moving us to a new room, that was just a band-aid on the problem.  The solution would have been to shutdown the party b\/c while we were able to sleep a few hours in peace, there was still a hall full of guests that had to contend with the party.\n\nWhen we're back in Pgh, we'll likely visit for the atmosphere and vibe, but since there are some big flaws in the overnight experience, we'll definitely be going elsewhere.
