I've been here for a few weddings in the past but today was for my sisters baby shower. This venue and its historic bones are TO DIE FOR!!!! The high ceilings and wood beams make my heart happy. We had the great hall and it was set beautifully with round tables. Our brunch menu consisted of: eggs Florentine, sausage egg bake, breakfast potatoes, danishes, bagels, toasts, and a vast array of fruits. Everything was absolutely delicious! The sauce on the eggs Florentine was so smooth and tasty! \n\nThe views of the golf course are beautiful and with the leaves changing, I was soaking up the awe and wonder. I highly recommend Pine Ridge for any baby or wedding shower. The staff was so attentive and proactive with our needs.
