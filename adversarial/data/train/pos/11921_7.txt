I'm not in the business of enjoying many buffets these days. My girlfriend doesn't appreciate my ever expanding waste line and my new found squishy qualities as much as I do. So where's the first place I go on a weekend away with the dudes? Buffet.\n\nNope, the food isn't spectacular, the service isn't worth raving about, and the atmosphere is pretty reminiscent of a fancy high school cafeteria. But, it's a buffet. You pay a small, small price for an endless supply of food. Best part? I had steak, New Orleans chicken, gobs of rice, heaps of ice cream, and some other stuff I can't remember because of the food coma, AND all of it was either respectably OK or even fairly enjoyable. \n\nGolden Corral will forever have a spot in my heart and a gaping hole in my stomach to fill.
