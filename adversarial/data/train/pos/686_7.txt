Good L'oven now has a sister bakery which is located near Reis Run Road in the North Hills. This location has a lot more to offer than the one in Bellevue. In addition to their famous cookies you can order breakfast, lunch sandwiches, soup, or even frozen goods to prepare at home. \n\nIt is more spread out than the other location but they have the same large cookies for the same prices. The more you buy the more you save. Nice thing about their cookies is that if you can't eat them then you can wrap them and freeze them individually. They can last up to two months that way.\n\nIn addition they have various children's clothes, tea towels, hand painted glasses, honey, and all types of knick knacks for sale. You can even get candy, chocolates, just about anything. It's a great place to browse around. Some are even sports themed. Yes, they sell my Zeke's coffee which is already preground or in small packets for small coffeemakers. You can even purchase their regular blend to drink or anything you'd like from the refrigerator. They do have a small eating area near the window. My girlfriend treated me to a delicious home made scone which I was told they make fresh daily. Covered with tasty almonds it wasn't overly sweet and I was able to save some of it to take home later as a snack.\n\nI saw that on Sats they have various local vendors come in and discuss their products. Tomorrow they will have a local farm come in and talk about chicken, eggs, and pork. Although I can't be there tomorrow I will make it a point to return to check out one of these vendors. I love to shop local and no better way than to find a spot that offers it.\n\nI purchased 3 cookies which I have frozen for future use. I'm pleased with the second location since it is easy access off the highway and ample parking is available. Looking forward to checking out one of those vendors in the near future.
