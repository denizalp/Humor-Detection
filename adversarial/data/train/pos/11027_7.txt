We rolled up with a gang of 8 right in the midst of a snowstorm and Spanos was shovelling out the delivery and takeout boxes like a whole hungry community depended on them. There were 4 other tables occupied in this tiny cozy restaurant and we were able to get seated right away. Service was slow but very friendly and helpful, and though I'm not a sports person I love the vintage authentic memorabilia they have on the walls. The menu is right up my alley too, classic Montreal diner vibes with pizza, subs, gyros and chicken wings. What else do you need in life? \n\nI shared a veggie pizza and veggie sub, both were great. I loved the dough and the sauce and everything was hot and fresh tasting. Our table in general was very happy from kids to grandparents. A very sweet surprise in the West Island.
