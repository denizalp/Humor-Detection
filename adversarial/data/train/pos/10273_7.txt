I just realized how a Grimaldi's Pizza is absent a puffy edge.\nI've never noticed this before. Mainly because I'm too busy gawking at all the bad plastic surgery forty somethings and their out-of-control kids. \n\nNo complaints. \nThe pizza is thin and flavorful, but the big rounded edge (cornicione) that's both chewy and crispy was missing, which led me to the conclusion that our pie resembled more of a flatbread than a traditional pizza.\n\nThe other thing you won't find here is a traditional Napolitana pie. \nNo sign of a Margherita anywhere on the menu. They do however offer additional basil for two bucks which will get you a reasonable facsimile.\n\nIf you want a great pie, go to Naples. \nA good pie, Chris Bianco's Pizzeria Bianco in south Phoenix.\nAnd a pie that's light years above the chains and consistent as hell, Grimaldi's.\n\nSo you're not going to get a big cornicione.\nNor will you get a traditional Margherita.\nBut, you will get a Saturday night, plastic surgery freakshow that'll make most men do a full body shiver, like after taking a pee.
