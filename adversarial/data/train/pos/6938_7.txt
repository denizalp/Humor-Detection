I finally made it out to Noodlecat (please don't tell Superior Pho!) and I'm a fan.  Whereas, places like Superior Pho are like the dark-haired beautiful girl straight off the boat from Vietnam, Noddlecat is the Hapa girl, with her hair dyed red, blue, and white, and maybe a nose ring.  She's hip, she's cool, and she got flava! :0    \n\nWe stroll in there, pushing our sleek red stroller and we are greeted by loud rock n' roll.  \"Table for two, and a baby,\" I say.  \"This way, please.\"  That's the reply I get and no raised eyebrows, no batted eyelids, and would you know it, there's already a seated family with their own baby holding court at the end of the table.  Yes, parents are hip too.  Giving birth doesn't mean I have to hide away for the next 10 years!  \n\nWhat about the food?!, I hear you screaming.  Well, pipe down and let me tell ya.  The food was delish! I got the duck confit noodle soup, full bowl, thank you. And some gyoza as appetizer.  My husband got the baby octopus noodles, and some fried chicken buns.  My duck soup was delicious!  The duck meat fell off the bone in velvety bites, and the soup was dark and thick, like any good soup should be.  My husband's octopus noodles were nicely spicy, with some bright crunchy vegetables thrown in for good measure.  He regretted having only ordered the halfl bowl.  And what about the baby you ask?  Well, she sat in her high chair, sucked down her bottle and bobbed her head back and forth, rocking out to the good ole American music being piped into the room. The verdict: we liked it, and so did the baby.\n\nWith flavorful food, Tom Petty, The Beatles, and the Rolling Stones on rotation, what's not to love?\n\nP.S.:  The one star off was for the prices! $11 for a bowl of noddles. But we understand that they are paying downtown rent and we will most likely be back!
