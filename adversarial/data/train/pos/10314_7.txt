First the good. This is a hole in the wall I would have never stopped at if it wasn't for Yelp. I'm giving it 3 stars because of the food. I had the fresh shrimp spring rolls. Delicious. I followed that up with an order of pot stickers the biggest and most doughy I ever had but never-the-less​ excellent​. My wife had some sort of ginger chicken dish which she enjoyed very much.\n\nNow the downside​. This is a mom and pop operation. When it came time to pay the bill I handed her my Visa card. She says to me in broken Vietnamese English​ \"What...you no have cash!\" She seemed rather indignant​ about it. I thought to myself this must be a cash-only​ joint. I turned around to look at the front door and they accept the full array of credit cards. She picks up my card and waives it around taking it to her husband cooking in the kitchen. A speedy​ Vietnamese​ chatter soon ensued​. He comes out and gives me a dirty look as he ran the card. I have​ never been in a restaurant​ advertising​ they accept credits and then get pi$$ed off because I used one! These people are so f------cheap they squeak when they walk. We left the fortune cookies behind because we didn't want them to file Chapter 11.
