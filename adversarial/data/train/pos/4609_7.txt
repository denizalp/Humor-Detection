ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.\n\nvery nice hotel. made me feel like i was a damn queen. our room was huge for two queen size beds and a living room area. bathroom is AHMAZINGGGGG. wow if i could design my bathroom it would look like that. the only downfalls to these hotel rooms was that our window faced a wall and the bathroom and shower doors did not have locks. obviously if theres multiple beds then multiple people are staying there and there should be locks on doors.\n\nanother plus is downstairs there is a VERY convenient food court with LOTS OF FOOD. i mean LOTS. wow. fast food and fine dining. THANK YOU. also casino is very lively and nice! would love to stay here again.
