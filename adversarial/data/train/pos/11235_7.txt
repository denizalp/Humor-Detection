I purchased a voucher for a 6-month membership at Florida Jack's located at the corner of Yonge\/Bloor for $199.\n\nI am a fan of group fitness classes because I find it adds variety to my workouts.  I have done boxing classes before.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a small gym.  It is located on the second floor.  It is shared by a few fitness companies, Evolution Fitness being one of them.  \n\nOn the third floor is the boxing area.  Equipped with punching bags and a boxing ring.  This is where my class was.  I took the Beginner\/Intermediate class, and everyone else in the class seemed to be regulars.  \n\nIt was an intimidating experience.  First and foremost, I didn't know how to wrap my wrists.  I approached the instructor, Eric, and he wrapped my wrists for me.   He suggested I buy my own, which was good advice for personal hygiene reasons.  \n\nThe class started, and the music was blaring, and drowned out Eric's oral instructions.  I felt like the new kid on the block who was socially outcasted and left out by everyone else.  \n\nHe went through the moves so fast that it was frustrating as I didn't get myself well coordinated the first time.  I was also left sans partner and was left with practicing my punches and uppercuts on a punching bag.  \n\nIt was a frustrating experience, and I felt that the instructor really didn't care for beginners, as he focused his efforts on the regulars.  \n\nI will probably not be coming back again, and rest assured I will be fighting for a refund.
