AAA contractor and all around good peeps. More later.\n\nSo it's been a month, that should be later enough. \nSo for my birthday this year we did a major roadtrip. SD to Big Bear. Snowboard and drink..not too much though because I need to be able to drive to Vegas. That's right...Big Bear to Vegas..all in a 3 day span. So on our way back to SD from Las Vegas, we decide to stop off at state line to gas up and try our luck at $1 craps and roulette. 2 hours later, cleaned out, we head to our truck....turn the key and.....nothing. shift the gears, try again...nothing. So I call AAA, luckily Larry's just became a mobile battery service provider. If he hadn't done that we would have had to wait for a service truck from Barstow!!!!\n\nIn a little over an hour they show up, test the old battery, install a new battery and have us on our way.\n\nThese guys are a life saver...and AAA too!
