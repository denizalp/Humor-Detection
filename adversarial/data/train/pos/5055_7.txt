I don't like giving just one star, though I was tempted. I realize that you have to take some places for what they are. Middle Road Inn is a bar. It's a dive with a nice lodge-y feel to it, and has a large bar space and several flat screens. We found it through Yelp after visiting the Hartwood Acres dog park. We checked the opening time (noon) and figured we'd stop in around 12:30 to watch some of the Pens game. \n\nThe bar tender was anything but friendly. She made it clear that she was in the process of opening, and didn't want to help us. I can understand when you are just opening you could be a bit frazzled, but she was so rude about it. Plus, don't advertise to be open at 12 and not have your shit together by 12:30. My boyfriend (in a timid way cause she was pretty threatening) asked if he could get a water, she said \"no - I just opened so I don't have ice.\" OK, well, that's that.\n\nA bit later once our drinks were slammed down in front of us, we ordered food. I ordered a veggie wrap with no fries or coleslaw. The food was awful in my opinion. BF isn't picky at all, and gobbled his greasy buffalo chicken wrap down. I really can't even look at coleslaw, and don't eat deep-fried foods, so I almost threw up when my veggie wrap came with fries and coleslaw ON it. There's no way around that , so I just pushed it away and ate chips. I didn't say anything to the bartender because honestly, I didn't want some spitfire remark. So I silently boxed up the wrap and saved it for the BF for later. \n\nIt was just a bad experience, and for drinks, it's not a bad place at all... except for the service. So, just won't be back here.
