Oh how we need negative stars available on here. Church's tastes nothing like it used to like I remember when I was younger. Went there a few weeks back and haven't returned and won't. Ordered chicken strips, fries and mac n cheese. That was a mistake. The chicken had a weird taste to it and the fries were soaked with what tasted like rancid cooking oil. The mac n cheese was runny and bland. I don't get why there are so many Church's locations. If anything there should be more Popeyes.
