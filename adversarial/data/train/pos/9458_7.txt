The only reason why I'm giving it 4.5 stars is because I was really hoping there would be the photo opportunity before the dinner show w\/ King Arthur & his court like there is at the Buena Park, CA location.\nI know my 9 year old niece would've really liked it.\nTuesday's have no shows- so plan accordingly.\nShows run about an hour & half. With showtimes at 6 or 8pm.\nRemember- NO utensils & eating like a savage are welcome.\nMeal starts off w\/ a creamy tomato soup.\nDinner- Baked Cornish Game Hen w\/ crispy skin & paprika dust. Broccoli floret, a fist sized red baked potato w\/ sea salt, & buttermilk biscuit that wasn't dry (Yay!).\nWe ordered 3 Jell-O shots- we didn't pick out any specific flavors. Pretty decent sized.\n$35 for a bucket of 5 imported beer bottles. Corona & lime anyone? You can mix & match beers!\nDessert- apple strudel w\/ flaky pastry crust!\nKids dinner menu- 3 piece chicken tenders (side of ranch), fries, & carrot sticks.\nWe were Team Spain and sat at the head of the arena. When you book online- you can view the arena map. \nBut, booking online there are NO prices for kids!!! Don't get duped! I actually called Excalibur & bought my tickets this way (while still viewing the arena map that way I knew which seats our party of 5 were gonna be seated at).\nWhen I mentioned to the Reservation Agent why the online price for kids wasn't posted- he seemed shocked. So- one thing I also asked is if I booked the seats over the phone was an additional charge- nope.\nThe characters in Tournament of Kings encourages the audience to sing along, Boo! at other characters, & get rowdy.\nTowards the end of the show- there is pyrotechnics... so use caution w\/ the young ones.
