Decided to come to this little hole in the wall for a late night bite. We ordered the chicken burrito bowl and the ground beef burrito. These were definitely tasty and very flavourful. The chipotle sauce is amazing and I love the fact you can put as much toppings and sauces as you want! Guac is NOT extra!! To add, it definitely isn't Mexican, but some kind of fusion Tex mex\/middle eastern food from what we ordered. Besides that, it's definitely delicious and fresh!
