$16 for one white sangria?  Yep, that's what I paid.  Was it right?  No, but due to time constraints caused by the staff who were unable to efficiently accommodate our large group despite ample notice we were coming, I had to forgo the inquiry.  So much for our 20% discount.\n\nWith my main complaints out of the way, I can say that I did like the clean and modern space.  Although we sat inside, they have a beautiful patio as well.  My husband and I had soup ($7) and shared several small plates ($8-$12 each).  The tortilla soup with avocado and roasted chicken was wonderfully spicy and full of flavor.  I was a little surprised by the small portion given the pricing, but it was spicy enough to be plenty.  The crab cake with chipotle remoulade was really nice, too.  I had the shrimp tacos to myself.  Although the shrimp was cooked perfectly, the tortillas did not hold up.  One disintegrated a bite into it requiring the use of my fork.  My husband also ordered the meatballs.  I tried one, and while they were tasty, I could do without.\n\nWhile I would be inclined to return for a cocktail or an appetizer, I would be hesitant to have dinner before a show or with a group again due to the extremely slow service in both getting our food and the checks.
