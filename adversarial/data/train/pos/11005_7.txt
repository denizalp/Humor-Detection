I had the Nashville hot chicken and I would recommend this to anyone. It has a little kick to it and was delish! The potato pancake that comes with it was cold and and it didn't taste good to me. I didn't like the syrup for it either. Mom had the shiitake noodles and it was amazing! My niece got the deep fried Mac n cheese and she loved it. Huge portions for both being an appetizer. Dad had a veg. Burger and he liked it too. Will definitely come to this place again if I come back to Arizona.
