It's hard to believe that it's been over a year since I posted the grand opening info for the Lulu Scottsdale Showroom.  Since then, the showroom has extended their hours, the girls working there have gotten even friendlier, and I've managed to spend a lot of money - both on myself and others.\n\nThe Lulu apparel I own is my go-to when I'm getting dressed to workout.  It's supportive, comfortable, durable, and flattering.  Even my brother told me that my ass looks good in my Lulu pants - ok, maybe that is TMI but you get the point!\n\nI've gotten friends and family members hooked on Lulu, including my fiance, my  mom, my brother, and sister... I recently went in for a visit and the music was pumping with such a good energy in the store.  Emily, Ryan, and Nicole were working and extremely helpful and friendly.  It's also motivating around this time of year because the employees at Lululemon have boards up on the wall with their own personal goals for the future.  Perfect to get you thinking about new years resolutions and your own goals as well.\n\nIf you don't own something lululemon athletica yet, what are you waiting for?!  At least go visit and tell them you also hope they open a bigger store in the Valley soon.
