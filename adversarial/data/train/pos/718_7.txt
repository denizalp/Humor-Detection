I have dined at this location several times in which I would have given a four+ star review.  We took my mother here for her birthday and, to the server's credit, he got us out right when we needed to be leaving for a show.  My mom and husband thought their steak and fish were very good.  \n\nThe reasons for the lower starred review is that the bread and butter were nothing to write home about and the sides and salad were all mediocre\/undercooked\/or overpriced for what you got.  Specifically, we got the mushrooms, which were above-average, potatoes au gratin which were like a cheese soup with very little potatoes, and uncooked and underseasoned brussels sprouts.  My salad had watery tomatoes and a really bland dressing.  It was disappointing to have such crappy sides because 1) they were expensive and 2) they comprised all of my vegetarian meal.  \n\nAlso, the waiter commented about three separate times about how much we must have liked our food or that we were hungry as he was clearing our plates  (rude).  Hey a**h*ole, if I'm paying about $4 per forkful, you had better believe we are eating all of it!!
