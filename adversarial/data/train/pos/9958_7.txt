Ok, so you can't expect hot go-go dancers or flashy celebrity names when you go to Freezone... But you can expect a good time for a good price.\n\nThis was the first Gay club I went to when I arrived to Vegas and it stays pretty consistent. You don't ever face long lines for drinks, the club is big enough for a huge gathering but never too packed to be annoying, there's a menu for food and hot servers for both men and women and the best part... there's no cover charge.\n\nThe music is generally good and the dancing is always happening. An ATM in the club and shot gals and guys roaming make it pretty convenient. They have pool tables and seating booths as well as gambling machines at the bar. Pretty well rounded.\n\nMost of my straight friends enjoy not having to see flopping penis' in underwear and the atmosphere is pretty chill. My brothers and close friends, all straight, love going here and especially love the servers and body shots.\n\nLastly, the 10pm drag show is comedic and... FREE! Boys night, girls night, bathroom attendants and drink specials. Check out Freezone for local fun at a fair price!\n\nSome downfalls: the crowd can be somewhat on the older or not too attractive side and sometimes the level of \"ratchet\" is a bit crazy. I also find that the Lesbian crowd is always in full force at Freezone.
