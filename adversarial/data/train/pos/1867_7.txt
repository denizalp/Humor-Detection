We came in here in need of some shrubs for our backyard. Our initial thought  was that it would cost around $1,000 in shrubs to cover our back wall. Uhg, no, try $500 each x 12 total to fill the wall. YIKES! I know, you may be thinking this is crazy expensive but the shrubs that we were looking at are already 8-10 feet tall and very full! If we wanted to get the smaller shrubs, they would be around $45 each but only 3 feet tall and grow 2 feet a year on average. This means, it would take us about 3 years to get them where we want them! We ended up going with the mature privets for a pretty hefty cost. \n\nOn the bright side, we got 2 free privets {buy 5, get 1 free special} and we had amazing customer service along the way. They walked us through the entire process and had answers to all of our questions. This hefty cost also includes planting! We also love that their trees are grown in Arizona {rather than a greenhouse} so they're acclimated to our climate. They offer 12 month, no interest financing to make it a little easier to swallow. I can't wait to see our backyard transformed come November 21st! :) They also threw in a few jugs of moon juice. \n\nAll in all, our experience at Moon Valley was a great one and we'll definitely come back for future landscaping needs!
