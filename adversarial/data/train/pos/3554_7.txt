I came to this restaurant thinking the food would be overpriced and mediocre. well, it was not mediocre. my boyfriend and I ordered the Toro tartare, 72-hr braised short ribs, lobster miso soup, yellowtail sashimi, tuna sashimi, king crab sashimi, salmon egg sashimi, and an order of the grilled shisito peppers. The toro came out first and was perfection. buttery fatty mild yet fresh. then came our sashimi and soup. the sashimi must be the freshest I have ever had in town and I am a local. miso soup is miso soup. nothing spectacular on that front. now, the short rib! boy, I don't have enough to say about how amazing they were. The presentation was...forget it. Forget the presentation. The fucking meat was so tender I felt I could have given it a glance and it would have fallen apart. I didn't want my shirt rib experience to be over truly an eat-with-your-eyes-shut-type deal. I am telling you. Get it. Your wallet might regret it but your taste buds won't.
