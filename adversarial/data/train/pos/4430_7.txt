I was flying out of Charlotte and got to the airport really early for my flight so I opted for breakfast.  Being that Burger King is one of the only places open really early, I chose it.  Plus, I enjoy their breakfast items.  \n\nI know it's come to be commonplace to expect poor service at fast food restaurants, but...why?  I worked in fast food in my younger days and provided quality service.  I was quick, I was knowledgeable, I was friendly, and I was attentive.  Is that really too much to ask?  If you can't make it in fast food...where can you make it?  \n\nAnyway, I stood in line behind one other person to order my breakfast.  I stepped up to order when it was my turn, and after the co-worker next to him finished talking to him...or at least took a break.  I placed my order and then stepped down the line to await my order.  I looked around and saw chutes full of pre-made sandwiches sitting under the warming lamp.  Employees were congregated in the back talking.  And more employees were congregated around the register talking.  Nobody was working except for the cashier, and even he was doing a half-assed job.  The cashier abandoned his register and came over to fill the first guy's order.  He then proceeded to get my coffee and fill my order.  Some jerk-off airport employee behind me \"kindly\" offered to take the coffee I had just been poured so I could get a \"fresh\" cup.  Thankfully, the BK employee continued to give me my cup of coffee.  \n\nThe food was good and still semi-warm, but is it too much to ask that people do their jobs while on duty?  Do you really need 10 BK employees standing around doing nothing?
