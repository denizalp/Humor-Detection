We went the second night after Luckee opened.\nSpace was nice. Chairs not.\nMusic was irritating.  Not sure what genre was playing.\nServer had some memory issues.\nMenu enticing.\nNoodle dish tasty and good value,\nSpring rolls good,\nLamb meatball overpriced for 2 small balls.\nSome of the other  dishes were small in portion\nFor the money,\nDeserts were an odd selection and average.\nWe will try it one more time for the dim sun.\nIf this doesn't WOW us we won't return.
