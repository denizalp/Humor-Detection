Drinks are amazing.  If you're going with your girlfriends get a day bed and some pitchers,  it's worth it. The layout is great for catching some sun and the hosts (Nima)  and cocktails are attentive. The Love Goddess is my fave drink.  The dj plays a great mix of dance, hip hop and edm. This is a top less (toptional) pool so no tan lines! \n Anyone who complains about the price needs to go back home because it's the same everywhere in vegas.
