I don't know if I just suck at finding the proper Yelp business postings, or no one has written a review for Zero Zone in the supposed six months that they've been open. I have a feeling that if there is a duplicate business, the almighty Jen K will help me find it though (I tried. I really did). \n\nWe went exploring around the Midland and Finch area tonight. My dad wanted dessert and this was the first place with dessert that we saw, so we came in to try it. Their menu is fairly limited for desserts, but they do have a decent drink menu. We ended up having the mixed fruit grass jelly ($4.99) and a regular blueberry juice ($4.49). The mixed fruit grass jelly had strawberry, honeydew, mango. My dad thought it could have been a tad colder, but it was alright. The blueberry juice was not quite juice, but not quite slushy enough to be a slush. There were real blueberries used to make it, but there was also blueberry syrup\/flavoring in it. I thought it was too sweet, my mom thought it was too sour, and my dad thought it was just right (something about this reminds me of the Three Bears). \n\nThey do have enough tables to accommodate a party of six to twelve or so if there are tables available. I saw two groups of at least six people. They have a couple board games for people to play, but many of them are Chinese board games. Free WiFi. Password is on the wall.\n\nWith the competition around, I don't know how long Zero Zone will last. If you want to go somewhere where there will probably be seats to chill though, this is your place to go.
