Went here for the first time after reading reviews on yelp.\n\nMade an appointment - they are very busy. Lucy was able to accept walk-ins if you walked in during a brief lull. \n\nDecent selection of colors from Opi or China glaze.\n\nFrom the outside it doesn't look that appealing (no frills nail place) but the service, quality of pedicure (good scrub!) and only $18 for a pedicure!!!\n\nGot in and out under 1 hour. I will be back for sure! I save at least 9-10$ here vs my usual spots at Bloor west village!
