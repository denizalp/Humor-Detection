Root 174's still trying to figure itself out in every way.. unacceptable at this price point\n\nRustic ambience with Old Hollywood gold paint and red velvet cushions. Earthy brown tables are never more than 1\/3 full during Wednesday's dinner \"rush\". The result is an awkwardly quiet restaurant on par with Babu Bhatt's restaurant on Seinfeld. Root could sit 34 but instead has as many patrons as workers.. 4-5. \n\nOur awkward server made no effort to connect with us, not even eye contact. When asked \"how's the short rib\", he gave evocative adjectives like \"good.\" Literally said \"We can't make that\".. it's a fucking old fashioned and you served me a sazarac moments later. What cocktails they did serve were risk-less, simple, and sweet.\n\nMixed-quality food was largely in need of better spicing. The mushy dates had exceptionally earthy chorizo, a nice counterpart. The Indian-esque shrimp terrine needed salt but delivered in acid, earthy lentils as balance despite boring shrimp. Pesto dominated the lamb neck, which needed salt to help elevate the too-earthy carrots. The lamb itself was super juicy though. Juicy med-rare short rib was all over, large jalape√±o slices dominating one forkful before the bitter taste of bok choy next. The promised kimchi made no appearance. And yes, in need of salt.\n\nBest was definitely caeser salad, the only well-salted dish. Cavier and anchovy blend superbly alongside a nice crunch and excellent dressing. \n\nYou can mess up one of service, drinks, or food for this price. All 3 means \"not good\", or cue Babu.. \"very, very bad.\"
