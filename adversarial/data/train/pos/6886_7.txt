First off let me say that this business is notorious for sending hate mail when the reviewer\/customer does not rate this place highly.  Now let me save you the trouble by saying that I will not read hate mail so don't bother as I am sure you will also not bother in making any necessary changes for ALL patrons to be fully satisfied when dining here.  \n\nWe came here on a Saturday evening and it was completely dead which was the first red flag.  We had heard good things by a few peeps so we decided to give it a go.  \n\nWe started with a few skewers and a kama  or I should say half of a kama which were all crowded all on the same plate thrown over a bed of cabbage accompanied by an overpowering smelly orange slice. AWEFUL! \n\nEverything we ordered looked nothing like the pictures we saw on yelp. No wonder they frown on picture taking.\n\nSo disappointed that I stopped at the second order and could not go on.  It gets worse ...the \"sushi chef\" also kept shaking his head NO on certain items suggesting they were not of good quality. I noticed that my husband kept ordering other items as if trying to convince himself that it couldn't get worse...but that's all they serve here and he soon realized they just could not be saved.  They also do not offer half rolls and offer 1 dessert per person and with too many restrictions at an all you can eat joint makes for a very un-fun experience all together. \n\nThere is just way too much competition out there and you unfortunately only have in many cases one attempt to cause a good first impression with me.\nGOOD LUCK!!
