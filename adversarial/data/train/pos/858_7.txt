I carelessly throw around the \"L-word\" & this review will not be spared its usage. \n\nEcho & Rig was recommended by a family member who clearly knows great food & with confidance, I can now also vouch for E&R's deliciousness. \n\nI love love love that there are over 30 \"small plates\" on the menu. Grazing is my eating style, & if i weren't hell-bent on having filet, I would've ordered more than the superb portobello mushroom fries & herb aioli. Tried a bite from his stack of thick-cut bacon w\/ BBQ sauce -- smokey, fatty, more like baked ham than bacon. \n\nLove love that you get a (free!) sauce with your steak. His \"charred onion\" paired beautifully with his rib-eye cap, & my horseradish cream pick elevated an already lovely filet. Say yes to their garlic mashed potatoes. \n\nAnd finally, love that our service issue was immediately & professionally addressed. My filet arrived medium after we'd waited 40-minutes for our steaks. They whisked it away with sincere apologies, & the filet was returned well done as I had ordered. Desserts & coffee (as if we could eat anymore!) were comped for our troubles (carmel turtle sundae is a must.) \n\nRoom for improvement: though I love (lust) that they pour ketel one, my cocktail, A Love Affair, delivered zero buzz, & tasted like a weak lemonade. \n\nProvided they don't make a habit of making customers endure excessive wait times for their steaks, E&R's extensive menu deserves a second look the next time we're in charming Tivoli Village.
