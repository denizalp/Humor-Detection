Always stay here when in Phoenix as its close to the clients site. Easy parking and easy to find. Close to shopping and easy access to freeway.\n\nThe good: Hampton has the best comforters around. AC worked great, a little loud but its Phoenix and everyone should sacrifice a bit of noise for a functional AC. Its hot here; although it is August. Staff is always friendly, and because of the location & staff, its why I choose this hotel.\n\nHowever, there are little things that Im not A-OK with. Towels need to be replaced. They have seen better days and have run their course. It always annoys me that hotels take the time to make sure the room is clean, but always neglect the iron. A dirty iron ruins your clothes. That was the case here...pair of pants and shirt ruined. Plus the ironing board needs to be replaced. Its the little things...\n\nThe wifi is always amazing here. Free & fast! Great to get a little work done.\n\nBe warned, they have one of the slowest elevators around. Push the button to go up or down, do your taxes, and then the elevator appears.
