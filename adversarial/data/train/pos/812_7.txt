The classic \"Welcome to FABULOUS Las Vegas\" sign is a real thing and there's a parking lot where you can drop your car (or your limo) so that you can get your classic shot of the sign. And yes, I did it.\n\nWhen Las Vegas attraction would be complete without a wedding party of Asians, another of girls wearing pink tutus and an Elvis impersonator? Really, it was as cliche as you can possibly imagine. AWESOME!
