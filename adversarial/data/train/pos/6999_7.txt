My first visit here was long over due. I had heard the legend of this Asian Mexican fusion cuisine. On first visit I was a bit confused about how and what to order as there are several combo and meal options to choose from, luckily they have helpful staff and I was sober. For me a vegetarian there are 2 main options, the Chile rellno or the veggies. I have only tried the chilie rellno in all forms. On my first visit I got a combo which allows you to pick any two items and get each one in either a burrito or quesadilla. I opted for one of each.\n\nWith the combo comes rice of several choices and beans. I recommend the Cuban style beans as they are full of great flavor.  To spice things up be sure to take a copious amount of their hot sauce. It  has a great spice with a slightly sweet note.   I got my meal to go so I had to wait a few minuets to see what I had actually ordered.\n\nThe first appearance was very greasy and somewhat disorganized in a small round pan. One bite later and I was hooked. The textures and flavors were incredible. The batter on the Chile is very unique and it must have cornflakes and or French fried onions to add that special crunch.  I was very satisfied with my meal, it was affordable  (less than $8) great tasting and very filling.\n\nTo my surprise the bag contained two free cookies! \n\nI will be going back when I have a chance. My friend who I was with shares the same opinion. I just will have to work out a bit more as this is not exactly healthy food.
