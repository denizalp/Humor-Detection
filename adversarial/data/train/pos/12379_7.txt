The design is great, the drinks strong and the best hummus in town, bar none.\n\nI've been there for brunch, lunch and diner. The food is always good and the atmosphere really works\n\nHere's my favorites: Brunch-definitely the eggs benedict and a bloody Stella (tomato juice and Stella Artois); Lunch-the Tangier burger is the best, with hummus, pesto spread and sun-dried tomatoes; Dinner-the tomato Taza salad with a side of grilled salmon.\n\nAlso check out the kisras with shrimp or lamb and, oh yeah... did I mention the best hummus in town?
