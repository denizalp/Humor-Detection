For a few months now, the Mob Museum has had this Underground speakeasy where hard liquor is served along with a few non-alcoholic drinks and food.  It's out of the way so the dirty coppers--especially that Ness fellow doesn't find it--and one can enjoy spirits without fear of being busted.\n\nI was at an author talk at the museum and took the time to visit the Underground.  I had a wooden nickel--a $2 discount off a drink--and it was time to visit the speakeasy.  The walls are covered with prohibition era signs and memorabilia.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs, turn left and you enter the \"Receiving\" area--aka--the bar.  There are a number of tables and there's seating at the bar which is where I went.  Looking over the menu, I chose the raspberry lavender fizz, a non-alcoholic drink.  The bartender took my wooden nickel and gave me my $2 discount.  The drink is normally $7.\nIn a room behind me, there's a working distillery.  The door is marked \"Shipping\" and there's an explanation of how liquor is made and you can see the distillery through the glass windows.\n\nThere are tasting areas in the bar and distillery areas.  Buy a card, insert it, choose the drink you want to try, and press the button to dispense.  \n\nThe menu also describes shareable dishes.  I'll have to go with some friends to try some food items.\n\nIf you go, remember, mums the word.  We don't want no Ness coming to our joint and busting up the place.
