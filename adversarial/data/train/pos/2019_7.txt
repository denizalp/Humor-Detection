As of right now, I was disappointed.  Most of the donuts are 2.75. Pretty steep for a donut. Love local places.  But I tried three kinds and none of them were really a wow :(  But I wish them luck and hope to give more stars another time.  The reason for the low stars is that I don't feel the high price is really justified.
