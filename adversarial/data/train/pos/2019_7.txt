I really don't understand these reviews... It's Wal Mart after all. On the scale of Wal Marts this one would rate pretty darn high. It's crowded like every other Wal mart in the world but it's clean and relatively new. The place has a great selection and a well stocked grocery department! I'm a Wal mart girl and this one is one of the better establishments in the area
