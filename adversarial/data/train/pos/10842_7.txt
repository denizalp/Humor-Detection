I had a very large messy thorny Texas Ebony in my back yard.  A large branch came down in a storm.  Howard came out and took the tree down for me.  He also trimmed and fertilized other trees in my yard.  He is very knowledgeable and reasonably prices.  He gave me recommendations for taking care of my trees.  Very professional.   I will be calling him again to plant some trees when I redo my backyard.
