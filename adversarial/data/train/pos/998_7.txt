I'd luv 2 give this place a glowing review, but due 2 my experience I still feel I'm being pretty fair under the circumstances. First the good ~ I picked this place because I needed an emergency extraction of a wisdom tooth that I could no longer put off & being it was the wk~end, the available options r kinda scarce.  Don't put off an extraction 2 long because when the pain gets as intolerable as seeing urself re~enact the Castaway scene when Tom Hanks does a self~extraction w\/ an iceska8... well, it's no bueno! \n\n   The last time I had been 2 this place was @ least 13 yrs prior & since I'm a bit of a wuss when it comes 2 teeth work (who called the WHAAAAMBULANCE?) & was concerned about being put under as it could adversely affect my heart, I again turned 2 this place because they removed 1 of mine b4 all those yrs ago w\/o doing so & that's the best scenario I could hope 4.\n\n   I called 2 c if I could get in & was told I didn't need an appt but could b w8ing awhile till he could fit me in somewhere which is completely understandable 4 needing 2 get seen same day on a wk~end.\n\n   Got all the paperwork submitted & the lady @ the front desk\/w8ing area said there was no way 2 confirm insurance being it was the wk~end so I'd have 2 pay out of pocket.  After ?ing a couple Xs more & her feeding me the same aoutom8ed reply like a robot I just figured UGH, ok whatever it takes, just need the problem yanked out. I'll have 2 deal w\/ the extra re~imbursement hassle l8er. Boy, was it ever... but I'll get 2 that ~ trying 2 keep things in succession.\n\n   After losing feeling in my legs\/arse in the w8ing area, was called back 2 a little section that would become my chair (or perhaps it became me) 4 an even longer dur8ion which is fine 4 no appt & squeezing me in. What I took issue w\/ was I was in immense pain & still being nice & trying 2 joke w\/ the prepper\/attendant  (maybe trying 2 make light of my nervousness).  This lady was stomping around like an elephant, snorting like a horse & slamming cupboards & drawers, over~clanking tools\/equipment which was counter~acting my attempts 2 keep my anxiety @ bay.  When I commented \"1 of those days huh?\" She st8ed, \"well I'm hot & hungry which is 2 of the worst things 4 me 2 b.\" I told her I was sorry & that it would get better.  She just stopped & glared @ me 4 a moment & then said \"pthththtfft yeah\" walking off.  Tried not 2 take it personally but I felt if I were 2 complete her sentence it woulda been: soon as I was outta her hair.  She came around the corner\/my chair area w\/ the same antics several Xs & I almost wanted 2 pay 4 her 2 go get a \"HAPPY Meal\" & ice~cream next door @ McDonald's b4 she touched me!! Seriously was gonna call from my chair & ask my ride in the front w8ing room 2 do so 4 me. I was close 2 leaving a couple Xs because I almost couldn't stand it (& I can really take quite a bit).\n\n   Finally, the dentist was ready 2 git-her-done which was not nearly as bad as I thought it was gonna b & I felt immedi8 relief in more ways than just the pain. When I velcro~detatched myself from the chair, I immedi8ly felt my mouth fill up w\/ blood even while biting down hard on the gauze & 'miss hungry hippo' wouldn't let me spit in the sink or trash. \"Can I get some more gauze then?\" \"Nope, there's some we're sending u home w\/ along w\/ ur prescriptions up front.\" GRrrr!!  So I proceeded 2 the front check~out area thinking: thx 4 making this feel like such a drive~thru which had everything 2 do w\/ her treatment\/behavior. \n\n   So 2 sum up the dentist was AWESOME & defin8ly got the necessary job done which I'm tremendously gr8ful 4 esp since it was on a wk~end when most dentist offices r closed (which is also a HUGE +)!!  Don't let the front desk lady tell u they can''t confirm ur insurance card on wk~ends (found out that was complete bull & my insurance company ended up calling her out on it) after having 2 call several Xs when they claimed 2 have sent the necessary documents via snail mail (they don't fax) which the insurance company kept denying receiving. It was apparently easier 2 charge out of pocket, (making me talk w\/ a mouth full of blood 15 min + keep \"saying\" they sent the info 2 the insurance company.) Reimbursed 2 Mo L8r!!!\n\n   It's a shame that he has front desk so~called \"help\" that is anything but (emphasis on BUTT ~ (_y_)  who really likes 2 sit on it btw instead of the job she's being paid 4) & the unnecessarily gruff attendant who prepped me & then assisted him on my procedure. It would b my luck not 2 get the really nice sweetheart of a gal who was there. Since I had plenty of time 2 observe & hear the goings~on in my surroundings while becoming fused 2 that chair 4 so long, she seemed 2 b the Only 1 there (@ least that day) who had a pleasant demeanor\/bed~side manner.  Still, I'd probably 'consider' coming back IF it were the down~2~biz dentist & the nice assistant I heard\/witnessed helping other \"chairs\" along w\/ a new front desk record person.
