The hours listed on here indicate they are open until 9:00 PM. When we arrived at the restaurant at 7:53 PM on a Friday night, I noted that the sign on the door also indicated they were open until 9 PM.  A staff member was vacuuming; there were no patrons in the main dining area, and she informed us we could only place to-go orders because they were closing. Not a problem, but she was pretty rude about it. We went to the counter and we're told we could only order salads. We placed our order with a very distracted staff member who made it clear that we were ruining her night by existing. While we waited for our 2 salads to be prepared, I wondered around the dining room with my 3 year old and we admired the Halloween decorations. The vacuuming staff member proceeded to yell at us for 'touching the decorations'. We definitely did not. When our order was finally ready we inconvenienced the staff even more by asking for forks (we were from out of town, staying at a hotel. We didn't want to eat our salads with our hands.). It took longer to get the forks than it did to make the salads. We were followed to the door by the vacuuming staff member and she locked the door behind us. It was 8:16 PM. Don't count on them being open during their listed hours. The salads were alright.  The horrible customer service ruined our app
