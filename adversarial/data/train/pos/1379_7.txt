6:00 pm reservations on a Saturday evening for a party of 8. The hostess, an older lady perhaps named Candy, was so very rude...and it appeared as though she was training a younger lady. I hope that younger lady doesn't pick up her terrible customer service habits! \nFood: was fair at best. There is no synchronization of cooking so a few of us received our seafood while the vegetables were cooking, then came the rice, then came the beef. I never had scallops, veggies and rice on my plate at the same time. We couldn't eat our dinners together.  I know this restaurant gets pretty good reviews...I have no idea why.
