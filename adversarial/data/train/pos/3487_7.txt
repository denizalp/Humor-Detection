Checked out @barriocoreano for the first time last night. Was pleasantly surprised by the tacos - yum! - but disappointed by the service. We started off with a great waitress, but we were moved to make room for a larger party - which we were totally cool with. Except, when we moved, we lost our waitress, and had to flag the manager for service after waiting for a long time just to make a second order. The wait, being neglected and having to flag staff for help killed the experience. \n\nOther thing to note, it gets loud! So if talking is your focus, it may not be the right place for you. \n\nAnd....only one beer on tap...the rest are bottles & cans (I think). The cocktails looked great, though I did not try any.
