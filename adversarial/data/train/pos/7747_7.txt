It's amazing to me that a place is in business. I went in there one time and it was just okay. The second time I walked in wasn't greeted. I took a seat with other people and waited. The barbers one by one finished cutting peoples hair and just decided to take a break. One started eating, 2 walked out the door and 2 more just sat there talking. You'd think a business would want customers?! No big deal, theres plenty of barber shops in the area. Never again will I go here.
