April 2012 I entered Boston Store in East Town Mall in Madison Wisconsin. I was in the store for about an hour and a half. I decided to try on some dresses & skirts. I went into a dressing room to change. I went to the room furthest from the dressing entry way. While changing my clothes I heard a mans voice.\n\nI frantically search for a way to lock the door, but there is not lock! The door flies open! There is a man standing there looking me up & down, smiling at me! I was trying on dresses so I was completely undressed. I went into shock, screaming you can be in here!! I slammed the door ( which flew back open, no lock or latch) I put a chair in front of it and frantically I got dressed. I came out of the dressing room yelling \"there is a man in the dressing room\"!\n\nThe clerks told him he shouldn't be in there, but weren't that concerned about what just happened to me! The only person who seem to care was a customer, she appeared to be shocked about the situation I left the store in tears.\n\nThe next day I called the manager. She didn't think it was a big deal! I said \"why don't you have locks on the dressing room doors? You could have prevented this horrible situation!\" She had no response to my question. She said she would send me a $50.00 gift card, but I received no apology, how insulting!\n\nCome to find out not a single dressing room in Boston Store East Town, not even lingerie dept has a lock on the door. I believe this is every woman's worst nightmare!\n\nAren't we supposed to feel safe in a store while in a state of undress? I wish it had not happened to me, but it did. I would like to bring awareness to other women. I will always make sure the dressing room has a lock before I enter and undress.\n\nI spoke with store manager several times. I let her know I spend thousand of dollars every year at Boston Store. She didn't seem to care. I asked to speak with upper management, she will not give phone number I gave her mine. To date no one has called.\n\nI feel I was stalked at Boston Store that day. He may have known there were no locks and followed me into dressing room. I feel lucky I was no raped!\n\nI want other women to hear my story and be sure to check dressing rooms for locks. I also want people to hear about the complete lack of compassion\/ empathy I received from the store manager who represents this this company.
