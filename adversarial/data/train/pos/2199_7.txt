Ok the terminal itself has some good restaurants and is pretty clean and nice, IF Southwest Airlines manages to put your connecting flight in the same terminal as your arriving flight, not in A when you arrive in D and less than 30 minutes from landing to take off. Also, each terminal letter (A,B, C,) has two actual terminal arms associated with it so you actually will be going past two terminals for every letter you are away. The D terminal is only one arm. \n\nToday, I arrived at the C gate at 6:20 because of a 20 minute delay in LA. My connecting flight was boarding at 6:10. So much for Early Bird Check In. There wasn't a whole lot of time to begin with. I would have landed at 6 pm and boarded at 6:10. \n\nI ran the distance to get to the gate and was literally THE LAST person to board. I would have used the people movers but there are so many people who feel they have to stand in the exact center of those that it makes it slower than just running on the hard surface. I feel badly for the elderly, handicapped and people with small children every time this happens to me. A wider people moved would be awesome and if southwest would cart people over for connecting flights, it would be even better. \n\nAVOID PHOENIX ON YOUR SOUTHWEST ROUTE unless your flight originates there.
