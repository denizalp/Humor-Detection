Not sure what happened on this visit....\n\nI used to love the chicken tenders, they used to be large plump pieces of chicken that were juicy and really good.\n\nThis time I got three relatively good size pieces but they looked like they were pounded flat and were over cooked.  They were hard from being over cooked and why pounded flat and not juicy at all, made this visit not worth the price.\n\nI am very disappointed and probably won't order these again as they seem to have changed.  The sweet potato fries I got with the chicken were actually under cooked.  Not sure what happened in the kitchen but am very disapp
