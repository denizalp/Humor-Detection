This is the worst restaurant I ever went to. Worst ever!!! Rude and aggressive owner, make you have to go in there and eat. Bad service, order a beer but never bring you one. A fish dish costs $39 dollars, OMG what kind of fish is it? When we were checking bill, they already put the tip on the bill, and you will have to pay for the tip. OMG desperate about money!!! Finally!!! And the most important part!!!! The food gave us run!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our belly hurts much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
