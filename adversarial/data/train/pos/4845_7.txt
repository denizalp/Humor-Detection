Another greatness hotel in Vegas. \nThe palazzo shares the Venetian next to it. \nIt's also a must stay or visit when you are in Vegas. Expensive? yes but is it worth it? Yes again! Great restaurants casino and everything else you can imagine. The ambiance is always classy. The service is nice as usual. Try on its worth it!
