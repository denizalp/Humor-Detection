Omg I love breakfast food. Especially GOOOOOOD breakfast food!! I usually have their pancakes which are so sweet and delicious but this time I tried their Wild Hog Skillet (I think that's what it was called or maybe I just made it up lol) and LET ME TELL YOU, whatever that creamy, wet sauce on all that meat was, was so amazing  I hate being that person that gets the same thing every time but I think I might just have to be because it was so yummy I could eat it every day! Anyways, give it a try guys. Oh and the lady at the front was so sweet and considerate. Warm and caring customer service is always a plus!
