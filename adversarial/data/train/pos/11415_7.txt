Probably one of the worst places I have been to. \n\nLowlights:\n\n-Filthy. I even moved food from one table on to another dirty table so I could sit down. It was \"seat yourself\" option and I guess they meant it. The food wasn't bussed for over two hours. It might have been longer but I flew out. The waitress even commented on the filth but nothing was done.\n\n-terrible service. I asked for my check several times and even from another sever. I ended up having to go to the bar and pay. I was never once checked up on either. \n\n-food was bad even for an airport. The marg was meh, but the guacamole was atrocious. It was watery like soup. Ick. \n\nYeah it's the airport but if you find yourself flying southwest plan ahead and avoid this place. \n\nHonestly I regret giving this place a dime.
