Really beautiful venue! My daughter and I came to see the Nutcracker near Christmas time and she loved it! I'm really surprised because this is my second time seeing the nutcracker and I almost fell asleep both times. She on the other hand was on the edge of her seat soaking in the 2 hour ballet. \n\nSome tips: There is plenty of parking, but depending on how far you want to walk, you will probably have to pay. We ended up parking in the $5 lot right across from the theater which was less than a 5 minute walk. \n\nChildren have to be at least 4 to attend.\n\nNo bag check so feel free to bring in your own water because it costs $3 (?) for a bottle of water at the theater.\n\nRules are that you have to speak with a regal English accent when you say \"theater\", and then add a dahhhling if you're a female (or an awesome male).
