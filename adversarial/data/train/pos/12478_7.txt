Debauchery + mayhem = Rehab @ The Hard Rock Hotel. It's sinfully tacky with loads of skin exposure and music in the sun. \nA pool club in the afternoon, is pretty much what it is.\nThe major difference is the almost nudity factor which leads to loaded naughtiness.\n\nI've seen people having sex in the pool!!.\nGirls get in for $20 and rumor has it that guys pay $100.\n\nWhen its just girls, go to the front line of the VIP and pretend to think you're on the list. This was my second time back and never had to wait in line too long. You really should get there no later than 11:00am or the line will be too long.\n\nTheir special Rehab drinks have diet red bull with vodka in a huge plastic cup...and little calories. Afterall, you don't want to have your wobbly fats jigglin around.\n\nThis place is an adults wonderland with near naked bodies, alcohol galore, music, and slides.\n\nMayhem.......debauchery!!!
