Oliver Bath House is a landmark on the South Side.  An oasis of swimming when the Allegheny is frozen and you don't belong to a YMCA or gym (with a pool.)  \n\nThis Institution is part of the Citiparks Program for Pittsburgh.  Conveniently located just over the 10th Street Bridge, minutes from Downtown & Mount Washington.  \n\nThe cost for me to swim and shower on a bone-chilling November day?  $4 !!!!  Well worth the cost of a beer or latte, to swim in warm water and to clean up for a massage later that day in Polish Hill.  There isn't a sauna or steam room, but it was definitely worth it.
