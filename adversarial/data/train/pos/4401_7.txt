This is hands down the worst company I have ever delt with. I have called four locations around Phoenix and nobody has answered the phone.\n\n When you do get someone they are rude and dumber than a box of rocks. It would be less frustrating if they put a deaf dog on the other end of the line. \n\nOur bill started at $45 and is now $110! We only have HBO with basic cable and NO internet. I would of switched to dish or direct TV but my apartment doesn't face the right way.\n\nI could start a cable company out of a card board box and provide a better service to customers. \n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!
