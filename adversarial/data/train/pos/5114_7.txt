What a mess!\n\nShowed up here on a Thursday night starving to see a line practically out the door. As we were waiting to get a table people a few ahead of us were told that they were closing. We looked at our watches and it was about 10 until 9 and they said they closed at 9. You might want to close when you say and not earlier because it almost caused a riot. \n\nWe decided to sit at the bar instead of waiting for the bottom to fall out of the mess at the front. Sat down and the bartender was pretty quick and really personable. He was the best part about this whole place. \n\nFirst let me say that this place is terrible. I went to their website and it was voted 'Best of' for several things that were totally NOT best of anything. Worst of, yes. Best of, stop using that phrase with this restaurant. Does not go.\n\nFirst up was chips and salsa. The salsa really was actually right on. It was fresh and had a nice kick to it, but the chips? They must of run out of their 'best of' chips because these tasted like stale Tostitos. Oh man, stale Tostitos would have been an improvement, actually. \n\nWe then ordered the spicy queso bean dip and instantly regretted it. It was so bland and so un-queso-y that we pushed it away and waited for our entrees. \n\nI ordered vegetable fajitas which you THINK you couldn't mess up. Oh, guess what? Yeah. My friend ordered some shrimp dish that I refused to try so I'm not sure if it was good or not. \n\nI wouldn't eat here again unless the world was wiped out by an atomic bomb and only because the food here would survive.
