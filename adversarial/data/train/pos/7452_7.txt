Seemed fine. A liquor store close to the strip with a nice selection. Even had Tito's Vodka, otherwise known as the greatest vodka on Earth, for around 20. \n\nBonus: Found 5 flavors of Four Loko. Suffice to say, this all amounted to a nice little party in my room. And then my pants! Because I spilled some on myself.
