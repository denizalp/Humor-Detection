4\/11\/10\n\nI've eaten here twice already, and I love this place!  Easily five stars, but a few things keep me from rating so...  One reason is that I'm not that enamored of the vibe here- feels a little too much like a meat market, maybe?  Perhaps the atmosphere's a little too \"dark\" (gloomy\/goth-y)?  Tiny details which, for now, do not prevent me from wanting to go back and try something new from the menu!\n\nOn my first visit (late March\/early April), I sat at the bar and was served by a very patient and helpful bartender whose name now escapes me.  (Sorry!)  However, he did steer me to the right direction on this visit by suggesting I try the Kurobuta Pork Ribs (and on the next visit with the Fried Chicken)!  I thought it funny that one of his pork ribs' selling points was that it was cooked in a sous vide-- sorry I kind of rained on your parade when I knew what a sous vide was.  (Thanks to episodes of Iron Chef America and fellow Yelper Joel L.'s cool blog at onefordinner.com!)  Hey!  You had me at \"no, it doesn't contain mustard.\"  (I asked.)  \n\nWoohoo!  It's been a long time since I had BBQ pork ribs, and this platter was worth waiting for!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=i3AkQGxtvOCETdQWiiPMCw#i3AkQGxtvOCETdQWiiPMCw  Great flavors and fall-off-the-bone tender pork...  The dish is usually paired with fries, but I asked if I could sub coleslaw, instead.  Oh my God, the slaw here is incredible!  (I wish they sold jars of coleslaw to take home.)  Needless to say, I ate the whole thing!  But was I done eating?  No!  I had to have something sweet, so I ordered the Apple Monkey Bread.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=LJSG9mQ0OJ0Hg11nLf_PAg#LJSG9mQ0OJ0Hg11nLf_PAg  Again, another winner!  I would've preferred a higher apple content (and less bread), but that's more of a preference than a fault in execution.  Loved the vanilla bean ice cream pairing, as well!\n\nOn my second visit, I ordered the Fried Chicken, which, according to the menu, comes with a buttermilk biscuit and honey drizzle.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=KVajeeB3_N2SYylwQpxOSQ#KVajeeB3_N2SYylwQpxOSQ  I asked for an extra plate so that I could share the food with Mom.  When the food finally arrived*, we were pleasantly surprised that the kitchen split the food onto two plates for us... so cool!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=C538acZVs3swVhHCQ0vwmA#C538acZVs3swVhHCQ0vwmA\n\nLOVED the fried chicken!  The batter coating treatment was perfect- very light, yet so crispy and not too greasy.  The biscuits were small, but perfect size for the amount of chicken we received.  I would've liked the biscuit to be a little flakier, but other than that, I liked my piece.  I personally loved the honey drizzle on the chicken, but Mom didn't.  (I told her to just take the coating off.  After awhile, I asked her to just give the rest of her chicken!  LOL.)  I really enjoyed what little of the garlic mashed potatoes I tried, and so did Mom!  (Thank goodness the potatoes made the grade with her, because the honeyed chicken didn't, and now I can't get her to go back to CD....)\n\nCannot wait for my next visit!  The prime rib dip and bistro steak are calling my name :)  [I hear from a foodie coworker that the salmon is not bad, either!]\n\n*I wonder how the crusty bread tastes like?  I spied quite a few sitting on a counter on my way back from the restroom.  Haven't tried the bread yet, because CD charges $2 for a serving.  Why charge for table bread?  Does anyone else find this practice off-putting?
