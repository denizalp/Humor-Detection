I grew up in the Valley eating at Pete's Fish n Chips. This place has many similarities to Pete's. They even have their own little secret sauce for your fries like they do. But after eating here, it isn't quite the same. The menu consists of basically over-battered fried food - fish, shrimp, chicken tenders and burgers. The food wasn't bad but the service was. The lady at the window botched my order and blamed me when I returned it to her. I had to laugh because she was watching TV as she was taking orders and I observed most of the staff on their phones while cooking. Oh well. I live in Chandler and was hoping for a version of Pete's close by to occasionally eat at, but it looks like I'll have to drive out to the real one in Phoenix when I have a craving. btw.. they have a drive thru and are cash only.
