Sometimes all a person needs after a difficult gym session is a donut. When that craving takes over, I am not one to turn it down. Instead of going to the big chains, I used the Yelp application to help me find a locally own, small mom and pop type shop. Instead of going to my go to apple fritter, I opted for the chocolate glazed buttermilk donut and a regular chocolate glaze. \n\nI waited to consume them until I walked across to UNLV. Maybe I could give one to my friend and not completely sabotage all my hard work. The longer they sat in my hands, the more I regretted buying them. By the time I sat down, I was dreading my next workout. When I finally broke into the chocolate buttermilk, I was puzzled. It gave way too easily. Then I bite into it and it reminded me of an angel food cake. What the hell was this? The taste of such a decadent treat comes in such a deceiving package. I am not angry that it was not the normal dense cake. Instead I am more angry with how fast I devoured the thing. There was not even an ounce of remorse and no heavy sinking brick lining my stomach. The first was so good, that I could only share half of the second donut. The regular chocolate glaze was fluffy but greasy.
