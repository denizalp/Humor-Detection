Who would have thought that a library could be so much fun?? Well, Kris of course! Great idea for a big event, that was well planned and well executed.\n\nI can confidently say that this is the most stylish library that I've ever been to, and just somewhere I could really see myself enjoying being in. It was fun just checking out the architecture and decor of this place, let alone participating in all of the fun activities that were set up - had a chance to take advantage of the green screen (chose the Harry Potter theme of course!), play the massive light board (was kind of sad to see the happy face we spent so long making get wiped out lol), and of course the robo pong! Only thing I regretted was missing the crafts and 3D printing section - for some reason I missed this :(\n\nAll the fun and games were of course made even better by the assortment of drinks and snacks to try. The Tito's vodka mix and Supermoon cheesecakes left the most lasting impression on me, but it was all good.\n\nGlad I made the trek out to Brampton, and have definitely told others about this library already. Again, great find Kris! Appreciate you and Aisa setting this up!
