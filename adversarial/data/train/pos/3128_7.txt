Where do I begin....\nMy friend and I came for dinner excited to try a new Indian spot. That's where the excitement ends. The staff was sitting in the dining room staring at us the whole time which was really awkward. Particularly the creepy man that went outside and was standing right outside of the window looking in where we were seated. Weird.\nWe ordered chicken tikka masala and aloo gobi to get a feel for the place, in my opinion both dishes are hard to mess up. Our tikka masala tasted like spaghettios and the aloo gobi was in a sweet yellow cream sauce which I have never had served like that before. The naan we got wasn't even naan it was legit the flat bread you get with a gyro. I felt really bad because the chef came out and asked what we thought and I didn't have the heart to say it was by far the worst Indian food I had ever had. We spent probably 15 minutes total there and left as soon as possible.
