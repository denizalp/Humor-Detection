Vegas has a few joints specializing in straight up chicken.. strips?!! After a few drinks and a long ride in from Los Angeles, hunger struck and my sister recommended Raising Cane's.\n\nThe inside has a slight Johnny Rocket's feel to it.. meaning it looks like an old school diner. Outside there's a drive-thru that seemed to always be packed during my last visit, as was the inside. \n\nThe menu was SIMPLE. Combo #1; a few chicken strips, fries, Texas toast and a drink. Combo #2; a few more chicken strips, fries, Texas toast and a larger drink. This was the case for the next two combos. 4 combos total folks. *They also have party platters for larger groups. \n\nStaff was on point; proper organization and communication both in the front and the back. \n\nAs for the food.. The chicken strips are marinated for '24' hours and are not frozen.. so there's none of that freezer burn lingering. They're then breaded and cooked to order.\n\nAs far as taste goes, you can tell the chicken tenderloins used are of a much higher quality than that of your typical fast food spot. There's a salivating juiciness you get from cooking chicken properly too, and each strip here is cooked accordingly. Generously breaded and lightly seasoned, each bite you get a little crunch followed by the natural flavors and juices from the chicken. Complimenting the chicken strips perfectly,  they provide you with a \"Rasing Cane's\" dipping sauce; Perhaps some honey mustard, ketchup and pepper? I'm guessing what's in it, but it was actually a nice little sauce whipped up that complimented the strips just fine. Nothing was over salted, over cooked nor had an odd taste to it. Good stuff. These things would actually go great with a brewskie! \n\nThe prices here are fair and they have good, quality foods. When I'm back in Vegas.. catching a buzz off the strip and am looking for a quick bite, I'll grab some Raising Cane's chicken strips.. no doubt!
