It SHOCKS ME that the OWNER of a business would deliver rude, condescending custmer service and ACCUSE the customer of lying. Even when I delivered proof that HER employee made a mistake and my account was debited in error, the OWNER STILL DID NOT apologize!!! (She did refund me but said \"it's only $20 bucks I am not going to argue with you, mistakes happen!)  A sorry?  NOT.  I DO NOT recommend you do business with Tangible Tanning at 67th & Peoria.  After a fairthful 3 months, I was treated like garbage.
