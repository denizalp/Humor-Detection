I'm a student here currently enrolled this is what I have to say. First of all when I first enrolled it was all great and I was excited\nThen classes began and all went well then almost half way through the course is when things got really unprofessional. There are a couple employees from SWINA that are EXTREMELY RUDE they are a part of student services so you would think they are there to help. Well if it's about reimbursement good luck because when it was time for me to receive I all of a sudden could not get ahold of anyone anymore via email phone calls voicemails personally trying to speak to them became impossible! Not to mention if God forbid you owe them money they will not allow you to attend class and email you none stop to pay them. If you don't pay and you let time go by you will get withdrawn from the program they don't care. The school director is a joke he's disrespectful and clearly hates his job. \nToday they drew the last straw and it is why I decided to leave this here for future swina or swiha students that are enrolled or those who are interested in enrolling. I called swiha to pick up a check I had received a voicemail from the receptionist there(older lady) I won't mention her name. She was BEYOND DISRESPECTFUL she had the audacity to scream at me and hang up all due to bad phone reception something that is out of my control. I called her back and asked why she was yelling at me and once again yelled and was completely rude. I can continue with this but I think I got my point across. I want everyone who is considering this school to think twice please tuition is not cheap there.
