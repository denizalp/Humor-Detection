Amazing!!\n\nI love ice cream amd with the weather being like its been. This was exactly what I needed. \n\nThis place is always packed. But, the staff know what they're doing so you rarely wait. \n\nWe were even able to pick up some treats for our dogs!! They loved it. \n\nIf you're put this way, definitely worth the stop.
