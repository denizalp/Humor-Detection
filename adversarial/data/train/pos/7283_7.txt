Came here after Brattyball because it was across the street and our team had a gift card.\n\nI ordered chips and gauc and Buffalo Salad. \n\nSurprisingly, the guac looked and tasted like it was freshly made to order. I was completely expecting a container of Wholly Guacamole or something but no this was, dare I say it, Chipotle quality?!\n\nOf course there were way more chips than there was guac or the verde salsa that it came with but eh, I'm just so happy the guac was fresh!\n\nThe salad was less exciting, your run-of-the-mill bar salad. Though, it came with micro-greens instead of iceberg lettuce. Touche Coliseum! The chicken tasted and looked to be Sysco-esque with the buffalo sauce clearly an afterthought. \n\nFor $9.29 you can do better with one of their wraps or sandwiches.
