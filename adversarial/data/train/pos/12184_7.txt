I was at the pool hall next door but you can walk freely between the establishments. What first caught my eye was this bunny (blond w nice body, bunny ears and tail) lackadaisically strolling into Gypsy - I saw that there was a plethora or said bunnies in there, and I tried to figure out if this was a club, a bar or a playground for adults. I still do not have the answer. \n\nIt was late, and I was too tired to spelunk down this rabbit hole of intrigue and folly. Maybe I should have followed Alice's example, because unquestionably and with certain I would have found a strange beverage down there that would have pleaded \"drink me\", and I would have foolishly complied. \n\nI will have to put together an expedition and explore this oddity in the heart of downtown Phoenix.
