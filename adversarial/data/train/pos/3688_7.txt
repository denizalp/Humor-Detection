I averaged my rating based on Oct 2012 (5Star) and April 2013 (3.5 Star)\n\nThe Arizona Jazz Festival is one of the nicest\/prettiest music festivals I've attended.  Normally, festivals are held in these huge fair grounds with dirty dust being kicked up everywhere.  But what is so wonderful and nice about the AZ Jazz festival is that it is held on the beautiful grounds of the Historic Wigwam Resort http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-wigwam-litchfield-park#hrid:-Yra83fScX6aPuKW8hLBSQ.  My review in this link tells you how I feel about the Wigwam.\n\nAs for the musical selection at this \"jazz\" festival, it is a common tongue in cheek comment  that this is not a real Jazz festival because the major draws to the event are \"neo-soul\" and \"old school R&B\/Soul\" performers.  A fellow Yelper, Reese J, commented that the festival should be renamed \"Arizona Soul Festival\".   Nevertheless, the fun atmosphere and talented draws are certainly worth the money and time.\n\nSo for a little FYI:  This festival was previously held at the JW Marriott.  This festival is put on every 6 months in October and April.  I attended both the October 2012 and April 2013 events.  \n\nMy friends and I bought hotel packages for each event.  If you live locally and you live out in Mesa, consider it.  The convenience of running to the room at 4pm after sitting in the sun and heat to take a quick shower and change can't be beat.  As well as not having to drive an hour to get home.\n\nAs I stated, I attended Oct 2012 and April 2013.  In Oct 2012, the festival set the bar extremely high.  I sent them feedback and my only \"needs improvement\" comment was \"get an after party\".  Litchfield park has no night life.  Capitalize on that.  They didn't do any better on Friday night in April 2013.\n\nThe lineup in April '13 was far better than Oct '12.  But less Jazzy and more Soul.\n\nSo, in April 2013, all they had to do was maintain the BEAUTIFUL experience I had Oct '12, but they fell short.  here's where I was unhappy.\n\n-The Will Call line \nAWFUL on Friday night.  I missed the entire Will Downing Concert because of it.  Suggestions: Have lines based on last name.  A staff person in the hotel lobby during check-in hours of 3:30 - 5:30 to hand out tickets to hotel pkg people.  Separate Will call for VIP.   \n\n-Drink Tickets!  ANOTHER unnecessary line.\nSuggestions: Presale drink tickets online. And\/OR Use a mobile app so folks can buy the tkts at their seats and get in line to buy drinks. \n\n-OverCrowded!!\nSuggestion: Reduce the Max Capacity.  Get a new, larger Venue.  In October 2012, people danced at their seats as there was more room.  Since we were packed in there, you didn't see that very much.  \n\n-Entrance to Festival Area.  \nlines were long and the VIP line was largely empty.\nSuggestion: Run the entrance like the TSA does the security chk points at the airport.  The TSA person checking the boarding pass\/ID of the 1st class passengers ALSO checks coach-class folks when there is no 1st class person is in line.  Apply that concept here too!  Anyone taking tickets should never be doing nothing (excuse the double negative) when you have a long line.\n\n-Guarantee Event exclusivity \nthe resort members scheduled an event on top of this event.  I can say that many people felt there was some bias there.  I'll leave that comment there.\n\nMy experience in Oct 2012 was extremely pleasant.  I could not imagine a festival being done better.  Apr 2013 was just ok for me.  The AZ Jazz Fest has my support in Oct 2013.  I'm hoping they use a sensible cap this time.  But I'm not sure how I will support this event in Oct 2013.  I'll have to evaluate the pricing and then make my decision.\n\nUpdate:\none thing I forgot to mention: They had more vendors this time around than in Oct 2012.  That may have contributed to the lack of space.  You may like it.  \n\nI also didn't comment that every single act was amazing.  The shows almost always ran exactly on time and finished on time. I especially love that.
