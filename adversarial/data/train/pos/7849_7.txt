Across from the Arts District in Downtown Las Vegas, The Las Vegas Community Healing Garden was constructed in just 4 days where people can pay their respects to the 58 angels God recieved on October 1st. \n\nA \"Tree of Life\" is planted in the center, and the Remembrance Wall is behind it, with photos, messages and mementos for the 58. Surrounding the wall are 58 trees which represents every angel.\n\nWe visited the garden a day after completion and emotions were still running high with sadness, grief, and shock. A man was there offering free hugs, and others were giving out water and snacks.\n\nThank you to the City and County of Las Vegas, and all the volunteers involved in constructing this beautiful park. ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  5
