I was there last week with girlfriends for drinks. The bartenders were condescending and rude throughout our time there.  At approximately 11:30 p.m., they told us we had to leave, so we rushed to finish our wine.  Evidently, the bartender wanted us out faster than were moving and he did everything short of physically pushing us out.  The bartender walked us out of the restaurant and locked the door, with no regard for our safety.  The valet had left and there was no one outside.  We quickly called our Ubers, but then realized that at some point one of us would be left alone.  The first Uber to arrive agreed to give us all a ride and we were safe.    \n\nI've been to the restuarant several times for dinner, but because of this event, I will not be returning.  There are so many other places to go to in Scottsdale.
