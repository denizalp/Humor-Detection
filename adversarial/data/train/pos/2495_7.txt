Dear Envy,\n\nI dream of your filet mignon daily.  And the truffle fries.  If I ever had to choose a last meal, that would be it.\n\nGo here, folks.  You won't be disappointed.  Granted, it's off the strip away from the glitz and glamour of the strip and some of the other steak eateries in Vegas, but it's well worth the trip (and there's never a wait for dinner).  This place has the *best* steaks, and they always come perfectly cooked and prepared.  And don't you dare walk out without trying the truffle fries-- they are worth every calorie.
