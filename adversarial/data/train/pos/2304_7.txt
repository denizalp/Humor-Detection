Wow the food here is disgusting! They served me raw meat and then the manager tried to argue that it was not raw. When there is blood on the plate coming out of the mystery meat (it smelled so bad) how can u tell the customer that their wrong? The customer service and management here is terrible. \n\nI've been to this location several times over the past several years and spent easily hundreds of dollars. I will never go back ever, and would advise anyone that cares about their health to avoid this place. I  ended up with food poisoning after eating only one small bite of the raw meat. They should reimburse me for my urgent care visit!
