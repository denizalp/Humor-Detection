I'm going to be honest when I tell you that I wasn't expecting much from my sweet potato poutine here. First of all, I was not under the influence of any substance before eating my poutine. Everyone(from poutine connoisseurs to your grandma) knows that consuming the combination of fries, gravy and cheese curds can only truly be appreciated after a night of heavy pickling of the liver*. Secondly, I had it as take-out and by the time I got home, the dish was not all too hot. Surprisingly the poutine tasted freaking awesome! All the components just worked. Every bite was sweet and savoury, and full of cheese and gravy. \n\nI'm no expert on the subject of poutine but I put the sweet potato poutine from Stampede's very high on my list of best poutine. \n\nLastly, I did not try the burgers here yet. I know it's strange to not review the house specialty but I just didn't want a sandwich at the moment. Although, if the poutine here was that good, I'm pretty sure the burgers here are out of this world!\n\n*This reason is why so many of our neighbours to the south never \"get\" why we love poutine so much, since when they try it, they usually are sober tourist eating poutine for the novelty of it instead of eating eat to soak up all the alcohol in the body.
