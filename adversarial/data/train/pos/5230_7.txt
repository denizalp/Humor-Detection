First let me say that the massage itself was wonderful. \n\nHowever, the management side of absolutely disgraceful !!! \n\nI provided my gift certificate to the front desk employee where she had over 20 minutes to review and verify my gift certificate that my husband purchased for me for Christmas. I enjoyed my massage and when I was finished and checked out I was told that my gift certificate was invalid. \n\nIn the end, I was forced to pay full price. I have never been treated this terribly by a massage spa in my life! \n\nNow I have paid twice for 1 massage. Management took absolutely no responsibility for any kind of mistake. This establishment is nothing more than a scam and treats you even worse. I absolutely would not recommend this establishment, if you could even describe it as such. I will never return and certainly not recommend it to anyone! I can only hope that their wonderful massage therapist, Robbie, isn't treated the way I was.
