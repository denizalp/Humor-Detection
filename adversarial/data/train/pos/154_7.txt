Hidden away in the plaza in front of Vaughan Mills, our little group ventured out to try a new place, for some of us completely different. Well maybe not completely different as some dishes are similar to other middle eastern fare. \n\nWe let our more experienced friend with guidance of our waiter place the order, and were happy we did so, as we didn't know much about Moroccan cuisine. The meal started with pita chips with a dip. I don't know the dishes by name, but everything was great, the chicken was juicy and the quail was flavourful, the spicy dish wasn't overly spicy at all.  The dishes recommended by our friend and the waiter really complimented each other, with a beef dish, lamb, chicken and quail dishes and vegetable dishes and a full array of different levels of spice and flavour. \n\nOur server was friendly and had a good grasp of the menu and the cuisine as a whole. He was able to answer all our questions and then some. He also had a good sense of humour, which really added to our experience. \n\nI'm happy that we were able to get together with some good friends and have a wonderful Moroccan meal, and close to home, we'll definitely be coming back after we save up a little as the prices were a bit on the high side and the portions weren't as big as one would hope to match those prices.
