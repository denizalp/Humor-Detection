Looking for food late night after running around Downtown, this is your spot. But if you're looking for amazing food, look elsewhere. \n\nFor years I've heard about the oxtail soup (served 11pm-9am) and how great it is. Well, it's not. Not even close. Wasn't tender at all. I had to pry at it with my fork to get it off the bone. Heck, I make a better oxtail soup than that! I was pretty bummed since I was really looking forward to it. And not only that, the rice was really dry too. Come on, man. Maybe it was an off night since it was busy but consistency is key, right? \n\nYeah I get it, it's late night so most people don't really care about the quality of food they just want something to fill them up. But I'm not most people so...\n\nPoints for having an extensive menu and being open late (and early obviously). The Philippine breakfast was good, so there's that. But the service kinda sucks. The wait isn't too long considering how busy it is. But once seated, you have to flag down your server for everything otherwise they won't come back to your table other than to bring your check. Not sure what all the fuss is about. Sorry fellow ninth islanders. This place just didn't do it for me.
