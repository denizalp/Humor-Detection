Great for seafood lovers and non-seafood lovers alike (but more for seafood lovers)! This location is just south of Yonge and Finch and gets very busy. Avoid coming at peak times, unless you want to wait 20-40 minutes - and there is no waiting area, so you'll either have to wait outside or inside the korean supermarket next door. Each table comes with a bib for everyone (wear it), plastic gloves (wear it), and a paper towel roll. It's kind of gross when you see the paper towel roll with sauce all over the top or bottom from the previous diners. There are TVs to watch the local game or news and I really enjoy the R&B music in the background.\n\nIn comparison to similar restaurants in Toronto and Chicago, I would rate this better because: 1) it's slightly cheaper; and 2) flavour is better. Be warned, theres a huge spice difference between mild and medium. As sad as this sounds, I actually like their chicken tenders and fries the most here. Portions are massive and fries are crispy on the outside but tender on the inside. You can ask for fries to be cajun or regular.\n\nMy only suggestion to this business is PLEASE invest in reusable dinnerware! It kills me (and the environment) to see all water\/pop\/drinks being poured in disposable cups to everyone every time we go.. And whenever we order rice, it's served in a disposable styrofoam cup too! AH!
