This place has all the amazing potential in the world. It's a cool concept and I certainly appreciate the plethora of vegetarian and vegan options they have available, but I gotta say: bland, boring, blah.\n\nThe hummus was good, but certainly not the \"best in the valley\" as our waiter purported. I ended up adding salt.\n\nMy \"LTL\" (veggie version of the BLT) was very bland. I added salt and that didn't even help. My bread was slightly burned and the potato hash that they gave as a side was cold, limp and you could tell it was burned during the cooking process.\n\nThe vegan pizza was also pretty boring. It was a combo of olive oil and red sauce. They could have spruced it up with some spices and made it really flavorful, but it definitely left me wanting for more.\n\nI appreciate the charcoal water filtration system that helps eliminate \"water bottle waste\" but I don't know that charging $2 for the table is necessary.\n\nThe honey lemonade was good but gave me a tummy ache, and the nojito just had way too much going on (honey, lime, ginger, soda water, etc).\n\nOur service was good, if not a little overbearing, otherwise I would give this place 2 stars. The food is boring and extremely overpriced. Our casual lunch turned into $50, and there was no alcohol involved.\n\nI am all for health and I support the cause, but they really need to do something about the taste of the dishes.
