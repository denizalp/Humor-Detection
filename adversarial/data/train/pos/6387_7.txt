SLS sent us a voucher for 2 complimentary entrees, dine in only. It's completely free? Sure, why not? We got nothing to lose. So my boyfriend and I had dinner here on a Monday night.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Chicken Milanese-lightly breaded & pan friend chicken breast with garlic toasted kale. He said the chicken was way too thick....and dried. He enjoyed his kale so much better.\n\nI was in the mood for pasta so I ordered the Whole Wheat Penne Primavera-zucchini, onions, roasted tomatoes, broccolini and roasted garlic. I requested to add grill chicken to it but they forgot. -__- oh well. This pasta had absolutely NO TASTE. Without sprinkling a bunch of black peppers and red pepper flakes, I probably wouldn't eat more than 5 bites. Heck, the roasted tomatoes and my garlic bread tasted better than the entire entrée!!!!!!! \nWhen you enjoy your sides more than your main entrée, there's a problem here.\n\nAlso, my boyfriend wanted to order house wines and they didn't even have the main ones available....like chardonnays, merlot, pinot, etc. He wasn't too pleased with that.\n\nDisappointing restaurant. Never tried The Griddle Café when it was still here but I'm sure their food tasted better than THIS.
