Very nice and clean. Staff is ver friendly. Very reasonably priced. I did not give them 5 stars for 2 reasons. I missed not having a pedicure chair with a whirlpool. You sit on a bench that has a massaging pad on it. Mine didn't work but I doubt I would have used it. I could've done without the added fruit\/flowers in the water. Nor sure where they are getting this from. Doubt if its fresh fruit, that would be a waste. I had Patrick do my pedicure. He did.a fairly good job. Massage was great but the polish application had a little to be desired. He didn't touch up the edges so that was a negative. Both big toes had polish on the skin along the edges. I didnt notice till I got home or I would've said something.\nNot sure if I will go back. I really missed the whirlpool tubs.
