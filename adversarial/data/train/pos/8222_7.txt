I've eaten a lot of Thai food and Nikky's did not disappoint! From the elegant decor and atmosphere to the cocktails and absolutely delicious food, Nikky's delivered and I can't wait to eat here again. \n\nWe started with the Crab Rangoon which was delicious as long as you like cream cheese which I do. Also, the coconut Mojito was delightful! A little pricey at $10 but definitely a good Mojito and I really wanted two! My favorite Thai entree is always red curry with tofu and extra vegetables. My request was accommodated with a few extra dollars for the extra veggies. Spice level is 3-10. Three here is basically not spicy at all. I've had up to 7 which was spicy but not too spicy for me (I like medium spice level usually). Food is served in fun \"gold\" dishes and flatware. I LOVE coconut rice. It might sound weird to those who haven't had it but you must try it once! I haven't had it with the mango here, only the ice cream which is amazing! \n\nStaff had always been polite and service quick even when they are busy. Prices about $10-15 per entree. Parking is on the street or nearby lots. \n\nCan't want to eat here again!
