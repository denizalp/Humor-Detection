Do not use this company for termite control. While drilling into our garage foundation their tech hit a water line and flooded our bathroom and master closet.  Management claimed they weren't responsible but finally agreed to pay the plumber when I stopped the check. Shortly after, all the concrete patches in the garage and on the patio fell out and guess what? A year later we still have termites.
