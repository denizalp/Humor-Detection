I'v been to Giuseppe's a couple times, and the food is very reasonably priced considering its quality and authenticity.  Giuseppe is a \"hands on\" restaurateur and definitely knows his wine as well as his Italian.\n\nEverything here is amazing - in particular the Veal Osso Buco and the Squid Ink pasta - but you won't go wrong no matter what you choose.  This place also has the best Tiramisu I've ever tried.  \n\nAlready looking forward to my next visit.
