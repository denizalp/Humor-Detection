Great place for an inexpensive quick bite. Located at Caesars Palace forum food court. Different $ options such as Smashburger, Difari Pizza, Phillips Seafood Express, Earl of Sandwich, Tiger Wok & Ramen, La Gloria Mexican, & Romaine Empire (create your own salad). \n\nGreat for people staying at the hotel because its inexpensive (compared to Vegas prices) & open until 11pm. Most of the restaurants in Caesars are upscale so this is an affordable alternative. \n\nI had the Holiday Turkey: wheat hoagie w\/ turkey, dressing, & cranberry sauce. Also had broccoli cheddar soup. Tasty.
