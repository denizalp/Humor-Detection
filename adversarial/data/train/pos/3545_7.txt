I would only go to this show if you're a HUGE fan of the Beatles.  The acrobatics of Cirque du Soleil is not the main feature and there are no live vocal performances.  The visuals are stunning but without substance.  The entire thing was like a plotless film set against a Beatles-only soundtrack with people jumping around.  Maybe not unlike that 2007 movie, Across the Universe.
