I love this place even though I've been getting nothing but the chicken plates and only been here twice they seem to always satisfy me. My personal favorites by far is the Ono and Garlic Chicken. If it were my decision, I would rename the Ono Chicken to Oyea Chicken lol. The owners are nice and always recommend a variety of plates to me. They maintain very clean tables and have a 50 inch TV to watch the big games while you grub. Prices are fair compared to the quality of the food you receive. Whenever I'm hungry and in the area I'll be sure to stop by here for more off their menu.
