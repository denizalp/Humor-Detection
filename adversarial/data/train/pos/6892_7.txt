Used my @CorbinsBarGrill @GrouponPhoenix today.\n\nJasmine was our server, and was also tending bar. She was quite distracted. I don't think it was entirely her fault, but the service was less than what I would have expected.\n\nMom had a cheese crisp with grilled chicken and ancho chiles.\n\nThe girls and I had clam chowder, and pesto cheese bread.\n\nLOTS of potatoes in the chowder, a decent amount of cheese on the bread.\n\nCountry music on the radio was ideal for me.\n\nI like Corbin's, and I'll be back again.
