I really wanted to write a fantastic review on this place.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  \n\nWe arrived on a Monday at 1.  The hostesses were great... it was down hill from here...\n\nOur waitress was slow... never really around... we looked around and it really was not that busy.  Our appetizer came out with our food :(  Nothing like dropping 18 dollars on the chef's cheese\/meat plater to rush eating it in order to avoid a cold pizza.  Several olives fell off the plater due to the waitress being bumped by a co-worker. Her comment was \"oh it was just a few that fell\" - We assumed she would bring us back more olives... this never happened. :( \n\nLets talk about the pizza... aside the crust... it was awful.  It was the most flavorless margarita pizza I ever had.  It tasted as if a can of tomato sauce was poured on the dough and cheese and tomato added... extremely acidic and tart.\n\nWe also had to wait patiently... and I mean wait...  to ask for plates for our appetizer and pizza.  One Yelper wrote about the avoided eye contact - the entire wait staff has this.  It was as if they were afraid to help each other out.  Zero team effort.  So simple request like, \"may I have a plate for my food\" will go unanswered until your assigned waitress makes her way to you. :( \n\nI'm going out on a limb of fairness... but maybe some of the entrees are better.  Regardless we will not be back.
