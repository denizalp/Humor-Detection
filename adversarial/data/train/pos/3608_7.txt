Great place to get a viral infection, and even better for repeated viral infections with a side of strep. Deceptive marketing, ambiguous contract\/billing protocols, and unsafe kids area (specifically regarding check-in and out).  Also, the older kids run wild without any controls, often allowed to hit the smaller kids. If you want your kids toughened up the old fashioned way...LVAC on Eastern is your place.
