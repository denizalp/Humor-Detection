Full disclosure: I've worked with the fine folks at Creeds on an evening event before, when they transform into, well, whatever you want them to be. But, I've been back recently to work in their beautiful coffee shop, and I wanted to share my experience.\n\nIncredibly friendly staff, great lattes, kombucha on tap (what!) and beautiful communal and personal tables. If you're a remote employee or wear dem freelance pants, this is definitely a spot you should become acquainted with.
