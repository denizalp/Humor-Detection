As an Oregonian, I had yet to experience the wonder of In-N-Out Burger until 2 weeks ago, when I went down there for the classic car auctions. Let me tell you, the food was worthy of the hype it gets. Now I know I might get killed for saying this, but I got mine without the sauce. I'm not a big mayo or secret sauce fan, so there. But, I did get one animal style, and it was amazing. One key to the great taste is they grill their buns. Another is that their menu is simple, and they don't deviate from the best tasting menu items. \n\nThe only problem I have with this place is their T-Shirts. They have a Barracuda on it with a 389 emblem on it. WTF is that about!? That made me mad, because no Barracuda has a 389 in it, let alone an emblem on the side. Minor gripe, and not enough to take it down a point. Definitely check this place out if you are in AZ. It is everything it was built up to be.
