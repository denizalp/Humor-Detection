Sam and Mike are very reasonable and friendly people, it's a family run operation which always makes me feel a little more comfortable. Their mechanic shop is also very reasonably priced and has always done good work for me. Their cars are very clean and in good shape which isn't always the case at some other dealers nearby. Unfortunately I wasn't able to purchase my car from them but i definitely appreciate how honest and straight forward they were with me.
