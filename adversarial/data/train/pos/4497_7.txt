Authentic Punjabi food and great service. The spice level is a bit toned down - I ordered a 10 (highest) and got what I would call medium hot. But they got me a bowl of green chillies so it was all good. Try this place for sure. \nBTW - I ordered the non-veg thali\nI'm modifying the review because the last time I was here the food sucked.  The service was still great and they switched out a dish for us but the overall food quality was lacking.  I'm guessing only the Thalis here are good as a person in our group ordered one of those and it was good
