Oh snaaap. If you wanna feel like Sharon Stone in 'Casino' circa 1975, then put on that sparkly silver dress and get your ass to the Fireside Lounge. While so many places in Vegas are trying to go old school back to Sinatra in the 50s, Peppermill boldly stays in the 70's...tacky floral uniforms and all.\n\nThe restaurant part is okay, but lounge is where it's at. Sitting around the water\/fire pit on those cheese plush couches makes you wonder why disco ever ended. ...well, other than the million obvious reasons, but the cheesy throwback amazingness of this place can't be beat.
