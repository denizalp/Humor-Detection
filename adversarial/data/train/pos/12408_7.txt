So yeah. I have officially packed on some weight. I'm super bummed too, because I am usually able to maintain my weight fairly easily without serious dieting and the like. As long as I work out regularly and don't eat doughnuts everyday, I'm good.\n\nAlas, while I was out of work, I had nothing but time on my hands. Between looking for a job, I was usually cooking (one of my fave things to do), and then eating all the crap I just cooked. Hmmph.\n\nAnyway, I have come here in search of my figure. I just might be able to find it again. You know why? One word. STAIRMASTER!!!\n\nI was pretty stoked to see that they had not one, but TWO of 'em here! Those things are awesome. If you have never used one, I highly recommend trying it. Even just ten minutes on that thing at a medium pace will have your glutes and quads crying out for mercy.\n\nThis location also has a Zumba class, which I really want to try but I am waiting for someone to invite me, cuz I will feel weird just walking up in there all like, \"SUP FOOS?\". I'm socially awkward like that.\n\nThe major thing I don't like about this place is that they have no \"rest\" area. Like, no place to stop and take off your shoes and crap. Well, there is one stool. And they have reeeaaaaly small cubbies, so there's not much room to store your stuff. They do have a nice stretch area though.
