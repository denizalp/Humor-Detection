This place is bad. BAD!\n\nI went for a cheaper hotel in Phoenix, since it was going to be a quick trip. But $65\/night in Phoenix should have gone further. I also am a Wyndham Rewards member, and wanted to rack up loyalty points... I don't know if I will ever bother staying at a Days Inn ever again.\n\n1) Welcome to the ghetto. It is seriously surrounded by project-style tenements. Blue Moon Nude dancers, a window-less brick building is across the street. I am pretty sure someone rented a room here on an hourly rate, as I was awoken to LOUD sex from 5-6 AM coming from the room next door, who checked in at 4:45 and checked out at 6:05. Wham bam thank you madam...\n\n2) The airport shuttle is slow.\n\n3) The continental breakfast is a joke.\n\n4) The staff is not friendly.\n\n5) The room stank of cigarette smoke - it was suppose to be non-smoking. The bathrooms were nasty. And there was a wet spot on the carpet. I also found a ridiculous love letter someone had left behind... And while that was incredibly amusing, the fact that the cleaning staff had missed it spoke volumes about their attention to detail.\n\nDon't do it, unless you are DESPERATE!
