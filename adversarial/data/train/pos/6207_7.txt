It was worth every last single penny I spent!!!\n\nI know this is a tad dramatic, or maybe I had too many cocktails, but by the end of the night, I was singing and dancing in my seat because I was food drunk.  It was a religious experience. My group actually shut the restaurant down.  \n\nThe lobster poutine lives up to its reptutation.  The scallops with gnocchi almost made me cry.  I couldn't even completely get my bite of spare ribs past my lips before I threw the fork down in disbelief that anything could taste that good.  Don't even get me started on our seafood platter that we started with, complete with raw oysters, scallops, king crab and shrimp.  \n\nI'm not ashamed to say that I went to sleep in a food drunken haze with delightful images of our lovely hostest Maud, the apple-cherry crumble, and the dimly-lit wooden ambience that hugged me up.\n\nI salute you!
