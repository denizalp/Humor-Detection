This was my first stay at Las Vegas and this hotel did everything wonderful to make me have an amazing time and stay. The rooms essentially look brand new, maybe it is brand new after reading all of the other reviews. All of the other popular casinos are right next it so the walk in the desert heat is not as bad as it could be.\n\nOther awesome stuff I can think of: free parking, expensive food service (don't use it trust me), two pools (4th and 14th floor).\n\nThe Marquee dayclub\/nightclub is great as well. You can get a table at a discount if you book a room with this hotel. Only special offer I took advantage of during my stay.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this hotel for your Vegas stay.
