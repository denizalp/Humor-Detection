Great items. Great prices. Came in here to buy a few things. Wouldn't accept a roll of $5 dimes. Rolled or unrolled. They should accept all legal tender. Won't come here again just because if this. Shame, Asian lady said she can't accept it and blamed it on the register being off at the end of the night. Excuses.
