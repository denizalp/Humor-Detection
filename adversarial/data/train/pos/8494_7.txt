Oh where to start.... my visit with this restaurant was such a disappointment and embarrassment to me and the girls. We sent back almost every dish that was brought out to us. We started with chips and salsa a staple item to all mexican restaurants my friends ordered the guacamole and asked for it mild. The guacamole was excellent, spicy but oh so good. My friend sent it back it was too spicy. I had ordered Carnitas tacos which my server made a suggestion n the Cochinitas which are yucatan flavored pork with marinated onions he swore I would prefers these so I took his recommendation and ordered them they were brought out and Oh Hell no! they were awful I asked for the original order of carnitas and ugh! when they were brought out they were dripping with grease. I could not eat them. So I sat and ate chips and thought gosh I am getting pretty full..off these...chips...
