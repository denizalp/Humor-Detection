I had a very unpleasant experience at Advanced Aesthetics Med Spa and would not recommend getting Dysport injections from Mary.  When things go well you will love her, but when things go wrong you will find yourself in a nightmare.  On my last visit she injected my face unevenly so that one eyebrow was arched and the other was not.  The day after my injection I called with concern and Mary's assistant, Kalani, was very rude on the phone and offered no customer service.  I was simply told that Mary would not touch me for a week.  I understand that Dysport takes time to work, however as a customer with a concern, I felt like the door had been slammed shut and the only option was to wait one week to even be seen by Mary.  It was a long week feeling like I looked utterly ridiculous.  \n\nI waited a week and at my follow-up appointment I was greeted (or should I say not greeted at all) by a very rude Mary who was hell bent to teach me a lesson for even suggesting that she may have missed a spot during my initial injection.  She made me wait 30 minutes despite being on time for my appointment.  She was aggressive, argumentative and in the end said she would inject me again to give arch to the eyebrow that was flat.  While she did stick me with a needle twice, I do not believe that she injected me with anything at all.  This is a deceptive woman who would not admit to her error and then only pretended to fix it with an empty injection.  Buyer beware.
