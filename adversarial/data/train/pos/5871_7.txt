This might be the oldest and cheapest of all the Cirque du Soleil shows on the Las Vegas Strip, but its still amazing and dazzling.  The incredible acrobatic stunts and mesmerizing visual images you'll see are the stuff that dreams are made of.  I saw this 10 years ago, but it was still seemed brand new and fantastic. \n\nBest of all, tickets can be had for as low as $40(except for those damn service fees and taxes), and the theater is small enough that just about every seat is a great seat.
