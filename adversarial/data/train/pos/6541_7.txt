Dined here with 3 other people. No one was happy.\nWaitress was clueless (new and untrained?) she wasn't sure what soda they offered. She brought the drinks about 10 minutes after we ordered them, saying \"sorry I was looking for cups\"\nMy lemon on my water smelled like dirty kitchen rag. \nFries were nice and thick, but dry and soggy. Corned beef was hideous, very tough and rubbery. I sent it back for a fish and chips plate that was similar to what I get at CoCo's, but with the big soggy sponge fries.\nHighlight of the dinner, the company and my beer.\nWe will never come back, unless it's only for drinks.
