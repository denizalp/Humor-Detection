I guess I must be old school but when I go to a club I go to dance, not to pay a ridiculous amount of money to sit in 'VIP', get bottle service, and dance around my table with the same people I came to the club with.  So I gave this place two stars for those who want to feel special and get a table.  You can stop reading this review and go to this place if that's what you're looking for.  If you want to dance, here's the 411.  We stayed at the Mandalay Bay and were looking for a Hip Hop club.  There wasn't one there so we heard Luxor had one.  The music sounded good from the outside so I didn't mind paying $50 for me and $30 for the wife to get in.  But once we got in I realized I made a mistake.  I guess it's because I'm a Californian but I would like to think I know what a good club is and this isn't one.  The main floor is roped off to give those who pay for a table 10 extra feet of room while leaving the cheapies (like me) with no room to dance.  This left a very narrow path down the middle of the club which is meant to serve as the minuscule dance floor and walkway.  The layout could be more conducive to dancing but since this club wants to focus on bottle service don't bother coming here if you just want to dance.  And the music: what I thought was good hip hop on the outside turned out to be poorly mixed music.  The DJ kept having a lull from one song to the next leaving an awkward pause between tracks.  This caused the crowd to stand around in between songs because he couldn't mix the music correctly.  Anyways... If you want to pay extra money to make yourself feel special then come here.  If you are trying to bump and grind find another spot and save yourself the money.
