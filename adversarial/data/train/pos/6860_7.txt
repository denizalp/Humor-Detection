Quite the attraction notwithstanding location. \n\nWe were hungry and my feet were starting to bother me so we headed up to the escalator for some fish tacos.\n\nThe menu was full of choices for burritos, enchiladas, and of course tacos.  I still asked the waiter if he would not mind changing it up for me for some grilled mahi mahi vs. fried fish tacos. I also asked him if they would put it on corn tortillas instead of flour. He most graciously said yes!  The fish was fine, and they put some sort of coleslaw on top, black beans with cojita type cheese on the side (yay no yellow cheese on anything) and the gratuitious orange colored rice. \n\nYou get green and red salsa with chips. The salsas did have some nice flavor\/spice to them.\n\nThe menu also had some fun foo foo drinks but we were slowing down a little and ordered ourselves some coronoas instead.\n\nPrices were reasonable as well. \n\nTit for tat it was a decent enough place for the neighborhood.
