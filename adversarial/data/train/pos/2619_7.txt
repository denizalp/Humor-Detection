I had the pleasure of dinning here with my family. We were greeted with smiles  as we entered this chic restaurant. What a great atmosphere in the heart of Tivoli village. We enjoyed an array of appetizers which put a smile on all of our faces. Their Sake Sangria was refreshing but be careful because it sneaks up on you. I would definitely suggest the Quinoa Fried Rice and Mac & Cheese. Everything was unique and service was fantastic. I can't wait to go back!
