I've been here before, but I had never tried their Flipp'n burger, and it was time (first anniversary since they opened). There was SO MUCH juicy goodness dripping from it that the mess would've run down my arms if I wasn't careful. Wasn't sure I could finish it, either, but I managed to, with a huge pile of toppings, a side of yam fries, and a shake (chocolate). You can pay a lot more for a fancy burger in an upscale restaurant, but I'm not sure it would taste better than this Flipp'n masterpiece.
