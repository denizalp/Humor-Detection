I'm not usually one to eat at places such as El Pollo Loco.. Especially with my eating habits and their lack of options for me. Anyways.. my coworker and I stopped by for lunch (because it's close to work and I was out of time). I got a $5 bowl (just beans and rice), which tasted fine, for the most part, she got the street tacos.\n \nThey gave us some salsa with our order: 2 red, 2 green.. The green was tasty but the red on the other hand I'm sure was rotten.. The containers with the red salsa in them were bloated and ready to explode, which led me to believe they were no good. Sure enough, they exploded upon opening and the smell was awful and so very sour. It was disgusting. Definitely threw those away!\n\nNeedless to say, my stomach and my coworkers stomach is upset, 3 hours after consuming less than half of our food. My food had pico de gallo on it, so due to the way I feel, I'm guessing the tomatoes in the pico were bad as well. \n\nGuess that's why I choose NOT to go here normally.. of course the one time I do, I get sick. Thanks, crazy chicken. You can keep your rotten tomatoes and sour salsa, jerks.
