OMG, I am delirious.   This event was right up my alley, all the sweetness and carbs necessary to put me on a comma.  LGO went all out and provided FULL SIZE items.  The cookies were gigantic.  Since my hubby was sent away on business, I asked my friend Maryanne to come with me.  I am so glad,  because we shared the items we sampled.  I couldn't possibly sample as much.  I loved  one of the cakes that had the peaches on top, so moist and delicious.  The cookies were great, but what amazed us the most was the home made english muffins, OMG, they are so delicious.  My friend ended up buying some to take home to her family.  The gelato sampling was awesome, I loved, loved, loved the peach sorbetto, so refreshing.  The mint, chocolate chip was great, also.  I could taste the fresh specs of mint.  My friend gave me a great idea for the twins birthday.  I am going to have LGO cater an ice cream social for us.  Hopefully they can make the cookies a little smaller.  They can make any flavor ice cream you want  as long as you order at least a gallon, which is going to be easy, most of my twins' guests come in pairs, so the number is pretty high.  \nThank you, Lindsey for setting this amazing event up and of course all the people from LGO who were so gracious and informative.
