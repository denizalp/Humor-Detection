Went to the one in Brampton, but it's not on Yelp, so I'll review it here.\n Like most fried chicken places, this joint is seriously overpriced, but I went on a \"Customer Appreciation Day\" and they had a great deal: 7 or 8 pieces for $8.99, as I recall.\n It was 11.30 and the place was already filling up with kids from the local high school, but there were plenty of staff and the service was friendly and prompt.\n My wife and I got two orders, one spicy and one regular; it was freshly fried and piping hot.\n We had planned to take it home for supper, but we decided to \"try some\" in the car...\nsix pieces later we looked at each other and agreed: \"Best fried chicken, ever!\"\n It was crispy, hot, flavourful, spicy and juicy. I don't think I'll ever go near KFC again, and at that price it put Popeye's to shame.\n We ended up getting another two orders. That was about 30 pieces of fried chicken for under $40...an unheard of value, in my experience. It was enough chicken for about four more meals for the two of us over the next three days.\n If that chicken was that price on a regular basis, I'd have to be rolled out of the basement to take my dog for a walk. Luckily [?], that price was a \"one off\", but if you want to try some fine fried chicken, here's the place to go.
