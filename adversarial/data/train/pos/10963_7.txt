Un.Be.Lievable. Wow. I am almost at a loss for words to describe how amazing this show is. \n\nFirst off, the venue. Perfect size intimate theater, not a bad seat in the house. We were in row M, felt like eye level with Garth. \n\nSecond, a legend and his acoustic guitar. That is all. Some lights and a little fog, but what more could you ask for. An inviting, humorous look at the musical influences and personal stories that shaped a Country Music legend. I lost track of time, but I think there were about 90 minutes of pure Garth bliss. Garth is an amazing story teller, vocalist and song writer. If you love music, and not just Country music, and you appreciate the artistry of music, song writing and performance, or if you just LOVE GARTH BROOKS, this show will enrapture you and draw you in. I couldn't blink.\n\nI never had the fortune of seeing Garth Brooks perform live before he \"retired.\" I'm so glad I had this opportunity to see him. It was a once in a life time experience. Hands down the best show I've ever seen. Worth every penny and I will now start saving to take my parents. They need to see this too.\n\nNote to future show attendees: Turn off your phone. Just do it. We all paid a pretty penny for an experience that should not be ruined because you think you are too cool. The world can wait 90 minutes. Second: Shut up. Small venue means your voice travels further than you think. Whatever earth shattering things you have to say can wait, it's probably useless chatter anyway, don't ruin the experience for the people around you.\n\nSEE THIS SHOW! You won't be disappointed.
