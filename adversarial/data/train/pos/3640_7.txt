This Mountain has been a great backup plan since Camelback Mountain is closed until the end of Fall. I know, how lame of CAMELBACK!! :(\nBut honestly, this Mountain does the job. It's tranquil and beautiful. It's a great place to get away from it all and just relax with a walk around and up the Mountain, or even a nice jog. The only thing I do want to warn you about is snakes. BE CAREFUL, we came across a striped orange and black snake, nothing too scary looking, more of a cute, large colorful reptile. But still, watch out and bring water bottles since its slowly starting to heat up out there!!! \nOh and I can't wait to try out the bike trails!! FUN!!!
