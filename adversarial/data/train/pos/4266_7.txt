I spent a long time going back and forth before settling on my final review.  I brought in my ipod for a simple repair.  The storefront is really nice and the staff were all super friendly.  I felt very comfortable having them complete the repairs.  However, the repairs ended up taking weeks.  They ordered the wrong battery and then it took a week and a half for the new battery to come in.  I suspect that they chose to cut their losses by ordering the second battery from the cheapest, slowest vendor.  In the end, the repairs were done properly and my ipod is like new.  However, in all of the back-and-forth with them, I came to lack confidence in their expertise.  So, the repair ended up fine, but I would not return, especially for something that I really care about, like my iphone or computer.  My star rating reflects the likelihood that I would return, given my experience.
