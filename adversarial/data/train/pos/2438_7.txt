We live a mile from Inyo so a couple of days ago I decided that lunch was in order and as I work from home, I zoomed over to Inyo. They had just posted that great photo of the brussels sprouts and I was dreaming about them.\nI picked up the sprouts and an order of the nifty red curry shrimp. In about ten minutes I was in paradise- flavorful does not describe this meal. My dear husband was respectfully sharing and also was impressed.\nStill my favorite artistry. Go Inyo. Cannot wait to return!!
