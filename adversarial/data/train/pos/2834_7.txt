I don't have a German car, but Robbie\/Rabih came out to change a flat tire for me as a provider for the roadside assistance I have through my insurance. HE WAS WONDERFUL! He was there in less than 20 minutes, changed the tire in no time, and was super personable and kind as well. \n\nI will share this will all my friends who drive German cars...this guy is legit!
