I love this place. The ambiance, the lighting, the rock music, the sexy bartenders, the go go dancers in the walls.\n\nWe stumbled into here after a Yelp elite event, so it was a great time to get wasted with some of the coolest Yelpers.  They have very good seating options with the lounge in the back., We quickly invaded it, but there tall tall tables along the side and bar seating. The dance floor is tiny, but this isn't really a dance club.\n\nThe only knock are the prices, $8.50 for beers and a lot of money for shots. It's a great lounge for groups of 4 people, but can accommodate for larger parties.
