Tonight I ordered some food from Brooklyn V's. When the food arrived they packed it all into a pizza box to hold the individual containers. Along with the food was a fairly large roach dead in the box. \n\nWhen I called the restaurant they did not sound surprised nor did they even bother to apologize. I have to think that this says they have some sort of problem over there.
