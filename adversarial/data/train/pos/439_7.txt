Horrible experience with this guy. Gave me surgery on both shoulders, said he had no idea where I should go for physical therapy, there for I had to go through about 10 different PTs to find one that cared. Both labrum pairs failed, thank you for not caring and making the last 2 years of my life miserable Dr. Zeman.
