I love being in downtown Tempe, so when I got a SpaFinder gift card for Christmas from my boyfriend, I knew I wanted to use it at Mood Swings. Mood Swings has a fun, trendy salon atmosphere, but everyone is really nice and not pretentious at all.\n\nMy first experience was getting a 60 min. massage, which felt so good! The spa downstairs was very quiet and I forget that I was in downtown Tempe. Before the massage they had me fill out a questionnaire that asked me if I had a stressful job, if there were any areas that were bothering me, etc...which I'd never had before when I got a massage and helped them get to know me better.\n\nI returned to Mood Swings when I needed of a haircut and highlights touch-up. I usually go to a beauty school, but I had a sketchy experience last time that made me want to try somewhere new. I was not disappointed! The salon upstairs made me feel really comfortable and my hair stylist, Brittany, did a great job and I have no complaints! I'll definitely return.\n\nThey also have a great email program, where they send out last minute appointments they are trying to fill (and you get a discount!) and surveys that also have discounts upon completion.  They really do follow up and ensure that your experience is as good as possible.
