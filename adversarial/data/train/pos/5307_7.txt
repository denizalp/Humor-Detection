Ways that the Salt Lick in Vegas (Red Rock) IS like the Salt Lick in Driftwood:\n\n* It's delicious\n* It's messy\n* You eat on wooden tables\n* The desserts are good\n* The sides are good\n* The sausage is wonderful\n* The people cutting the meat have big huge knives\n* It's best with a big group of people\n* You have to drive a long way to get there, as it's pretty much out in the middle of nowhere. \n* Big fat slices of white bread\n* You eat so much you could just die!\n\nWays that the Salt Lick in Vegas IS NOT like the Salt Lick in Driftwood:\n* It's inside a building with A\/C and everything!\n* You have to pass by slot machines to go to the bathroom\n* They serve alcohol!! (including Tito's and Shiner--hello!)\n* It 's easy to get drunk since you didn't have to bring your own drinks!\n* You can take said beer out of the restaurant and then go play Black Jack.\n* The stoves are inside\n* It's not Texas.  \n\nFriend had a pre-wedding welcome dinner here for almost 60 people. Service was great and we had our own private dining area. Salt Lick was smart and gave each server only one or two tables to worry about.\n\nIt was a nice little piece of Texas in a nice little piece of Vegas.
