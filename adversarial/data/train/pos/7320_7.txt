Just left this Walmart and I am so disgusted.\nShopped for our dinner and my husband bought beer. While checking out my husband was carded no issue he showed his ID. Then the cashier asked for mine which I didn't have he then refused to sale is the beer.\nI asked to speak to the manager who came over her name was Sheila (this woman was so rude and racist) I asked for her managers name which at first she did not want to give me so I turned on my video recorder and then she wrote her managers name. \nShe stated it is against the law not to Id both people so I stood in front of the store and watch two different cashiers sale alcohol to other customers and not ID the woman they were with.\nI then brought my video to Sheila and told her what I saw. She refused to speak with me and then called the police on my husband and I.\nAll while I was recording the entire thing.\n\nWalmart managers and employees should have better training and managers really should racially profile people.
