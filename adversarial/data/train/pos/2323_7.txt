I had a really bad day.  Like really awful, all I want to do is sit on the couch in my flannel monkey pajamas and watch terrible wedding shows.  Needless to say, I had zero urge to get up and make anything to eat, let alone go to the grocery store or a restaurant.  So I looked up delivery places in Monroeville, and up popped Carhop's.\n\nNow I've lived in Monroeville for 4 years, but I didn't even know of Carhop's existence... I do remember passing it, but I thought it was a car shop I guess - apparently I don't pay attention.  So I checked out the website and decided to order out.  I chose the Volvo Vegetarian, some cheese fries, and fried mushrooms - the perfect blend of grease and cheese to suppress my anger at the world.  \n\nAbout 20 minutes later it arrived... a GIANT sub.  Holy Toledo, apparently the \"sedan\" subs are 2 feet long (what?!?).  I had no idea... guess I'll have some leftovers.  The food is overall decent.  Good fries, good cheese on the fries (not that nacho cheese garbage), great bread for the sub (thin subs, but everything tastes fresh).  I feel slightly less annoyed with the world.  The only thing to keep in mind is that you can't order takeout with a credit card - cash or check only.  Meh.  I can handle that.  I will go back for more greasy goodness in the future.\n\nAnd to clarify, I did indeed answer the door in my flannel monkey pajamas.  The delivery guy was really nice, though I'm sure he was judging (who wouldn't?).
