Initially my wife and I thought this would be a nice place. That was the only good thought we had. When we went to the back it smelled like butt and feet. It was an overwhelming odor. Then we went to our gazebo and the massage started. Again we both thought initially it would be nice. Again we thought wrong! Both guy and girl jumped on our backs then did a 60 minute massage on our back. Typically this is ok but not when they wore socks that felt like broken glass and then they stretch you like a medieval prisoner. Also, during the massage they were talking in their native language the whole time!!!!  After being tortured for an hour they leave us alone for 15 mins then do a quick foot massage. \n\nOnce we were done the Masseuses escort us to the register. To which we pay and they stood over us waiting to be tipped. So we tipped 10 bucks each and they flipped out. They started yelling at us in English and something else. \n\nWorst experience we ever had!  Horrible horrible horrible!
