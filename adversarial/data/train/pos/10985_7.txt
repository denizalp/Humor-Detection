Good cheesy fun as it's best! \n\nLike many others, I've always wanted to pay Madame Tussauds a visit but either schedule didn't permit or the peeps I came with would give me the eye roll as if I was the lamest person on earth. But lucky for me, I found someone equally as lame to finally share my visit! I mean that in a good way hubby. ;)\n\nHalf-Off Ticket booths rock! I love not having to pay full price. When you first enter, you are greeted by Whoopie Goldberg. As we took the escalator ride up it reminded me of the intro to the Space Mountain ride at Disneyland. \n\nHey, is it me or does Justin Timberlake look an awful lot like Brian Austin Green? You know, the geeky dude from Beverly Hills 90210?Just an observation:\n\nhttp:\/\/static3.px.yelp.com\/photo\/TGBuDDNDdLMWt8_e1_jyGw\/l\n\nFrom there, we proceeded to take cheesy photos of\/with JLo (who was significantly thinner and had minimal ass-ets), Hef, Jenna Jameson (hubs was all over that one), Cameron Diaz, Jodie Foster, and more. I have to agree with Jenny R. about Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts bearing no resemblance to their likeness whatsover--in fact, I was like, \"is that Hilary Swank? With long hair?\" Moving on...\n\nI kind of a cringed a little at the American Idol experience but was quickly distracted when I saw the Lenny Kravitz wax figure across the room. Really disappointed when I saw him in all of his lackluster glory but oh well. He's much hotter in person :) Prince looked exactly like Prince... http:\/\/static2.px.yelp.com\/photo\/cL2qp7k47u-t6AWSIM6kxw\/l\n...and I could've sworn that was the real Britney Spears staring back at me. I thought hers was the most realistic out of the bunch.\n\nOverall fun experience, especially with the scare factory added in. Good times!
