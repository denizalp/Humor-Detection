My husband and I are visiting Charlotte for the day, and I was in charge of finding dinner for the two of us - a vegan and a vegetarian.  Little did we know we'd happen into a restaurant open for just two days!  Had we not read so beforehand, we'd never have known - nothing in our dinner would have belied that fact.  Service was smooth and efficient, servers knew all about the menu, and everyone worked with confidence and pleasure.\n\nWe enjoyed our entrees - the Three Sisters Cakes and the mushroom risotto.  Both were hearty and flavorful without being too filling.  We also ordered the Squash Blossom Hush Puppies as a starter and while we enjoyed them, I take issue with the \"hush puppies\" label.  They're really more of a jalapeno popper, with a batter-fried exterior enclosing a creamy vegan cheese and squash bossom.  I'd been hoping for more of a twist on a traditional, cake-y hush puppy.\n\nThat issue aside, we were pleased with the whole experience.  The restaurant's decor is both dark and cozy while still fresh and airy.  If we were locals, we'd certainly be back for a nice date-night meal out.  Since we're not, the least I can do is leave a positive review and hope it sends more business their way.
