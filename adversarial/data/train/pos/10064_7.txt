Pancho's Kitchen is definitely killing with the flavor\n\nI'll start by saying the pozole is a must try! \nSo good and it's served with 2 mashed potato tacos which or my favorite kind of tacos!\n\nThis was my first visit here and the place clean and wasn't too busy. Staff was friendly and helpful.\n\nI also ordered the potato rolled tacos with rice and beans. My only complaint was there wasn't that much potato filling in the tacos only half the taco the rest was just crispy tortilla.\n\nThe food is delicious though and I will come back again.
