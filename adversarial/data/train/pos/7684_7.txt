La Parilla Suiza has been a restaurant that we've gone to for a long time in our family. Though we don't go as frequently, I believe the service and food seems to have slipped a bit.\n\nThe first thing that your MUST order when going is the \"Queso Suizo\" which is absolutely mouth watering amazing. Definitely a favorite when we go, and has and will always be delicious. Luckily, you get complimentary chips and salsas (green one is my fav), so that'll keep you busy before your huge plate arrives. \n\nTheir combination plates are pretty good, not too much a fan of their charro beans, but their chicken enchiladas and arroz are very tasty. Their chicken is always grilled very yummy, their fajita plate is veeeery tasty. Make sure to ask for extra green salsa for your food, it's a must.
