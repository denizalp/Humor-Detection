Couple things: the name 'American Junkie' is atrocious. It's kind of filling the void from Mickey's Hangover but with a much nicer interior and superior menu options. They proudly support Ohio State football and the Pittsburgh Steelers. I guess they each have a few great seasons every decade. But why not add the Detroit Red Wings if you're going to cherry pick teams from the Rust Belt? \n\nThere's 2 sides to this: the regular bar\/restaurant and the typical weekend douchefest club. I've been here on a Saturday night and it was nothing special. There were about 4 attractive women, 35 ugly ones and 100 guys. It used to be you could goto into a Scottsdale bar and see dozens of beautiful women - not anymore. My advice, skip the Friday\/Saturday sausage fest. Unless you're into that scene, in which case, you need to die. Look at the weekend pics from this place on azcentral or New Times if you doubt me regarding the male to female ratio.\n\nComing in here on an off-night, you'll find a fancy interior, well-designed patio with sprawling sofas and plenty of large-screen LCDs for sporting events. The food here is really good and the main saving grace. I've not tried it all but the artichoke dip appetizer is the best. Wed and one other weekday is half off apps from 4-7 for happy hour. Expect it to be packed when the Steelers are playing on a Monday or Thursday night, along with most tables being reserved. I've been here when it was really busy and got my food and drinks ok, but they could've used 1-2 more waitresses. I wish this place would drop the douche and step up the sports bar side. American Junkie is great for the off-night or weekday lunch; I'd avoid it on Friday\/Saturday nights and NFL Sundays.
