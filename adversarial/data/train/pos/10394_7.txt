Dropped by Teriyaki Boy in search of some quick, clean protein.  The b\/f says this is where Jay Cutler has his own bowl, and sure enough, there's a picture of the former Mr. Olympia on the counter and his own big teriyaki chicken bowl--buff!  We only wanted plain chicken breast with no sauce, no rice, and some plain broccoli and the folks behind the counter were very accommodating; this location is right next to LVAC, so they're probably used to such requests.  If you're into eating clean, which can mean boring at times, this place can hook you up.  It's also super clean as an eating establishment--the employees were mopping and cleaning when we walked in and kept on after they served us.  They have boba on the menu, too, but it's not on our diet these days; too bad, so sad for us.
