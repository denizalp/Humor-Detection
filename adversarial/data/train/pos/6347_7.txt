Come on people... I don't even live in Phoenix and I know about Rito's. \n\nI grew up eating Mexican food (my dad is Mexican) and this is real Mexican food, no doubt about it. Rito's has been in the same location on 14th street for a long long time... I think around 30 years. There isn't a sign outside...you just have to know it's there.  Just look for the people walking out with smiles on their faces and to go containers in their hands.\n\nWhen I was there for lunch it was filled with city workers, parents with young kids, and retiree's who live in the neighborhood.  Rito's is family owned, and honestly, I think grandma does the cooking. Also, it's cash only. \n\nYou pretty much have to know what you want when you get to the order window because the place is packed and they don't have time to answer your questions about what's in this and what's in that. \n\nAfter asking the other patrons in line what's the best,  they pretty much all said the same thing...Green Chili Burro...I think it was less than five bucks. I also ordered the beans and rice. My husband ordered the same thing. There was so much food that we could have easily shared one with all the extras...I guess we figured since it was so cheap it's be small...no way...HUMONGOUS!  \n\nWe took it to go and ate it in the car...cheese, beans and rice were flying every where, the windows were steamed up...the car was rockin' cause we were soooo happy...I'm sure passers by thought something kinky was goin' on inside our car. Nope...just chowin' down on some damn good Mexican food. \n\nI hope I haven't given it away and blown the secret of Rito's by Yelping it...I love the fact that there isn't a sign, you have to know about it to know that it is even exists and it's a locals only kinda place.  The prices are right, the food rocks and it's family owned...what more could you ask for?
