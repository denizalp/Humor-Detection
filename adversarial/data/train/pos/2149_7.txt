I am always inspired when I stop in this tiny vintage homewares store. Located on the north corner of Belle and Detroit in Lakewood, she changes the look and mood of the showroom quite often. \n\nThere are always colorful and trendy vintage dressers, tables, and chairs to chose from. She also has new items, such as candles and soaps, that have a vintage feel. \n\nI bought a dainty pair of white 1950's gloves that I wore to a party where they were stolen! Perhaps I should not have left them dangling off th branches of the Christmas Tree.
