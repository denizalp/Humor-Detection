It'd been years since I'd been to a Ruby Tuesday's before last month. And since then I've been three or four times. Is it that good? No, not really. I mean, it's not bad, not as bad you probably think it is, anyway. But it ain't great. So why do I keep going back? That's a good question. Because it's not cheap, either. Probably because it's close to work.\n\nI've been making my way through their seafood options lately. The jumbo lump crab burger - it's crab cakes on a bun. That's probably some kind of no-no on somebody's lo-carb diet. Fried shrimp, grilled creole shrimp, shrimp scampi... tried 'em all, and they're all the same - not that good, but not bad. An incredibly solid three stars.\n\nOh, and they've got a veggie burger, which technically pushes them up to 3.5 stars, but I'm not in the rounding up kind of mood today.
