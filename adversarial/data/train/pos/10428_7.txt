If only there were a negative-one to be given. Why? Well, it was certainly not the food because I never got a chance to try it and after what happened, I doubt I ever will.\n\nSaturday, a group of us headed over there because we're all big BBQ fans and one of our party had read some rave reviews. We got there just after noon - they opened at 11:00 and the place was packed. Not only is it significantly smaller when you get inside but there are not a lot of tables, although they claim they have 58.......hmmmm.....were some perhaps hidden in the basement? Out back? Anyway,  a lot of people were getting it to go, which considering the lack of tables, made sense. But we wanted to eat in.\n\nAfter being told that the wait would be an hour!!! we promptly decided to go somewhere else. Now that is not the end of this story. When one member of our party took to FB to voice his disappointment over the long wait and the amount of tables, he got a reply which included, \"too bad you are above waiting in line.\"\n\nFirst off? How rude, arrogant and insulting. This is NOT how you address a complaint from someone who was ready to put down a good chunk of change to eat at your restaurant - and after reading some other reviews, overpriced -  and secondly? Two members of the party were DISABLED and to ask them to STAND in a line, for an hour was strictly out of the question. \n\nPerhaps the very tactless people at Adamson's should consider this possibility before hitting the keyboard to accuse potential customers of being \"above standing in lines.\"\n\nThere are lots of other BBQ places in this city and Adamson's is NOT the only game in town. There may be an excuse for the long lines but not for the terrible attitude. That just sucks.
