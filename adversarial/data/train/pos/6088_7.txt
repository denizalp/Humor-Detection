There are some stores that just intimidate the crap out of me. This is one of them... at least at first. How silly and very 'Pretty Woman' of me (you know the scene I'm talking about, where Vivian is turned away from the boutique - not that I'm comparing Anthropologie to a high-end couture shop or me to a whore with a heart of gold...)\n\nSo what made me go in here? Well, my friend raved about buying a very cute top from here (despite fretting about the price). Then her next mistake was forwarding me a link to the website. I instantly fell in love with the garments but at the time it was a mere 'admire from afar' so I decided to check out this new location. \n\nGranted, I had low expectations: 1. they would not have half the selections that were featured on the site and 2. no way would anything fit me. Well, looks like I owe the universe a Coke because I was proven wrong on both accounts.\n\nThe store itself is huge and a bit overwhelming to the point I'm not sure if I've raided that rack yet.\n\nAs for the prices... it is not cheap but some days you gotta say to yourself \"What the eff. I think I deserve a little treat today\". And right now with the changing season, their summer stuff is on sale (40% off the lowest marked price - seriously, throw some leggings under that skirt and you're ready for fall wear!) But don't make a sale be your only reason to step into this store - give it a whirl and you might find something that is worth its price in gold.
