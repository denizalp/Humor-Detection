Oh what a wonderful find this joint was. \n\nAfter my disappointing visit to Benjarong, I gave up my quest for a great Thai restaurant within a 2 mile radius of my neighborhood. But literally a few days later, driving home from work famished, I noticed this unusually placed restaurant with a bright neon red sign as I was driving by. I almost shrugged it off, until I realized I didn't register the word \"Thai Kitchen\". I immediately crossed two lanes and busted a biznatch. \n\nWhen I went in, there was only a single party of two in the middle of their dinner. I took a peek and the food looked and smelled good. The waitress\/host quickly and cheerfully greeted me and provided me with a menu after I told her I was taking-out. She was very genuine and even asked me if I needed anything to drink while I was waiting. \n\nGot home. W-o-w. I haven't had such a fine tasting Styrofoam-plated meal in my life. Everything I ordered (Which I'll list below, because I've been to this place about 5-6 times after my initial visit) was piping hot, vibrantly flavorful and most importantly, satisfyingly spicy. Which, on second thought, might be sweat-inducing for most other people. I usually get a 10.. hey, I was raised on Kimchi and Sriracha sauce.\n\nMust-haves: Beef Pad Kapow (Spicy Basil Dish), Chicken Pad Thai, Pork Pad Kea Mow, Pineapple Fried Rice, Panang Curry\n\nOverall, this is a \"cute\" little place, that serves excellent Thai food, amongst the best I've had, at a reasonable price and served with a smile. Only downside that I can even think of is that the restaurant can fit 40 people at best. \n\nDare I say it, when it comes strictly to the food alone, Surang is giving Archi a serious run for his money.
