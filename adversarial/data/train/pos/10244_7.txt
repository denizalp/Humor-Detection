Ah, video games. I agree with Lynn and shake my finger at those people with a console. Isn't the distance between two people far enough with texting, IMing, Facebooking, tweeting, and all the other -ings out there?\n\n----gets off soapbox\n\nThis is a great store. Too bad we don't have any in SoCal since Wizards of the Coast died out. The diversity of games is excellent. They have, but not limited to (just in case I missed something)\n\n1) Traditional boardgames like chess and checkers\n2) Standard boardgames like Sorry, Monopoly and the game of Life\n3) Puzzles of all sorts like jigsaw and metal puzzles\n4) Playing cards\n5) Collectible cards like Magic the Gathering\n6) Specialized board games for the hardcore boardgame fan like Carcassone, Settlers of Catan, Axis and Allies, Descent and Runebound\n7) Specialized card games like Munchkin and Race for the Galaxy\n8) RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons\n\nSo, if staring at a screen gets old and boring, or decide that the distance between 2 people is too wide for you and you need face to face interactions with actual people, head on this way, I'm sure they'll find something you'll like.
