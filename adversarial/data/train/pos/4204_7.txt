Hands down, best pedicure ever. The lady was at it for almost an hour, just massaging and scrubbing and using hot stones. Efficient work and super relaxing. My dogs were barking. Definitely gonna make this my regular pedi stop. And 30 bucks ain't bad to be pampered like that. Feet so clean you could eat off 'em.
