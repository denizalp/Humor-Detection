4.5 stars\n\nCame here with my buddy and right when I walked in, I thought I was in the twilight zone. I couldn't really understand the theme\/decor of this place. It's a diner concept, yet it looks like a boutique furniture store. The servers were a little cukoo and overly friendly (not in a good way), but hey the food was absolutely delicious. \n\nSinful Tots- I'm usually not a fan of tater-tots, but these were really good. The combination of the cheese, bacon jam, and truffle oil on these tots were just orgasmic. \n\nNot Your Mama's Grilled Cheese Sandwich- One of the better sandwiches I've had in awhile. The panini bread was toasted nicely (crispy but not overdone), and the brisket was really soft and flavorful. The bacon jam was the highlight in both of these dishes. Great combination of sweet and savory. \n\nButtermilk fried chicken and waffles- the chicken and waffles were superior. My buddy ordered this, but I got to try some of it. The waffle was so crisp, and the fried chicken was hot and crunchy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. It had the breading of a katsu, and it was so good!\n\nWill definitely have to come back and try some of their other items.
