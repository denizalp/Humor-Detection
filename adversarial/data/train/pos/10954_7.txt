They have great overly priced stuff. You could find majority of their items for about $3 off at other outlets. Their shoe selection is really nice. Nothing under $29 though. Their wigs I could buy offline for half the price.\n\n Being darker skintone trying to purchase blonde spiral thick hair, I needed to see what I was buying. Not all shades of blonde looks good on everyone. I ended up trying on 7 wigs and was going to buy 2 of them for $29 dollars - that is until one of the korean workers who was practically stalking me across the store told me that I couldn't try on anymore than 3 and to leave after. I told the person servicing me to never mind the wigs and gave her back the $36 pair of boots. Left with a solid F that attitude. \n\nEvery other time I go up there to try on hair, I never get waited on. I don't get a recognition even when I say something.  Although this time I was receiving the best service I have ever had, this freaking stalker man finally put the nail on the coffin. I'm done with that store. I will be spending my $130 elsewhere :\/
