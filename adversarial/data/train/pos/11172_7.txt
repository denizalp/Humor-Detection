1. We went to this Jo-ann tonight, tried to use a notion wall coupon for threads. We asked a man in the store if we can use that coupon for thread twice and been answere YES. We spent about 2 hours and chosen about 20 different threads and was refused to get the discount. We talked to the manager and she do nothing but say sorry. The manager said if there are some discount comming on the next coupon she can give us this time but there are not any. But we found 50% off thread on the coupon for the next period!!!\n\n2. We tried to buy Gutermann thread, two spoons of thread with the same color number has significantly color difference.\n\n3. Our car lost a whell cover while parking outside the store. I cannot make sure it was lost there, but that mad my day even worse\n\nWe really DO NOT RECOMMAND going to this Jo-Ann with non-professional sales and careless manager.
