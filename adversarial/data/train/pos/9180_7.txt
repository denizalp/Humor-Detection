I have not been in a Sears for many years.\nI used to be a devoted sears buyer mostly for the Craftsman tools.\nBut these days there is really nothing special about there tools and most sears have become big parking lots with no cars in them.\nI went in to return a tool that had broken.\nAll Craftsman tools have a lifetime warranty which is why most of my tools that I have bought in the past are Craftsman brand.\nThe store is huge and has two levels and as I walked around I found a big huge empty store with lots of product and no customers and not that many sales people,\nI brought my tool up to the counter for return with a replacement that I took off the wall.\nUnfortunately the sale person did not know how to do a return and I had too wait until another associate came over too help.\nI am definitely not a fan of sears any more if I buy tools I go to Home Depot for appliances also Home Depot and other items probably Walmart or Target.
