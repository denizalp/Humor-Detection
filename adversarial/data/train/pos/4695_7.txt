Great breakfast\/brunch spot with a nice pet-friendly outdoor patio.  \n\nI went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was PACKED.  You order at the counter, they give you a  \"letter\" to place on your table and someone will bring you the food (a bit like corner bakery). I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was really good...not too heavy. Great location and ambiance.
