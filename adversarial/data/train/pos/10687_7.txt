I ate the WHOLE calzone and didn't even get a t-shirt?!?  Really?  Not even a discount?!?\n\nSeriously, my stomach hurts so bad right now, but I conquered the beast. The whole, delicious beast in all of its entirety. \n\nThis place is not a diner, not a drive-in...definitely a dive, but, man is it good!  Came with a business party of about twelve and the place accommodated us just fine and without hesitation. \n\nEveryone loved their food, so I'll definitely be back...though next time for a MUCH smaller portion...or at least when I have portion-control. \n\nSuper delicious and a super dive!  Gotta' love places like this!\n\nCheers!
