I fixed my truck there few years back, it took three trips to fix the same problem the first time. Now My truck ended up getting a new axle, because they did not do it right last time. The break job they did also sucked, the breaks only lasted 3 years and 20 thousand miles.\n\nDon't get scamed here. find a local repair shop.
