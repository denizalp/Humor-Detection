Who you dine with and the staff's warmth is part of what makes the experience.  This time around we were sitting in a room full of people who ADORE food.  \n\nThey were asking questions and engaging the staff.  We even started the meal smiling at each other and clinking glasses with our neighbors.  Wow, friendly.  \n\nThe last two times I have had to hold my purse on my lap, there are no hooks, this time the gal whisked my bag to the wall.  Fabulous, wonder why it wasn't done before.\n\nFabulous new items:\n-merienda, a spin on a traditional sandwich moms pack for their kids in Spain\n-clams with reconstructed olives\n-'fabes' con jamon, replaced the chickpea stew.  Loved the latter, didn't think it could get better, it definitely has, Iberico ham broth, lardo and reconstructed beans, so beautiful and smooth, because there is NO skin!\n-secreto of Iberico pork with squid, super smoky and the pork was salty, fatty, good\n-'kokotxas' al pil-pil, fish jowl, you don't need teeth for this one.  Just melted.\n-check the round red disc with a golden 'e' stamped, a concentrated raspberry.  Willy Wonka style.\n\nStill iffy: \n-nitro almond cup, I don't love nutty and caviar, too avant garde for my pedestrian tastes\n-too much citrus in 1-2 dishes, but it's an option you can add to your bite, I opted out\n\nWine pairing is $130\/pp and they will top you off.  The meal goes by pretty quickly and about halfway through they pour one selection per course, so you should have plenty left.\n\nBeautiful meal, still a little lighter than I would like, but seemed more substantial.  I asked what their guesstimate would be calorically: 1500.  Not bad!!!  Much less than French, due to more creams, oils and little to no butter.  \n\nIf you're late, like we were, they will seat you at the end of the table, not what is stated on your ticket.  I noticed I smelled like the kitchen this time around, not sure if it was from the back or if it was from the paella pan in the main room.
