Pros:\n- Dr. Helen and staff are basically druids with +5 cat husbandry skills. Treated cantankerous feline with comprehensive knowledge and zero gore.\n- Smells nice. Some really photogenic pets parading the waiting room.\n- Prompt appointment, communication and follow up.\n- Reasonable prices.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of bleeding and trauma means I'm in charge of cat custody for future veterinary visits.\n- Cantankerous cat is probably going to live forever.
