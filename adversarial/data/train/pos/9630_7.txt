Cotton candy fluff and snow desserts? Sign me up! This place is hip with the majority of the patrons on laptops and\/or hanging out with friends. The server was courteous and suggested the early grey snow with the candy fluff. The snow itself with the earl grey tea was quite tasty. You definitely taste the earthy tea flavor and the sweetness level was just enough to qualify it as a dessert. The snow texture was super fine, so it melted easily upon eating. I enjoyed that aspect of the snow dessert.\n\nThe candy fluff was ok. It was not cloying sweet like most cotton candy, but it adds an extra texture to the melting snow in the dessert. Maybe better for taking pictures or wearing as a Santa beard as I did for fun. The wooden spoons are neat, but they were a weird shape so when you scooped the snow and ate it the spoon didn't glide smoothly empty. I would come back to try out their other flavors though.
