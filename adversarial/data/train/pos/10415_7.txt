I'm pleased to report Toronto's Via One business class lounge is now much, much improved. It was moved out from the back of the departure area to street side. The previous lounge was dark and kind of crammed. The new lounge has much nicer seating areas and windows that look out onto the street. Freebies are unchanged (coffee machine, sodas, juices). I think they've added a new range of free magazines. \n\nThe lounge can be loud. All the stone, tile, and plaster doesn't really do much to absorb sound. \n\nAll 'n' all another sound reason to go Via One if you have to go by train. Train is always more expensive than you think it should be. Via One isn't that much more expensive than coach fare. You get bonuses like being able to chill out in this lounge, pilfer stuff from the fridges, and free reading material. The best part is the pre-boarding. You get led out past the Bataan Death March line of tired, sad, miserable people lining up for their coach gate. Everyone looks like \"will I get a decent seat? Or will I have to sit next to a guy who thinks it's okay to travel with a bayonet in his carry on?\"
