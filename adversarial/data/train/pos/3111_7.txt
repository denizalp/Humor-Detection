It's been said that \"every pizza can be a personal pizza if you try hard enough and believe in yourself.\" This is fact. \n\nAt Blaze, you can forget that sharing is caring and order your own personal size pizza for under $10. What I love about this place is that pizzas are fully customizable, or you can opt in for their signature styles. There dozens of toppings and sauces, plus three types of dough: traditional, gluten-free, and high-rise. If you want a \"lighter\" pizza, go with the traditional; it's a thin and has a crunchy crust. The high-rise will no doubt fill you up. After pizzas are made, they're slid into a fiery oven and cooked within minutes. Unlike other pizza shops in town that operate on a similar concept, my pizzas have always been baked to perfection -- never undercooked. \n\nThe ordering process is painless. Despite the occasional long lines, the wait time is short. Hate lines? Place an order online -- too bad they don't deliver.
