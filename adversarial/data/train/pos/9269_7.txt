Zero stars\nThis company trains employees to ring the doorbell of your home, twice, because they want to promote their product via door to door sales. If I want pest control I'd come to you. The men who are selling can't even do the work. This business model is terrible! The young man banging on doors was pouring sweat,  got dropped off in our neighborhood to do this job, and was so brainwashed into thinking this job is great. He also said per sale there is fifty dollars in it for him which can fluctuate depending on how bad they want to make the sale. I presently cannot recommend this company because of this.
