Nice selection on tap and nice atmosphere.  Unfortunately the food doesn't quite get to the 4 or 5 star mark.\n\nI was excited to see the traditional Haddock used for fish and chips, especially when I ordered the large portion to share with my wife.  When the plate arrived with a pound of Haddock in two long slabs hanging over the plate (That's what I'm talkin' about!) I was thrilled.  Then a mild case of disappointment set in:  the fish was slightly overdone and tasted a little fishy.  I also did not like that the chips had a coating.  \n\nOh well.  We are a long way from the Atlantic aren't we.
