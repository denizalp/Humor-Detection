5 stars for making an epic mocha. As other Yelpers have pointed out, the espresso used is much less acidic than what gets pulled at most coffee shops. Additionally, I had flavorful, chocolatey goodness instead of a mouthful of half and half or whole milk. You get a great view of the light rail, the option of a groovy patio to chill on, and some paintings to admire. The theme appears to be positive body image, which I find to be totally rad. \n\nTasty. Artsy. And don't forget the tantalizing snacks. People in this part of town look so busy chasing cabs and buses in their suits. They should probably chill the freak out and stop at One sometime.
