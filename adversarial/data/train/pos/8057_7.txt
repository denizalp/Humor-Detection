Ok again I'm going against the grain and sticking to what I know, good southern bbq! This place is ok but far from the mark. The beef ribs were too fatty, the pork ribs weren't fall off the bone and skimpy. The flavor was pure smoke only. No real sense of the bbq flavor. The yams were drenched in liquid sauce and couldn't mix it in so it ruined it for me. And sorry to say as I was excited for cobbler, but this is far from cobbler! Gosh this is making a trip down south seem overdue! \nWe called ahead our order and still waited a long time as they just said overwhelmed by orders. The little one wouldn't eat the ribs she was so excited for either. I so wanted to like this place so I can have a bbq place in town based on a lot of people's reviews but needless to say I'll keep on looking....
