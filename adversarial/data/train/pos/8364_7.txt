I went to Bound by Salvatore for a late night stop.  All I have to say is that this bar is perfect for me.\n\nLots of plush seating, friendly bartenders and wait staff, very unique cocktail menu, and it's a really great spot for people watching at The Cromwell.\n\nSince I like to stay up late in Vegas, my favorite part of their cocktail menu is that they have some really good espresso cocktails!  They're perfect for when you've had a long night on the Strip but want to keep it going just a while longer.\n\nThe \"Never Say Goodnight\" --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1mn6TUe\nRed Bull Flavored Espresso, Stole Vanil Vodka, Perond Absinthe, Sugar Syrup and Spices\nJust by reading the ingredients alone you can tell this is a serious wake-up drink.  This definitely kept my night going and the taste of this cocktail was pretty good!\n\nI will definitely be coming back here again next time I visit Vegas.
