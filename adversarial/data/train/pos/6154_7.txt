It's experiences like this that make me wonder. \nImmediately upon arrival, the vapid atmosphere hit my fiancé and I like a ton of impotent bricks. \"Greeted\" by the server, it was as if we were about to dine in the lobby of a half-baked 3-star hotel. The reality of the situation was regrettably not far off. \nComing in with high expectations, and money to burn, was our first mistake. The first word that comes to mind is \"Drab\". \nMy partner and I aren't the Yorkville types. Maybe that's why our server, sloppy as ever, seemed to despise every moment of attention he paid to our table, though those moments were few and far between. \nThe food was mostly cooked with skill, but dishes like the lamb shoulder were held back by GastroPub veg. \nCreme brûlée? Sure it's on the menu. Sure my fiancé orders it every time. Did she order it this evening? No.
