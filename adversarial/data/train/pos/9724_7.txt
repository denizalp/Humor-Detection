ROLF ~ I hate to give any business a 1 star rating especially when it's a locally owned but after two different visits to Hot Bagels & Deli in Surprise, I view them as a potential health hazard.  \n\nOur last visited started off on the wrong foot with the owners having a conversation between themselves and ignoring their customers.  We ordered two bagel sandwiches for lunch ~ asiago cheese bagel with ham & cheese and a side of chips and drink.  They only offered two choices of cheese, Swiss and American which I don't like either... My friend ordered a turkey & swiss (only choice) on a jalapeno bagel.  \n\nHalf way through our bagel sandwiches I noticed little blue dots on bottom of his bagel and they were not jalapeno's, ROLF!  The bagels were old, chewy and came with a bit if penicillin apparently.\n\nThis was my second bad visit and don't plan to go back.  I tried to tell the owners about our experience and she turned away and walked off! wowsers!
