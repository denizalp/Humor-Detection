This place needs to be shut down- please do not eat there.  I may have gone on a bad night but there is no excuse for cold, crispy burger meat and hard bread, a shake that has 5 times more syrup in it than it should (ew aftertaste), and a 30 minute drive thru wait.  25 minutes of that time, they had my debit card and did not give it back until my husband went in and yelled.  When the manager came to the window to return our debit card, she had two of them and didn't know which one to give me.  I feel bad for whoever else had tried to pay, I could have easily taken their card.  So unprofessional!  The kitchen was filthy and people were walking away from the grill.  If they were short staffed, maybe they need to cross-train the servers.  There were 5 of them just staring at me as I was waiting for my food while the other 3 staff were running like chickens with their heads cut off.
