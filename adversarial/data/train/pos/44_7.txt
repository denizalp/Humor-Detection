I cancelled my membership today, a few days before the renewal date. Here's why:\n\nLast year I identified that the Toronto location didn't have cars very well spread out over the city. Sadly, nothing has improved in this regard. What has changed are the prices. I made a midday, non-weekend reservation to drive a Mazda 3 for four hours and the bill was almost $60, however, to rent the car for 24 hours is $89.\n\nHere's some simple math:\n(i) The $12.75 hourly rate billed for a Mazda 3 for 24 hours would total $306 (12.75*24=306).\n(ii) The hourly rate for being charged for 24 hours is $3.71 (89\/24=3.71).\n\nTherefore, people using the cars on an hourly rate are billed 3.5 times more than those who rent for a full 24 hours, but this doesn't really matter if you're using the vehicles for 1-2 hours. I don't think pricing model is all that dishonest as the company heavily promotes the use of cars for short trips and hourly use.\n\nHowever, it does become a problem when we factor in the information I wrote about in my second paragraph: the distribution of the vehicles around the city.\n\nThe company heavily promotes a hourly rental system, but when the cars aren't evenly dispersed throughout the city it ends up taking longer to get the car, and longer to return it. A lot of time is eaten up taking the car to where you need it, and returning it to its far off home. This makes using the service significantly more expensive for people that could use the service but have to spend hours getting and returning the vehicle.\n\nI identified the problem last year and nothing has improved. This tells me that either (a) the company doesn't want to change what they have happening, or (b) they haven't really paid attention to my concern at all. Neither of those two options are good for customers.\n\nZipcar Canada, you entered my life as quickly as you departed. Too bad we couldn't get to know each other better - but this is probably best for both of us. I just couldn't keep paying huge hourly rates to spend most of my time taking you where you needed to be, or bringing you back to your house. Every relationship needs to be give and take, and I just feel that I've been putting more into this than I've been getting out. :\/ No, it wasn't you: it was me. I'm sure you'll find somebody else that will be a better match for you. :)\n\nBye bye Zipcar Canada.
