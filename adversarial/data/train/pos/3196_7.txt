Mmmmmm. Filipino food.\n\nBeing randomly in Parma, we decided to get lunch and was happily surprised by Melys.\n\nIt's small-definitely take out only. Being half Chinese-Filipino (and the other half Canto), I have a deep appreciation for Filipino food and culture. So when we searched and Melys came up, I was thrilled!\n\nA cute little Filipino lady runs the place. We entered and got the lechon (with the gravy), and the pancit. She then showed me some fresh lechon (without gravy), which I had to get a box of. Total? A ton of Filipino food for only 20 bucks (yes!).\n\nShe instantly knew I was Chinese and tried to sell me some steamed buns. She kept being like \"you know what this is! Bao!\" Hahahahahaha. I politely declined, but it's nice that she had some!\n\nToo bad there was no Filipino desserts or drinks out, or else that would have been icing on the cake. The rest of the food that she had looked great- I may be back for that adobo. The lechon was meaty but the skin was fried to perfection- slightly fattier than what I'm used to, but still very good.\n\nI loved the homey feel of it, and also the little Filipino lady that ran it. For that, the restaurant worked it's way into my heart, and I give it five stars.\n\nIf you want some good Filipino food, skip the buffet and just go to Melys. :)
