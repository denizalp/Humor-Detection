This is one of the biggest fitness centres Calgary has to offer. For the price of a membership they offer some pretty awesome bang for your buck, especially if you're into multidisciplinary fitness. I love being able to work out in the gym or catch a group fitness class and then hit the steam room and hot tub after. \n\nThe dive towers are currently closed to the public. This is sort of a shame as these have been my favourite feature since back in the days it was known as Lindsay Park when I was but a we diver.\n\nRIPPED - I wind up at the 'Ripped'class a lot with my room mate - she's nice enough to do me a favour and drage me out of be at 5:15 AM so that we can be at the 6am class. While it seems there's mostly women that get into the group fitness thing, this class is awesome for any fitness level as you can up your weight and the depth of your moves to get as much from the workout as you desire. It's can be rather dancy, but I just forget about the hundred other people in the facility that can see me, get my inner Diva on an burn some calories. While by no means a strictly women's class, this class sure seems to focus on my \"lady problem areas.\" My buns and triceps sure seem to take a sever beating whenever I do this class. I also wind up in a sweaty, panting puddle.
