Caf√© de' Mercanti translates to Merchant's coffee and this charming Italian jewel definitely sports its name well. \n\nSure you'll see local residents stumble in for their regular order, or tourists waltzing in from Montreal Old Port and Old Town but noteworthy is the number of local business people buzzing in for their morning fix and take off as quickly as they came in!\n\nThis wonderful cafe is small, so perhaps a bit tough to accommodate big groups but has great atmosphere, the owners offer the best service and you'll enjoy solid espressos, lattes and many other classic Italian coffees. Noteworthy are the mouth weathering pastries which are made fresh every day - you won't regret it.\n\nPicture perfect biscotti, cornetto, cannoli, chunky double chocolate or caramel & sea salt cookies are strategically laid out to entice you. Oh oh oh and don't forget about the gorgeous vanilla custard lemon bombolini, a seasonal treat, so get' em while you can! And before you ask, there is a delicious choice or gluten free and vegan treats to choose from.\n\nCleverly displayed are also some staple \"to go\" items such as tomato sauces, pasta, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, marinated olives, salts, chips, juices... all Made in Italy!\n\nNext time i'll try the panini sandwiches and gelato... hope you will too!
