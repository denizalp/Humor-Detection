I brought two delicate items to this cleaner and they did a PHENOMENAL job. This was two separate occasions and I can't stop raving! \nOne was a baptism gown that had been stained for literally years! My grandmother almost seemed upset that it was actually 'cleanable'- but even better, it looked brand new. Pretty amazing for 30yr old Spanish lace with baby spit-up and yellowed stains. \nThe other was a wedding dress with fake tan stains on the back and in the seams. Again, looks brand new. \nAlso, I was referred here by a vintage wedding gown restorer, so you know from that they know their stuff on treating delicates.
