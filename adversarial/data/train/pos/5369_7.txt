Before your first time you usually hear a lot of stories. Stories of pain. Stories of romance. Stories of endless conversation, unimaginable positions. They tell you it's going to hurt like a bitch. They tell you to relax, it'll hurt more if you're tense. \n\nKnowing all of this, I walked into the Four Seasons, ready for Natasha to pop my Brazilian cherry. But Natasha had left early, leaving me with 15 minutes for the Advil to kick in and the least recommended \"waxtician\" (i coined a term!) in the joint. Lena. I was utterly terrified. I looked at the clock and prayed to the gods of the highest heavens that this was some miracle advil.\n\n\nI've never endured such horrific pain in my life. It took all the strength in my pint sized body not to scream bloody murder.  Yes, I'm silky smooth for the most part.  For the amount of pain that I endured you'd think that I wouldn't grow hair for a year. \n\nMy boyfriend better be ecstatic.\n\nAs for the massage portion of the afternoon. It was utterly delightful and made a little hot. I could not wait to get back to my hotel so to allow my boyfriend to play with utters.
