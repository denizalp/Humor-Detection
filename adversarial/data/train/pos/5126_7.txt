This is one of the worst hotels on the strip I upgraded my room and it was still smelly and dingy ... I got sick and they would not work with me about taking off the last day of my trip I didn't expect to get a full refund but I expected some kind of compassion and did I mention all the rooms smell horrible ..mine did and so did the other rooms my family got .. I will never stay here again the rooms are ugly and smelly ,the slots are super tight and the staff is not hospitable at all the whole hotel was horrible..
