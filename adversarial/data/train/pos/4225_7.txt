If you want to get a crappy color job for a very cheap price this is the place to go to not only are they horrific on haircuts they're professionalism is not there at all. I tried  to go to the owner my highlights were spotty and uneven all they talk about are drugs cursing and going out all the girls that were good moved away and for a reason.\nPriscilla was the only good one for a while but she left to Sola salon. I just don't know how they stay in business.
