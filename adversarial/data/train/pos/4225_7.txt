Well, perhaps I've been spoiled by other airports.  But this one is subpar to average at best.  There aren't lot of good restaurants.  THe duty free shops are priced higher than full price goods outside, so whoop-dee-duty on the tax free.  \n\nThere are charging station  plugs in the international section between the seats at the gates, so charging your phone or computer is easy.  There is also free internet, but wow is it slow.  SLOW SLOW.  I tried to download a 22 minute video for the flight and it got about halfway loaded in the 2.5 hours before my flight.  It took about 5 minutes at the hotel.\n\nParking lot was crazy expensive and poorly maintained.  Ice and slush everywhere to drag your suitcase through.  Nasty.  Short term parking cost $14 Canadian for an hour.  So hurry through that ice and muck so you don't get charged for another hour.\n\nOur flight was canceled and rebooking took more than four hours.  That is probably the fault of American Airlines, so I don't fault YYC.
