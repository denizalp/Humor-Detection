After a bad day at work, I needed some sushi- my GPS suggested Sushi Fever, but I saw this place on the way. The banner stretched across the entrance saying \"low price sushi and rolls\". Sign me up!\n\nThis place is set up like a round sushi bar, with individual grills for each diner for hot pot meals. I might come back here for that, but as I said, I had sushi on my mind. At 4PM, there were only two other couples present, finishing up grill meals.\n\nThe menu has two pages of sushi options that are decently-priced. I was surprised to see that the majority of roll options are fried or contain tempura-fried fish or shrimp, neither of which is my thing.\nI opted for the Crazy Boy and Sahara rolls, each $8.99. There was an insert in the menu stating happy hour discount from 4pm-6pm for 20% off of the bill, so I added on a plum wine.\n\nWine was a decent portion for $5, super sweet like I like it. \nThe rolls came out quickly: crazy boy is a bit more mild with avocado and cream cheese, but the sahara compliments it well with spicy salmon and a spicy garlic ponzu sauce. Rolls were a little on the skinny side and there wasn't much fish in them, which was slightly disappointing. It was just okay. \n\nBill came to about $25. The 20% happy hour discount was not on the bill and I didn't feel like I should have to bring it to the employee's attention. I am not likely to come back, or if I do it will not be for sushi.
