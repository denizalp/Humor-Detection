I went to the Phoenix location for an ultrasound to rule out an ovarian cyst. This is already a terrifying thing for a women so I brought my fiance with me. I had to drink a liter of water and then hold my bladder---to my dismay they were already 30 minutes behind at 8 am. Then the tech wasn't going to let my fiance come with me because the room was in the women's center. I insisted and she seemed really put out, rolling her eyes, but agreed. During our test she told us all about her horrible divorce and lack of child support payments and then even asked my fiance how much money he makes! Completely inappropriate. \n\nI then called to get a copy of my records to take to a physician. I picked up the disc a few days later only to find that the disc was blank with no files on it. So I called to get another copy made and encountered nothing but attitude from the girl on the phone, as though I had intentionally erased the disc or something. \n\nNext, my doctor had to call the radiologist at SimonMed to clarify the results. Turns out that the report he had written was not accurate and that he had reported normal findings when this wasn't the case. My doctor said that she would never send me there again. \n\nIf you have a choice, ask your doctor to send you somewhere else. I'm an RN, I know the system well and even I found it full of roadblocks. If you're already stressed facing a medical issue, save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else.
