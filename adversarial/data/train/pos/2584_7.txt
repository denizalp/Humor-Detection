One word to describe XS: BEAUTIFUL.\nI heard so many positive things about XS and I sort of already knew what to expect.. from the decor to the music, etc. Since I had 14 girls in my group we got in super quick and really early.. a bit too early where when we got in it was fairly empty. The club did start to fill up quick. Had an amazing time at XS, met some awesome people there. Drinks were a bit on the weak side but I was on a nice buzz, music got even better during the middle of the night and danced my butt off. I LOVE Vegas.. & XS you are amazing.\nP.S I think it's hilarious how there are tables in the middle of the club.. my boys would just die... this would definitely be their favorite spot.. what guy wouldn't wanna have hot girls around.. drinks.. dancing and black jack!
