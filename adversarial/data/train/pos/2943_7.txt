Should I finally divulge where I get my awesome Vegas hook ups? Yeaaaaaa okay...Evan's My Ultra Vegas is legit.  For the past few years, I always text Evan whenever I come to Vegas and have not once been disappointed.  My girls and I always manage to the coolest hookups anything from attending a Playboy suite parties to getting a free table at Marquee.  Though the services are mainly based at the Palms, there is no limit as to the service they provide and can get you in wherever, whenever. \n\nAs much as I'd like to keep the VIP status to a minimum, Evan's services and professionalism deserve to be praised.  Dealing with promoters can be annoying but My Ultra Vegas never bombard my text inbox or FB message inbox with annoying event invites.  Every time someone asks me for one of my contacts I know I can trust My Ultra Vegas to give them a good time.  Now let's get me body painted for the Midsummer party! Evan?
