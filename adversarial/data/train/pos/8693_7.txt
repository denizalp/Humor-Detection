What in the sam hell did we just eat????  Seriously!!!!\n\nNew Years Day hangover breakfast.  wowsers.\n\nWe ordered the sage fried chicken benedict.  Pretty sure it was as big as my head.  After we took pictures of it, the guy sitting next to us took a pic too.  Awesome.\nIt had yummy fried chicken, and then eggs, and then maple reduction gravy, and then biscuits, and then spinich and tomatoes with a side of BACON mashed potatoes.\nAs if that weren't enough...\nI also had the BACON waffle.  Dude, it had pieces of bacon cooked into the middle of the batter.\nAs if that weren't enough...\nI said it was the day after New Years.  Bloody Mary required.  But this was a BLT bloody with lettuce, tomato and BACON.\nYou've gotta look at the pictures people posted, especially the pot pie.  The people next to us oredered it and we clicked away.  The pie is as big as an actaual mexican sombrero.\n\nSo, Happy Bacon year!, Happy New Bacon?.....\n\nBacon New Year!!!
