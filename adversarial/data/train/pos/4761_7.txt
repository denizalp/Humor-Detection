OH MAN THE HYPE ON THIS JOINT!!!\nI was amped to come here. I love what he did with Ginza Sushi Ko in Beverly Hills and what he left behind -- a well taught sushi chef, Hiroyuki Urasawa.....and I knew what to expect with prices so I'm not going to reiterate the whole price point issue (that I agree with the majority on), but I never thought that this place would bend me over and do me like this?!\n\nHere's my fairy (nightmare) tale....\n\nSetting: a warehouse? Whatever, it was cool. But it seemed like they got first pick of the real estate and picked the wrong place after all was said and done, \"Ya, the ceilings a bit tall....\" \nHey I thought the lighting was pretty neat. \n\nCast: Friendly service. Knowledgeable front of the house staff. Server forgot our waters and only brought one soy dish for the two of us. That balanced things out on the wrong end for sure. \n\nPlot: I appreciate the plate presentation and the actual food quality. The ingredients and overall variety on the sushi menu is fabulous but I had to reason with this lasting impression on the bill ----- \n----- $18.00 cocktail = $18.00 Age-dashi Tofu. FML \n\nConclusion: $113 tab for an appetizer, six pieces of sushi, a cocktail and a glass of wine....  \n\nFirst time I have ever felt so financially sodomized. \n\nI am excited about their next door spot \"Shaboo\", and I am probably coming back.....\nIt's like watching Mrs. Doubtfire over and again: it fucking sucks, and you know what's going to happen, but you still end up crying a little
