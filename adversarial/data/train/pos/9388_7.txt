I own a restaurant and I feel HORRIBLE for the owner of this restaurant. Do you know that KIDS are running your place and treating customers terribly? We came in 1 hr before closing. We just left at 9:07 and closing time was 9. I saw on the door as we left. We got no chips and salsa until we asked for it. Water, we asked twice. The waiter showed his face at our table very rarely. The food was cold and not good. We were the last ones in the place and I KNOW the workers could hear us making remarks about how this is every Yelper's dream come true. (Remember I am a restaurant owner. I NEVER leave a bad review for a restaurant because of that.) They never said a word to us, never apologized for the bad service. They don't care. If you own this place and you are reading this, I would fire every person closing tonight.
