Need to first start out by saying Jamie, the cleaner, seems like she would've done a great job and she was very nice and understanding, unfortunately for her, poor communication and customer service is not her companies strong point.\n\nThis is a long review, if you don't feel like reading the whole thing i'll sum it up:\n-probably a good cleaning service (didn't get that far) \n-bad business\n-offensive manager\n\nI called yesterday to schedule an appointment. Now, unlike many other cleaning companies, their model is a bit whacky. They don't charge you per hour, they charge you a flat rate based on home size. They also have levels of service (deep and basic) with add ons, BUT you can't get a basic unless you have a deep cleaning (of course). So after explaining our needs and time constraints to the scheduler we decided on 11a today and about 3 hours would be needed as we had to leave at 2p for appointments.\n\n11a today rolls around, no cleaner and no late notice. I email stating my concern and i get an email back saying she hit traffic and will be there by 11:30 and a reminder that their confirmation email gives the cleaner a 1 hour window....hold the phone....when considering a time constraint of 2p and a 1 hour window, how does 11a work when she can show up by 12. 12 + 3 =3p and we expressed our availability after 2p being limited. \n\nSo we had an exchange of emails expressing how this was unacceptable and i wasn't paying $115 for a 2 hour deep cleaning of 1br and 2baths + common area (kitchen\/living room). That is nearly 60 an hour and there was no way it would be done completely.\n\nThis is when it gets good.\n\n1130 rolls up and no show yet. I email and they said she was lost looking for our house.\n\n1150 rolls up and no show, i email asking for a call.\n\n11:56 i get a call and the cleaner shows.\n\n12:01 i am on the phone with Juan, the manager\/owner of the company and cleaning has commenced.\n\nPhone call with Juan:\n\nI explained my concern with not being notified she was running late, being quoted a time frame without being told the one hour time window up front and how this rendered the cleaning dead from the start, and the fact that if we were to continue we would need her to be complete by 2:15p.\n\nI told him that i am not confident this deep cleaning can be done in time and we want the basic cleaning for the rooms specified and we are confident it can be done as it's really only about 1000 sqft. \n\nTurns out they quoted us 2900 sqft while our home was stated as 2200 sqft, he told us the whole thing was our fault, and our only options were to let her finish, come back, or leave the key for her to lock up.\n\nNot sure how any of this was my fault, not sure how it was my fault for not notifying myself of the cleaner running late or omitting the arrival window or falsely quoting the homesize.\n\nJuan gave us some alternatives, reschedule, let her lock up, or even let someone come back the next day. When we opted for the latter - he said \"no, no, no we can't do that.\" - wait, what, you just offered me that option.\n\nI will not be using this company again, i wouldn't recommend them. Unfortunate because we require bi-weekly cleaning.\n\nJuan was offensive, told us they weren't comfortable cleaning our house and we were harassing him. Ironically, this conversation was going on while we were having a friendly chat with Jamie, apologizing that she was caught up in this mess with her employer. She was very understanding. Too bad we can't hire her.
