Traveled here for business. The wigwam is a VERY pretty resort and I stayed for 5 days. Some rooms seem not as worn\/new than others (600 section seems to be a more recent addition?) I stayed in 241 which was nice but felt a little dated. I did like the size of the room and the patio area is a nice touch. I could hear the other people in the room adjacent (entire convo) to mine and the air felt stale in my room. The safe batteries went dead but I didn't inform the staff as I was leaving that day. I forgot a toothbrush and when I called, someone rushed over and gave me one and toothpaste to get by. I enjoyed the toiletries offered and they seemed to be of good quality but my room had no tub whereas some others did. My room was always picked up daily.  Late room service is non existent and there isn't much near by. The breakfast offered at the bar was surprisingly good and not too pricey. We ordered the BF sandwich, burrito and pancakes.  All good eating.  Check in\/out was easy with no long waits. They offer a tray of oranges each morning in the lobby which I thought was nice touch. \n\nMy only complaint was the staff at the bar (Melody).  One in particular was VERY rude and impolite to our group. She acted as if she did not want to be at work or serve us. Not sure if she was having a bad day but my team and many other patrons were not happy with her actions.
