There's an abundance of hot pot restaurants in Chinatown Toronto but I'm a big fan of the Little Sheep chain. This location is basically AYCE because you can go through 3 rounds of food selections and there are other premium selections that are available at an additional cost.\n\nTheir broth choices are milky (bone marrow broth) and spicy but you can also do half and half, AKA yin yang style. Beware of the peppercorns in the spicy broth because it's more of the numbing spice feeling! The meat is good quality and the portions are generous. They also have appetizers (ranging from cold noodles, seasoned veggies, etc.) that you can pile up on while you wait for your food to cook. They also have a self-serve create your own sauce bar and offer dessert! Service was also friendly and we were checked up on frequently.
