What is the hype all about?  To say we were disappointed is an understatement!  We started with a Frito Pie; salad with a few hunks of brisket and a couple of corn chip strips. Main course; brisket and pulled pork with collard greens and corn. Brisket was DRY, pulled pork was ok, certainly nothing special, even the collard greens ( usually my absolute favorite) were terrible. Actually, when our tray was cleared the greens and brisket were largely untouched. The corn was definitely the highest point of the meal. \n\nMy daughter has a gluten allergy which we stated as soon as we sat down. We of course asked what was gf and ok for her to eat. Our waitress had to go back and forth to the kitchen to inquire individually for each entree\/side instead of asking  the kitchen about all of the gf options upfront. Very frustrating!  The servers that we encountered  simply served, no personality. They never even asked if our meal was ok or wondered why we sent back most of our brisket and collards. \n\nGive all of BBQ choices in Pittsburgh I'd stay away from this one. The place was pretty much empty at 8 on a Saturday night.....no fun vibe like we expected.
