Zack's is OG in the hamburger game.  I love places like this.  Nothing special on appearance and food, but yet there is something so special about a place that has history.  The burger was good and I liked the shoestring fries.  The price is cheap as all hell.  Every once in a while a few of us at work hit this place up for lunch.  It seems to just be one of our go to spots. Don't expect a kobe patty or anything, just an old fashioned hamburger place.
