Called several places before this guy and they all quoted me high prices.  This place gave me a fair price and did an excellent job that's why I'm giving him 5 stars.  He had a nice little shop that's open to the waiting area and you can see them working on your car, i like that.  It's clean and well kept plus there's a TV to watch to kill the time of you are so inclined.   Did i mention the owner is very professional.  Just call around and get some quotes then call this guy he will pick up the tax if you pay cash also.
