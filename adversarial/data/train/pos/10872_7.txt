Um, all 4 people in Paradiso when I dropped in at 7:30 in the morning to grab a cafe mocha gave me this look like I was an alien as I walked through the cafe.  Next time I come back to Urbana, I'll get my strange look ready in response.\n\nAll the tables and chairs look like they're from dorms and classrooms in the 1950s.  Gives the cafe a worn, unique, and... musty... feel.  Woot for free wifi.\n\nMy cafe mocha was just like you want your men... hot and strong.  I knew I walked in here for a reason.
