Jason was a very easy going instructor who did not rush anyone even though we had a few stragglers in our class. The class was at TGI Friday's so we were able to order food and drinks as we painted. The portrait was fairly simple and only required three different kinds of paint colors: blue, white, black. But the end product was o so perfect, which displayed a bright moonlight with sillohueted lovebirds and a bird's nest sitting atop tree branches. His instructions were easy to follow and he made sure to go around and check everyone's work. He let people work at their own pace but making sure to keep the class on track to finish on time. My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed this class and now we have a souvenir to place on our walls to remind us of this Date. Would definitely sign up for more classes!
