If you have ever been to any circus you have seen the acts in this Cirque show. The only difference is the size and setting. The acts are very good and the acrobats very talented, but we were somewhat disappointed after reading all of the glowing reviews and after paying the highest price for any Cirque Show in Vegas. It just didn't \"wow\" us. We will try one more Cirque show, maybe Michael Jackson or something like that, but O was very over rated, in our opinion and the prices were just not worth it. I DO HIGHLY recommend Le Reve at the Wynn. Hands down better than any Cirque show.
