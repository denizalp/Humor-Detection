This local roastery offers an clean place to sit, a cute vibe, and an exceptional cup of coffee. The menu is relatively simple, but they focus on the quality and technique - so don't expect verbose descriptions or to get foam art masterpieces. Their almond milk latte was full and smooth but without the burnt or acidic aftertaste.\n\nMore than the great coffee - I was  impressed by the welcoming staff who seem to be genuinely nice people. I ask a ton of questions... and they almost seemed happy I did! They are on the pricy side, but I'm looking forward to coming back.
