The Las Vegas Hilton is a full service hotel which has many hotel rooms, pool, hair salon, spa, shops, restaurants. Made the reservation with hair salon and makeup at 10 AM, went back to room to dress up at 12 PM, grabbed a beautiful tiara on the way at the shop. Went to the chapel at 12:50 PM. Everything is so close by. \nThe ceremony only takes 20 minutes. They provided everything, including flowers, photographer, wedding coordinator, and a pastor. \nThe pastor needs an extra fee ($65 of cash). We also tipped the photographer. The nice certification with a hard cover is $20 in cash. \n\nGlad we went there. We also received 20% discount on room reservation. Because we are HHonors Gold VIP, our breakfast buffet was free!!! \nOverall, It is a perfect deal than most of the 4-5 star hotels in Vegas.
