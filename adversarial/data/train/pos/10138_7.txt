I love the feel of the restaurant. Nobody can take that look away from them. This is what a Southern diner should look like. It's done right and not over the top. That's what gives it that character you expect to see in a chain restaurant. Then again, I just said it was a chain. And like most chains, the food is a hit and a miss, depending on the day and the employee on duty. This is \"family owned,\" but it's a chain, folks.\n\nI've been here three times for lunch. The prices are decent for the food I'm getting, but nothing really urged me to come back. And that's something I won't be doing for a good while. Now, before I continue, I went here for lunch, but wanted to try their all day menu items. It should be safe, right? Hmm...no. \n\nWe went in and had great service from the start. There is NOTHING wrong with their service. Our server was probably one of the BEST I've seen in a long time. Ordered our food and got some biscuits while we waited. Love the biscuits though. Not too flaky or doughy. Just the right mixture for my tastes. \n\nI ordered the Bacon and Egg combo with potatoes as my side. When it came out, I thought it was joke. It was literally two eggs fried, burnt bacon that had the consistency of an icicle, and a scoop of seasoned potatoes. Nothing special at all. What was worse? I paid nearly $8.50 for this! Are you kidding me. I would've gone to Waffle House and got twice as much and just the same quality if not BETTER. The other meals that I've gotten here aren't too bad, but still run along the lines of mediocre Southern dining to me. And it seems overpriced for the quality of food you expect to deserve.\n\nI'm disappointed. If this is what \"Southern dining\" is, then you can keep it until you prove me otherwise.
