I think I would die without TJs. It's not quite cheap, but it's the least expensive way to eat healthy (fresh, no chemicals and preservatives, etc.). I do the bulk of my grocery shopping here and save Whole Foods for the harder to find items. I eat a high protein, starchless pescetarian diet, the bulk of which is made up of vegetables and fruit. It can be a big challenge to find suitable food in today's supermarkets, but TJs always comes through.\n\nAwesome products include--roasted garlic hummus, trio hummus (the spicy cilantro one at the bottom is the best), low-carb whole wheat tortillas (10g carbs, 7 of which are fiber), bagged salad greens (romaine and baby lettuce), fat free feta, sliced baby bella mushrooms, Tuscan Italian dressing (everyone I've shared it with agrees it's to-die-for), roasted almonds, omega-3 eggs, decently-priced tilapia fillets, etc. My favorite product by far is the Greek yogurt, which is a lifesaver-- it's similar to Fage yogurt, which is high in protein and low in sugar but very expensive. The TJs brand is much cheaper and it's even higher in protein and lower in sugar than Fage. My only wish is that they sold a larger container to save money.\n\nOnly problems--they are often out of stock in things, which can become something of a culinary disaster for me at times. Their produce is definitely not always fresh-- just today I looked through a stack of strawberry cartons full of mold before I found a fresh one. Just be careful and always check before you buy. \n\nAnd yeah, I have to agree with all the other reviewers in saying that I long for a bottle of two buck chuck. Just thinking about it missing from my life (lost in a sea of inappropriately expensive state stores) gets me kind of worked up, so I'll just leave it there.
