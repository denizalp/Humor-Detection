When my cat was alive (RIP, Emily). I really liked Petsmart. They had lots of great name brand foods, toys beds and basically everything a pampered pussy could want-- at great prices.\n\nNow that I am the owner of a fine feathered parrotlet, I find their avian selection to be lacking. This past weekend we went to look for a larger travel cage for Marvin-- something that we could actually use for a smaller cage to house him in when going places and bringing him with us, as he spends a lot of time out rather than locked up. They had nothing but big cages that were over $100. Not  a lot of selection for food dishes with covers, either. If there's no cover, the bird can sit with his bum over the bowl and guess what---? Poop in it. Gross.\n\nIt's nice that they have the in store pet grooming and the adoption center is nice, too. But I think Petsmart is better for dog and cat owners. If you have a smaller pet, you might do better at Pet Valu or Menagerie, which is where we usually shop for Marvin.
