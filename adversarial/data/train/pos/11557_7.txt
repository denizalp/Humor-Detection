Our first stop on the \"Microbrew Mini Crawl\" (it's not a real crawl if you only manage to hit three bars) was Tenaya Creek Brewery.  Tenaya Creek is a solid craft brewery in Vegas, about 6 miles off the strip and next to a hospital.  In fact when we arrived the only things that stood out on the street were the hospital and the brewery which was sort of odd.\n\nTenaya Creek is all about the beer.  And this being Vegas there is of course a little gambling thrown in.  They do not serve food.  No kitchen on site.  I recommend either picking up some tasty takeout on your way here or having a pizza delivered to Tenaya.  They don't mind.\n\nBack to the beer.  The Hefeweizen (4.8%) is a solid full bodied brew...very tasty indeed.  The 10th Anniversary Double Altbier (9%) is yummy and has an interesting heft.  Not very sudsy and with what I can best describe as a hint of a \"beer liqour\".  The Monsoon Double IPA  (7.6%) was double hopped and really popped.  \n\nOverall, Tenaya Creek was my favorite of the microbreweries that we visited and had the best beer and best selection of beer.  Next time I go I'll bring dinner in.
