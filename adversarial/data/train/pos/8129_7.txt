All it takes to get in here is a Platinum card ( which is actually pretty easy to get....it aint like getting a Centurion card).\n\nIf you got a platinum definitely use it. It is a great space to relax, chill, grab a cocktail away from the mad rush outside. Better WiFi than the airports too!!!\n\nKeep in mind a lot of people have platinum cards and it does get hella busy.
