A total shit hole. \n\nI walked in here to get a gallon of distilled water for my neti pot and this place was soooo disgusting and weird (I don't think I have ever been in a CVS?) I walked out. \n\nWhy in the f would you have carpet in a pharmacy type place, it's disgusting. Do all CSV's have carpet? I hate carpet PERIOD but seriously how do they clean and scrub this place when they have pill popping sick people tramping through this place 24\/7. It's next door to UMC a hospital (a whole other ball of dirty wax)! \n\nCreeps me out at the thought of ever having to step foot in this place ever again. I won't.
