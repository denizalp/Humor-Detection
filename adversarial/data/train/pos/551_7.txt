There's another hospital closer to me, but I've heard too many horror stories about that place, so I choose to come here even though it's a good 20-minute drive. \n\nI go here for routine visits, check-ups, etc. Why is it that every time I have a doctor's appointment, they take me in within 5 minutes, but I end up waiting in the room for 30 minutes or longer???\n\nFacilities are nice and clean. Staff is polite. I've been to the ER here on a previous visit and everything went without a hitch. HINT: (this applies to all ER's, not this one in particular), if you're injured and need to go to the ER, don't go during a shift change - sometimes they may forget to tell the next shift about you! That's only happened to me once at this ER.\n\nRecommendation: If coming here for an appointment, bring a good book or other form of entertainment, because you're gonna be waiting a loooooong time! My doctor said to blame it on Obamacare.\n\nSide note: in the event you are hospitalized and have to stay here, the hospital food isn't your only option. Jimmy John's is right accross the street, and they deliver!
