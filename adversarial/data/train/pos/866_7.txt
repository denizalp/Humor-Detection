Others seem to love this place, unfortunately my experience wasn't the same. Came in and waited nearly 5 minutes just to be acknowledged and was told I should be seated shortly. After 15 minutes of waiting and watching other folks come in and I was still ignored by the host, I gave up and left. \n\nNormally I wouldn't write a review like this, but this is my second experience. I was here two months ago and had a very similar experience where I was ignored and ended up leaving to find another place to eat.
