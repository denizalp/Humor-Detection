Definitely see myself here at least once a week. Clean restaurant, friendly staff, and damn delicious tacos.\n\nToday was Taco Tuesday, which means $1 tacos! I'll be honest, I like that they offer it, but they only do a couple of different proteins and limited styles. So even though I'm paying a bit more, I still got the Locos Al Pastor. Pork so good you wouldn't even think it's pork (sorry Pork lovers, I'm usually don't get excited about it). Outstanding fresh toppings piled generously on 2 authentic corn tortillas per taco.\n\nThe salsa bar is great as well. I've taken quite a liking to the Pineapple Habanero, but it's just a bit to spicy for me so I cut it with some of the mild salsa. It's been fresh and delightful every visit to Sabor.\n\nLee served me and Jeremy was behind the line today. Great service, I've been to the Sabor closest to my house and was real disappointed with the crew. Glad that this one really values it's customers.\n\nNext time I'm getting one of those fancy margaritas! They have a selection of mixed drinks on the menu on the side wall so be sure to check it out.\n\nKeep churning out those authentic tacos and I'll be a long-time customer!
