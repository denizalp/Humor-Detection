Strip.\n\nRight on the strip, baby.  This CVS location is right next door to the Monte Carlo and the perfect spot to run to for forgotten items such as bath items and bottled water.\n\n1 large CVS brand of water ($1.63) and I was set for the evening.\n\nIn addition, they have a large variety of snacks (a friend of mine purchased a popsicle for dessert) and typical Vegas souvenirs for the so inclined.\n\nThis location is open 24 hours.  Perfection!
