This was a great meal! The wait staff was friendly and attentive and the food was innovative and very yummy. I had the eggs Benedict with salmon. The fruit tasted fresh as well and coffee was always being filled. You will also get what you pay for since the portion sizes will fill you up. Overall, Cora's is a very innovative and tasty place to eat!
