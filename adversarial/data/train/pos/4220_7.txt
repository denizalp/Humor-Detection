This is half of a $17 shrimp and grits which we asked to have removed from our bill because it was awful and I was pissed about spending that much on a tiny dish like that.\n\nThe food is here kinda going downhill and doesn't stack up to the places to each side of it. The prices are insane!\n\nNice gals working here though. Drinks are stupid expensive as well.
