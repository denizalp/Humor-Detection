kensington is my happy place . i love the people, the food, the vibe .. i love everything about kensington . it makes me feel like ive stepped out of toronto . i love how everyone and everything is so full of character . i love how everyone is doing their own thing with a face as if theyre doing exactly what theyd want to be doing at that moment . it has such a carefree, positive, peaceful vibe . i can spend all sunday afternoon strolling around, checking around the vintage shops, eating unusual authentic ethnic food (catus taco, anyone?), watching people walk by, checking out unfamiliar ethnic products from one of the little supermarkets, stuffing myself with pastries from one of the bakeries .. theres so much to do . oh ! cant forget about blue banana ! they sell all sorts of really interesting stuff from different vendors inside the store, it's really fun to just walk in and spend some time checking everything out !
