I had a problem with my agent during a sale and the president, Jeff Sommers, said that I shouldn't worry about having to pay several hundred dollars in extra utilities since his agent had saved me from having to pay my full mortgage in my short sale.  Anyone who has done a short sale knows it is the owner who has saved the money and that the agent is just doing the transaction, pushing paper.  They take no responsibility when there are problems and recommended I take the buyers agent to small claims court.  They knew I had been wronged but would not help or rectify the issue.
