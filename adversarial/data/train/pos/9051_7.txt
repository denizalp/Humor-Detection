I went to another location with my family a long time ago and have been wanting to go back ever since.  The  location that I went to before did not have the BBQ.  I really like this place.  Butcher paper on the tables or the bar, food served in a plastic bag and the BEST hushpuppies I have ever had.  Plenty of TV's to watch whatever you want, friendly staff and the food was good.  When I went this time I had 2 lbs of crawfish and hushpuppies.  My buddy had the King Crab legs, he said that they were good.  I will definitely continue to go back.
