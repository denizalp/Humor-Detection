I need to preface this by saying that I have never seen the Evil Dead movies before 2015.  My boyfriend is a huge Evil Dead fan.  He was excited about the Ash vs. Evil Dead TV series on Starz.  So when I happened to mention that they had a musical in Las Vegas, he really wanted to go.  We bought the GA tickets from Vegas.com.  Just a note, there's some ludicrous note about picking up your tickets at least an hour before the show at the Tommy Wind theater, don't bother.  Your name is in the computer on the list for the show times.  They couldn't print me tickets because their printer was down.  I really wish they had mentioned it because I drove all the way into Vegas to pick up the tickets instead of checking in at my hotel first.  It was a waste of time, especially since parking at the theater is $5 and there are no in and out privileges.  \n\nThe musical is endorsed by Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell so it must be good, right?  I have to say, some of the actors are really great.  Some aren't so much.  The show incorporated both the first and second movies.  It vaguely referenced the third movie which most people ignore anyway.  It's full of gore, blood, deadites, gratuitous cleavage, innuendos, and campy references.  Some of the jokes worked, some didn't, but most people had a great time.  They have a \"splatter zone\" that you can pay additional to sit in but it's more of a super-soaker experience where they spray you with what smelled like watered down Hawaiian Punch or Kool-Aid.  I would not want to be sitting in the splatter zone but there are those who did and loved it.  The cast even has time to pose for photos after the show too if you want to wait around.  If you're a true Evil Dead fan, you might want to check out the show next time you're in Las Vegas.  They've been in Vegas for 4 years now.  3.5 stars.
