Barber shops are terrible.\n\nHeres how the business usually goes: Barbers who cut good hair have super long wait times, and the barbers who suck handle the newbie walk-ins.  These terrible barbers prey on new clients coming into the shop, luring in these lonely souls who are unknowing to their lack of skills into the barber chair, and turning what would have become a masterpiece of a haircut into a massacre.  Of course your politely tip, agree that it looks good, and say \"Thank You!\", but deep down you hate it, and in your soul you vow to never go to them ever again.  But then a month rolls by and you crawl back into that barber shop, with all the pro barbers busy again, and that lonely bastard barber who ruined your life last month is waving you back into his chair.\n\nJimmy's is something special. It's not really a barber shop. Being that Vegas is in the middle of a desert, I'm declaring this place an oasis.  It's honestly nothing like I've ever experienced:  You're greeted with a smile, a beer, and a wait time.  It's a long wait, but once you decide to sit down, you're guaranteed to walk out with a great hair cut.  Forget about running into that one newbie who cuts terrible hair, cause everyone goes through Jimmy, and this guy is a prodigy.
