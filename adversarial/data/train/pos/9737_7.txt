Been here 5xs now. \nDined in 4xs and took take out tonight at midnight because no one else was open. \n\nCustomer service is awful. No personality and seem stressed being the only one on the floor. \n\nI ordered the shrimp don and my mom ordered the tempura udon. Both were awful. I asked for udon noodles and we got home and found out we had cold soba noodles in a cold square instead hot udon. \n\nWon't be back. \nBest to dine in.\n\n1 Star for late night hours.
