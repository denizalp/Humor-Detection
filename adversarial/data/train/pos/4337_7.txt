EH....... I'd prob only come here for a drunk after hours bowl of pho. We came here sober, in hopes to cure some of our hangovers with a tasty bowl of pho, but to our disappointment the soup was really off and a tad bit over priced, but of course non comparable to T.I's pricing.. but that's a whole different story. So, long story short... this place is not that great.
