Feels odd writing this review right after putting one up for the AZ Hindu temple ! Talk about having  issues ! \n\nMoving on, I love the atmosphere, and as many have rightly noted this place is timeless in its décor and the low light adds to the ambience. I like the feel the dark wood and leather gives and if you add the aroma of a good smoky scotch you'd almost believe you were in some alternate era. Ok so maybe I'm going a bit overboard and I am pining for a good single malt on the rocks, but I digress.. getting back ... As others have rightly noted that it is (thankfully)  devoid of the clichéd Scottsdale crowd I have not been here on the weekends to fully substantiate that. \n\nThe weeknights are rather sparse and I tend to enjoy the solitude the place offers. The drinks are spot on and the prices are what you would expect.
