Place was delicious! Staff is friendly and efficient and the location isn't too bad with it bing less than 2 miles from exiting the I-10. The sesame chicken was my favorite main dish. The carb rangoons don't look like they're tasty but they really are. The pot stickers were good, too. Orange chicken was average and the terayaki salmon was tasty.
