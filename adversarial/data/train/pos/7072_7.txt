This was once the only Alternative station in Las Vegas, and it quickly began going downhill in its more recent years. With 107.9 now available, this station is well on its way out.\n\nWhen this station first came about around 1996, they played the best music of the day - Nirvana, Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots - essentially bands that are now considered classic alternative rock artists. It used to be, if you heard a band on this station, they were going to be around to stay.\n\nBut then the station shifted direction towards nu-metal - an utter disaster if you ask this reviewer. It's now nothing but one-shot bands who all sound alike, trying to get their 15 minutes of fame. It used to be I could turn on this station and hear an \"instant classic.\" Now the music on here is so hit and miss that it isn't the great station it once was. They still play the occasional alt rock classic and such, but it's so few and far between.\n\nWith 107.9 now around, you can pretty much consider this station useless. They play ALL the classics, and keep the new stuff to a comfortable minimum (and what little new stuff the other station plays is sure to be here to stay.) 107.5 is still a decent alt rock station, but why bother when there is a station superior in every way?
