Even as a Chinese student, I never feel the staff have basic courtesy at all. Every day they serve you with their disgusting faces as if you never pay for your bill. When I see their faces I feel no appetite. This is the Chinese restaurant that I have WORST impression. When friends ask me to go eat Chinese, I must ask whether they are going to EVO. If they say Yes, I say No.
