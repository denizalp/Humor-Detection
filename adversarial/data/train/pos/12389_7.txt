My son had a nasty cough for several days so I figured we would run by Minute Clinic to get him checked out! Well this particular Minute clinic is inside CVS in a remote little spot with a three chair waiting room.  \n\nYou have the option of phoning in for an appointment, registering online or simply just walking in. The wait is not long because there are usually two physicians on site.  \nThere was only one person ahead of us so and Heather got us in right away, she throughly checks out my son and the total in and out time was 20 minutes.
