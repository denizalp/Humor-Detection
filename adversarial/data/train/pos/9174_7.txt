30 something bucks for me and two kids.. meh\n\nI had the steak which was a cheap cut but cooked perfectly. Decent sides of toast and baked potato. Not a bad meal for 9.99 with the salad bar, unless you remember that the place 'down under' serves a real steak and a great salad and bread for the same price. \n\nKids had salad bar, they were happy = free 'ahem' dessert.
