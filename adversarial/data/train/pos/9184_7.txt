We received great service from Luis and others. I liked the vibration of the staff and location. \nWe ordered from the lunch menu, and while the food was good, it just was not great, too much sauce on the items, and no really great salsa to go with the chips. I tried several, but they were all either too sweet, or too spicy, but not one that was just great. I prefer a spicy chunky salsa.\n\nI have been spoiled by Leticia's and Juan's Flaming Fajitas so my standards are higher when it comes to quality and flavor. \n\nI would visit this location again based on the great service throughout the entire visit. They also serve Pepsi products exclusively, which to me, as stated in other reviews is a bad customer service decision.
