I vote the next location opens in the San Gabriel Valley, California! It's painful to have to wait until a Vegas trip to fill my belly with this delicious fish (and mochi ice cream)!\n\nThe cuts of fish were above what is typical for an AYCE sushi gig. The scallop nigiri was fresh and tasty. The cut of fish simply named \"white fish\" was really good, too. I could eat unagi anything all day long. \n\nThey have many rolls to experience as well. My personal favorite was the spider roll which was huge, and had the best combo of ingredients and sauces. I like that you can order half orders of rolls, so that you can try a greater variety. \n\nThe desserts were wonderful, too! The vanilla and strawberry mochi ice cream balls were the best. The tempura ice cream ball was next best, and the green tea (wasabi-looking) ice cream came in at a close third place.\n\nThe best part about this place is all of the choices! You get to try such a variety of great-tasting different things, and even experiment with things you've never had the opportunity to try before. \n\nAn entertainment aspect of Sushi Mon is they have some pretty awesome names for their rolls... We had many \"that's what she said\" comments with their creative names, especially the famed \"Monster Roll\". I also can't wait to try multiples of the Orgasm Roll next time! Should be a real treat! ;)
