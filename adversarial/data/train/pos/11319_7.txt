We did enjoy our starting garlic shrimp appetizer and the Spicy Vodka hot condiment was a plus point. But pizza connoisseurs like us have tasted the finest Napoli treats and I'm sad to say that although topping wise Lamp does a truly good job to source excellent product, the one singular ingredient to create remarkable pizza missed the mark and that my friends is the pizza dough itself. \nWhether it likely a poor imported flour ratio or over rested dough, but whatever the case it makes for tough and hard as cardboard texture. Sorry to say we'll likely not return for this reason as well as DC Ranch pricepoints. We'll stick with our other Scottsdale fave for now.
