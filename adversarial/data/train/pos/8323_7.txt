I hate to be the one person who isn't crazy about this place but....I wasn't crazy about this place. The first day I came in there were two snarky younger girls running the front desk who I did not care for. I had a groupon for 2 months of yoga and one of them said \"why didn't you get the 3 month?\" I replied that I was starting a new job and..., then was cut off with \"you didn't know if you wanted to do yoga anymore teehee. Not awesome.  I attended both of the classes offered in the morning and the bikram in the afternoon. I felt like the morning classes were identical despite having different names and the bikram class was the same as the morning classes except they turned their AC off... The pace is very slow and concentrates a lot on breathing (more than most classes I've been to)....this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it just didn't really do much for me. I like doing yoga for exercise, but this studio is definitely more yoga for relaxation....so if that is what you want, this place is for you, the morning teacher even sings to you at the end of class.... The teachers were nice, although they didn't do any of the moves with the class so there wasn't really a model for how things should be done. Anyway, the space is nice, the building is older and has some character. The actual yoga area is carpeted while the rest of the place is wood.....I don't really understand why they did that because I find balancing is much easier on a flat surface like wood, but at least the carpet didn't smell bad. Finally, this studio doesn't have a lot of times when classes are available, especially for people who have jobs. So I guess it turned out that I didn't want to do yoga there anymore after all (since I can't make the times during the week and they have very limited times on the weekend) and I was glad I didn't waste my money on the 3 month pass.
