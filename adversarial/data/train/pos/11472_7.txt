I really enjoyed this chic-like, fun froyo shop. The staff was especially cheerful. The design is in soft greenish-blues and my favorite colors. I couldn't pass this place up with a variety of specials that they offer. I was initially lured in from the advertisement with Harkin's Theater to save your movie ticket for 20 % off at Yogurtini.  They also have Happy Hour specials: Monday through Friday, 11am to 2 pm get a 16 ounce froyo for $4! (Regular price .42 cents per ounce.)\n\nBTW Thank you Yogurtini for allowing your customers to try out flavors on their own vs. having them get a flavor you want (that's a total turn off and I don't visit those froyo shops.)\n\nThis place is kept clean and they apparently have over 90 toppings?!??!?!!!! INSANITy!! Great for other patrons, since I never top mine off. I just prefer it as is. I did like their \"cake batter, plain and blueberry\"! Super YUM! This place is next to Elevate coffee house, so it's extra special to hang out on a Friday night when they have their live music. Double your pleasure for sure! \n\nI LOVE the colors so much and their work t-shirts that I want one for myself! :)
