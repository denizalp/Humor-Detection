The Little Woody is the trendiest dive bar in town.  Is that a good thing?  You can judge for yourself.  \n\nThe \"bouncer\" gave me a tip on when a chill crowd is there, but I won't be sharing that with you!  Of course, if you are like me, the time to go is NOT on weekends, when college students and arrogant twenty-somethings overtake the place.  \n\nThe coolest part about The Little Woody is they have Skeeball!  They also have Foosball and a couple other games, but Skeeball takes the cake.  \n\nOf course, if you don't heed my warnings and you go on a weekend, there might be a blonde who drank far too much hogging Skeeball; she might try to start a fight with you and your friends when you try to play an empty lane.  When you make it clear you will not tolerate drunken shenanigans, she might go into hiding for awhile and then reemerge even more drunk.  Well, at least that's what happened the first time I was there.\n\nStill, the place is pretty nifty.  \n\nI'm not sure how much the drinks cost because, well, I'm a woman.  I don't think they could be too pricey, though, since I heard no complaints from my thrifty friends.\n\nIf you're one of those people who has to always do what the cool people are doing, go ahead and bookmark this one now.  ;)
