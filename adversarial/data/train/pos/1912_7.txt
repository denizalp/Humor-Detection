I'm neutral at this location because on some days its great, on other its not. \n\nHere is a lists of problems\n- Dumbbell weights only go to 75 LBS\n- Car parking is only for 2 hours, by the time you get up to the gym and changed and how busy it is all the time, you run the risk of having to pay for parking if you go over by a minute. \n- Very snobby clientele which I've caught just treating the gym like a social club rather then a gym\n\nHere is a lists of good things\n- There is free parking for 2 hours\n- Variety of machines, squat racks, etc.\n- Great looking people for both gender (which is great motivation for those who need a constant reminder as to why you are at the gym)\n- Staff is friendly\n\nOverall it's an okay gym for the location.
