Picked up some donuts for my buddy.  I have been to other Bosa donuts before and they were awesome.  Came to this one since it was the closest location to where I was.  I got a half dozen.  The only bummer was that they did not have my favorite kind....buttermilk bars!   Fresh out.  Whack!  Their donuts are delicious though and warrant 4 stars on their own.  If you have a chance to try the buttermilk bars, get them immediately.  Possibly the best donut in the land.  If I am ever in the area, and craving donuts, Bosa is usually always the right choice!
