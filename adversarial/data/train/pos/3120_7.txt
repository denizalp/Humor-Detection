Cool place to check out and loved that they offer a variety of food options. I came here for a quick lunch and ordered the serrano wings, papaya salad, and five-spice cornish hen with rice. The food overall was fine and a nice change from your typical Vegas food. \n\nserrano wings- a little plain, but nicely crisped\n\npapaya salad- love the peanut flavoring, and the nice chunky pieces of shirmp\n\nfive-spice conrish hen- the chicken has some nice spice to it and the sauce is a nice complment
