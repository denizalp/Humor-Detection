Solid food, good service and easy access...\n\nThe location is on Buffalo, right off the Summerlin parkway. \n\nThe bagels are delicious, the cream cheese is really fresh and they do some serious meats! (The bacon, sausage, cornbeef and chorizo are all great) \n\nGreat spot for a solid east coast breakfast\/brunch.\n\nEnjoy!
