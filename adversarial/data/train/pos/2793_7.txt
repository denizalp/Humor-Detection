This review is specifically for the Afternoon Tea that is offered at the Petrossian Bar.  \n\nReservations are a must - I recommend at least three days in advance.  \n\nThe Bellagio is my favorite hotel\/casino property in Vegas.  It screams class with elegance and between the graceful fountains, the nothing-to-prove Italian decor, and the opulence of the conservatory, not to mention the splendor of the Cirque du Soleil \"O\" show... it's just out of this world.  \n\nThe Petrossian Bar is an extension of the bar right out of NYC, known for it's Sunday caviar tasting, elegance, and supper-club feel.  It is a great place to relax, pre-dinner\/pre-show, enjoy a cigar, have a nice glass of scotch, listen to the piano, people-watch...\n\nThat said - it has NO BUSINESS doing an afternoon tea!  NONE!\n\nIt doesn't matter how the food tasted (decent) or the tea selection (average), or the service (forgettable), because eleven feet away from you is a slot machine going DING DING DING DING!  And smokers!  And flashing lights and there is -nothing- relaxing or sophisticated or magic about this tea WHAT. SO. EVER.  Just a disappointment from beginning to end.  \n\nBellagio!  Take this sad attempt at a tea time and move it to the Cafe!  Shut off a section of the cafe that overlooks the plants and conservatory and put it there!  At least there will at least be a visual with no slot machines, smoke, or other elements that otherwise destroy a grasp of tranquility!\n\n***This is currently the lowest rated Afternoon Tea in Vegas on my list.
