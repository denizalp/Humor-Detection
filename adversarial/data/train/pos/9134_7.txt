Wow. Sorry I tried to help. The last thing I was expecting from a 3 star reviews (that pinpointed exactly what could be improved on) was being attacked, blamed and not believed by the owner (see comment by business owner below).\n\nIf you can't take constructive criticism well from your own REPEAT customers then how can I feel confident that next time I visit your business that I would have more than .0002 seconds to look over the menu or I won't have to eat watching an employee using her cell phone (that I doubt she washes every times she uses it) in the front of the house. If that is going on in the front then I don't want to know what nastiness if happening in the back?\n\nBlaming a customer that requested time to actually be fully in the store before asking what she wants is completely unacceptable.\n\nSo Business Owner let go of your ego, stop attacking customers that give three stars and perhaps listen to us.\n\nI won't ever go back. I have updated my review to a one star because of the ill response I received from the owner.\n\nI'll go spend my money where my concerns or suggestions are appreciated.
