Every city needs a place where middle-income-ish people can buy wedding gifts for their friends who want something a little funky and unusual but who aren't so far out there that they expect their presents to be hand-felted from dryer lint. \n\nThe Secret Village is that place. The kitchen-y section in the east building is a scene of major housewares lust, and it's mostly the \"ha, you'll think I got this in a little shop in Paris!\" sort of dishes rather than the \"fine china, once a year\" dishes. The west building has the cards you'll need in wrapping presents for your nuptials-bound friends who get the dishes. \n\nThe back building is where the boho gifts and tchotchkes live -- upon close examination, the stock is more mass-produced and less exotic than even at the much-lamented Green Woodpecker but since there's nowhere else in Phoenix to even think of finding weird bits of items, how picky can one be?\n\nGo make your friends have celebrations so you can buy them coffee mugs here.
