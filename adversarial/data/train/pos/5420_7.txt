I came here for mani&pedi combo and was disappointed to learn that the prices raised from $30 to $35 in the last few years. But well, another place just 2 blocks away charge $40, so I guess it's okay.\nTogether with tax it was $40+tip, about $45.00. Wow, I guess I'll do my own mani pedi from now on, or find a bit cheaper place.\nSapnadid my nails and she did a very good job! My mani (also pedi) lasted more than a week (11 days in total) and no chip at all! I think it depends how well the job is done, what nail polish is used and how careful you are afterwards.\nMy only complaint is that few nails had missing polish in the corners (that I didn't even notice for 2 days, so no big deal). I definitely recommend Sabita - such a great person with friendly attitude.
