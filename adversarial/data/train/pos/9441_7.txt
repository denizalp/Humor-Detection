I have this weakness for Prix Fixe Menu... I just could not forgo a good deal. \n\nI have to say Il Fornaro has the most extensive menu I ever see in an Italian restaurant... There are over 15 main entrees one can choose from including pasta, meat, fish and pizzas.\n\nPrix Fixe Menu ($25)\n\n- Baby Arugula Salad (tons of goat cheese)\n- Veal Chop (over cooked and dry but with tons of veggie on the side)\n- Tiramisu (creamy and tasty)\n\nand \n\n- Caesar Salad (fresh and crispy with the right amount of dressing)\n- Linguine Pescatore (tons of seafood, huge scallops!!!)\n- Chocolate Cake (meh...skip!!)\n\nA good value for $25, but without the prix fixe then this place would definitely be a 2 star.\n\nServices was efficient but cold. We got all our food fast and hot... but no one really care to come to ask us if everything is ok? The waiter just left the bill on our table when he served us the dessert... that 's really odd in a restaurant.... we felt like he was trying to get rid of us?!\n\nIl Fornaro serves OK food at a great price point but I don't know if I would come back because the services here just not what I expected....
