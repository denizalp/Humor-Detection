Stopped by for dinner and pleased. The chips and salsa and bean dip were great. I mentioned to our server that I like spicy stuff she went to the kitchen and came back out with some of their spicy salsa. It was very spicy and fresh. It was cool of her to do that and said it can be requested on future visits. \n\nI ordered the carne asada casero burrito but asked them to leave off the bbq sauce and add tomatillo instead. I also asked to have just meat, cheese and sour cream inside my burrito and no rice on my plate. When my burrito came it looked so good but when I cut it open there was rice and beans along with the meat, cheese and sour cream. I was disappointed because I said that I did not want any rice and was specific about what I wanted in my burrito. I could have said something but didn't want to wait for it to be remade and just ate around the rice. The tomatillo sauce was very good and so was the burrito aside from the goof. When our server came to check on us she noticed the pile of rice on my plate and was upset my burrito did not come out right. She offered twice to have it remade but I explained that it was fine, and that she even noticed meant something. My wife loved her meal and had no complaints. Service was great and we were checked on often. This is a legit place to eat and I will back.
