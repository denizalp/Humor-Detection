***************PUPPY MILL ALERT*************\n\nMy wife and I came here on 3\/16\/16 hoping to find a puppy, they had some adorable pups and we really liked two of them. One was a beagle\/pug mix and the other was a beagle\/English bulldog mix. However we were soon saddened and shocked after we asked to see the names of the breeders....\n\nOne was Henry Wagler who has 10+ violations with ASPCA and is a known puppy mill owner. \n\nThe other was Jolyn Noethe who upon searching her in Google showed she's had multiple protests at her kennels for abuse and having a puppy mill. \n\nThe owner will usually reply back with \"we screen all our breeders carefully\" but that's a total lie!! It takes 5 seconds to google them and see they are all from puppy mills and the breeders have multiple violations!! \n\nThey sell these dogs for absurd amounts from $1500-5000 and get them for $100-250 from puppy mills. I will be writing to other sources to get the word out about this place.\n\nDon't ever come here or buy from here!!
