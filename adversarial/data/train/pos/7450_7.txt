Normally, I don't have much to say about fast food chains but the reason this is actually special is how fresh and delicious the food we ordered was at this particular branch!! \n\nMy husband wanted to get a quick bite while we were in the area so we passed by the drive through and he ordered the 2 for $6. He picked a whopper and the chicken sandwich. I decided to try a couple of bites each and it was just delicious!! I can't tell what the difference is. We have a Burger King branch close to our house in Mesa and it cannot compare to this one! It was hot and fresh and tasted great!\n\nAlthough I am not a big fan of fast food, I think this branch just ruined me! Lol. Stay tuned for more check ins at this location!
