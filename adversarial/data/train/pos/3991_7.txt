They've got high marks on Yelp, but I was disappointed. It's an AYCE spot off of Lake Mead Blvd. and I found most rolls to be poorly crafted. Rolls were falling apart before even picking them up and they seemed to have an excessive amount of rice. The quality wasn't great either with one roll after another leading to more disappointment. The best of the bunch, though was probably the Jony Jony -- a spicy tuna roll wrapped with different cuts of fish. The green tea tempura ice cream wasn't bad too. Although the tempura batter was a little too thick for my liking.
