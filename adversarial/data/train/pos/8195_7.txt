Good lunch spot. The rolls are a little on the unimaginative side and coming during HH only gets you a minimal discount, but they have a surprisingly extensive menu complete with vegan options. That said, I still only get sushi here- the salmon-asparagus roll is a favorite. The chirashi is a little basic, but the fish is fresh. The poke bowls are a better choice. \n\nBonus points for offering free brown rice substitution on all rolls. They also have gluten-free soy sauce available and a 10% LVAC members discount (dine-in only). When getting takeout, they usually throw in a cup of edamame.
