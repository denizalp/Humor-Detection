I finally had a Fez burger!  meh.  I went away less than amazed but it was my own fault.  I ordered what was popular rather than what I thought would appeal to my palate.  I had a Fez burger with a side of sweet potato fries.  Both the pears and the bbq sauce were sweet as was the cinnamon on the fries.  For me it was just too much sweet in one dinner.  What I will order next time is a different burger and I was informed I could order the sweet potato fries with just the dipping sauce without the sugar\/cinnamon dusting.  And those fries are not the thin soggy ones I had had elsewhere, they are nice and crisp on the outside and stand up quite well on their own.  The burger came out a perfect medium and I did not ask to have it less the cilantro, which I don't care for, so I could have the burger in it's normal form.  I did take the cilantro off the second half.  I happen to like burgers on ciabatta bread so that was fine. \n\nThis visit was sort of spur of the moment.  I had found out where I was meeting folks for a couple of drinks that evening did not serve food and I decided food was in order first.  As I was driving across town on Indian School it didn't take me long to realize how close I would be to Fez!  I got there during the last 1\/2 hour of happy hour and the parking lot was packed and I started wondering if I was going to be able to sit anywhere.  I was greeted by Thomas, the GM, almost immediately and he asked what kind of atmosphere I wanted and I explained I was just looking to grab a quick burger on the way to someplace.  He found me a spot in a quiet corner that was perfect.  I had my water right away and my server showed up quickly and took my order.  The wait for the food was reasonable, especially just finishing up happy hour.  My server stopped by on a regular basis and Thomas came by just as I was finishing to hear any comments I had.\n\nI went away happy I had chosen Fez for dinner.
