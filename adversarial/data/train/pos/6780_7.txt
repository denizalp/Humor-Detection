This is definitely my favorite place to eat on Yonge between Bloor\/Dundas.  I've come back to this place a few times already and my friends love it too. \n\nI walked by this place for years until one day when I was really desperate for Korean food. I guess I never gave this chance because of it's sketchy appearance from the street. The inside looks like an Asian internet cafe or something; everything's black and sketchy looking. \n\nThe FOOD however is fantastic. The first time I came was for lunch with a friend. We ordered Bulgogi, Porkbone Soup and their Flaming Hot Chicken. The Bulgogi wasn't actual Korean Bulgogi, BUT it was delicious. It was pretty much stirfried meat and veggies without any spices or anything, but still sooo good. The Flaming Hot Chicken was good too but definitely not spicy at all.It did come on a clay stirfry plate though so that was pretty cool. I didn't like the fried rice it came with though; it was pretty much just regular rice soaked in oil and cooked some more. The Porkbone soup was fantastic. I pretty much get it every time I come here. It comes out still boiling in a claybowl! They give about 4 large pieces of bone with lots of meat still on it. \n\nRice and Japanese salad come with your meal. (Order the specials, they're half the price and better than the dishes they have.) Water comes ice cold in a Korean alcohol bottle (lol). You can also ask for additional Kimchi and spicy sauces for not charge. Dinner prices are just 1$ more than lunch. \n\nService at this place is decent. All of the waiters are fobby Korean guys who could pass off as any k-pop star. Definite eye-candy if you're interested. \n\nThis place always has a steady flow of Koreans. How can you not trust Korean food from a Korean? Definitely wanna try the fried chicken next time and definitely coming back again and again.
