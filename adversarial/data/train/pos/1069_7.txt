Joey Eaton is in a great Location at Yonge and Dundas close to everything and anything.\n\nDrop by with my Yelp Drinking Buddy for a late night drink. I do appreciate that Joey has a drink special everyday. The food though I find a little boring and pricey.\n\nCheeseburger Sliders ($11.49)\n- Mini cheeseburger? not bad? not good?\n\nBaja Fish Taco ($13.49)\n- diced deep fried fish and shrimp\n- not memorable... not going to order again... \n\nServices was nice and pleasant but we just could not get our bill... Our waitress was busy with other tables and never came back to check on us.. all we want to do was pay and leave!\n\nJoey is OK... If you are a sport fan. I don't mind watching a game or two with my friends but I definitely don't want to go on a date at Joey... ever. \n\nWill I be back? Maybe for a drink when I am in the area, But would not be wearing my Little Black Dress to any Joey's location ever!!
