This place sucks! We ordered a medium pepperoni pizza... what'd we get? a medium pepperoni pizza.... barely any sauce and extra EXTRA extra cheese X3. It was loaded with so much cheese, it was disgusting. I never thought I could hate cheese so much. I guess next time i'll have to say \"add sauce... light on the cheese\" (if there is a next time). Just thinking of that pizza makes me gag. ugh.
