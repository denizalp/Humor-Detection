They go the extra Mile!  \n\nMy girlfriend complained that her A3 is very hot in the summer... for 3 years!  So, I decided that instead of telling her to get the windows tinted I made the appointment and brought it in myself.  The Audi A3 has a ton of windows, it's basically all windows.  I had them install the legal limit and also a clear tint on the windshield and sunroof that eliminates almost all UV rayes!\n\nThe cars back window motors are broke... it's just one of those things.  Well, that is a bit of an issue for the installation process.  They explained to me it could severely affect the end result but they would try their best.  Well, the windows look great, if he wouldn't have said anything I would not have guessed that there was an issue at all.\n\nThe price was a little lower than I would have guessed for the scope of the work provided.  Use the yelp deal and get $25 off.\n\nMy girlfriend is also super happy with the tints, and notices the temp diff.  She also loves the clear tints because it doesn't affect night driving.\n\nThis is the only place to take your car for window tints.
