These are definitely hot pockets in the sense of \"hot\" meaning what's happening and what you should be noshing! Not, Hot Pockets, the sad grocery store staple of bachelors and latch key children. \n\nI had the opportunity to sample a Roamin' Dough creation at the Vegas Spring Social. It happened to be a vegan variety because I couldn't resist black beans, green chiles and zucchini! The pocket exceeded my expectations. It wasn't light and fluffy. The pocket itself had a slight sourdough taste, which I loved, and the fillings were nicely seasoned and generous. The pocket was accompanied by a cilantro avocado sauce. Everything went together like a well thought out gift. And, all while keeping it vegan, so kudos for that!\n\nI just wish it were bigger! I could have easily consumed two of these numbers. I was hungry. It was delicious.
