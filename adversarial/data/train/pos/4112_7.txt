DO NOT BUY their TV warranty!! What a joke!  Stuart lied his ass off about the warranty!  It's been 2 years and the 75\" Samsung went out on us!  Every feature that Stuart said was part of the warranty WAS NOT!  I've had a broken TV for 3 weeks and all I am getting is a bunch of excuses.  I will never shop here ever again!  I hate being lied to!
