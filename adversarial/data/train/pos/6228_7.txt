One cannot go wrong with a sweet treat on a hot Valley of the Sun fall day!  This DQ has solid offerings, is clean, and they are pretty quick with the orders.  My issue is with the extremely angry, moody, rude older Hispanic woman that works the counter regularly on Monday afternoons... She just oozes hatred... Hatred for her job, hatred for the customer, and hatred for everything in life... And that's why I can't and won't give this place anything more than two stars; because every time I head to the freezer for one of my tasty DQ treats the bitter, angry woman appears in my head!
