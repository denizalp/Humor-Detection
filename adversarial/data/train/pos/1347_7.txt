I ate here after the dinner rush on a Wednesday. I was able to get a table in the bar area right away. However, it gets busy during dinner so reservations are recommended. I started with the shrimp cocktail and New England clam chowder. I had the San Francisco Cioppino for my entree. Everything was great. Service was good. If you're looking for a good seafood restaurant with reasonable prices, give them a try.
