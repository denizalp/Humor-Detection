First time here for dinner before going to see \"Man of Steel\" at the best movie theater in town.  A popular spot with Yelp peeps, I was pleased to see that they offer breakfast all day.  I had the eggs, Portuguese sausage, and rice for the bargain price of $5.50--deal!  The sausage had a nice little kick to it, but I only got 4 pieces and about 3 cups of rice--for reals.  I think there should be some equity in proportion, but it's so cheap, I guess I can't really complain.  I really can't complain because I didn't even pay--thanks, BP!  Friendly service and a good selection of Aloha eats--mahalo!
