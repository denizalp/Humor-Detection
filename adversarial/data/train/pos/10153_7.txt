My lil man came in with a temp of 104.1 when 102 was normal. Dr. John Graham treated him to the best of his abilities. Talked up the bill as much he could, even over administered Sub-Q fluids.  Popeye died 2 hours later. I couldn't even return unopen, unused medicine.  Never again will I trust this place after nothing but positive experiences with Dr. Thomas and Dr. Benard.  A healthy 14 month old cat goes in with slightly elevated temp and is dead 2 hours later because even Dr. Graham said 'Im chasing ghosts, so I'm treating everything.'
