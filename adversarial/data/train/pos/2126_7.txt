Like most people, I'm sure, I just can't get enough of that Orange Julep!  Sure, a lot of people say it's like Orange Julius, but it's not the same.  Whenever I travel on Decarie and see that big orange ball, my heart is filled with excitement and joy.\n\nOK, the gushy part of the review is over now.\n\nIn practical terms, don't expect a haute cuisine experience here, this is an old-school diner style restaurant, just without the indoor seating.  In previous years, the servers used to bring you the food on roller skates, but now you just pick it up yourself at the window.\n\nThey serve regular chain restaurant food: hot dogs, fries, hamburgers, poutines, along with a few other options like tuna sandwiches and salmon patties.\nAs a vegetarian, I appreciate that they offer veggie burgers, veggie hot dogs, and even veggie pogos!  These kind of things are often hit or miss, but at the Orange Julep I've always found the veggie options to be very tasty.\n\nExtra bonus, the poutine gravy is veggie-based!\nAdmittedly, I find the fries to be rather disappointing, but all I really care about is the cheese (and not eating meat), so I'll settle for the compromise on fry quality.\n\nGibeau Orange Julep has been a Montreal fixture (in various incarnations) since 1932.  If you haven't been there yet, what are you waiting for?
