When we're traveling, we love to check out the local Costcos to really immerse ourselves into the local culture and see how the natives live.\n\nThe locals at this Costco are just as friendly as the ones back home.  But, they do have some exotic items that are foreign to our own Costcos, like glass rifles full of tequila, wine and poke!\n\nThe parking spots are on the small side and the gas station is east of the building.
