In a pinch, I came here because my ABS light was on.  I was heading up north and wanted to make sure everything was functioning properly so I wouldn't have any problems on my trip.  I dropped off my car at 2:00 p.m. and told them I was bringing it in because of my ABS light.   They said they would call me when they figured out the problem.  Luckily, there are some shops close by so I just walked around and waited.  By 4:45 p.m. I hadn't heard back from them but they had told me they closed at 5:30 so I walked back.\n\n As I approached the business I could see that my car was already done.  I walked inside and got my wallet out to pay and the guy told me there was no charge because they couldn't figure out what was wrong with my car.  I told him the ABS light was on, that's why I brought it in to them.  He said \"Oh, yeah, but we'd have to run a diagnostic test to figure out why that's on and we don't have enough time for that because we are about to close.\"  I couldn't believe what I was hearing; I knew they'd never pull a stunt like this with a man.  It got ugly after that, I'm not proud of the way I behaved, spitting may have been involved.  One star is way too kind, I wish there was a blacklist option.
