Perhaps if I were \"hammered\" I would have enjoyed this meal better... I was sorely disappointed in this BBQ spot. I ordered take-out on a Sunday, and when I arrived I felt something was off right away. The place was dead... Not one person in the gigantic dining room, only two people working there sitting at a table looking bored. The bar however was pretty lively, maybe I should have just sat down and had a beer instead of getting food. \n\nRibs - all char and fat, barely any meat and extremely overcooked\nPulled pork - lacked flavor and came in a canister of grease\nThe sides, corn (half a cob is considered a side for two??) Cheese grits, worst I have ever tried, dry and flavorless\nCornbread - perhaps if it was used as a dry sponge\nBBQ Sauce - disappointing at best, watered down and we were only given 2 tiny containers (like salsa sides).\nPeach Cobbler - canned peaches poured in to a container with a crumble on top\n\nI really don't like writing scathing reviews, but  there was not one redeeming item in our meal. There are tons of great BBQ joints in Phoenix, this is not one.
