Sydney's is where as a sugar momma I would take my beloveds to shop there! To dress them up in suits and jeans in those slim European style cutting. \n\nNice selections of casual wears and suits that they will alternate to be fitted perfectly. The salesperson here are professional and well dressed! And I don't know why I kept smelling this pleasant scent while I was browsing the store... \n\nPrice is on the expensive side.. but don't I want my beloveds be dressed like they are right out from the European GQ magzine!\n\nWhat caught my eyes is the cute little doggie in the hand knitted wool cardigan... hey even dogs are dressed so classy at Sydney's!
