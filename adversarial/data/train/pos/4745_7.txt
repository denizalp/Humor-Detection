This place is great for lamb lovers like me. So many different types of lamb dishes, most of them delicious. \n\nWe ordered a few dishes, all containing lamb. The ones that I remember:\n-lamb soup: I didn't like this one actually. Seemed like they added some flavor to try to mask the gaminess, but I didn't really like that flavor. When I order a lamb product, I want the gaminess! \n-lamb dumplings were excellent. Among the best that I've had\n-had a lamb noodle dish that was the special of the day. This was also really good. Probably our favorite dish of the night\n-stay away from the lamb chops! They were really salty, and also a LOT of fat pieces (in fact, there was more fat than meat)\n-cumin lamb on toothpicks was delicious as expected\n\nWill definitely be back. Would have been 5 stars if not for the fatty lamb chops
