I had never seen a food court version of this Maryland seafood stalwart, but I thought, why not give it a try? It is located in the food court in Caesar's Palace, and unlike most places in the casino, the prices did not seem out of line. Unfortunately, the recurring theme of feeling cheated in Vegas continues here. \n\nSome choices weren't bad...the lobster roll, though the most expensive item at $15, was at least a reasonable version with plenty of large chunks of real (though bland and tough) lobster. It even came with waffle-cut fries. They did not have cream of crab any of the times I asked for it...the lobster bisque was just ok...no chunks of lobster. It kinda tasted like Costco's version. The New England Clam Chowder also tasted like it came straight from a can...inoffensive but edible. \n\nThe real outrage were the crab cakes and the fried scallop roll. These crab cakes were not even the mediocre ones usually served at Phillips restaurants on the east coast (though they were priced like them)...no, I am pretty sure these were straight out of the box Phillips-branded frozen \"crab cakes\" sold at Costco. As a native Marylander, I was offended. The topper was the realization that the \"bargain\" scallop roll at $9 was a manifestation of the devil's science lab...they figured out a way to use surimi to fake scallops! Come on man! Bay scallops are relatively cheap...but you just had to use fake bay scallops???\n\nComing to Vegas in the old days, you always had an idea that they were giving you the finger behind your back...now, they do it right up in your face. Sigh.
