I'm a little torn about writing this review.  I went with some girlfriends for Happy Hour,  I got there just at the tail end of the HH, so I ordered some of the HH food while I waiting for my friends to arrive.  I ordered the bruschetta, only the last 4 on the list are part of the deal, so I ordered one of each.  Also the Ortagio plate is 1\/2 off during HH, so we had that too.  It is a lot a vegetable for the amount of hummus you get.  For the price is not bad.  The bruschetta were good but nothing special.  My favorite were the first two, the one with gorgonzola and sweet fruit and the one with the olive tapenade.  Now the wine list by the glass is really short.  My friends and I decided to try the tasting card.  This is where we had some hiccups.  I thought the idea was fabulous.  I started with my first pour, we opted to get the minimum pour, so we could taste more.  First one was without any issues.  The second one, the server suggested I hit the half pour and that I will be charged only the amount it pours, because it had enough for the 1 1\/2 oz pour, but not for the 1\/2 glass.  When I hit the button, I got less than the 1 1\/2 oz pour.  I called the server immediately, and had him compared the amount to the one my girlfriend had gotten (she got the 1 1\/2 pour of another wine), mine was 2\/3 of hers and I was being charged a lot more.  I told him I wouldn't mind paying almost $8 had I gotten the amount they claimed I was served.  The manager came over and she offered a $5 credit.  My third taste the same thing happened and I was done with the tasting choice.  I ordered a glass of wine from the wine list.  Then one of my girlfriends tried to get another tasting and the same thing happened to her.  She did get a credit also, but it is a little annoying to have to call the manager and start comparing pours.  The place is nice the food seems ok, but I am not sure I will do the card next time I come.
