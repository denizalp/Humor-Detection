Ordered the Mutton Chettinad, Goan Shrimp Curry and Kerela Fish Fry. The fish tasted really fresh and the spices were great but the mutton had undercooked potatoes and barely had any flavour and the shrimp was the frozen kind and extremely oily. \n\nI wanted to like this place but I was very disappointed so won't be back again.
