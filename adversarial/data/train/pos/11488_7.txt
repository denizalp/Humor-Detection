I've had Street Cafe bookmarked for a couple of weeks, ever since reading a positive review by one of my Yelp friends. I was surprised to find that Street is literally in the same strip as my current area favorite, Maverick Coffee!\n\nBased on the pictures and previous reviews, I knew I wanted to swing by for a warm mug of coffee and a breakfast sandwich. The food, in particular, looked tasty and I was excited to try. I chose this morning for a visit.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS\n\nUpon entering Street Cafe, I was warmly greeted by a woman who introduced herself as Lisa. Turns out, she's one of the owners. When Lisa learned that this was my very first visit, she made a point of getting to know me.\n\nLisa also took the time to tell me more about Street Cafe. She told me how the business was in place as a non-profit with a mission to help feed the hungry and teach important life skills. I had no idea of this before she told me and was VERY impressed by the concept.\n\nLisa then introduced me to their menu. They keep pricing simple: just $5 for the breakfast menu items, $6 for lunch. She was also excited to show me a fresh batch of organic Guatemalan coffee beans recently roasted on-site.\n\nNaturally, I ordered a pour-over of the Guatemalan and paired that to a breakfast sandwich (the Alpha & Omega Breakfast Burger). My total came to just $6. I then found a shaded seat just outside in the European-style cafe alley.\n\nFOOD & DRINK IMPRESSIONS\n\nIt was not long before Lisa was delivering a steaming blue mug of fresh coffee to my table. The brew was very tasty, especially for being a first run at on-site roasting! (Hopefully they still have it available when you, dear reader, decide to stop by for a coffee!)\n\nThe food was delivered shortly after the coffee and it was very tasty. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the sandwich included a side of potato cakes. (As much as I enjoyed the sandwich itself, those potato cakes were the stars of the show. Wow! So good!)\n\nOnce I had finished my food, Lisa surprised me with an icy cup full of an experimental cold brew coffee, explaining that she and the chef (her husband) would love my opinion of it. (My opinion was that it was one of the most unique and flavorful cold brews I've ever had.)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI took my time in the cool air of the alley, reading and writing and listening to music. I couldn't have felt more at home. Everything from the ambiance to the outstanding service experience to the delicious and fairly-priced food MORE than exceeded my expectations.\n\nIf you haven't been to Street Cafe yet, I cannot possibly recommend it highly enough. I have never met more dedicated and caring business owners. I left today feeling like I had made new friends, and I will definitely be back - frequently.\n\nThank you, Street Cafe, for being such wonderful hosts! And thank you for all that you do for your community-in-need via this inspiringly creative non-profit concept. I'll be sure to send people your way every chance I get!
