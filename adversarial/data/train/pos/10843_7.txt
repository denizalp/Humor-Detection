I really wish I took pictures of the food to show how bad it was. \n\nI ordered their pizza (yes pizza) and it was not only cold, but soggy too. Frozen pizza literally tastes better than what I ate. \n\nThe other people around me ordered pasta type dishes and it was really bad too. \n\nThis restaurant doesn't even deserve any more time from my review, so I'll just end it by bluntly saying, THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!\n\n(oh wait, lets not forget the rude waiter in the pony tail, whatever your name is. bad food and bad service, hmmm great combination ehh...)
