Okay, a few months ago when I came to this location, I went to the bar & waited & waited and was completely ignored till I ask for a manager. She gave me her card for the next time I come. Well I wasn't looking for a freebie so I ignored it\nToday I went after all this time, I sat alone at a two seater table, waitress was very sweet. \nThat wasn't my issue... a gal came around w\/ her broom& dust pan cleaning the floors, could she have waited till I was done eating before she pulled the chair in front of me to clean! And my feel weren't dirty to be dust off, which I don't think she was aware of it. No smile or excuse me! Pissed me off!!!! Can you wait till I'm done next time!!!
