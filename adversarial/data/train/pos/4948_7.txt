Not closed... however I bet the staff wish it was. My waitress was grumpy and before I even sat down she said she would not be there for long. The sitting was tight and i believe they only have a total of 12 tables.  the food was pretty good.  the corned beef omelet was tasty and the hash browns were some of the best i have had in this area.\n\nnow only if they can get their head out of their ass and know that the online reputation is shot .  the last entry was that it was closed.  when i brought it to their attention it was almost as though they had never seen a smartphone.  \n\nso A on the food and a D on the service.
