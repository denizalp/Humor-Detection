Levack is a mystery to me. All my slightly older friends kept wanting to go here about 2 years ago. Everytime i went, there was a lineup and the inside was packed to the titties. But it seems convenient for birthdays in the 30+ age group, trying to relive a little bit of youth funk in a 'too packed to be just a bar but not really a club either' atmosphere.  \n\nThe good part though is you get into an older and more mature crowd so you avoid all the crap that is now being associated with Queen\/Ossington area. The music is ok. The front room looks fine, then the back room looks almost dungeonous. But you're probably too drunk to care.\nI guess if you're with a good group of friends, this place isn't too bad, but i would never willingly want to go here.
