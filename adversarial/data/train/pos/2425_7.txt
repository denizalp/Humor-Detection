Okay, Metro can get rid of that bench warrant for me, issued for living here more than 12 years and not seeing Mystere until tonight, for the first time.  I've seen other Cirque shows, but I think I enjoyed this more than all the others.\n\nThe seats were fabulous.  (And did I say free, thanks to that great site that gives us free tickets?  Well, not totally, since we have to pay a very reasonable yearly membership).\n\nThe show was dazzling, funny, visually stimulating, and at times hypnotic.  The music seemed to encompass an array of ethnic derivations, ranging from Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, Asian, and African drumbeats, and mercifully never ear-shattering.\n\nI wonder what inspires a child to turn to his mommy and say \"When I grow up I want to do a headstand on a man's single upturned foot while he rotates his body 180 degrees while lying on the floor.\"  The acrobatics were fearless and awe-inspiring, and also terrifying when I thought one of those high-flyers was going to fall on top of my head.    \n\nPart circus, part vaudeville, part Summer Olympics, all beauty.  This show has something for everyone.
