A good friend of mine had some time to kill in the city while waiting for his bus, so we met up and walked about a block.  Their colourful signs  caught our attention and we decided that we were both in the mood for breakfast at 2:00 PM.\n\nThere were about 4 or 5 other people there; this didn't really change over our 40-minute eating\/catching up.  Everyone got quick, really friendly service.  I was actually surprised at how fast our food came.  It was probably less than 5 minutes.\n\nI had The Classic Breakfast:  Eggs, bacon, home fries, and toast. It was a pretty big portion size and served at the perfect temperature.  Even better was the seemingly never-ending supply of those little packages of jam and peanut butter.  I love those things.\n\nTry it out, and DEFINITELY get the fresh squeezed orange juice--unless you have a thing against pulp.
