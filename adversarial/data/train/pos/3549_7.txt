I was in the neighborhood and had bookmarked WhereUBean Coffee for a visit, after reading Karen W's Review. \n\nThis is an old style coffee place. Reminds me of the dozen or so eclectic, bohemian places that use to line the streets in greater Seattle and Bellevue when we lived there. Where have you gone Tully's?\n\nMeaning... the friendliness of your Battista and comfiness of the seats were all that mattered. Oh and of course, a good cup of Joe. \n\nHere, James was very friendly while making my Ghirardelli Mocha, the coffee was good and the leather seats comfy. 'Nuf said.
