Wow, it is sad that you are deciding to keep this issue going and not let this go.  You picked the wrong person.  I know you requested Yelp to remove the picture of my son's chin, and that is fine.  I didn't fight them, because I have better things to do.  I was going to let it go.  But now, I will post it in all the sites I will find.  You were not there, so YOU cannot say ANYTHING.  Per my request, and because I have worked for doctors before, I had them put my child on a wrap restrain, which by the way, they were putting it wrong first.  I had to help them put it in place, since I knew how it worked.  By the way, you think it is ok to put a child under anesthesia to remove sutures?  I am sure you are going to have a BRILLIANT reply to this.  My child's pediatrician did it in less than 5 minutes.   Oh, and by the way, Chad, your personal insults are comical, and do not hurt me at all (think skin).  Your rating reflects your performance, and the way you are handling it, it is even more evidence of your questionable practices mentioned by other reviewers.
