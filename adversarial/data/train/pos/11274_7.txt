Came here around 7 for dinner and the place was pretty empty. This should have been the first sign for me to grab my things and run. I would have saved myself from bland food and saved my pockets some cash. The service was actually really good. Our waitress was super nice and accommodating. She explained all the food and what to expect from each dish. She was super quick and got our food out fast. The food however was disappointing. The food was very very bland. I really expected more from the Bellagio. I will not be back and with so many different options in Vegas I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. For the price point you can much better quality food elsewhere.
