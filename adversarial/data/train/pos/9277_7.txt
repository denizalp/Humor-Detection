I never intend to, but somehow, each year I manage to ruin major holidays by gorging all the See's Candies before anyone in the family ever gets to sample any.\n\nAt first I'm all, \"I think I'll skip breakfast today and have one with my coffee.\" Then another, and another, and after a while, I'm like, \"Aw, fuck it.\" \n\nI don't know what happens, but once I eat one of See's 'Nuts and Chews', I lose my motherfucking mind, slipping into an eating frenzy so pronounced I practically want to devour the box.\n\nAnyway, they cost a small fortune but are worth every penny. \nI bought a one-pound and a two-pound box a couple days ago, the price tag was fifty three bucks. \nIf you do the math, that works out to just under 4 cents a gram, which compared with coke at $40  a gram, is quite the deal. \n\nIf you have an addictive personality, you may want to glom onto this See's thing. Just up your workout regimen a tad and load up. Try about a dozen with a couple of Monsters first thing in the morning and get ready to kick some boo-tay at work.\nAt least for a couple hours anyway.
