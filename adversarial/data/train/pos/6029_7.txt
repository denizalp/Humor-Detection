I tried the ribs. They were by far the worst I have ever had. The formula here is for Elwoods to buy the cheapest worst quality ribs they can find, then sell them to you. This is how a shrewd business makes a bigger profit margin.\n\nRibs + onion rings + tea = $22\n\nThese are NOT baby back ribs. These are full grown hog ribs that are stringy fatty flavorless and have a large sheet of thick rubbery membrane material all along the bottom of the ribs. The ribs have little pork knuckles at the ends of the ribs that you will have to spit out. The rack of ribs I got had a few white tendons at the end of the rack. You know, where the bones stop and white tendons (that look like giant fish bones) begin.\n\nTo be perfectly fair, I will have to admit that the stringy fatty flavorless meat did fall right off the bone. I was thinking to myself ... if a turd falls off a stick, does that make it a good thing?\n\nThe sauce used on the ribs is tangy. So you can't get away from that odd aftertaste.\n\nI'll never forget where I was when I had the crappiest ribs imaginable. I was sitting right there inside of Elwoods. Elwoods, \"home of the poorest quality, lowest grade food out there\".
