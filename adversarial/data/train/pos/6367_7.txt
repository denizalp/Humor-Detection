$9.00 for canned tuna excuse me tuna nicoise is just not going to work for me. Not in this universe nor any other for that matter. \n\nThe Bluebird Kitchen has hours until 3pm.  I arrived at 2:50pm and not wanting anyone to have to prepare something that close to closing time I opted from the tuna nicoise salad with the mustard dressing. Now hear me out on this one. When the dressing is the best part of the meal you know you're in trouble.  \n\nThe description of the salad said, \"Yellow fin tuna cured in oil. Oh come off if BBK, yellow fin, and cured ought to be removed out of that description. I feel smoke going up my breaches and I don't like it.  I do not like far reaching menu descriptions and inflated prices for a tuna salad.  I had to grab a  copy of the menu after I started eating.  I had to reread the meal description to double check what I had gotten myself into.  I don't care what kind of tuna you started out with. Once it goes in the can it all becomes the same tuna when you take it out of there.\n\nThe space is very lovely, big windows and bright , airy and sunny.  I would love to go back for a cup of coffee....but I'll get my tuna salad elsewhere for now. \n\nSwitch to tuna steaks, add another $1.50 to the price of the salad either that or take $4.00 of the price of the salad and let it be what it is.
