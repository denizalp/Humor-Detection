Avoid at all costs!\n\nI went to this location with my wife while she was car shopping for a new Accord. There were two other couples walking around the lot looking at cars as well when we pulled up. There were about six sales man working and not one asked if they could help us.\n\nAfter fifteen minutes without any service we left! I will never step foot on their car lot again in life!
