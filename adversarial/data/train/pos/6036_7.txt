I absolutely HATE THE SERVICE HERE!! The lack of customer service is unwelcoming and borderline disrespectful. On every.single.visit!!Wether it's dine in or take out! \n\nThe food is good and it's in my neighborhood so that's why I always come here. \n\nOnly the elderly woman is nice. I think she's the owner. She's the ONLY ONE there that makes you feel welcomed and doesn't give you an attitude when you ask for something, e.g. check, extra sauce, limes, napkins, water refills and even the check! \n\nNow back to the food. The food is good. But I wouldn't be surprised if you annoy them and ask for extra sauce they give you \"extra sauce\" if you know what I mean....
