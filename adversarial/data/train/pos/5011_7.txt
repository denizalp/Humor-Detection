Me and my boyfriend attempted to order take out, which we have from them at least five times and maybe as many as ten.  We were told they don't deliver to us.  We explained they had in the past (this comes up every time we call) and it always gets worked out.  This time, we were told we had to spend at least 40 dollars to take the order.  We explained that was ridiculous and they had delivered in the past.  We were told that the driver was busy and to make our order a \"priority\", we needed to at least spend $35 (the amount dropped $5 during this call somehow.  What a joke.  We understand it's Christmas Eve, but don't lie to your repeat customers.
