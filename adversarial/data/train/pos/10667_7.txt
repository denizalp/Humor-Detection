The story of how I had a road bump in my Vegas trip due to \"Douchebag Mike\"  \n\nHey Mike, why the long face?  Why the rude comments?  Tryin' to shoot some dice and make some money at the craps table, why are you making bets with my money?  Is that why they call you \"Douchebag Mike?\"\n\nIf anyone is looking to swing by before their stop to the Vegas strip I know someone that can provide you with great service!!!  Contact:\n\nName:  Mike\nAKA:  \"The Douche Bag\"\nJob:  Craps Dealer\nWhere:  Craps table @ M Resort Casino\nProfile:  Asian with a bad English accent\n\nI arrived to M Resort for cheap gambling and a little fun!  All I got was a rude craps dealer who was spreading bets on the table without my permission.  All night he constantly was talking trash.  Until I asked him, \"Hey Mike, isn't your job just to hand me my money?\"  He was pissed after I said that.  After that the pitboss sent him on a solo mission to the break room by himself.  Cool yourself Mike, your attitude sucks!  Anyhow, I would never go back to this casino if Mike is working at the craps table.  I told everyone that I get better customer service on the strip and left.\n\nThanks Mike you suck!
