I bought my new bike, \"Rupert\" here fairly recently ( I name inanimate objects...sorry) along with some accessories. I showed up about a half an hour before close and when I mentioned it the guy said \"no worries, take your time\". I already had a pretty good idea of what I was looking for, a fairly basic commuter \/ hybrid that I could still take on some pretty decent \"distance\" rides. \n\nI never felt rushed to choose. He brought out a couple of different cycles for me to test ride. I even tried out a cruiser that I knew I wasn't going to purchase, just for fun. Once I settled on what I wanted the rest was quick and painless. He even helped me load the damn thing into my vehicle without asking if I needed help. (I did) *mental note... purchase a trunk rack*  \n\nI came in about a week or so later to buy some lights and he remembered me and even gave me a discount because I had made the purchase such a short time prior. I will certainly continue to give Landis my business.....and I will certainly continue to give names to objects. \nVery good experience.
