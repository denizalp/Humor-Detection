Rubio's are a dime a dozen in California, especially in San Diego where it originated from.  Lived there most of my life and I got sick of Rubio's.  Well, now I rediscovered them here.  I was recently in the area for something quick.  It was going either be Aloha's Kitchen, Thelma's, or Rubio's.  Aloha's Kitchen wasn't open, even though it was after 10 AM.  I wasn't in the mood for Flip food at Thelma's.  So, I settled for Rubio's. \n\nI wasn't disappointed with my eats.  I ended up getting 4 Chicken Street Tacos and for good measure, an extra side of chopped chicken breast.  Let's start with the tacos, these were good.  I was a little disappointed with how small they are.  Real street tacos aren't even this small.  But at least they aren't as small as Nacho Daddy's street tacos.  Because they were small, 4 was needed.  It's cheap so I'm not complaining.  I was actually satisfied with my 4 chicken street tacos, but needed that additional protein so I got an side of extra chicken.  The chicken was a bit dry when you have nothing with it, but it's all about the macros at this point. \n\nI tend to frequent chicken grills like T-Boy, Samurai Sam's, and TMAD lately.  But discovered that Rubio's sells chopped chicken breast on it's own too.  You know what that means, I'm adding them to my list fast food healthy eats.\n\nPro Tip:\n-Best fish tacos for a fast food joint\n-Their nachos with chicken, cheese, and sour cream is a must try\n-Addicting Chipotle sauce here\n-Their steak street tacos are my favorite\n-Great service at this location.
