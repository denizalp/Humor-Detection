This show is just meh. It is more of a comedy staring 8 or 9 moderately attractive women.\n\nOne of the weaker I have seen in Vegas. Really poorly organised and as stated by other comments the transitions and content is not the best.\n\nIm not sure if its trying to be smutty or classy? Some of the scenes you just have to laugh at - one from memory was the doctor nurse part where they pick a guy off the floor for what I would call a lap dance. \n\nA few of the girls are gigantically tall too. \n\nDon't buy the expensive tickets.
