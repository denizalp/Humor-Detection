We went there on a Thursday night and as soon as I entered I was surprised by the crowd. The restaurant was 80% full which is impressive for a weeknight considering the fact that the location also does not attract a lot of walk ins. \n\nWe had the appetizer platter and the house wine to start. The house wine is terrible but I was not expecting anything better in an Indian restaurant. It was our own fault ordering wine, not a good pairing at all. \n\nMost items on appetizer platter was tasty but my favorite was the Pakora. Very delicious and fried to perfection. Also it came with two dipping sauces\/chutney which was fantastic. I am sure if they bottle them most customer will buy it on their way out.   \n\nFor the main course I tried, the lamb Vindaloo and the Dal. Both of them were very good. However, the Dal was something special. Probably the best Dal I had in Alberta. I normally try to avoid vegetarian dishes but if every vegetarian dish tastes like this Dal, I may convert ;). Also on the side, we ordered saffron rice and garlic bread. The bread was freshly baked and tasty. On the other hand, the saffron rice did not taste like saffron at all. I really prefer the Persian version of the saffron rice which is more generous on the Saffron :D \n\nI will definitely go back there to try other items on the menu but I am sure whatever I order, I will have the Dal also.
