This place has \"All That Glitters\" -- my go to penny slot machine. How can I not like this place? I'd like it more if there were more than just one \"All That Glitters\" machine, but that one machine is so close to Coronado Cafe that while my party waits in line, I can watch those cascading reels syncopate to the beat of my excited little heart.\n\nThe casino itself isn't too bad. I've seen the rooms and they are nice -- definitely nicer than several of the rooms on the strip. They have really good late night food and they have a Seattle's Best Coffee that serves Selma's cookies (that are very tasty).\n\nI'd give them 5 stars if they had a section with just \"All That Glitters\". Seriously.
