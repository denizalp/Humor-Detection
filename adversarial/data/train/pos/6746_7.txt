Small and no frills but absolutely delicious!!!\n\nI walked into this place not knowing what to expect and was pointed to take any table I wanted. I chose one and sat down expecting for the typical silverware and napkin to be brought and to be asked my drink order. This does not happen here as it is completely self serve, but there was no offense that I was not aware of that. The gentleman told me to help myself and I requested a glass of water to drink, to which he gladly obliged. Only later, after I observed regular patrons, did I learn that even the water is self serve by grabbing a pitcher off a nearby tray.\n\nThe buffet is smaller than some nearby competing Indian buffets (while this is a Pakistani restaurant, the cuisine is similar since most of the Charlotte area Indian restaurants serve North Indian food), but the quality and taste of the food is much higher.\n\nThere were several chicken, goat, and vegetarian dishes including Chicken Tikka Masala, Goat Curry, Pakora, and one of my favourites: Channa Masala! \n\nOne of my problems with several of the competitors in the area is that they are clearly catering to the \"local\" palate and are too afraid to spice up their dishes. While the food here wasn't up to the level of heat that I would order a personal dish, it definitely put a thin film of sweat on my brow and was much appreciated!\n\nThe television runs on an Arabic speaking Pakistani channel (sound muted) and there are a lot of patrons that wear hijabs and abayas, so if you are Islamaphobic, this might not be the place for you.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for a delicious and well priced \"Indian\" buffet outside of Charlotte City limits, this is your place!
