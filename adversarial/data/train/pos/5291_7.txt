Pretty disappointed in you Danny Boy. I stopped in to pick up a deep dish Clevelander style pizza like I have gotten in the past (see my first review) and it was not a good experience. \n\nThe girl working the register\/pick up area gave off an unpleasant negative vibe. No smiles. No friendliness. She was just going through the motions of her job and she either was having a bad day or really dislikes the public but is forced to say a disingenuous \"thank you\" anyway. I tried to ask her about this potato pizza I saw on special and she couldn't have been more disinterested in talking to me. It also took her at least a half a dozen tries to get the credit card machine to work. (I currently have an extra charge pending on my credit card from the multiple swipes, hopefully it will fall off since it is not a legit one).\n\nGlad I checked my pizza before I left. Turns out they made me a regular style Clevelander. Big difference when you asked for it deep dish style. If I am going to be spending $15 on a small pizza I want it made the way I asked for. Deep dish is like this hearty Chicago style pie. The regular version is a bit lackluster. It was dinner time and I was hungry. It was a busy night inside and I did not want to wait for the correct pizza to be made so I got a refund for my pizza and left with just my side salad.\n\nI'm just saddened. I was really craving a good slice of pizza and having to eat just stupid lettuce instead doesn't help. I was very specific when calling in my order and even repeated it to make sure they understood what I wanted. Getting the wrong food was one thing, having disagreeable customer service on top of it just made the whole experience bad and makes me not want to go back any time soon.\n\n**Not sure why an older picture of the mac & cheese pizza is attaching to this review, but ready my previous review on it.
