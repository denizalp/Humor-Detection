I went to Ulta for the first time in about a year to pick up some hair care products. There was so much wrong with this trip that needs to be said...so, here we go!\n\nFirst, when we entered the store, we passed about 6 employees on our way to the hair care products. Not one of them asked us if we needed help.\n\nSecond, after waiting and looking around, I finally found an employee (they seemed to be avoiding us). She just stared at me until I asked if I could get some help.\n\nThis is the worst part...I asked her about a type of product, which she gave me a suggestion for, but then started putting her hands in my hair and looking around. She told me I needed a good haircut and shampoo. I told her I got my hair cut a week ago, at which she wrinkled her nose and said, \"Really?\". I kinda stared at her for a second and nodded. She then proceded to tell me that my haircut is very choppy and frizzy and that she could \"fix\" me. I was so mortified--all I could do was stare at my sister (who was with me the whole time and equally as shocked). She kept running her hands through my hair, then told me she would get price quotes for me and come back.\n\nAnyway, she never came back,  but I had already moved on. I got some very helpful advice from a blonde man working with the flat irons.\n\nWhile I was checking out, I asked for the manager to tell her about my experience. The only thing the manager did was look mortified and tell me she would speak with the employee. This is a nice gesture, but I believe someone telling me I look horrible warrants a little more than an, \"I'm sorry\" when you work in a beauty supply store. Needless to say, Ulta did not make me feel pretty.\n\nOf course, this was also the first time I decided to let my hair air-dry because I want to prevent damage, so I was already feeling self-concious.\n\nI now definitely remember why I started going to Sephora. I will continue to do so.
