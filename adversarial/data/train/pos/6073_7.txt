So happy this awesome little place opened up right near me! Tried some grab and go food here. You can customize a platter for yourself that comes with a meat, rice, pickled turnips (yum) and two sides. I tried the chicken shwarma plate with fries and quinoa salad. The fries were insanely delicious. They come hot and crispy, and include some herb seasoning that you can sprinkle on as liberally as you like (I think it had sesame seeds and oregano?). Actually, everything I tried as delicious and the portions were definitely satisfying. \nI took my food to go but hey have small window seats where you can enjoy your meal. \nOnly downside is that it's only open 7-3 on the weekdays and 7-2 on Sat for the working crowd. Great addition to the neighborhood!
