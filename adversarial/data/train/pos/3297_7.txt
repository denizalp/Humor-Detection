If I pay $6.95 for a Chirashi with miso soup, I should just shut up and eat?\n\nSalmon, Tuna, White Fish, Crab, Surf Clam sounded OK?\n\nShari Rice was poorly done but $7??\n\nServices was decent, food came fast.. and they accept AMEX too?\n\nGinza Sushi is decently good for that price... and I am not complaining... of course there are other options..but if you are looking for a good, cheap lunch special when you have craving for sushi like me.. then just enjoy!\n\nBTW, seems like no one is ordering any of their Thai food item all these time I was there...I guess it is safe to stick with their Japanese selections.\n\nA lot of female eating alone during lunch hour... including me! :P
