Candy by the pound and fun little treats you don't normally see in stores. Steer clear of the regular items that can be found at just about any other grocery or chain store for cheaper. Novelty items galore are available here and it's always fun to see all the comical items they have available. \n\nPrices can be steep, but that's to be expected for the area.
