As far as the west valley goes, Bomboba rules the west.  With their vast amount of flavors and their use of punch cards, it's easy to understand why Bomboba is so popular and always really busy.  I do like how they have tiny menus as I keep one at work.  It's a favorite establishment for my friends but I still prefer an east valley boba place more.  Bomboba has a mushier soggier tapioca ball [not to be confused with soft and fresh] that I don't like.  I still have yet to try their snacks.
