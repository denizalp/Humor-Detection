I have to tell you, after traveling through Southeast Asia eating a lot of noodles, dumplings, and all kinds of delicious food imaginable, I am on a mission to she'd some pounds so it was great that I was able to order their lobster lettuce cup and have it for dinner (minus the fried wonton chips and sauce) and have it be low calorie, delicious, full of flavor and filling!  \nMy son had their hummus platter and needless to say, he also loved his dish!  \nAll at happy hour prices. My bill came to less than $20. Gotta love that!
