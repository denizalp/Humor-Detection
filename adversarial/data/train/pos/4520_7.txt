I like this place in that it is just as big as it needs to be, it seems to have a good selection of brands and from what I have seen of other tobacco shops this place has slightly lower prices (although really there isn't much of a difference when it comes to cigars)\n\nPlus the guy who I assume is the owner is nice and helpful in choosing out a brand that he thinks you would like, or a good cigar for a certain occasion. \n\nnot to mention it doesn't have that pompous atmosphere that most cigar places seem to have, if you are just an average guy wanting cigars (even nice expensive Cubans) you shouldn't feel like you are of a lower class in here.\n\nnot much else to say, its a good place that sells tobacco, plus its in the east end. I believe most smoke shops are downtown.\n\n* he also has a massive selection of bongs, blunt wraps, paper and pipes. Every time I am in there all I see are people buying stuff for weed, he still has a great tobacco selection though.
