I would not even normally write a review for a place like this; you get what you expect normally when going to a chain like this.  I went their recently however and pretty much everything was bad.  The food was so heavy and greasy, the service was terrible, and the waitress was really rude.  \n\nOn their menu, they have a \"Filet Focaccia Sandwich\" which is labeled with an asterisk indicating that it is cooked to order with the standard \"Undercooked meat could kill you\" warning.  I tried to order it medium, and the lady looked at me like I was an idiot, and told me that \"It comes how it comes, you don't get to choose\".  I don't know if the menu is just wrong or what (I ended up opting for a different dish), but her response was ridiculous.\n\nEven if you like outback, I would certainly not recommend this location...
