Clearly this is a bargain hunter's paradise. You really need to be one of those people who love cheap deals and are seriously (SERIOUSLY!) willing to work for it. \n\nI usually come home with great scores. My biggest guilty pleasure are finding shoes and sweaters. Sweaters, you say? Yes, I'm a sweater hoarder. \n\nThis last trip, I came home with two pairs of new boots, in time for winter, for $30 each. A cute Kensie going-out-on-a-date dress for $12. A few scarves for $5 and leggings for $0.99 a pop. \n\nThe negatives about this place are:\n- Long lines for the dressing room. There is a 10 item limit. \n- Place is pretty packed because everyone and their moms is trying to score those same cheap deals. \n- You have to watch your basket because people will try to jack your stuff from it and \"claim\" that they thought the basket didn't belong to anyone. \n- Narrow isle ways and everyone is running over your toes. And, why do people insist pulling their shopping carts through the narrow shoe isles?\n- Parents who aren't paying attention to their kids because they're too busy shopping. Last Chance is not a playground!\n- There's a lot of used stuff. So finding brand new items are a challenge.\n\nDespite the negatives, I love shopping here. Spending less means I can buy more. Yes, I realize I may have a problem. =P\n\nI prefer to not go during the weekends where arguments are almost likely to happen. The parking totally sucks at this shopping center, during peak hours, so it's best to get there early.
