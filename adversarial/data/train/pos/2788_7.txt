I work in a building connected to the underground city so will sometimes come to Place Montreal Trust to have my lunch at the food court. Place Montreal Trust is connected to the underground city and using the underground passage ways, it is in between Eaton Center and Les Cours Mont Royal.\n\nExcluding the cellphone carrier stands which I will sometimes go to in order to pick up something or try to get something added to my account, inside Place Montreal Trust, I will generally stop off at the Dollarama Dollar Store, the Indigo Store, La Source, and Winners. This Dollarama store gets very busy during lunch so I try to avoid it for the most part since there is another Dollarama Dollar Store connected to the underground city in Les Promenades Cathedrale where the lines are shorter and it seems to be run better. All the other stores don't really interest me for the most part. I will also go to Place Montreal Trust and have lunch at the food court there.\n\nI've eaten at the McDonald's, the Koryo BBQ Korean, Tiki-Ming, Subway, and Sukiyaki restaurants within Place Montreal Trust's food court. Place Montreal Trust has free WiFi and it appears to be limited to the food court itself since when I went to the Dollarama Dollar Store which is at the same level as the food court but off to the corner, the WiFi signal was lost.\n\nI find Place Montreal Trust to be a decent\/good shopping mall and would rate them 4 stars.
