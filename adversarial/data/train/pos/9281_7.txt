You forget how lucky you are until you try other places. \n\nThis MCD went through a Renovation a couple years ago and still looks brand new inside. They have the coolest decor, it is all Americana. \n\nThe service is usually quick and I cannot recall a recent time where something was screwed up. Seriously That deserves 5 stars now-a days. \n\nNo play land... yeah! \nDouble drive through ... Yeah! \nCoffee thing with all the special stuff.... Yeah! \n\noh and the occasional crack head... viewing pleasure i guess.
