for once, i felt old. upon entering, you are immediately asked for your id..to make sure you're 18. so you can hookah.\n\nafter the feeling-old bit passed, i felt like a cougar. loads of 18-to-early-20-year-old boys from every stereotype you could want..mohawks and muscle tees? check. plaid button-downs and skinny jeans? check. polos and khakis? check. take your pick. i mean, NO! NO! STAY AWAY FROM THE YOUNGER BOYS.\n\nit's sexy, how blasphemous it is. being in a large space that used to be a church but now has rows upon rows of hookahs, tapestries adorning the walls, and a giant projection screen featuring music videos with middle eastern beauties shaking it and seducing you with song.\n\nand then..it suddenly feels like college all over again. you sit on your floor pillow, make yourself comfortable, use the ikea lack table and get your food and drink served on \/\/ in the ikea färgrik plates and mugs. how am i so sure? i lived it. and you probably did, too.\n\nthere are a couple miserable-looking employees here, but karin, our main girl, was on top of her game. she chatted with us when she could and replaced our coals without us asking. even though you could tell she was tired, she kept a smile on her face and made the experience pleasant. the owner is also very attentive and always asks patrons how their experience was before they head out. snaps.\n\nmore than anything, this place is great for a walk down memory lane (if you were into this kind thing in high school or the early college years..or when you studied abroad in turkey and \/\/ or the middle east) and people-watching. if i come back, i'll likely request to sit upstairs, so the young ones don't distract (read:: tempt) me.\n\nsome notes::\n- $2.50 minimum per person if you're smoking hookah. which is more than reasonable, but is angering when you're not hungry, order a $3 cardamom milk and get..warm milk. where's the cardamom? i'm not trying to fall asleep here.\n\n- cash only, but there's a 5\/3 atm in-house. (i've always had something against fifth-third though..i HATE improper fractions.)\n\n- i dare you to try and leave without stopping for kabobs outside the café. the aroma is mouth-watering, even when it's 20 degrees outside.
