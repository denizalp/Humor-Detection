My first visit to Sasa was a great experience! The staff, right off the bat, was super friendly and joked around with their customers. I was kinda anxious about their AYCE rules with 1 hr and 15 min time limit for dinner! Haha! Not that I plan on \"camping in\". I can't eat as fast I want to! No one wants to choke while eating their meal! \n\nAppetizers: 5\/5\nPoke salad was garnished with some seaweed. It was fresh and delicious with just the right amount of dressing in it. Other locations dredge their poke salad with the sauce and that's one of my pet peeves. \nTuna carpaccio was super yummy! Love the mild sweet sauce with a kinda garlicky taste to it served with mayo underneath.\nAmaebi was one of the best I've had! Love the lightly breaded flavorful shrimp heads! \n\nNigiri: 3.5\/5\nSalmon belly, eel, and tuna were really fresh, but my first few pieces of the nigiri, sushi rice was a little bit undercooked. Rice to fish ratio was awesome! Perfectly sliced thickness with VERY small amount of rice! We will see IF the second visit will be the same ratio.\n\nSushi Rolls: 4\/5\nThe only sushi roll I ordered from the menu was the Sasa. It has shrimp tempura, spicy crab, cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. The sauces were mayo, sriracha, and eel sauce. I really like it a lot, but it could have been better if the shrimp tempura had some crunch to it. The rest of the special rolls I've had were made by Nick who was superb! I was game for anything he can create! And oh boy did he impress me! \n\nSmall cut of sashimi served in the traditional Asian soup spoon with a sweet hint of sauce was delicious! This creation was repeated, but this time it was served on fried crunchy edible leaves. The next roll he whipped up was a tuna roll with tuna, crab, and scallops. It was garnished with super creamy sauce and jalepeno for added heat.\n\nDeserts: 3.5\/5\nYuzu sorbet! It's about time someone gave me a full scoop of this goodness! Most places either give you about a tablespoon or it looks like a full scoop, but it's hollow inside. Really? You think I can't tell the difference?!? LMAO! \nGreen tea tempura ice cream was just \"okay\". Green tea was weak in flavor and not as creamy as other green tea ice cream I've had.\n\nI would definitely come back since I barely tried out their menu selections, but I would probably not come here with a large group since there is a time limit of 75 minutes. BTW, they have happy hour with 20% off their a la carte sushi rolls from 2pm-5pm.
