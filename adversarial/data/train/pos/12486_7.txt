Tried it once more since Lucky's closed I have to find a new pizza place. Sigh....\n\nService is excellent they knew immediately what we ordered last time. We tried the signature pizza this time since its the most popular. The delivery was very quick I admit but the pizza still leaves me looking for a new pizza place. The toppings were all good spinach nice and crispy and then the sauce is good but way too sweet for my taste! It makes me wonder if the secret seasonings have something to do with sugar? Oh well I really tried liking this since its so close but what can a girl do?
