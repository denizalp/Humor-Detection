Must see! Love this show. It's my favorite out of all the shows on the strip to date. Now, I personally don't see this as a negative but compared to a Cirque show, Absinthe is rude, gritty, profane, and politically incorrect. If you're easily offended skip this one, its crass. The acrobatics are breath taking and the show is excellent. I only have one complaint, the seating sucks. I'm 6'1 and 250lbs so I barely fit in the hard wooden fold out chair. My girlfriend is half my size and commented on how cramped the seating was. Everything else was amazing and well done. Loved it!  The feel and style of the tent\/venue is a 1950s circus meets Marilyn Manson. Enjoy!
