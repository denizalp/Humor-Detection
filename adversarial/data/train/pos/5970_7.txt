Indulgence takes on many forms in Sin City and enjoying time at a spa is just the way to sweat out the toxins and enjoy the amenities a luxury resort is meant to provide. Canyon Ranch has spa locations throughout many warm weather locations from Miami to Arizona and this LV version maybe among the most decked out of them all.\n\nThere is a departure aspect from host resort to spa facilities, an oasis from the Venetian if you will, as the Canyon Ranch theme is very different from the rest of the Palazzo \/ Venetian. Luxury accommodations aren't quite to the standard of the Wynn or Cosmo per se, but they've got more than enough to satisfy the average spa goer.\n\nThere is rock climbing, a full scale gym with treadmills, weights, and the works. My personal favorite activity is the sauna + massage. Sure, there's likely an influx of older folks getting their spa on (and letting it all hang out), but nothing beats a good ol, overpriced, frou frou massage. The masseuses are masters of their sport, making sure they've got all of the problem areas covered.\n\nWould I go back for more? Considering all the things they have to offer, I've already been here enough times to call myself a non-newb, but not enough to be in their regular rotation. I'll be aiming for a player's comp as always.
