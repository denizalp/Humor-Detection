Troy recently came by to install a new counter top as well as put up some monitor mounts at our Mesa store.  He was extremely professional, there on short notice, and did a FANTASTIC job.  The new oak counter top couldn't look better!  The monitor mounts weren't even a challenge for him (I wouldn't have wanted to touch it as they were going in brick) and he was done before I even thought possible.  You are the man Troy!
