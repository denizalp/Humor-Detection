My boyfriend and I went here for the first time today to get deluxe pedicures! We both have jobs where we are on our feet all day and good pedis are a must for us. The salon is nice and very clean. The staff is friendly but a little forgetful. This place would have gotten five stars but there were a couples of problems. First off make an appt here! They were so busy! My boyfriend and I sat with our feet in the water for an hour before they started our pedis! Sitting and soaking for 20 mins is ideal for me but an hour!? Even I was getting bored and impatient! Second, they were rather overwhelmed and over filled my boyfriends pedi bowl soaking our shoes and my purse on the floor! And then they didn't bother to clean up the water! And lastly even though my bf and I both got deluxe pedis they did not do the same things for both of us. I don't know if they just customize the service depending on your needs or what but it really just seemed like my bf's nail girl skipped his salt scrub and mine skipped my leg massage. Overall, it was a good pedi. Our toenails look perfect, clean and shaped. Our feet are soft and smooth, that cheese grater really worked! I was nervous about it, but it was not uncomfortably and my feet really needed it. Okay selection of polish but I think I will bring my own next time if I want a specific color. We will be back but next time with appts.
