Sweet Jesus! Sweet Poké has so many toppings- mango, masago, avocado, and more! With poké bowls so delicious, I could eat here every damn day. Here, you move left to right as you choose a base, protein(s) from 9 choices, sauce (a dozen choices), then toppings. Their seafood and ingredients look and taste super fresh, but their soft shell crab was a little cold and not as crunchy as I had hoped. A regular poké bowl has 2 scoops of protein ($9.50) while a large has 3 ($11.99). Service was awesome and all smiles- I was getting sauce for my toddler's poké bowl and didn't want it spicy so they let me taste a couple of their non-spicy sauces.\n\nFor drinks, they offer bottled water, tea, soda, and juices. Under their \"Sides\" menu, their bag of super thin and crunchy Taro Chips with a creamy sauce that had just a hint of wasabi for $2 was just killer. GET THIS! They also offer a $12.50 meal deal which includes any regular bowl or sushi burrito, a soda, and either edamame, miso soup, taro, chips, or seaweed salad. In addition, they have legit kid's meals including apple juice for $6.99.
