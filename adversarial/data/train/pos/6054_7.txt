...All I wanted - nicely waxed brows of preferably relatively equal length. Is it too much to expect? Especially as we know our faces are very symmetrical  for the most part and different length of the eyebrows will be noticeable. \nThe woman who was doing a job was missing good customer service and a mint. \nHer own eyebrows were non-existent. \nShe was reeking of tobacco and treated me like cattle: did not warn me of the oncoming pain and pretty much took over my face like fascists over France.\nIn the middle of the torture she stopped and examined her unfinished work with a very whimsical look on her face - \"Hmm, crap. How do I fix that?\"\nShe also kept badmouthing her coworker who got a nice written review from the customer ; she reassured another lady who worked with her to destroy the paper with compliments once she is done with me.\nI felt like a furniture listening to all this. Very violated furniture. I did not want to ask her to redo my eyebrows knowing her potential to be so vindictive. I just made sure not to leave a good tip.\n I left the place unhappy having my personality as a back up  to charm the world since my good looks were totally ruined.
