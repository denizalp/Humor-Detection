I have no idea why Andiamos insists on seasoning the life out of every pasta dish. It's pseudo Italian food on MSG.\n\nOnly reason why I'd +1 star is sometimes we'd get really friendly service.\n\nThe sauces are very heavy and obscenely salty (even when we asked beforehand for reduced-salt) They may taste good on the first bite, but 1\/3 through my pastas here and I have to stop eating. I usually feel bad after eating here, extreme dry mouth.\n\nThe gnocchi is AWFUL- mushy and grainy, it was definitely store bought and sitting around for a long time.\n\nThe manicotti was nice but has the same issue with the sauce being way too salty.\n\nThe pesto penne was too garlic-y but otherwise decent.\n\nThe veal parmigiana was decent, but came a much smaller portion of pasta than it usually did. We suspect it was because another table had complained about their pasta and the kitchen had to do a quick re-fire- both pastas were penne so we think they just took some from our order. \n\nOn two separate dinner occasions (one was a birthday) we wanted to order tiramisu but were told that it was not ready- keep in mind it was around 7pm.\n\nI have been here six times in the last year and  the quality has gone downhill each time. My family and I will not return.
