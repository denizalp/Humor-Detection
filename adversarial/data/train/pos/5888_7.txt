I got a call today from the girls at Destiny's Bride telling me that my dress arrived... yay!  \n\nAfter searching high and low for \"the one,\" I found it at Destiny's Bride back in February... Like Kate C, I worked with Linda - she was fabulous!  I felt comfortable immediately...  I tried on a bunch of dresses but ultimately went with the first one I saw at the store.  As I walked upstairs and the woman helping me at the time asked me what I was looking for, I looked up and said \"something like... that!\" (and pointed at my dress that was hanging on the mannequin).\n\nLinda helped me with envisioning accessories, etc... but I'm waiting until I see it again to make those decisions.  When we put the order in, I was told the dress would arrive in September... but it's early August and it's here - no stress - gotta love that!\n\nMy mom also found the dress she'll wear at the wedding at Destiny's Bride.  If you are shopping for that perfect dress for your wedding, I highly recommend Destiny's!  I'll update this again after my alterations are done, accessories found, etc... but so far, no complaints!
