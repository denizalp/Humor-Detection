This is convenient if you're staying at Delano, but its definitely not a place to trek to. \n\nI ordered a cheese panini and it was just okay. The sandwich was haphazardly put together. The bread was just decent and the cheese was just okay. The small side of tomato soup was good. \n\nThe fruit side had a chemical taste to it and I just couldn't eat most of it.
