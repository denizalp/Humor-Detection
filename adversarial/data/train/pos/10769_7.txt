Cute place! I liked how it was all open and not as crowded as TOT. You must buy a drink before playing with the cats but it is a very reasonable rule, they need to make money somehow. As for the cats, they were okay, preferred to kept to themselves and didn't really seem interested in the toys until one of the owners brought out all the treats. There was 1 grey main coone that was quite angry and swatted everyone lol, if you have kids be careful!
