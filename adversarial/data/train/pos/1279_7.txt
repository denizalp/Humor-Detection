This is equivalent to the seeing the Christmas Tree at Rockefeller Center.\n\nYes, its just a tree. Yes, the Fountains of Bellagio is water and a light show. But its \"The\" Fountains of Bellagio. Its personifies the Las Vegas strip with its nightly show starting every 30 minutes. One song might be Sinatra singing \"High Hopes\" the next song 30 minutes later could be a Michael Jackson song. The lights, water and song make Fountains of Bellagio extra special.\n\nFountains of Bellagio is a lot of fun to watch, a touristy thing for sure. Have I mentioned its free??
