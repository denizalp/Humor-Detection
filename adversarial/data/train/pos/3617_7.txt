You know how the guy on ESPN uses the catchphrase \"Useful....useful shot\"?\n\nWell, this review is Useful....if you want a shot. Go here, it suits you well.\n\n~Fud\/Drink~\nI smiled when I saw Restaurant in the title for this place. The food is consistently sub-par, even the apps are lackluster. I got sick here prior to a Coyotes game, thank you McFaddens for making me howl PRIOR to the game itself. I thus, never have eaten here again, because why bother when you get sick from an appetizer. Not too appetizing. You go here to get wasted, but where is the fun in that? Speaking of drinking, the drinks are average as well. Its your average bar option, nothing with pizazz. I could recommend it if there was something of note, like Saddle Ranch's Beer Tower, but they aren't even that creative here. The beer's are expensive as well. Why am I paying so much for these suds and wretched food? It's just a lose-lose situation. Also, its a poor choice if you want something Irish, because its a saloon, right? Haha.... If you come here, later, during the game, you will be asking yourself  \"Why did I come here.....?\"\n\n~Atmosphere\/Service\nJust when the food is bad here come the waitstaff, who are not quite bright in the head. You go in, you sit down, and they do not attend to you quickly. You would think after repeated attempts to waive your hand in the air (I rarely do this, its a necessary evil), that they would see you. They don't. They must have some kind of Ray Charles syndrome. Or Stevie Wonderitis. Can you name another blind person style syndrome? Message me with one and I can add it, because that would be what the waitstaff must have... Actually, the blind are upstanding citizens with amazing senses, they would probably do a better job, hence I feel bad bringing them up. Oh well, anyway.... \n\n~Extras\/Rating~\nYou might be surprised they get even two stars...and heck, they really do not deserve them. I give them one star for the location and another for still, after all the bad experiences, not being the worst bar I've attended to this point. Congrats to that! They are more worthy of 1 1\/2 stars, but why not, I have pity on this spot...so two it is. Just stick with me on this one, and stay away guys! Leave this place for the drunks. There are so many better options in this center. I mean, seriously.
