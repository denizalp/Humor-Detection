I had lunch here with two coworkers, one of them is an Indian, on a Friday.  Ours was the only table for the entire time.  I ordered a Lamb Vindaloo with rice from the lunch combo.  The Vindaloo curry was the spiciest I have ever had.  I knew that Vindaloo curry was a really spicy curry. Yet my Indian coworker agreed that the Vindaloo curry here was too spicy even compared to the version in her homeland.  On the positive side, my coworkers said their food tasted good. \n\nThe venue was beautifully decorated.  The services was fine.  The waiter was polite and effective (bear in mind that we were the only customers the entire time).  And echo other reviewers, the food was expensive.  A non-vegetarian lunch combo costed $20 per person.  A vegetarian lunch combo costed $15.
