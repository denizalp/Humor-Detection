I recently found myself facing a birthday milestone of sorts, so like any level-headed person, I chose escapism to avoid any office brouhahas and off-key singing. By pure happenstance, I wound up at this InterContinental (it was part of an Expedia package), but let me tell you -- it was a week of pure heaven. First of all, you're just steps from Old Town, so surrounded by breathtaking architecture. It's conveniently Metro-adjacent, flawlessly decorated, and staffed with service-oriented professionals who spoil you rotten. I literally wanted to have my bed, park view, and luxurious bathroom shipped home with me. While this hotel stay was not of my choosing when I booked my trip, you can rest assured I'll now be purposely staying at this chain again and again.
