What a wonderful little place to have breakfast.  But vegans beware because every item in this menu has an egg in it!  \n\nOvereasy Breakfast Ltd is a very attractive chic breakfast journey.  The place is so delightfully done up in red and yellow chairs, stools that look kind of like eggs, retro graphics on the walls and overhead lamps illuminating the words Overeasy.\n\nThis is definitely an Edmonton Trail gem. Fresh farm eggs are used in every meal and there is tons to choose from, your basic any way you like it eggs, Egg Omelettes, Benny styles and my personal favourite Crepes and French Toast. And for those of you watching your figure, there is a light menu and an executive menu. \n\nBut it doesn't stop here, not only does it serve up fruit juices and coffee; there is even wine and beer. For breakfast you say? Why not cure that hang over; it is always best to drink an alcoholic beverage the next day for breakfast anyways. \n\nThis is a unique breakfast outlet that is worth checking out and I am not yolking!\n\nClosed on Tuesdays.
