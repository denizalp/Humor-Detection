Located in the ever changing downtown arts district, Hop Nuts Brewing brings us a fairly solid location to throw back some craft beers brewed on site, other regional favorites and a pretty well stocked bar of the typical booze found at most establishments in town.\n\nLike most bars in the area, the crowd and occupancy is very fluid.  It may be packed on a Tuesday but dead on a Thursday.  Slammed on First Friday but nearly empty on a Saturday.  I still can't figure this out with places in the area; I suppose people are just bar hopping and don't really have a loyalty to a particular place, save for the friends\/family of the employees.  During my visit I had the opportunity to try a few of their beers on tap and chat with the owner and head brew master.  I came away with a sense that they are in it for the long haul and care about their craft; I can appreciate that.\n\nThe space is fairly stark inside and out on the patio, but lends itself to a decent amount of seating given the small square footage of the bar.  The selections of beer that I tried were all quite good but heavier on the alcohol-side than mainstream. It is my understanding that live music will be happening here quite often; during my visit, there was a DJ playing hip hop music...that didn't really fit if you ask me.  I'd rather listen to a 3 piece ensemble doing jazz fusion in this type of environment than some thuggin' in da club type stuff.  Either way, when you're in the area, or hopping out of Velveteen Rabbit down the street, come on by and give it a try for yourself.
