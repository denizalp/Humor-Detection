Okay, i took one for the team here.\n\nWas in LV on business and had a craving for catfish.  Based on Yelp reviews I went to this place - it is a long drive from town and when I arrived (about 1:00pm on Wednesday) there were no customers... bad omen but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nFirst, this is not a restaurant, as such - it is a fast food joint where you order at a high counter from a big menu on the wall.  Food is brought to your table in Styrofoam containers,  I had catfish, chicken, green beans, and red beans & rice.  the veggies were tasteless except for the odd (dishwater?) aftertaste.  I thought they would be better with salt so i got up and looked for salt - I figured that with 11 tables, there must be salt somewhere.  I found the single salt shaker in the room and used it - honestly, it didn't help.\n\nTo their credit, the catfish was not bad - nothing to rave about and certainly not worth the drive but not a bad taste.\n\nI gave them the benefit of the doubt and I suspect most of their business is due to people giving them the benefit.  I can only conclude that the five star reviews are from owners, friends, and family but not from legitimate customers.\n\nEven though the catfish was not bad, I won't be back.
