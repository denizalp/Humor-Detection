Note #1: Pittsburgh Barbecue Company is actually on Banksville AVENUE, not Banksville Road. Look for the Days Inn motel; PBC is right next door. \n\nNote #2: PBC is strictly carry-out, and there is no need to call ahead. You just walk in, tell the folks behind the counter what you want, they ring you out, and your meal's boxed up for you to take away. Everything's ready to eat immediately. \n\nOn a secret, gravel-studded street off of Banksville Road sits a house of stained wooden slats. Spectral vapors can be seen floating into the air from a tin chimney only to vanish into a powder blue sky that serves as a backdrop for an early Spring evening. A campfire aroma will comfort your nostrils as vehicles race up and down the highway--you will briefly forget that you're in a major Northeastern city. \n\nThe other day, I treated my family to another bring-it-home banquet, finally getting down to trying PBC after years of procrastination.\n\nWhat we found were St. Louis Ribs that were fat with luscious pork that almost pulled itself from the bone and blushed when torn into. \n\nSpeaking of which, the pulled pork sandwich was tall with protein, crisp skin, and sweet, blackened debris. \n\nA runny, vinegary sauce with just enough bite to it dressed the smoked animal flesh.\n\nWhatever fires that burned in our traps were extinguished by a fresh, vibrant, crunchy cole slaw. \n\nA lackluster macaroni and cheese was kicked out for loitering while a serving of baked apples arrived fashionably late, stealing the spotlight with its wealthy, fruity, pie-filling lava. \n\nIf barbecue is a science, PBC should at least be nominated for a Nobel Prize. \n\nI only wish they'd add potato salad to their menu.\n\nMy personal food obsessions notwithstanding, fly down to Banksville and take home some sapid, smoldering Southern fast food for you and yours. You'll win hearts and minds.
