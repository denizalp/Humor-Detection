on day 4 of our trip I finally realized this Starbucks is here at the MGM  - dang! could have been enjoying my usual beverage everyday\/ Oh, well, found it now.  Located in Tower 1 - this Starbucks doesn't have any lines to speak of compared to the one in the MGM food court area. I ordered a Venti Vanilla Macchiato with No Foam. It was great. The Baristas were very nice and I had no problem using my Starbucks phone app to pay for my drinks. It's not a cheap Starbucks. You're paying for convenience, don't like it, stand in line for an hour in the MGM Starbucks.
