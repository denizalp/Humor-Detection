Oasis Kitchen looks to be a real mom-n-pop shop, with an older Asian lady manning the front of house and an older guy manning the back. I'm all for supporting local businesses, unfortunately I was underwhelmed with their product. Mongolian beef was excessively oily with a touch too much sweetness from the sauce, while the cashew chicken was bland. If I return hopefully my experience will improve.
