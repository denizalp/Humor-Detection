I went to Forbidden on one of their new Wendsday nights a few months back. I liked it! The DJ was on it! Props props props on spinning the newest underground electro stuff. Me and my large group of friends were like, the only straight ones there but it was okay! This one guy showed us some pole dancing moves :)\n\nAlso, the drinks were 75 cents?!! That's right, 75 cents!! I guzzled down so many vodka anythings it was disgusting! Also, I met some guys there who gave me hair advice and style blog recommendations, not bad :) \n\nMy straight guy friends wanted to kill me for bringing them there, but I didn't care, all us girls had a blast!! We were on the stage getting tought how to \"shake it\" and boy can those boys \"shake it\" lol. \n\nAs for some people saying it's not really Scottsdale pretty ect, who cares, it's 75 cent drinks that night. Heck, I'd party in a tent with folding chairs and a disco light up ball for 75 cent drinks :)
