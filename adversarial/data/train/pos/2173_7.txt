What would Pittsburgh be without its famous iconic personalities! The Fred Rogers monument is part of the \"Tribute to Children\" circle made possible by one of his late dear friends Cordelia May.\n\nThe statue captures Fred Rogers tying up one of his sneakers as seen on his show. Fred Rogers would normally come into the studio house of his set with his red jacket, untie his dress shoes, tie his sneakers, and sing the famous song \"Won't you be my neighbor?\"\n\nHis children's TV show ran in the late 20th century and was an inspiration to children everywhere with his soft spoken voice. During his lifetime he spoke to children in such a way to help them learn about life and also gently and with great discernment broke down some of the hardships one faces in life. \n\nThe statue sits under a half moon archway where you can actually climb on his lap.  I feel this is what he would have wanted and the way the statue is set there is indeed plenty of room to climb up it and no get hurt. From the statue you have a spectacular view of the city of Pittsburgh and behind it is a sign both describing his work and devotion to children. Also on that sign is the friendship connected with him and Cordelia May and her generosity in making this statue possible. inside the archway you can hear a recording of one of his songs.\n\nLocated right by the North shore walkway where the north end of the Manchester Bridge once stood it is best to visit it when the Steelers are not in town and there is no event at Heinz Field which sits almost directly behind it.\n\nFor more on Fred Rogers, head over to the Heinz History museum on Smallman St near the entrance to the Strip district. There they have the actual sets used in the production as well as the set that served as the castle and grounds for the King Friday puppet and the other children's puppet characters made famous on the show.
