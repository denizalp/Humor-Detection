First off, I cannot comment on the food.\n\nI went on a Sat at 6.00 thinking it was early enough to not be too busy.  I had checked THEIR website about reservations and didn't see anything so assumed they didn't take them.  We wanted to sit at the bar anyway.  When we got there, the place was about 1\/2 full at best.  He told us there were no open reservations until 9.00 (then why is the place half empty?)\n\nThat was fine by us, we wanted to be at the bar which had NO ONE AT IT.  He told us that to sit at the (empty) bar, we had to spend $50\/person minimum.  WHAT?!  Now, I was prepared to spend some money, believe me, but what if I don't like the menu or I run out of time for dessert?  So, we weren't allowed to sit at the bar or a table.  We were pretty shocked so went somewhere else that didn't have a minimum spending to sit at a fuller bar.  \n\nI will never go back.  They completely turned two cute girls away that were ready to spend probably $80 in 45 min and had a pretentious attitude about it.
