This was only my second time here, and wifey has never been, so we returned here after the Jabbawockeez Elite event. Tony T. had already secured a table for 8, and TNY was celebrating their 2nd Year Anniversary by offering 50% off two of their signature pastas-Uni Tomato Cream Pasta, and Squid Ink Spaghetti, so we met up with Teri C., Reggie M., Tony T., Professional competitive eater Miki \"Mikachu\" Sudo(who was Tony's +1) and Regina and Earl C.\n\nIt was PACKED when we got there, but we already knew what we were coming for.\nPretty much our whole table got the Uni Pasta(or two) and shared the Squid Ink Spaghetti on top of our orders. Miki opted for the Miso Carbonara, and Tony killed a few apps before his two bowls of Uni Pasta. Our wait time was pretty long, and we had been warned by our waitress, but our party didn't mind, as we filled the time chit-chatting, catching up with one another, and hearing about Miki's food challenges where she beat Joey Chestnut in a Wing Bowl Challenge, and beat Sonya\"The Black Widow\" Thomas in a Kimchi Challenge by killing 8.5 pounds in 6 minutes! Phozilla Challenge @ Pho 87 and The Quadruple Bypass Challenge @ Heart Attack Grill? She's been there, killed that...CRAZY!!!\n\nOur food finally arrives, and man, the Uni Tomato Cream Pasta did not disappoint!\nPerfect al dente on the pasta, the richness of the uni tomato cream, nice sweet chunks of uni, the chili threads and the torn pieces of basil helped balanced this dish out perfectly. Man, was that DEE-LISH!!! The Squid Ink Spaghetti came next, and this was also good...pasta and squid cooked to perfection with a hint of garlic, but it still seemed to be missing something, or the uni pasta was just too good to be overshadowed by anything else.\n\nI would return, BUT if I can find me some chili threads, I could duplicate this killer dish at home...ALOHA!!!
