Fox's is a classic bar that is offering nice domestic and international drafts. Here you pretty much always want to order from a bottle! I got the impression the kegs were beginning to collect dust!\n\nI haven't tried the food personally, but the pool tables are nice and fun. Also the jukebox was slammin. This is a classic sport's bar that is middle of the road. I'd go back for the cheap beer alone.\n\nDim lit, working class atmosphere, no frills here. Straight up dive bar. I had fun. \n\nFun Tip: Try playing keno while you drink, it's surprisingly fun but has been known to turn you into an 80 year old woman with curlers. \"I need to play my numbers!!\"
