Can't believe I haven't written a review yet!  So I live walking distance to Rum Bar so it's a staple in the neighborhood.  Rum is the name of the game and anejo wil be to blame.\n\nThere will be no rum and cokes in this place!  The owner, who will always great you at the door, will help you expand your palate with a craft cocktails or flight of rums.\n\nMy favorite drinks have been the Swizzle and they make a great Dark & Stormy.  Work yourself through the rest of the specialty cocktails...you won't be disappointed.\n\nHave only had some apps and desert here.  The spring rolls, scallops, and the parfait have been excellent.\n\nThe Abuelo 7yr has been a great sipper and compliments many of the dishes.  Rum Bar reminds my of NYC and it's a pleasure to sit and soak up some good conversation with friends
