Being of the (ahem) generation that had an old-school plastic Zoo Key, tapped on the plastic Egg incubator in the Children's Farm and threw marshmallows to the Polar Bears, all I can say is that the Zoo has changed.  For the better.   Lush plantings, creative, participatory exhibits and nice attention to detail everywhere.   The new Elephant Crossing is interesting and a drastic, drastic improvement over the old Pachyderm building.   \n\nI, personally, like that the Zoo is spread out as it provides a nice walking environment and gives you time to reflect on the many joys of life ...including that I don't have a screaming child amped up on sugar and rollng on the ground in a major melt-down.\n\nWas so impressed, I bought a membership to help support the place.   You should, too.
