Rosie's is TROUBLE. I know this has to be my favorite bar not because I remember having good times here but because I rarely remember anything.  All stories I am about to relay are passed on the day after by a trustworthy \"source\" who is consistently regaled with my 3am Drunken Story Time Hour.\n\nThe roomies and I fall here \"just for one\" and consistently end up calling my boyfriend (aka \"The Source\") at half past 2 for a ride home, so it's not a crowd favorite, because he undoubtedly hates Rosie's.\n\nOH! And there is one bartender we love in particular. After being hit on for hours by the same ridiculous wedding-ringed douchebags, one wink of the eye from Captain Awesome McBartender meant our entire tab was being taken care of by Cheaters Anon, aka those dickbags (unbeknown to said bags). It was TOTALLY AWESOME.\n\nI also have walked in on some sex in the bathroom. Boyfriend especially enjoyed hearing me dramatize that one in great detail. I'm a hoot when I leave Rosie's, apparently.
