You want to know what I did?...\n\nI just missed out on a slew of great furniture finds. Upset? I would say so! But you know, I'm learning to be more responsible and not just fling my cash about, I had to sit and wait and make sure things were going to pan out the way they did. I do have regrets though, like an awesome 3-piece dining set that was only $175 that sold out fast... But even after the major furniture clearance event I was still able to find some great deals. Like a dog bed for my precious Alice-ma, and awesome room accents for the pretty much empty abode. I hope there is one of these closer to my new location, otherwise I will be doing a lot of fuel burning trying to get around to see whats at this CPWM! Even if its not a huge sale, at least being a member of their buyer program can get you a 10% off discount on everything stocked!
