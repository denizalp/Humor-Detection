I generally love this park.  There is so much to do and so little time. I literally believe this park was built for the parents as well as the child. I find myself drifting to participate on all the cool activities.  \nI really like the open grass area, as well as the enclosed small city for the kids to use there  & scooter and of course imagination.  \nThey also got barbecue pits and benches to accommodate parties.  With shaded areas do the sun isn't melting you or your cake away.\nThey also have awesome a good trail, which I am wasn't able to venture out in. It was literally too dark and I was scared the creepy crawlers might come out and feast on my flesh.\nOverall I would definitely recommend taking the kiddos and fam bam.
