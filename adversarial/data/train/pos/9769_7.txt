This snotty place is not worth your time.  However if you prefer being treated badly by pompous servers, go for it.\n\nOur group were told by a man who much resembled Napoleon Dynamite that we were too loud.  I was stunned. The table of people nearest to us said we were completely fine.\n\nI promise NEVER to go again and NEVER recommend to anyone, I won't be wasting my money here.\n\nBring back the Firehouse Lounge!
