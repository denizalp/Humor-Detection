We went to Cabana as a surprise for my birthday. The cover was a pretty steep $20 for or $40 for the pool. We didn't want to go in the pool, which we sort of regretted because the pool seemed more fun. Nonetheless the cost for pool access is way too much.\n\nAs we entered, we saw around a 70:30 ratio of girls to guys. The place was all white and actually looked very clean and fun. We then went to get some drinks which were expensive - around $8 per shot and the shot glasses were tiny too. They provided 2 pool tables, 1 ping pong table and a foosball table. We played a few rounds of pool where the loser had to take 2 shots. Unfortunately i lost twice lol, but its ok because it was my bday haha.\n\nThey played soccer on the big screen by the pool which was cool, but i actually preferred to listen to music instead of watch the game...so we walked closed to where the music was.\n\nWe ordered Miami Vice and was very unimpressed as it was all liquid and tasted like Pepto Bismol. Yuck.\n\nCabana was fun, but not amazing. Maybe a 1 or 2 times visit per summer.
