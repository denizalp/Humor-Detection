\"Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.\"\n\n- Vladimir Nabokov\n\nSo, Lolita is the super sensual girl I spent with but only one (hot) night. I'd like to change this from a one-night stand into a prolonged love affair, but alas, I live in Chicago. For now I'm content just knowing that she forever changed my life. \n\nAnd how so? She got me eating brussel sprouts... and loving them! The nutritional qualities are probably long gone once they're fried and fried deep, but the combination of chopped brussel sprouts, anchovies, capers, garlic, walnuts, honey and chilies was... well, like when Michael Corleone gets hit by the lightning bolt, meeting his Apollonia. Real love, not infatuation.\n\nAdditionally, I shouldn't gloss over their wonderful wine and craft beer list, their fit-for-the-foodiest-of-foodies kobe burger, or their attentive service and chic insides.\n\nDon't forget, Lolita: I will love you forever more, forever more.
