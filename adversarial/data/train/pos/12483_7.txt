First time in my life, I've been craving BBQ almost on a daily basis. I credit (or blame) Rollin Smoke for that. I come to LV several times a year, and almost always end up eating on\/near the Strip. But this time, I took a drive out here, under a freeway overpass, next to a strip club, in a less than glitzy part of Vegas. But so what, it's all worth it.\n\nUpon entering, you'll see the seating is communal, resembling picnic tables & benches. Once you decide what you want, place your order at the counter. Grab a table and in a mere minutes, someone calls out your name. You better answer, because he's holding your food. \n\nI would've gotten the 5 Meat Pit Special, but the wife isn't exactly a carnivore. So I ended up with the Trio Basket; 3 meats and one side. Chose ribs (of course) brisket & pulled pork. \n\nRibs: F-ing awesome (and I rarely swear about food) Smoky, salty, tender and a bit fatty. I'm craving hard as I'm typing. \n\nBrisket: Covered in a crust of coarse pepper, it is so tender with small chunks of fat to give it that greasy coating. \n\nPulled pork; Super tender but bland as hell by itself. Grab some sauce to give it life. Would not order again\n\nCorn bread; sweet, sticky and moist. Perfect ending to the a meal of meats. \n\nExtra order of Corn nuggets; Because the fatty meats aren't heavy enough, these fried corn nugz are great, and have a slightly sweet finish. \n\nNapkins are on the table, and about 4 choices of various sauces are at the counter w\/ small paper sauce cups. I'd say try all 4. They range from sweet to heat. Depends on what you get, it may add a new level of flavor, like the underwhelming pulled pork. \n\nThere are separate rooms. First is the main room, where the entrance, the ordering counter, and fountain drinks are. Over to the left, is another room with big screens airing sports. A third room is a bit larger, detached from the first 2 and seems quieter, but I never made it in there. \n\nThe food, came out fast and was excellent. The service, not bad. The girl who took our order really didn't want to be there. She was lethargic, and couldn't describe any of the flavors of the food to a first-timer. And all I asked was \"how is the pulled pork?' She answered, \"it's pulled pork.\" ...  \n\nI would, without a doubt, come back.
