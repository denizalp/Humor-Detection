OK, I'm officially a Marco's whore. Hands-down my favorite take-out\/delivery pizza in Cleveland. Now I'm not saying that this is some fancy-schmancy organic whole wheat stuff the (tasty) likes of which can be found at places like Angelo's on the West Side, buuuuut when you're in the mood for quick, tasty, and incredibly unhealthy pizza, this is the place of choice. They recently opened up near my workplace, which is cool, but I may be 50 pounds heavier by this time next year.
