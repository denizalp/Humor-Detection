I really, really wanted to like this place. I saw all of the yelp reviews and was super excited...\n\nCame here around 1 on a Sunday and had no problem getting sat right away. \n\nService was nice, but extremely slow at times. We had our appetizer, food, and beverages picked out before the server came to greet us. I did like that you pay up front after you're finished. That's quick and efficient. \n\nMy boyfriend's cocktail was very good, a decent size for around $8. \n\nWe started off with the shrimp ceviche, which was the biggest disappointment. It was a bunch of tiny sized, heat cooked shrimp in a too-sweet tasting tomato salsa. I'm merely speculating, but the tomato salsa tasted like any jar salsa you'd find at the supermarket and perhaps had been \"doctored up\" with cilantro and diced red onion. Really unimpressive and misleading. $12? Not a good deal at all for what the dish ended up being. \n\nMy mexicana arepa had chorizo, cheddar cheese, pickled jalapenos, and a one ounce portion of guac on the side. I barely finished it but I figured I'd just take it home and throw in whatever contents were left inside with eggs for breakfast tomorrow. Perhaps I just don't like arepas, as this was the first time I tried them, but the texture was so hard to get past. It was crumbly, somewhat flavorless, and hard and chewy on the edges. I got the yucca fries which basically taste like a very starchy, dry and flavorless potato. There was no seasoning on them. I didn't finish this, either. I barely got through one fry.\n\nMy boyfriend's dish was much better. It had braised beef topped with and egg. He said it wasn't bad and finished it all. I had a bite, and I thought it was okay, too. He got the red bean chili which he said was good, I tasted it but I was unimpressed.  \n\nFor one cocktail, one appetizer and two medium sized dishes the check came out $56. I haven't been this disappointed in a really long time...
