Let's just say...after having stayed in Downtown Las Vegas for the first time, here at the Golden Nugget, for our annual Fantasy Football draft with a group of our amazing friends, we will mos' def' be staying again.\n\nWe got an awesome deal for a corner suite in the Rush Tower. Great room that was the perfect size to become Draft HQ and then viewing central for the May v Mac fight that night. Plenty of room, with two tv's and two big windows (we were on the 19th floor) that looked over the pool and into the glittery Las Vegas night...so nice!\n\nTotally loved the showerhead...plenty high enough for the 6'4\" hubby! Nice big soaps and shampoo and conditioner, plus the toothbrush and toothpaste. \n\nOnly issues, as others have said, were the lack of power outlets (NEED to have one by bed!) and the high step it takes to get into the shower (makes a difference when you're only 5'2\"). But not so drastic that it ruined our stay.\n\nWe love the location, since Downtown is just so convenient and full of life (though those freaks do come out, day and night...so Vegas). \n\nWe'll stay again! Give it a try!
