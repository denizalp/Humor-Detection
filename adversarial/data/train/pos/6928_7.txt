I'm not trying to scare anybody, just warning you to be a little cautious. I purchased a black German Shepard puppy for $900.  i wanted a companion for my other German Shepard. she was really skinny. Puppy's should be round tummy, but I could see her ripp cage. I took her to There vet was free.. Vet was really far in the east side Las Vegas. The vet said bonnie my puppy was under weight and had several virsus. I contacted the puppy store, The owner reassured me she's healthy. But my bill doesn't lie. she still has a lot of medical problems. Due to being a mutt. I did a background check on her parents, she came from a puppy mill. Bonnies paper work explained she's not purebreed, but was told she was. The owner apologize saying there working on getting better breeders, which is another way saying \"sorry you got screwed\"\nMy advice is if your gonna get a puppy from there, talk money, don't pay what they offer. They will lower price if you hold your stand. They wanted $1,200. But play balled and paid $900. Look at that contract, read where it says it's a purebreed. If not talk cheaper for price. make sure your puppy is not skinny or sick go see a vet right away. Take pics.  Keep record. Hopefully your experience will be better then mine.
