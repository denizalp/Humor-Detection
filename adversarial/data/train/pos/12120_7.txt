I came here for happy hour with my ladies the other day.. We had a pretty big group so we sat on the patio. \n\nWe ordered the AZ rolls and the hummus plate. The hummus plate was good and really huge! I wasn't too fond of the az rolls. I think it was because it was mixed with a couple different cheeses maybe? For drinks I just got the merlot. I should've gotten a beer. They have 20 ounce beers for $4! They have a very huge selection of happy hour items that last until 7. \n\nThe thing that got me was they don't have ranch! How does a restaurant serve wings and salads and such and not have ranch! I'm a ranch girl, so I need my ranch with my wings, salads or fries. My meal came with a jalape√±o ranch. Um how did they make that if they don't have ranch? Because of this, they get a three star from me.
