Awesome place!   After a few hours of shopping,  I felt I needed a nice cool drink and passed by this place caught my attention!   I really liked the name and the great display picture of the Bloody Mary Lobster Claw!\n\nI sat at the counter and a nice friendly girl came over,  so I told her I would like to order the drink advertised.  She made it quickly and first taste was great!!!  Very nice tomato flavor with a good amount of spices,  I ate the claw, plus it has a fresh lemon and celery stick!  Best part was the crushed ice, it really does make a big difference in drinks compared to ice cubes.  Overall very refreshing drink and I enjoyed my break, as my legs have been walking all day ...
