This is a combined review of both the Chandler and Gilbert medical facilities.\n\nIt's not that I was treated poorly the one time I went to their office, but I was given the runaround (literally) and was once refused to be seen because I was 11 minutes late for an appointment.\n\nThe first time I went was in Chandler and an X-ray was ordered. This is the only Dr's office I can remember that does not have its own X-ray machine on site. They sent me to a place across from the Chandler hospital.\n\nProblem is, there are a number of buildings with that name in that parking lot alone. I must have been in the lot 5 minutes before I found out which one was the right diagnostic center.\n\nLong story shorter, woman tells me she can't do an X-ray gives me an appt. for later in the day. I return only for her to tell me she's booked and never gave me an appointment.  This is the kind of facility Hatfield sends me to. \n\nFast forward a few months I try to make an appt. in the Chandler office again only to be told the only opening is in Gilbert office. \"It's our Val Vista and Baseline office,\" I'm told but it's not quite on VV and Baseline. It's about a mile and a half west next to this or that. \n\nWhen I finally arrived, 11 minutes after my scheduled appt. because it was about 100 yards west of Val Vista and not 1.5 miles (which put me a stone throw from Gilbert Road and not Val Vista)  I was told the PA (not Dr.) couldn't see me because there is a 10 minute rule and they are going to lunch soon.\n\nI couldn't even get an appt. for later in the day (not that I'd drive back I don't live in Gilbert). \n\n\"Even though it's our fault\" she says, I don't have any more appointments today. There's an Urgent Care up the road though.\"\n\nI've wasted more gas with two Dr. appts with the Hatfield doctors than any I've ever seen.
