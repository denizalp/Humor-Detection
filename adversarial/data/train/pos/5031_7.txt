I had waited for a year to cut my hair after leaving Roy, my fav in tucson. i tried AJ because she did great things with a friend of mine with similarly textured hair. I also really like Dally's hair and didn't know until after my first visit that she was responsible for that too. My first cut was fine. i just got it trimmed to get the damaged ends off. also a highlight. the salon itself is very private - only one client at a time. so, i got to know Aj a little. She's sweet and down to earth with the talent of a dramatic and unavailable stylist sans the ego. \nThe second time i went in for a cut. I said something to her about Maria's haircut in The Sound of Music. She offered donate lengths. I didn't quite have enough. She took off eight inches from the bottom and more from the top. I'm accustomed to letting the stylist decide what to do with my hair. so, when AJ asked me shag or bob style? i wasn't prepared. I said, \"I dont' want a soccer mom do.\" So she opted for playful shag in the back. It was so liberating to just take all that hair off just when the summer is getting cooking. \nWhen i got home, my husband, who scares easily said,\"I love it. Get in my bed.\"\nThird haircut got it down pat. Turns out i am much more of a bob girl than a shag girl. I should know that. the guy at bookman's used to refer to me as a \"junior league\" type. which i'm not. but i'm also not one to flip my hair up in back like a past Oprah hairdo. I'm not \"fun\" like that. I'm messy, though, and this hairdo is perfect for me. I have gotten so so many compliments on it. \nThanks, AJ. and all the girls at The Roose. See you soon.
