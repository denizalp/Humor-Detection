My milk green tea was had a powder residue inside the cup, even though my drink was just milk and tea with honey boba.\nFirst impression was that the interior was very simple and the some of the girl workers were wearing animal costumes and the other were in a black tee shirt. The girl working the cashier didn't help much when I asked \"what's the most popular drink?\" She just told me they had a menu.. Okay?? Thanks.\nI ordered the a green milk tea and my BF got the mango slush. My boba was soft and chewy then it was hard in the middle and way too sweet. The mango slush was eh, at first it had a mango flavor for a second then it tasted like water. Whomp whomp. \nIt seemed overstaffed as I noticed they had one guy walking from kitchen to a his table of friends during my visit. Then I saw a group of 4 workers hanging out behind the bar and 2 people in the kitchen.. It wasn't that busy, just me and my bf and 2 other parties. \nOverall I would once in awhile because I'm a CSN student who loves boba but until they improve I will stop by when I'm in desperate need to satisfy my cravings.
