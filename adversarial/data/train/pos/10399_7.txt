After hearing nonstop commercials for High Voltage Indoor Karting on the radio, I decided to book a group of 7 of us here for my brother's bachelor party.  Everyone had a blast!  I booked the reservation months in advance and the staff there made everything simple!  I put down a deposit and paid the balance when I got there.  Driver registration was quick and easy online and they send you an email reminder the day before your reservation.\n\nThe facility is located in an old foundry building at the end of a residential street, which was a bit odd, but it's a really nice setup they have.  They have a snack stand and there was a food truck out front too. There's also arcade games and a couch and TV area to catch up on sports.\nYou check in at the front desk where they take your picture for pole position and standings board and give you a head sock for your helmet.  You can even rent a GoPro to mount on your helmet or bring your own! They'll send you a text letting you know that your race starts soon.  Walk over the bridge and a staff member will give you the low down on the rules, how to work the go-kart, how to put you helmet and neck brace on, etc.  The package I picked consisted of 3 races of 4 laps each. These karts are super fast, going up to 50mph!  Realistically, the straightaways were only long enough to hit maybe 35-40mph, but it's still a rush and so fun! They recently expanded their track to add an outdoor section, (weather permitting) which was really cool!\n\nThis place isn't cheap, but it's definitely worth checking out! They have cheaper rates during the week, so check their website for details. Zoom zoom!
