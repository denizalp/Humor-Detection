A hop, Skip, and jump away from my stomping grounds is this pretty decent buffet off the 95 on Lake Mead parkway inside of the Fiesta Henderson.  \n\nThe Festival buffett won''t win any best of Las Vegas awards, and It's not the greatest or biggest buffet in Henderson, but probably the best value because their Mongolian grille, and a pretty good offering of vegetables at that station. \n\nLike most Station Casino buffets, it has the standard offering of American, Italian, Mexican, BBQ, and a small seafood area, but this place is about the Mongolian BBQ, and fried Chicken.  Yeah, the Fried Chicken is actually very good ..don't worry Chef Keller, this place has nothing on yours but for 5.99 at lunch, this place kills it!  \n\nThe wait help can be a hit or a miss, but If I go with my mom, who's has a chairman status players card with them, everything is good.  Even though they might have a huge line when they do their promo, we will walk right in and get our butt kissed, then given their most experienced staff member who's pretty much on it.  I guess having a higher membership status has it privileges.  On the other hand, if I take one of my friends there with my card, I have stand with the rest of the cattle in the general line. Perhaps, I better start carrying a walking cane, because there so many bogus people without a disability who are cutting into  the handicap line. Sorry, but being mentally challenged because you can't read isn't a handicap. Come on Station Casino please enforce this.
