Overall very impressed with this Sushi place that is just around the corner from my condo. There are already a few options within 3 blocks including Nijo Sushi, Wow Sushi and Tokyo Kitchen as well as some cheap alternatives on Yonge Street. \n\nI hadn't come to Asahi Sushi because I always tend to go to Nijo Sushi. Now for some reason Nijo sushi is closed due to \"Management Change & Renovations\" so decided to try this place on Church Street. \n\nFirst off, they have an outdoor patio in the front and in the back which is great for the summer when you want to get some sunshine. More importantly, the sashimi platter had a great mix of fish and everything was very fresh. Freshness is always the key to a good experience and I suspect that Asahi Sushi is busy during the weekday with many office towers around and not a lot of restaurant options. \n\nThe service was fairly good although there weren't too many people in there when we arrived (around 3pm on a weekday). Would definitely recommend this place as a Sushi alternative in the area. I give it a 5 as it is what it is meant to be - a good local sushi place. (That doesn't mean you should travel from Oshawa or Hamilton to check this place out though!!!)
