Just thinking about the \"meal\" I had tonight makes me want to throw up - literally.  I was going for something healthy.  Ordered the seared ahi tuna, asparagus, and side salad.  When it arrived, first sight, I said to myself \"blach!\"  Yes, maybe i ordered boring stuff but at least try and present it nicely!  The tuna came in a huge, thick square that was grayish brown. Ugh! Not really seared. Just brown.  Cold. The least they could have done was sliced it up pretty. It was this huge hunk and like over an inch thick....just thinking about it....all brown and gray and cold and raw inside...\nAsparagus was so dry and was a bit brownish. Really cold.  Salad was a bit of iceberg w\/ dressing on the side.  \nMy mom ordered a pulled bbq chicken sandwich. Meh.\nAs I was walking out I was looking at other people's food.  Nothing special to look at at all. Never going back even if the rest of my party wants to go. I'll just walk over to In-n-Out and camp out in the parking with my burger box until they're done.
