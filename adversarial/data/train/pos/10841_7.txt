If you want to be called a bunch of freeloaders who need to settle down, then this is the place for you. \n\nWe came for the $25 BBQ & bourbon deal, for the second time, our first BBQ & bourbon experience was great. \n\nWe ordered knowing the deal came with a platter of BBQ and two Bourbon drinks. As we finished the platter and our first two drinks, another round of drinks came to our table. We said we didn't order those, and the server took the drinks back. Few minutes go by and the server comes back with the drinks and asks why are we sending drinks back that come with the platter. He clarified that our platter came with 2 drinks per person, so we then take the drinks after they had come back after the initial confusion. \n\nWe didn't think much of this until it came time to settle the bill. This is where things started to go downhill, fast. \n\nThe server brings our bill out and we have been charged for the platter and drinks all separately. As if there was no $25 bourbon & bbq deal. We then realized there was a mistake in the server bringing out the second round of drinks. We brought this up with the server multiple times, but we were having issues getting is resolved, so the manager came out to us. \n\nWe were hoping that the manager would apologize for the confusion and hear us out with the mistake that was made. Instead he tells our friend that was trying to explain the situation to settle down and accuses us of complaining about the situation to just get free drinks. \n\nI would understand if we had originally taken the second round without sending it back because we didn't order the drinks, but we sent them back and they were brought right back over. \n\nService was fine, it was busy at the restaurant, so can imagine he already had his hands full. But the way management responded to our issue was just unacceptable. This is the last time I will be recommending Southern Rail to friends. \n\nAlso as a side note, the yelp page says it's a $20 BBQ & bourbon deal, which is definitely incorrect.
