Horrible, horrible place! Melody is the worst person on the planet! To say that she is a child is an understatement! She rolls her eyes, stomps her feet, sucks her teeth, ans stomps out of the room! Very rude and unprofessional. Management is very uncaring, SAVE your money and go somewhere who appreciates you
