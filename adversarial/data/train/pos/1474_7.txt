I was able to visit this establishment on 3\/29 after Spring Training in Camelback. \n\nA friend of mine found this place based on the star rating on Yelp so we decided to give it a go. Upon arriving things looked like they were headed in the right direction, however, things changed once we sat down. \n\nThey were able to accommodate our large party of 8 which was nice, got in right before early dinner rush came in. Once we sat down, my girlfriend asked if we could get some water, the waitress responded \"Now?\", no we wanted water as were about to leave. The waitress did bring out one glass of water while everyone else waited. 15 mins later, a new waitress came out and finally brought water and took drink orders, after my friend had to flag her down and ask if we could order drinks. 15 mins later, the drinks finally came out, with a different waitress, even though there were was a surplus of workers. The Michelada was a bit watery, not enough tomato juice. \n\nThe service is a it slow, almost as if they are the tortoise in a race. The responses to questions felt like a forced, almost put off, response. Our drinks weren't cleared until the chip man came around and had to be asked, even then, he removed the chips and two glasses. The other glasses were left behind as if they were two week old enchiladas. \n\nOnce the food came out, that sort of brought it up to par. I shared the carne asada plate and it was pretty good, the flour tortillas were the highlight. \n\nI'm not sure what the 75 4-star rating is about, there was nothing amazing about the place and probably wouldn't go back if I am in the Phoenix area.
