You know the Soup Nazi, now meet Joe, the Pizza Nazi.  \n\nDude, it was your choice to open a pizza joint in the middle of the second most pretentious city known to man and keep it open til the wee hours of the night, not mine.  Learn some tolerance.  \n\nGet drunk enough to ignore Joe before you get in there (which most people do without realizing it anyway) and stumble into Joe's after the bar.  Its open late and has the best pizza in town.  \n\nThin, huge slices with all the regular fixin's...  Oh and garlic bread knots with ranch and marinara.  Its all ready to go so theres not a wait once you actually get in there...and what line there is outside usually moves pretty fast.  \n\nI have no idea what the prices are because I'm either too drunk to notice or the chach in front of me didnt realize that he just paid for mine.  You taking notes here?  \n\nJust remember to keep your orders to the point and be polite when you get to the front of the line....they may not let you use the bathroom (and you know you'll have to go) if you dont.  :)
