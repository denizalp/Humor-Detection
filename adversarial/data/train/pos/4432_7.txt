Run here for all your running needs! Seriously, this shop knows how to give a runner the best experience. Between the great selection of running shoes and clothing, to the accessories and tools, this is your one-stop-shop to all things running. I just wish I had found this store when I was training for the half marathon. I would have purchased every accessories they have. Besides having a great selection of your basic running clothes and shoes, they also sell every accessory imaginable. They have an entire wall dedicated to hands-free water bottles, whether it be a backpack like pack or even one you have strapped to your hand. They sell cool waist-bands that are made locally that you can put over your workout pants to hold your sell phone, keys, etc. In summary, if you can imagine it or dream for it in regards to outdoor exercise, chances are they have it. Live and love local and support this great local running shop. If you're looking for group runs, they also offer special events for running groups as well. One day I will take advantage of one of their events!
