The croissants were too rich, though the prices were quite reasonable.  What really was even more unappealing though was the attitude the waiting staff had.  I bought my croissant and espresso and went out to the patio to enjoy the beautiful weather, only to have a waiter order me to leave in French.  I explained to him that I was not from around here and was perfectly willing to be served, but he cut me off and asked me to leave.  I walked off in disgust, but only after talking to the manager and the waiter himself, telling each that their attitude was unbecoming for a business with their apparent reputation.
