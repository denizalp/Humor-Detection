No doubt the best Portuguese chicken in Montreal. The chicken is grilled to perfection. The meat is moist and tender, not to mention juicy. Served on heap of golden crispy  fries. I can go on and on about how good the chicken is, but there are almost 150 plus reviews about it. Another thing no one here mentioned are the chouriço's. They are really good. Spicy sausage Portuguese style.  Lines are REALLY long, but they move fast. You place your order, pick it up and go to the cash register and pay by Cash or Debit. No credit cards accepted. Did I mention the food here is very cheap??? And yes, Their Nata's are good too.But you have to visit this place mainly for their chicken. \n\nP.S. : Definitely NOT a good place to visit if you are Chicken  \n\nFood -  Really Good\nService - Fast\nAmbiance -  What Ambiance???\nWorth the money - Sí
