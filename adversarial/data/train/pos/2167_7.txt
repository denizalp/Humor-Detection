On a recent visit I'm standing at the olive oils...a woman with an empty cart except for a store flyer moves toward me...stops...then asked me \"are you looking for a special one\".  I say  \"no, are you\".  \nShe does not answer...starts scrolling thru her i phone...looking nervously up and down the aisle.  I move on...about an hour later at the check out I notice her going up the oil aisle again...nothing in her cart.  Was she an employee, or just someone enjoying pushing an empty cart around the store?
