Agree with everybody else:\nThe gelato is delicious. \nThe flavor selection is gourmet and interesting. \nPrices are cheap. \nThe location is arts district, so that's cool, but kinda a long way to go for gelato. \nLocally owned is a bonus. \n\nI love taking out of town visitors here and visiting myself when I'm in the area.
