You don't have to go to New Mexico to get tasty chile treats! Yes, the signature item here is the \"Sloppi Jo,\" but don't expect a Manwich meal! The Sloppi Jo is slow roasted pork drenched in a New Mexico chile sauce served with an egg and tortilla. A creative, fun dish, but I actually enjoy the tacos a bit more. And, I love to gnaw on their corn on the cob as well. \n\nHowever, the fifth star is earned by their unexpected sweet treats and their incredibly friendly service. We sampled their coffee cake at Taste of the Nation, and my husband and I loved it. When his birthday rolled around, I knew coffee cake was truly his favorite cake, so I decided to contact Sloppi Jo's to see if they would be able to make one specially for him. They were happy to accommodate and even left the cake in a spot that was convenient for retrieval. The coffee cake was moist and delicious, and it made my husband's birthday!\n\nFrom creative cuisine to cheery service, Sloppi Jo's really has everything you could want in at truck. I smile every time I see them motoring around town!
