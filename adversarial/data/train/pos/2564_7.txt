- I had the Tuna which was WAY TOO salty. I also had the grape salad which I LOVED!! It had grapes, brown sugar and nuts. If you love sweets you WILL LOVE IT! \n\n- Soooo walking in was so confusing.\n\n-  We did not know where to place our order or if we was suppose to be seated and waiter or waitress will come over to take our order.  \n\n- The only sign we seen was for picking up orders\n\n- Parking was OK not the best \n\n- This place was pricy for a Tuna sandwich and the grape salad I paid $15.00(and that was with no drinks). \n\n- The cashier DID NOT explain things,  I was handed a wooden spoon thinking someone will call my name. Not knowing what to do with it\n\n- They totally forget about my co-worker food (she order before me) and we late coming back from lunch \n\n- I did see outdoor seating, I think I even seen a fire pit\n\n**  I don't think I will visit them again ( something I really don't say after just one visit, but that one visit really rub me the wrong way). If it was not for that grape salad, they would have gotten 1 star from me
