OH HOLY HE[double hockey stick]\n\nBest cure for a hangover ever.    This place is right off the strip so it's kind of too far to walk to, but you can see it right over the highway.\n\nIn & Out is what some would consider Las Vegas's Chick-fil-A [since we don't have one of these fine establishments].\n\nIt's ALWAYS packed at whatever time you will get there. So be prepared to wait in line and wait a bit for your meal.  Sometimes you even have to wait for a seat so you can actually enjoy your cardiac arrest on a platter!\n\none pattie, fries and a drink is plenty for me...but I know some people go hog wild. If you also get the 'special sauce' on the side and\/or just get ketchup\/mustard it saves you like 10 grams of fat [all the nutritional info is on their website]\n\nI just wish they served beer. Beer 'n Burgers it just goes together.
