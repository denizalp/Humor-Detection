Came here for brunch since it's right by the University of Pittsburgh. We sat outside on the patio and it was really nice being able to see the school and the pretty scenery around.\n\nUnfortunately the food is where The Porch falls a little flat:\n\nOmelette of the Day (3\/5): it was a very basic omelette, the crispy potatoes were delicious though.\n\nSunny Side Burger (3\/5): just your average burger, it is pretty filling and heavy.\n\nEggs Benedict  (3\/5): if you like a lot of spice-y flavor, then I would recommend it. However I didn't think it was a great flavor for a benedict.\n\nThe service was just okay, the waiter didn't seem very enthusiastic to serve us. Overall just an average brunch restaurant.
