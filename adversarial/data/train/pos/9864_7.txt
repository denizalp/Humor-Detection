I will admit, I am not a pinterest fan. I kind of think pinterest is ruining the world by homogenizing school projects everywhere and allowing people to pretend to be artistic when really they just have the internet. Regardless, the husband got me a splatter paint date (on groupon for a ridic amount of money..... over 70$) for Christmas. We went. It was fun. We splattered paint of various bright neon colors at a canvas in a cool paint covered room for a half hour or so. The end result is fairly ugly (did I mention I'm not very artistic?). We then got 'wine and cheese and chocolate' as part of the deal. The cheese 'plate' was like 4 slices of cheese from one of those costco trays.... sad showing. We each got one glass of champagne that was fine. The 'chocolate' was a fun sized hershey. No joke. Not exactly what I would expect for a '$100 value.'  I know people go gaga for this kind of thing because it is just sooooo instagram worthy, but I think it's sort of a gimmick. If you like that kind of thing, though, you would love this place and should go right away. It just wasn't for me.
