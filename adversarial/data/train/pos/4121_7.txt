Very cool place for large- and small-item shopping of all kinds of unique, decorative and gift items in all price ranges, but mostly high end.\n\n35 shopkeepers offer an array of new and gently used or refurbished items. Definetely check out the candle booth that has an enormous selection of high-end candles.\n\n There is an outdoor center courtyard with antique patio and garden items. One booth sells refurbished lighting from the age of glamour.  Not a great idea to haul your kids or large pets here as you stroll.
