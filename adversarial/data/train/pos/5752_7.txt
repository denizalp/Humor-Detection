Look. I can eat at STK everyday, forever. I have been to the LA location a few times and the vegas location was nothing short of fantastic. Amazing service and really friendly staff. That, off top, is reason enough to come here.\n\nTHE FOOD THOUGH. I seriously want to bathe in the hot bread, sweet corn pudding and mac n cheese. I would tattoo all three of these on my forehead if i could. AMAZING.\n\nEat here and enjoy here. It's fun, prices are good and you will leave soooo happpppppppy. yum yum
