I'm not a gym rat. In fact, the foremost reason for me to go to the gym is so that I can keep eating all the delicious food I want.\nI like to work out, but I felt that if I was paying for a gym membership, I would be more consistent than just going to a class here or going for a run there.\n\nI went in with a friend who was already a member and was able to get a good deal with one of the managers, Roy. I was told that I could get a free lanyard (the only free merchandise they offer) but even after repeatedly mentioning it over 5 months, I was never given this magical freebie. Only told that they were on order (probably forever \"on order\").\nI had to pay an initiation fee, but that means if I leave, I will not have to pay a fee then (unlike with Good Life where there is no intimation fee but a fee to leave). The rates are also significantly cheaper than Good Life, however, the down side is there are only a few locations in the city for LA Fitness. \n\nI like that they are expanding, they recently opened a location in Kennedy Commons, and I like that these are large format gyms.\n\nSo the takeaway:\n\nCons:\n-Few locations\n-No towel service\n-No free merchandise for members\n-Not enough lockers (half are too high for majority of members)\n-Unnecessary amount of sinks (space which could be used for more lockers and changing areas)\n-Friendlier front desk staff would be nice.\n-No equipment in terms of jump ropes, resistance bands, and foam rollers.\n-I know this is a bit much, but it would be nice if one location had a track or offered hot yoga classes (and if that location was not the Signature Club)\n\nPros:\n-Cheap rates\n-Lots of different types of machines\n-Large format gym\n-Located near a major intersection (convenient)\n-Offers classes for spin, yoga, swimming, zumba\n-Has a daycare service for members who need it\n-Has a pool
