Love the new menus....no more worrying about knocking over drinks with the ginormous old one. \n\nI also thoroughly enjoyed watching four dudes in some cool shades take a limo to Oregano's for lunch today. Classic!\n\nUnfortunately, there's no improved rating from me. The inconsistency here gets on my nerves. Sometimes my meal is perfection and other times it is sloppy and greasy. Luckily, the service is always great.
