What at one time was a wonderful mall has since the building of the new c-train station next door been transformed into a place for sketchy homeless men and women to panhandle, shoplift and sometimes pass out in. \n \n Think twice before you bring your family to this mall as you will most likely have to deal with very unsavory people asking you and your family for cash\/cigarettes.\n\n The mall itself is very clean and offers a good variety of stores and places to eat and includes a very nice dinner theatre at the end of it that serves some wonderful food.
