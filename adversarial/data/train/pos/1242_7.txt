I get a comment from the owner of this pile of poo...\n\n[Comment from Aaron L. of Philadelphia Sandwich Company 9\/6\/2011]\n\"thank you for taking the time to write about your experience!\"\n\nWhat GREAT customer service! Instead of at LEAST trying to correct the matter (and\/or apologize) I receive sarcasm! Well THANK YOU mr. Aaron L. of Philadelphia Sandwich Company with that retort, I'll take it with a grain of salt (which you SHOULD'VE used in making some real food). I'd like to take one star away for obvious reasons.\n\nAnd yes, I'll be stopping in again, just to see if you can prove me wrong.
