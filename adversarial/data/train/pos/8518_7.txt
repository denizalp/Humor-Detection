The crossiants are my favorite!! This is a great little neighborhood spot my fam has been frequenting for years.  They are amazing at accommodating special occasions.  I threw my dad's 68th birthday here and everything was perfect ... And surprisingly affordable! I highly recommend the pork chops and prime rib.  Great place for a cute date night or romantic dinner.
