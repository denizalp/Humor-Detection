Current owner - Hub Blanchette | Bren Blanchette\n\nUsed to own Chronic Car Audio (out of business for unfair business practices) - \"F\" rating with better business bureau\n\nReason for poor review - Store sold me used equipment as new, after driving 45 miles 1 way TWICE to resolve the issue in a respectful manner. I was continually gave the run-around, sold more used gear, and instead of simply refunding me my money, they told me I'd get some lousy store credit for more junk. I went to my bank and filed a dispute and they still REFUSED to return my money. Attempted to resolve issue in person TWICE. Was requested to drive 45 miles back and forth to shop, only to be told the person that was supposed to help me wasn't available, then sold more used equipment.\n\nThe salesman apologized initially and told me the equipment was \"B-Stock\" directly from Kicker, therefor I called Kicker with the serial numbers of the subwoofers I ordered, they informed me that the units were not B-Stock, were manufactured this year, and were NOT brand new, and based off the photos I provided to them, the units had been used, destroyed, then re-coned so they could be re-sold (Which Kicker does not condone).\n\n^ Fabricated story from a lousy salesman trying to pull one over on uninformed customers ^\n\nJust a heads up, I was jerked around over the course of a few weeks, and lied to. Needless to say, I will not be returning for future business, and highly recommend staying away from this place, and ANY place owned by Hub Blanchette that involves car audio, or anything for that matter.\n\n\nShady, unfair business practices.\n\n\n\nRegistrant Name: Hub Blanchette\nRegistrant Org skipjack dive & dance ware inc. is associated with ~4 other domains   \nRegistrar GODADDY.COM, LLC\nRegistrar Status clientDeleteProhibited, clientRenewProhibited, clientTransferProhibited, \n  \nWebsite Title   Slangin Sound   \nResponse Code 200\nSEO Score 74% \n\nLinks 95   (Internal: 91, Outbound: 3)\nWhois Record ( last updated on 2015-11-16 )\nDomain Name: SLANGINSOUND.COM\n\nRegistrant Name: Hub Blanchette\nRegistrant Organization: skipjack dive & dance ware inc.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe user \"Bren B.\" has decided to harrass me via Yelp messaging over this review, claiming that I am slandering his name\/business.\n\nThis review is a completely unbias, objective, clear depiction of events that occured with Slangin Sound and Tint. \n\nThe staff at this store was unwilling to reimburse me for my purchases, even with 2 - 45 minute drives to their store, instead, they offered an in store credit (which I did not want), and could not understand for the life of me why they wouldn't reimburse me for my purchases (considering the items I had purchased were never used by myself).\n\nThis information has been carefully documented with my bank and with the Visa network. Steer very clear of this business. Very shady business practices.\n\nEdit #2 :\n\nThe comment posted below by Mr Blanchette is complete lunacy and unfounded in the reality of events that took place. I currently own and still use the subwoofers today, I was able to get some black crinkle paint from Kicker and cut out the excessive glue inside the subs, and get them back to looking\/functioning new. Still have the receipts, serial numbers, phone call conversations recorded, the whole nine Mr. Blanchette.\n\nThe store manipulates you into buying used\/cheap gear, with no way to seek recourse if said gear fails or does not meet your expectations by stating after your purchase you CANNOT return your items for a cash refund, they will ONLY provide in-store credit for more items.
