Searching through the racks of clothes in this store is like searching the heavens for the face of God. You look and look and pray and get down on your knees and dig through the meaning of it all and you come up with something that looks just about right but when you put it on, you realize it doesn't fit. So you keep searching. You might find something, you might not. But always the search continues. And there are always people in your way. And never a room to enter to try on your new found God. \n\nDid this analogy work at all?
