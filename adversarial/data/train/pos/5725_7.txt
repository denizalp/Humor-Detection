Everyone should be flocking to Flock!\n\nTo be honest, my first experience at Flock was not pleasant. I had made the mistake of placing my order through Hurrier, a food delivery company. Unfortunately, Hurrier \"hurried\" the order. The Fancy Flock salad with chicken ($10) was submerged in liquid and had random bones in the salad. It looks like the salad was regurgitated by a bird of some sort (pun intended)\n\nI had e-mailed Flock about my experience and head Flocker, Cory Vitiello had offered a complimentary meal to compensate for the lackluster experience. Second time around, Cory had entrusted an Uber driver with the sacred lunch. Unfortunately, the hungry Uber driver had flocked away with my lunchtime delight. \n\nThird time around, Cory had arrived to my office in a taxi. He brought a bunch of goodies including a new side (roasted miso brussel sprouts), a large Power flock made with Kale, a large Fancy Flock, pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich and two bottles of Pierre water. I still have left overs for another day after sharing the meal with my colleague. The food was beyond delicious. As much as I had adored the salads, the chicken sandwich in brioche buns was by far my favorite. The bun has a hint of garlic butter. The sandwich itself was garnished with beet & apple horseradish, dijon mayo, green leaf, crispy onion, tomato & avocado. It was an interplay of flavours and texture. If I have to eat a sandwich for the rest of my life, this would be it! \n\nThank you for your generosity Cory! I will be flocking to Flock for lunch and dinner!
