I always enjoy a sqaure deal, and today was no exception. Having a shiny new restaurant*com coupon in hand, we made our way out for The Dhaba. I'm not too proud to partake in a coupon here and there. Let's face it, why pay $40 when you can spend $25 after tax and generous tip? Now that's smart shopping.\n\nThis place was a good decision. We really enjoyed the food, they're in a nice spot right off the light rail, they've got a cool Indian (dot - not feather) market and adjacent shops to check out before, or after, your meal. \n\nThe Adrak De Panje dish (marinated lamb cooked in the tandoor for those of you who don't know); while tasty, was a bit tougher than I was expecting. They could stand to provide a sharper knife with this item. I was here with my wife and mother-in-law and we all really enjoyed the Nawabi Murg Tikke (marinated chicken cooked in the tandoor).\n\nOverall they serve great tasting food and India themed d√©cor. The restaurant dining area echoed on the inside, which made for an interesting experience. We could literally hear what our neighbors were talking about. While they did have music it could have been a bit louder, felt like we could hear every conversation from all the surrounding tables. and I expect that this could have been overcome with ambiance level music or some interior curtains.\n\nAt one of the shops, we met an interesting and awesome guy behind the counter, my guess is that he's the owner. He told us about different spices and dietary info about different Indian foods. Had a fun evening learning about Indian foods!\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix! .... errr Tempe I guess. ;-)
