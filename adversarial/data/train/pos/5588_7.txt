I sure was happy when this Daddona's opened up on the west side!  I have eaten in and gotten carryout several times.  Never have I been disappointed.  The atmosphere tries to be mellow and relaxing, with dim lighting and a green\/purple scheme, which is nice, but some of the artwork doesn't really seem to fit.  It's not very big, but it's not crowded either.  The booths are quite comfy but if you're at a table the chairs are hard and a tad on the small side if you're not tiny.  Also, it's always cold.  I have learned to take a sweater along, which is a little annoying in warm weather.  Also, there's no bar like the Solon location, but stay anyway!  \n\nStart with the garlic bread bites, but be careful, they are like crack.  One bit and you're hooked!  Then on to the menu... pretty tradtional Italian fare.  The menu is large enough to have a good selection, but not overwhelming and it sticks to what they are good at.  If your entree comes with a salad, I would get their Italian wedding soup instead.  The salad is fine, but not extraordinary.  The soup, however, is fan-freakin-tastic!  Then if you're in the mood for something light, try the ravioli or a pizza.  If you really want to pig out, you really can't go wrong with anything.  The lasagna is like a million layers of yum.  The chicken parm is slap-your-grandma good.  The alfredo is rich and creamy and comforting.  The portions are large, so plan to take some home.  Don't worry, they wrap up food like real pros- they wrap the styrofoam containers securely in plastic wrap.  I haven't tried their desserts since I'm always stuffed to the gills, but I saw a tiramisu come out once that was the size of my head.  \n\nOkay, gotta go, I'm hungry now.
