\"We'll upgrade you to the suite\"\n\nWait what? why? I had no idea, but we only paid $150 for this upgraded suite. best deal in vegas! we better not get charged for it.\n\nWhoa, there's a kitchenette\nwhoa there's an L shaped couch\nwhoa there's another huge bedroom!\nwhoa that's 2 LCD tvs AND one TV in the bathroom!\nwhoa there's 2 bathrooms\nwhoa there's a jacuzzi with seperate shower\nwhoa there's adjustable lighting\nwhoa there's even toothbrush\n\nO M G the panoramic view of vegas! Although of the side of the stripe and desert but it's panoramic! We paid $150 for all this? I really wish we stayed here on Saturday instead of Friday!!!\n\nThe hotel itself is alright, parked at the masquerade, big mistake, my bf did not enjoy being greeted by naked guys and it's about a mile walk to the lobby. So second time round, parked in the Carnival parking lot. a much closer walk.\n\nCheck in took like an hour. omg. but with the free upgrade, no complaints here!\nThe casino in itself doesn't look grand or friendly. The carnival buffet is only a one-time experience (I wrote a review for that last year) The voo doo lounge does give one of the best views in Vegas. but the crowd was not appealing to me. \n\nTip: Park in carnival NOT masquerade if you're staying in the hotel. or eating at the carnival. Exit flamingo rd. on the 10e\n\nFavourites: panoramic view of vegas! Free upgrade! jacuzzi! omgomgomg! all for $150!\n\nDo not want: hm, the hotel itself isn't too appealing\n\nLast words: Best deal in vegas!
