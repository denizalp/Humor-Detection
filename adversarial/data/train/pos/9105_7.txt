What is all the hype about 808?  This place honestly is a joke.  \nI go in to order to go food at 5pm.  There are 8 people in the restaurant dining, so not many people mind you.  I place my order with a girl who was really put out by my wanting to order to go food.  She places my order and tells me it will be 15 minutes.  Ok, that seems reasonable.  42 minutes later, still NO food.  2 people who ordered after me had their food come up.  When I inquired, the same girl seemed even more put out.  No apology, no offer to give me a soda or water while I wait for a lousey 3 sushi rolls.  Boy, obviously customer service is not a requirement at this place.  I get no answer except \"They said it will be up soon\".  Again, no apogy for the ridiculous delay and time needed to prepare it.  It finally comes up and she sends me on my way.  \nI was agitated to say the least but I was hoping that the story might take a slight turn for the better when getting the food home and having my sick wife who I got it for to cheer her up be so amazing it would quench the sour taste of the 45 minute wait.  Well, not to be.  The sushi was average at best.  For all of you who have reviewed 808 as having amazing sushi, you need to get out more.  I have been to so many places with better food quality and certainly more friendly people.  \n808, you need work.  A lot of work.  I am sorry I wont be back nor will I be sending anyone your way.  You had a shot to secure a life long sushi eater and lost it.  First impressions are critical in the fickle world of the restuarant business and well, yours just plain sucks.
