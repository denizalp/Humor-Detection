Since the first time I have visited GB, it has warmed up quite a bit--- I am not certain they have the proper A\/C unit for this space..... seriously, it was an OVEN in there multiple times this summer.  So these 2 stars are just for the SWAMPY feeling and massive heat stroke I nearly experienced in GB.   I will not be returning until AFTER the summer....
