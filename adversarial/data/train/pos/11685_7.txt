I am a very fair person and don't like railing on a restaurant unless its absolutely deserving.  That being said I will preface my review by saying that my experience is only relative to bar service and eating dinner at the bar.  Which by the way, shame on me, I should have learned by now that bartenders are NOT waiters and I should never sit at the bar for dinner.  So I think you know where I am going with this review.  Yes, the food was fine, not great, fine.  The service, beyond repair, horrible, non existent and pathetic.  My golden rule is that if I'm at your establishment, please don't make me feel like staff by having to work at and do what you should already be doing.  #1, if I see everyone has chips as a starter (much like most Mexican eateries) then I expect you to bring me some, not for me to have to ask you about it a solid ten minutes after ordering.  #2, If I'm with two beautiful girls and their drinks run dry and you offer then a refill within seconds of them placing their drink down yet I've been done with my lonesome beer for fifteen minutes I don't want to feel like I have to grow out my hair and grow breasts in order for you to serve me.  On top of that, I won't go into any particular details but I happen to leave a personal belonging at this place and turned around to get it within a minute or less of walking out the door only to find it gone and no one know about it.  After giving the staff the feeling that I wasn't leaving until I found it, this said item magically appears from behind the bar with the explination \"it was covered up with the napkin\".  So you picked up a napkin that weighed more than what 20 cloth napkins combined would have and didn't think to give it to the front desk so if the person came back they would have it?  S-H-A-D-Y.  \n\nSan Antonio's Modern Mexican should be called simply the Alamo because with service like this no one will be able to forget you....trust me.
