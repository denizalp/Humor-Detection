A high class restaurant to say the least. This is comparable to Mastro's or Boa Steakhouse. \n\nThe atmosphere of this place just exudes class. As soon as I walked in, I felt like I was transported to a beautiful ballroom in the Titanic where all the upper class elite are dining. \n\nThe service here is impeccable and the food is the epitome of what every restaurant should aspire to be. \n\nI started off with a peach flavored martini rimmed with sugar that was delicious. I could barely taste the alcohol and it went down so smoothly.\n\nOur first appetizer was a 12-piece Rockefeller oyster rack. I am in awe at how fresh and tasty it was! I feel like they had just plucked the oysters from the ocean and brought it right to my plate. All of the oysters were perfectly chilled and the mix of sauces it came with made my mouth water. This was definitely the highlight of the night. \n\nThe crab bisque is a must have! I loved every second of this soup. The flavors were so complex and at every corner I tasted a different flavor. It is creamy and hearty all in one. \n\nI ordered the pan saut√©ed branzino fish with lemon and capers. I enjoyed it. It's a healthy option and the sauce they use is drool worthy. \n\nWe ordered the key lime pie for dessert and it was bomb! Tart and sweet with a kick ass crust. I salute Joe's for creating the best key lime pie in California. \n\nOverall, this was an amazing meal and I am so happy we came here for dinner! With all of the options in Vegas, I think we definitely made the right choice.
