Pretty solid froyo. I had some free coupons that were expiring and so my brother and I came here. I thought it was on the opposite corner of the intersection but it had a clear sign and I maneuvered my way to the other side and found parking right in front. \n\nIt's got a cool storefront and the inside is reminiscent of other froyo spots. We grabbed our cups and the small sample ones to try the different flavors of yogurt. No matter what I try, I always end up getting a chocolate yogurt as my base. Here, they had two: one with mil and the other dairy-free (sorbet style). The topping bar is my favorite part and it had some of my go-tos like mochi and marshmallow sauce. I added a variety of nuts, chocolates, sprinkles, berries and even waffle cone pieces. My total weight came to about 12 oz and it was all yummy.\n\nBest part of my trip was that it was free! Didn't look to see if they had any punch cards or specials. Seems like a chill place to hang out and get a sweet treat.
