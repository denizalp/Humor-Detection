I'm not a huge fan of this Giant Eagle.  It's not because of the selection they have, it's more because of the level of customer service you receive.  If I were to evaluate this place based off of just the quality of the products held within, it would be a different story, but because a review covers more than just that, here we have it.\n\nThe customer service here is some of the worst I have ever had.  The employees look bothered to even have you ask them a question.  And when you can ask a question they don't bother to acknowledge you.  Some times they don't even care if you are standing there to ask them a question, instead they will have a whole conversation with their coworkers.  \n\nThe best part, or as close to best part about this location, is being able to leave.  That is if you can maneuver the parking lot.
