GENERAL NOTES\nThis place is busy! And small. And the seating is awkward. In other words, it has all the elements of a great pho place. I went here on the recommendation of a non-Yelp friend (what do they know) and was glad I did. The menu is what you'd expect and the price is right. Now let's have some pho.\n\nMENU RECOMMENDATIONS\nRare beef pho - just do it. The large is an enormous bowl of green onions, sprouts, mint (right?) and wonderfully thin beef. I found the broth to be far less salty than most pho places, almost to the point of wanting it to be more salty. Luckily, there was lots of salty things on the table that could be added. \n\nThe fresh rolls were good as was the vermicelli dish I had. I'm going to go out on a limb and say you can't go wrong here but unless you're definitely feeling like something other than pho, get the pho.\n\nLOCATION NOTES\nEast side of Ossington between Queen and Dundas. \n\nSERVICE NOTES\nThis was the annoying part. They moved us after serving us tea but didn't move our tea cups for us. Meh, we got over it. \n\nHUMOUROUS STORY\nPicture an Asian lady with a thick accent singing Oh Darling by the Beatles. It didn't happen or anything, just picture it. \n\nOh Dalring\nPrease bereive me...\n\nAnyway...funny to me.
