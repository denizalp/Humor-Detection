We went for a friends birthday party. I like the intimate setting. I'm usually not a comedy fan, but I laughed quite a bit at 3 out of the 4 comedians. There was a Fetish Ball going on next door, which confused me at first b\/c I didn't understand why leather masks and nipple clamps were the dress code for a comedy club, but once I saw the little neon \"Comedy Spot\" sign, I figured it out. Overall its a great place to go on a  weekend. Assless chaps optional.
