I admit that I bring NYC sandwich snobbery to this review. Problem is, you can't get a decent sandwich in Pittsburgh. Primanti's is no exception. Fries and cole slaw are side dishes and don't belong on a sandwich. Primanti's bread is cut too thick and there is a minimum of meat and cheese and the quality of the meat and cheese just isn't that good. Their cheesesteak bears no resemblance to anything found in Philadelphia which adds Philly snobbery to my review. The meat in the Primanti version more closely resembles a thin flavorless hamburger patty. \n\nThe bar is ok and the pizza is surprisingly good. But the sandwiches...puke.
