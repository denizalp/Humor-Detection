This is a small cart parked on the patio of Banger Brewing. The menu is small, but it'll help fill you up or give you something to munch on while you drink. The staff were super pleasant and friendly. We ordered the quesadilla. Meh, it was alright. There are probably other items on the menu that are better. As Rob P. put it \"I could make this at home.\"
