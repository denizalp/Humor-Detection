You know what I like about a real Italian restaurant? The commitment to fresh food and basic ingredients.\n\nUnfortunately, from the doe and ingredients for the beloved pizza to the pasta, it is all factory. And we're talking three $$$ resto here people. And what do you expect with such immense menu variety. Always question a large menu. If you have to ask, how do they do it all- don't do it.\n\nIf you're Italian or have respect for Italian's don't support this mockery of Italian cusine that preys on poor unknowing suburbans who don't know the difference. They get them with the fancy fire burning oven all-the-time. FYI the oven may be fantastic, but what they're using it for- ain't. On top of it, the one manager I met is smug and will stick up for his poor food- this was the most interesting part of the evening. That night I only remember being dissapointed by the lame pizza (more like dressed-up Dr. Oetker) and the crazy salty veal dish with cream sauce. But the wine tasted like wine... so that was good. Not to mention the free parking in the suburbs. Thank god they sell booze otherwise I would call their expiration at 2 years. Just saying. It's not the food fueling this engine. As for decor... if Baton Rouge was an Italian restaurant... just saying.
