My bf and I just love looking for cozy French cafes. La Maison de Maggie exemplifies that welcoming feeling right when you walk in. The owner Maggie and her staff were very personable and made you feel at home. She even gave us a background of the names she chose for her menu which I thought was pretty cool. The interior is industrial chic which I love! \nMy bf and I ordered the Marion which is a savory crepe that has pesto, tomatoes, and cheese, and another savory crepe that has ham, blue cheese, and spinach. Both very delicious and you can just taste the quality of the crepes. I also recommend their smoothies and lattes!! :) will go back again!
