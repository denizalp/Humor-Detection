Simply amazing. \n\nComing here is like an oasis just steps from the subway station. \n\nStaff are very professional, courteous and knowledgable. Every detail is is taken into consideration and done and done perfectly starting from the check in. \n\nUpon check in, they offer you out a hot, minty towel to wipe your sweaty, oily face. Oh I know about your sweaty face, this is Toronto, we all work very hard. Then they give you your treatment details - your therapists name, which room you're in and your locker floor. \n\nThe washroom is incredibly clean. They provide bath robes, towel and slippers to make you comfortable during your stay. Shower and go to the water therapy.\n\nClose your eyes by the pool to listen to suiting music or dip in the salted pool. The choice is yours. \n\nIf you're with a group, the jacuzzi is a fun place to stay for a bit. Heck, go there even you're by yourself :). Yeah know. \n\nThere's a steam room in the water therapy section and inside the shower area - doesn't matter where you'll access it... make sure you go there after the treatment... it's sooo relaxing. Did I mention that it's clean?\n\nWhatever you choose to do before or after your treatment make sure you grab a (complimentary) tea, apple or flavored water. \n\nBut a spa will not survive without great therapists - Elmwood has EXCELLENT line up of therapists. Really concerned for your health and not just your wallet. \n\nAh... now writing this review makes me want to book an appointment. \n\nIn case you're curious, I'm not employed by Elmwood.... just really a FAN!\n\nSeriously.
