basically i dont give a rat's **s on what the majority say i have never been treated like this in my life! saw it on foodnetwork, we just moved to az a month ago from los angeles. so after a 2 hr wait and it rained.....we were seated and for $4 we get a teeny cup of oj fresh squeezed i might add. we get the waffles with potatoes and thick bacon. it was ok but not worth the wait w\/ kids! i didnt tip her becuz she just acted snippy. but we spent $47 so oh well. she comes running out the store like we stole something! was everything ok? (loud as ever) nevermind its a crowd waiting oiutside..she says rather loud...u didnt tip my server i said lady get out of my face u actlike i didnt pay the bill. its gratuity and there was no gratitude. i said your millionares after that show ...damn b&^%$# i will never go back. i also disputed the charge becuz she has the nerve to add 4 dollars in the tip line that i presigned. sheesh!
