The good old Pal. The only place in the city that makes me want to commit a crime. The BBQ sauce is so good I have to fight back the urge to put a bottle in my purse as I leave. But in all honesty the best Mac and Cheese and chicken wings I've ever had. Not to mention a killer country and rock and roll atmosphere that makes me feel proud to be a little country.
