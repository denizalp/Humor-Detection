I cannot stand this place. If I could give 0 stars, I would!! I was trying to get a prescription refill and they would never call me back. Even my local CVS called multiple times to speak with them and said they had never dealt with a doctor's office so uncooperative. I called 10 times in the matter of 2 days and the receptionist, Rachel, was so unprofessional. They wanted me to get a procedure done that only needs to be done every few years, even though I had just gotten it done a few months prior. It seems like they just wanted to charge my insurance multiple times for unnecessary procedures. Finally, after being fed up and asking for my information to be sent to a different doctor, Rachel hung up on me. I have never experienced such unprofessional behavior, ESPECIALLY from a doctor's office.
