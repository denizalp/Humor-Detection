Another overrated PGH pizza place. \n\nSlices are puny with hardly any cheese, crust is not that great either.\nReally came here to try slices of the Sicilian, but of course, they had zero made up and ready to put in the oven so that was a disappointment, I mean why there would be NO Sicilian pizzas made and waiting on Saturday afternoon is confusing.\n\nSaw two grimy employees grabbing and handling raw and made pizzas with their foul bare hands. \nNasty.\n\nNope. Never again.
