So, I read the other reviews. All true. Most definitely. \n\nThe process with AWH Bridgewater was arduous.\n\nFirstly, the lots the model homes are on are bigger than the actual lots you move in to. Not to mention the model homes are about 2-3 feet smaller than the actual homes. While the realtor staff was nice, and this being a brand new developing community, and we were in the first phase... They should've known more about Clark County Zoning restrictions. We signed our addendum for our upgrades, which included a rear balcony. It wasn't until the day after the last day you could make changes to the home that we were told the Zoning Commission denied our rear balcony due to the placement of our house on the lot. Had we known, we would've moved the house over to allow the balcony to be approved.\n\nSecondly, the communication between the builders with AWH was poor. Every week. Every week for 3 months I had to complain about the trash in our house. Chicken bones, rotting plates of food, soda cans... for 3 months!\n\nDo not go with their prefered lender. They waited until three weeks before closing to run our paperwork. It was just unprofessional.\n\nThe only positive reason I gave them 3-stars, was because of the sales agent, Debbie Montgomery. She has helped us so much during the building process and after the home was built. Kevin and Todd don't do anything for you after closing.
