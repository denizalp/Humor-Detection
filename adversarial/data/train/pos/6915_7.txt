Probably the best beer selection in Flakewood and thats saying something.  They have pretty much all the standbys and a few rarities but the rare stiff doesnt stay long.  A sign of the times, I guess.  Everyones an expert now.  Also,  another sign of the times is that the price of beer has gone through the roof.  Sucks.  This place is on the higher end of beer prices.  I miss the 6.99 for a sixer craft beer days...
