When we arrived, we were surprised at how relatively un-crowded the airport was.  Yeah!\n\nBut, the poor 2 people behind the US Air counter were obviously over-stretched.  Even one more person on the desk would have made things run a little smoother. \n\nWe were only slightly delayed. No big deal. It happens, particularly when it's snowing all across the land.  The weird thing, though, was the total confusion from the people at the gate desk about which place (Philly or DC) would board first. I should have known that this was a bad sign. \n\nWe got to DC only a 1\/2 hr. late.  Not bad for holiday travel. However, nobody's luggage arrived.  Now, 7+ hours later, we still can't get any update on if our bags have been located.  Here's the thing -- I'd be more patient if we hadn't PAID to check the dang bags.  But if you pay to check 'em, and the airline manages to misplace a whole PLANE worth of luggage, I feel like I should get a refund on that $30 luggage fee. \n\nUS Air, you might get one more star if my luggage (containing my presents for everyone) arrives in time for Christmas.  But for now? \nSorry, I'm a little sore with ya. You get coal.
