Love! How could anyone have anything bad to say about this train?  ~$10 USD to get from the airport to the city is more than reasonable (especially considering that a taxi would cost 5 to 6 times as much) AND it is clean with comfortable seating, power outlets, and wifi. Plus it runs every 10 to 12 minutes.  The ticket kiosk can be a bit finicky but there are real people that you can buy tickets from also. They do check your ticket on the train, so don't try to be sneaky! For locals, there is a \"Presto\" program where the fare is even less.  The convenience of this train definitely makes Toronto a very accessible city to visit!
