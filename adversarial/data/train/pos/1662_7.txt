I really love the platform business model of The Juice Standard, \"Sustainability.\"  I am a big advocate for simple living.  I had a work event at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, and I lucked out and found TJS on the 2nd floor wondering around during my break. At the time of my visit, they just opened (2 days in business) I was told.\n\nI'v always been a huge fan of any businesses supporting the environment and reducing the ecological footprint.  TJS I was told encourages their customers to return their bottles for reuse. TJS is also on a mission to change the way their customers through education to help achieve zero emission.  \n\nTheir drinks ranges from Product-Cleanses to juices.  I got a chance to sample their Bee Alkaline and it was fantastic.  I'd definitely make an effort to come back here when I am back in Las Vegas.  Keep up your awesome mission TJS!  \n\nUntil then, be kind to one another and Cheers! :p
