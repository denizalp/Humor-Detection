4 stars! \n\nPros:\nIt's super clean which is a plus. \nQuick to order \nFree wifi\nBomb smoothies\n\nCons:\nCecilia, at the front, lighten up sweetheart! You make smoothies for a living. There's no need for that little attitude of yours! \nTrying to get her to ring up my $2 smoothie was a nightmare. It took 4 employees to ring up the discounted price of a small 16oz. \n\nI tried one of those fruit and veggie ones. It's like a green apple color drink. Very filling! \nMy boyfriend ordered mega mango. He's tellin me it tastes a little bland. Not good. \n\n\nWe will be back. Hopefully Cecilia gets to make smoothies next time instead of struggling with the register! \n\n;)
