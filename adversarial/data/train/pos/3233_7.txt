Disclaimer: This class does NOT teach you how to slide upside down. That'd be Stripper 501 you're looking for if you want to learn that!\n\nBut it does teach you how to give a super sexy lapdance and a few simple but very effective pole dancing moves. We went to a real strip club that night and even the girls there didn't know how to work the pole as well as we learned!\n\nI found this class while researching online for strip clubs in Las Vegas. It seemed like a fun and perfect addition to the bachelorette party we were planning, so I booked us 10 tickets at $50 a girl (included the class, a free drink, souvenir photos and a t-shirt). Kind of pricey, but when else are you gonna get to learn how to pole dance alongside your girlfriends in a safe and NON-sketchy environment?\n\nThere were over 30 women in our class, three or four to a pole, and one amazing instructor named Kindra. She was funny, engaging, and certainly talented at her craft. She would teach us a round of moves at a time, quickly but efficiently, then turn on clubby music for us to practice to. I think the size and structure of the class was just right, allowing enough time for every participant to try out her moves a few times.\n\nI agree with another reviewer that the rest of the people who work at the business are pretty blah (the ones checking us in seemed entirely bored and unimpressed with the enthusiasm we entered with, and the photographer was meh), but overall the experience is a lot of fun. It's a workout for sure--the next day my arms ached and I had bruises all over my legs from jumping on the pole--but it was worth it. Work that pole, girl!
