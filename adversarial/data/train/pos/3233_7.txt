I was in the first week they were open and had a great experience. It was great to see a mid-priced steakhouse in the area. The prices are definitely easier on the wallet than Mastro's, Ruth's Chris, etc. The food was very good, and was a portion large enough to split (we had the Ribeye, which included sides). I really like the decor as well - very tasteful and clean. I'm going back tonight!
