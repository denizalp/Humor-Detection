In the interest of brevity (it being the soul of wit, although possibly not witticisms:), I will keep my review of Bunna brief.\nI only had one cup of coffee...the Guatemalan Dark Roast, but WOW...good coffee!\n\nGood enough for Bunna to inspire another haiku - \n\na cup of dark roast\nmakes my heart beat much faster\nwith love, not caffeine\n\nGood Coffee!
