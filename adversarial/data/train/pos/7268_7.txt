Always try the Chef's Specials listed in the middle of the menu!  Delish!\n\nFirst off Joey V., Raul, Chris, Ernie, Regina who loved to Lago, all are the best bartenders!  The new GM is also the sweetest.  \n\nThe focaccia bread & black olive tapenade are the most delicious!  The moist tasty focaccia is also very filling.  If they have Copper River Salmon in the chefs special, it is a MUST!  Trust me. \n\nExcellent wine list & awesome happy hour & regular menu.  Three things you cannot go wrong with:\n\nBeef Carpaccio absolutely the best!  I love putting the black olive tapenade on the polenta under the beef carpaccio.  The balsamic gives it such a sweet kick.\n\nButternut Squash Tortillini has a sweet & delightful nutmeg taste that keeps you coming back.\n\nGrilled Squid & Octopus melts together with the garbanzo beans.\n\nAlso the pineapple & the blueberry infused vodkas are very good. The burger & many other salads & menu items are also so yummy.  I am a regular there so will update on other items.  Cheers!
