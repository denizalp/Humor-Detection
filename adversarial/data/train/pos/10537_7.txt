I love all things Gucci and I have a few bags, watches, perfume and a wallet to prove my love, or at least my husband's love!  \n\nFriendly but a bit houndy ...either I look rich or I look like a purse thief? Regardless, it was annoying.\n\nThis store has lots of baby and toddler clothes too, so if you're in the mood to splurge come here, just give the lady clerk with the short dark hair a dirty look if she follows you around and ask for someone else!
