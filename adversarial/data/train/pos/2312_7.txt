If you've never been to Italy, don't panic- you can go to DeFalco's and taste the real taste of Italy in the middle of gross AZ. Everything is absolutely authentic, legit Italian. Homemade tomato sauce, pasta, pizza- you name it. Even the owners are homemade Italians, if you know what I mean. You can also purchase Italian-style groceries (pasta, sauce, wine) so you can take home to cook and pretend you are a cool Italian. \n\nI recommend the ravioli if you have even an ounce of attraction for ricotta cheese.
