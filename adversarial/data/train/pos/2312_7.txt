Uhg, I so desperately want to give this location more than 3 stars because it is walking distance from my house and I have literally been coming here since I was a little girl, BUT it really just isn't the same! It seems a little dirty on the inside and every time I come in, it doesn't seem that the employees really like their job at all. I ALWAYS get the world class chocolate and it is still just as tasty as ever but the fact that 1 scoop in a small, sugar cone is $4 boggles my mind! That seems so high! The prices go up and up but the atmosphere, service, and quality all stay the same. I'd much rather spend this money at a local ice cream establishment over Baskin Robbins now!
