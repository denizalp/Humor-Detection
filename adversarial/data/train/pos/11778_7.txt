Yes they have low fare prices, but is it really worth all the hassle of fees and baggage weight limitations?\n\nWhen I arrived at the check-in line it was an okay experience.  I was a little irritated that the weight limit for check-in bags is 40lbs and if you're over it's $25 extra.  Despite that still an okay experience so far.  \n\nThe employees seemed fairly nice but they provide no snacks or drinks during your flight.  However they do charge for snacks and such and only accept card\/debit.  So there wasn't much interaction with the employees.  But they could work on a script when they are speaking to the passengers on the plane without hesitation or some confidence. \n\nThe flight was horrid!  For some reason I can sleep on flights and including this one surprisingly.  As my eyes were closed I felt like I was on a roller coaster or some ride in an amusement park and I was being jolted up and down and side to side.  Tell me how awful is that??!?   Thankfully my flight was only an hour because I WILL NOT fly Spirit anymore.
