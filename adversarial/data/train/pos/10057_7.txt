I ordered delivery from these clowns and never have I experienced being treated so rude - I felt as if the man who was taking my order was genuinely hostile to me.\n\nSimple questions to make sure my order was on spot was replied with a sarcastic and gruff tone.  If I wasn't ordering for the entire office, I'd cancel it right then and there and tell them not to bother.\n\nON TOP of all that, I was overcharged for the entire order, which I paid out of my own pocket because I didn't want to bother with the fuss of arguing with the a-hole on the phone again.  Despite their reputation and slogan being \"The Burgers are Bigger at the Double D\" - I'd go so far as saying that the \"Double D\" stands for \"D!ck and Douchebag\".\n\nMakes me wonder how they survived this long with such a shitty attitude towards their customers.\n\nEdit: I was being too generous with 2 stars.
