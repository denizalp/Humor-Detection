This is a long standing love of mine.  It's a Cuban restaurant that is a cross of authentic food with an upscale presentation and higher standard of service.  Yet without a higher price tag.  Imagine if Nana had taken a culinary class.  It's in a 3 star neighborhood with 4 star food.\n\nThere are mainstays like toasted Cuban pork or beef sandwiches.  Plantains, bruschetta, croquetas and the lot are all there.  The other tapa sized dishes include 2 lamb chops that are so savory, shrimp and Mahi ceviche and a masitas fritas pork medalion with a nice texture to it as well.\n\nAs far as the mains you can't go wrong with the Lechon Asado, easily my favorite main.  So tender and dripping with some kind of delicious sauce with rice black beans and that really fresh tasty salad.  Mix all these in each bite and it may become a favorite for you too.\n\nThe Camarones Al  Ajillo is a Cuban twist on scampi lemon buttery sauced GIGANTIC shrimp with black beans and rice.  Better than any description I could ever attempt to give.\n\nNot too fond of the Ropa Vieja.  A shredded beef and sautee'd peppers and onions. \nIt must be an authentic dish.  It's not bad I may just be spoiled by the other courses. \n\nYou can't go wrong with an espresso and a Leche Flan or Tiramisu for dessert afterwards.\n\nYou wont break the bank here and you will be satisfied.  I still taste the savory and decadently rich sweetness of the meals here.
