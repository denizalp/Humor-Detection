Not trying to sound like a snob, but the other sushi restaurants don't hold a candle to Ginko and I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews, especially from people who live here.  If you want cream cheese in your sushi or huge ass rolls, go to one of the other \"sushi\" restaurants that cater to the basics.  Ginko is the closest thing we have to an authentic sushi restaurant. They even use real wasabi, not that gummy shit other restaurants serve. My personal favorites are Eye of the Tiger-for all you raw scallop lovers (ME!), Salmon Skin Roll, Fatty Tuna Roll (Sometimes these are only  $5!)l, Ika & Saba Sashimi and Ume-Kyu Roll.  I always go during happy hour and I have always had impeccable service.  Great....now I'm hungry talking about all this sushi-guess that means I'll be going to Ginko tonight =)
