Is there a way to put a negative star. This place deserves it. It was the first apartment I moved in to post parents. Cheap and all I really needed. I stayed in my one bedroom for 3 or 4 months. I actually like the one bedroom best but it still wasn't great. It's in a bad neighborhood. I stayed in the inside near the playground so I always heard kid yelling and screaming. \n\nEventually I got a 3 bedroom with my friends and moved right upstairs from where I was. Worst apartment I have EVER HAD! When we first moved in there there were multiple problems. The worst was the bugs. I hate bugs. They were everywhere and it was disgusting. I eventually had to walk down to the office and ask to speak with the manager personally. She then talk to me and it took weeks to find out what the problem was. Ugh! \n\nWorst part was leaving.. I got charged sooooo much for all kinds of crap. They didn't make me aware of my early leaving. Over $1800. I couldn't believe it, worse they didn't send it to me so it went to collection.
