I'm not much of an artist. The most I could ever draw was an epic forest for my art class which was half-assed drawn the night before. I ended up taking the most expensive sheet of paper in our class and taking my drawing pencil and paper shader and mushing out the crappiest (but eerie) group of trees. My art teacher, who was also my volleyball coach, decided to let his only left handed spiker a break by giving me an A.\n\nKengsington Art Supply is in a great location and one of those shops worth checking out on a Sunday where a stroll through Kensington shops made the most sense even if you didn't have any cash to spend.\n\nAgain for a guy who couldn't draw a straight line to save his life, I managed to find a lot of things of interest here. Some cool desk toys like that crazy wooden figure with all the moving joints. But what impressed me was their slightly cheaper collection of Moleskin notebooks and even cheaper alternatives. Compared to Chapters, this was a way better selection considering it didn't have the stupid fancy covers that really, only teeny boppers who never spoke to their crushes ended up \"expressing their emotions\" into their diaries.
