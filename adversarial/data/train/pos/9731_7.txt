Worst customer service in town. We ordered a soup but they didnt give us spoon to eat and i have to ask for couple of time for them to give me one. The worst thing is before we leave there was one woman came to my table ask for tips and saying that she wants exactly 10%. We just wanted to pay for our bill because the service really bad here. But she insisted on tips so we left around $2 or more. But she asked for more. So rude. We were just saying thats all we got for u n left. \nSeriously, where the hell did she come from? I didnt see her the whole time. She didnt even serve us at all
