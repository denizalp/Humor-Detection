Terrible experience. A friend had a birthday celebration at Pasha with a larger group. The party was forced to switch to a fixed price menu at $40 per person. For those like myself who did not want to come to eat but just for a drink with the birthday girl, had no choice but to pay the set fee. The restaurant is not a buffet style and should not force anyone to eat if they are not interested in the food. \n\nI think this type of arrogant customer service says a lot about a business. The taste of  the food is irrelevant because this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I will not be returning.
