Located on the second floor of the DT Summerlin mall near Public School, and upstairs from the Farmers Market area near the Lawn. I heard about this new location from the free yoga Lawn series they hosted throughout the summer. We got to experience many different instructors during the lawn series and many of them will be\/are teaching at this new location.\n\nThe studio is spacious and the locker rooms are gorgeous. They offer two yoga rooms, one heated and one non heated, though just know the non heated room is still plenty warm, just not 103 degrees hot. There's also another room for kettlebell and suspension classes, and yet another for cycling. And a juice\/smoothie bar and cafe!\n\nFront staff is very friendly and they don't seem to have any kinks as far as I know. \n\nSign up now for their intro special, $30 for 30 days.
