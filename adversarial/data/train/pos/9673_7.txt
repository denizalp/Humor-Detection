HoneyBaked Ham has delicious ham. It is as good as I remembered years ago when I was in college and would bring home half a ham to Singapore for Christmas. We are lucky to have a cafe\/store in Phoenix. I can drop in and grab a sandwich and be satiated with that delectable sweet and salty goodness. I got the croissant sandwich. The croissant was nice and flaky. I can't wait to grab another soon.
