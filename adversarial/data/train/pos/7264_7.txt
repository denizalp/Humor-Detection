This place was great the first dozen or so times (although their Dobson and Ray location is much better).  The menu gets old after a few times.\nOne crazy experience: My husband and I had a hard time getting drinks, then ordering, then the check.  We could never find our waitress, as she kept disappearing for long periods of time and finally asked the manager to help. When he brought out our food my husbands meal was wrong and the mgr comped us his meal.\nAt the end of the meal, the waitress returned to our table and apologized by letting us know that she was having \"female bathroom issues\". THOSE WERE HER EXACT WORDS! We could've gone without knowing that, but at least she waited until after our meal to give us the rundown.
