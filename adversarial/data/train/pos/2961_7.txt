First off I'd like to say that I really \"LIKED\" this place until today! I've been here a number of times and thought it would be nice to treat my mother for a mani & pedi for her birthday! She decided to go with the Cucumber pedi and I opted for the basic pedi. In the past I've had the milk & honey & hot stone which were both amazing! But this time being that I am 9 months pregnant and can't stand seating for long periods of time and getting the urge to pee every 15 minutes  I decided to go with the most basic pedicure at ($25) \n\nApparently word spread fast and three different employees asked if I wanted to \"upgrade\" to any of the other pedicures. No thank you! It seemed to annoy them all that I didn't upgrade. The pedicure was nice and short as I expected. I did end up asking  for a gel polish which I'm sure he was happy about since it bumped up the price AND I also asked for  a poka dot  design (BOOM double upgrade without even having to ask me) I loved the color I picked out, BUT that didn't last long. I made the mistake of reading a magazine while he was poka dotting my nails, when I looked down to see his work \"oh dear lord\" each toe nail was completely covered with dots... I know I know that's what I asked for right, ( ummmm no not really I asked for a few poka dots but instead I got 21 dots on ONE TOE NAIL!!) of all different shapes and sizes. What was I suppose to do break his little heart by saying I didn't like it. All I could do was smile and say thank you they look great! \n\nNext mom's and I moved over to the manicure station for our manicures. She went with a french tip arylic full set, and since I hate arylic nails I just went with the basic manicure ($15) and upgraded to the gel polish once again.  He actually did a great job on my nails I did like them a lot. \n\nWhat I'm upset about is that he completely took advantage when charging me. Some how my bill of a basic manicure & basic pedicure with a $5 gel polish upgrade. Came out to a wobbling $90! Hummm let's see basic Mani=$15, basic Pedi=$25, Gel polish=$5 each for a $10 upgrade. Poka Dot madness design= $10---I'm pretty sure that adds up to $60 so why was my bill $90 because he decided to upgrade my mani to $25 even though all I got was a file down and polish change. He also decided to upgrade the price of the gel polish to $20! I didn't argue with him I knew exactly what he was trying to do and if that's how this place wants to run their business by discreetly over charging their guest then they will be losing much more costumers. I will never return here again nor will I continue to recommend to friends. My final bill after adding a $30 tip for both employees was $220! Yikes!
