Since this is so close to home and was highly rated, I was ecstatic to try this little French-Italian eatery on my Dad's birthday dinner...and guess I should have tuned down my excitement. We went on a week-night, and contrary to the massive warnings about \"having to reserve a table\", we had no problem getting a table on the day of, and there were an ample amount of seatings. \n\n----- Food: Moderate -----\nBread   --  Gotta give credit for the bread, it was nicely done; crusty, thick and warm. \n\nMussels   --  Had to double check if we ordered the right thing, this being tasteless and lean. Surprisingly, the sauce was good though. \n\nOnion Soup  --   Was sweet? Is that how the French do it? Whatever happened to the ionic bowl?\n\nCarbonara  --  Butter overload. Period.\n\nLasagna  --  They lied. It definitely wasn't \"North American\" best.\n\nVeal  --   Can be compared to a morning minute steak or the steak on a HK sizzling plate.\n\nCreme Brulee  --  Now this is FINALLY something to brag about! This is seriously recommended. \n\nCreme Caramel  --   Meh. No surprises here. \n\n----- Service: Mediocre -----\n-   Louise wasn't as helpful as expected\n-   food came out real slow for a casual-family restaurant\n-   limited water refills (Almost felt like we were experiencing a water famine)\n-   male waiter tossed a fork at us (Sorry, didn't know we were disturbing your blooming juggling career.) \n\n----- Atmosphere : Mediocre-----\n-   very warm (Don't get me wrong, there were indivudal AC units in every room, but they didn't bother turning it on, probably because they were huge eco supporters. But I gotta give them credit for opening the main doors wide open to let a little of the city breeze in...)\n-   plates (shaky, granny floral plates)\n-   dim\n-   cracked vinyl chairs\n\n\nFood: 3\/5\nService: 2\/5\nAtmosphere: 2\/5
