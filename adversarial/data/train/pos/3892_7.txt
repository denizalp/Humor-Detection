After eating American food for the past 3 days in Vegas, we found some Asian food. My friend and I didn't have too much have an appetite so I didn't do the AYCE but the rest of our group which was an additional 4 people did. They told us either we ALL have to do AYCE or we can't which was stupid. So my friend and I who wasn't opting for the AYCE sat at a different table next to them. It was so stupid.\n\nI had tofu soup because I was hungover and I thought it was okay. Not that great, but what can I really expect for something being on the strip? My friends who had the AYCE said it was pretty good.\n\nService was HORRIBLE for my table. Not once did the waitress check on our table or refilled our water. She visited our groups table frequently but not ours. Maybe because we didn't get AYCE we weren't as valuable customers as those who did.\n\nAnyway, usually tip is included if you're a party of 5\/6 or more right? Well they added the tip on there because we were originally a group of 6 I guess but we had to separate so it was NOT right of them to add the tip on there already since we ended up being 2 different parties and the fact that she never visited our table for any service at all!
