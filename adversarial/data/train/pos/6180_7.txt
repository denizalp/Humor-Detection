Still not the Lenny's I know and love. I now know why too. They re-heat previously cooked burgers to melt the cheese. I watched a total of 12 pre-made burgers be sent out. They tong them out of the little warmer drawer, place on the grill or griddle and reheat to appear hot and fresh. The burgers are tasteless, I mean nothing. I asked the less-then-thrilled cashier if I wanted a fresh burger can they do that? She said \"uh yeah it would take longer.\" \n\nDoubt I will go back.
