Visiting from Cali, food was NOT GOOD. I had never experienced such a place in my life, and that is not a compliment. Their food made me sick for almost a week. Going there with an \"open mind\" will only cost you money and possibly an entire week in the toilet. Owners really have no concern for their customers. I give it ZERO stars, and hope who ever reads this doesn't make the same mistake I did.
