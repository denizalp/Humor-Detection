Ah, Steve (we're super tight, so that's what I call him) ... you have REALLY outdone yourself this time.\n\nYou know... when you built the Bellagio, and you were asking me what I thought of the lights in the lobby, and I said, \"Steve, don't you think you're going totally overboard with the Chihulli *lamp* in the darn lobby?!?!?!\" \"Why don't you just tone it down a notch?\"\n\nSteve listened.\n\nHe built Encore with me in mind .. you know -- simply put ... the guy just gets me. \n\nSimple elegance, attention to detail .... great customer service. I felt like a princess during my entire stay.\n\nWhy knock a star? When we arrived, glasses in the room were missing, and our ice bucket was filled with water from the previous guest, with no new bag inserted.\n\nSteve, you know I love you, so you know I've got to be telling you like it is.\n\nxoxox!
