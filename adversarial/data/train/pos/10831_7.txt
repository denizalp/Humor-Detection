I attended a Wednesday service on my day off.  It was ok.  Nice coffee shop. Simple, sweet, homespun. Music and messages of God's love for not perfect people.\n\nWhere I had a problem was speaking to Lori R (see \"tip\" below) about their  Destiny House ministry.  This was the first time I have run up against those smug judgmental Christians everybody warned me about.  Wow - mean and belittling to me about my walk with Christ. I didn't measure up. I was judged for working in a casino (IN LAS VEGAS!). \n\nIt made me happy I go to Central.  We aren't like that.  Will not go back.
