It was somewhat busy but there was no trouble seating our party of four for dinner.\n\nMeh. Nothing memorable about the food though except that the meatball sandwich was bland. The mozzarella cheese and the sauce didn't do much for it. The sprinkling of parmesan helped but there still wasn't much flavor. The spaghetti with meatballs was insipid and lifeless too. \n\nService was okay and the food did come out quick, but please do something about the flavor of the food.
