People that know me know that I love peanut butter. In my opinion, Retro Bakery had the best peanut butter cookie in Las Vegas.  Let me stress the word HAD.  The former owner of Retro Bakery, Kari Garcia, took her talents to North Las Vegas by opening tsp. Baking Company.  Even better news...she brought her peanut butter cookie with her.  It's a little different than Retro's, but it is now my favorite peanut butter cookie in Las Vegas. The PB cookie is made with real peanut butter, not too moist, not too dry, and is even fresh days after.  If you don't know Kari's work, then you're missing out.  Kari has so much energy that you can feel the passion she has for her customer and a baked goods.  Everything in her bakery is homemade and fresh.   You'll find custom cakes, cookies, mini-cupcakes, and even some ice cream. But if you ask me, it's all about the peanut butter cookie.\n\n2017 Yelp Review #11
