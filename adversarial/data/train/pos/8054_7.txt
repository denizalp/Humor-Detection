Let me start off by saying that I would never come here by choice. The pictures didn't look appealing and we could make better food at home. Our friend had their wedding rehearsal dinner here with a group of 30 people. And I must say the staff did an awesome job accommodating us.\n\nOur waitress (forgot her name) was super patient and friendly with our large group. The bussers made sure our glasses were filled and plates were taken away accordingly. The manager came around a few times to make sure we were all happy. They were even nice enough to split up all of our checks. So the stars in this review go to them. \n\nAs for the food, it's a completely different story. The only thing I enjoyed was the chip and salsa bar. The chips were crispy and warm. I liked that there were different salsas so you could try them all. They were all fresh and plentiful. Our main dishes were forgettable. I ordered lettuce wrapped tacos. The lettuce was wilted and the meat was boring. My BF ordered the carne asada. That was also boring and forgettable. \n\nNot my first choice for Mexican food and probably will never be back here again.
