This review is not only for Garage, but also \"Family Dugout,\" the new pop up shop that is owned by and connected to Garage... It just opened this week and it will be around through Spring Training!\n\nFamily Dugout is a baseball lover's dream... they're still getting in a ton of merchandise, but for now, they've got really cute baseball team books, books about ballparks, team pennants, Cracker Jacks, peanuts, popcorn, Big League Chew, sunflower seeds, and more.  The \"dugout\" is covered in green turf and I'm pretty sure there will soon be an area where you can take pics as if you were posing for a baseball card.  The only bummer: no Detroit Tigers stuff but I assume that's because their spring training takes place in Florida and not here.  \n\nAs for Garage itself, they've got amazing quirky fun gifts for kids and hip adults... and a huge collection of unique candy too!  I picked up some fun stuff recently and Baby M got a few fabulous gifts here from friends as well... Right now you can pick up all kinds of onesies and infant outfits with band themes including AC\/DC, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Run DMC, and more.  There is a plethora of cute stuff for both boys and girls too.  \n\nKatie, the owner, is super sweet, and so was Lisa who was working today when I stopped by.  Sure gifts from Garage are on the pricey side, but sometimes you just can't resist.  If nothing else, stop by this place to \"window shop\" or pick up a sugary snack.  You can't help but smile at how adorable and fun both Garage and Family Dugout are!
