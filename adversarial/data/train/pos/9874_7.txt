Cheese Alert!  \n\nStopped in here last weekend after a nice lunch next door at the Blue Spoon to check out their cheeses!  LOTS of cheese.  Lots of samples!  But oh man, bring your money honey.  This place isn't cheap.  I was eye balling this truffled cheese that was around $18\/lb.  Ugh, why must I be attracted to the most expensive cheeses?!\n\nSadly, I did not splurge for this fine delicacy, but it's definitely worth a look around in their shop for all you cheese aficionados.  The employees looked bored, but I think I would be too...I mean they just cut the cheese all day long.... (pun intended)  ;) \n\nSave your money and make a little side trip down to Monroe....Alp & Dell is the place to stock up on some seriously (cheap) cheese action.
