I like this place. It's a fun thing to do with people when they are in town, and relatively inexpensive. There's a one drink minimum in order to sit on the patio. But they offer coffee as well as a few cocktails for those who don't want to imbibe, or prefer not to spend $15-$20 on a strip beverage.\n\nThat being said, the cocktails they offer are unique and delicious. There is a mini-show (3-5 min long) every half hour starting at dusk and going till 11:30pm. Now, this isn't a cirque du soleil production. There aren't actors, or acrobatics. This is strictly production, lighting and video. They cycle through a few different shows and repeat. I've seen 3 or 4 of them and each is different and fun. In between the shows you can drink and enjoy the gorgeous view and ambience. \n\nDefinitely a place to check out if you haven't been or are in town visiting.
