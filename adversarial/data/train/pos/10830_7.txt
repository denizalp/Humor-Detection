We come here even though Jenni Pho is closer for all our hangover needs but this past Sunday's visit just might be our last. Walked into the restaurant and was not even greeted for over 5 minutes even though there were workers here and there just looking at us... My man finally walked up to a server and asked if we could sit in one of the empty booths.. We sit.. takes another 10 minutes just to get water and menus.. After a few more minutes pass my boyfriend tries to get one of the server's attention but we are told to \"hold on...\" At this point we are so irritated. We walk out he gets a cheeeeeburger from next door and I got my pho from Jenni Pho. UGHHHHH the restaurant is small and was not even that busy.   \n\nAnnie you need to step up your game because the service here gets a big fat F~!!!
