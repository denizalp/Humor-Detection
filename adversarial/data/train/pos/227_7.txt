Backstory: I have gone to pink polish every other week for the past 6 months, and when you first begin going there they ask for your name and phone number. So being the naive person I am, I assume they're keeping track of what I normally get... A FILL AND A GEL POLISH! \n\nSo today I get there at about 10:15, 15 minutes after they open, and a lady greats me and I say \"hi can I get a fill and gel\" and she points me to this boy sitting at the front desk. So I walk up to him and say \"hi can I please get a gel and fill\" and he taps a lady on the shoulder who had ear phones in. I said again \"hi can I please get a gel and a fill\" she asks me for my number, and says \"Sierra?\" I say yes and she goes \"and what would you like to get today\" and I said for the fourth time \"a gel and a fill please!\" She says she can get me in right away and then sends me to the back to pick out a polish. \n\nI sit in the waiting area for about a minute, and this lady comes and gets me and takes me to her area. She says \"a gel manicure today.\" And I respond \"and a fill\". She walks away and comes back with tin foil and cotton balls. And if you have acrylics you know they just sand down the nail and fill it in and give you a new gel polish. So I stop her and say \"I want a gel and a fill, I have acrylics on\" and she responds \"you want me to take your acrylics off\" and I say no \"a gel and a fill\" at this point I'm a little upset because I have never said the words GEL AND FILL this much in a 10 minute time period in my life. She responds that she doesn't do acrylics and goes back to the front. The lady from the front comes over and let's me know it will be 15 minutes before a technician who does acrylics can help me.\n\nSo I wait for 20 minute... \n\nThen the lady from the front comes back and asks me what my name is LIKE YOU DIDN'T JUST SEAT ME AT THIS STATION 20 MINUTES AGO! And then she goes back to the front and comes back and told me that I didn't tell anyone I wanted a GEL AND A FILL and that it would be another 15 minutes until someone could be with me and then asked if I had anything else to do today like my entire life revolves around getting my nails done. So I politely said I was going somewhere else and went to my happy place, target. The prices are way to high for that kind of service 10\/10 suggest going somewhere else!
