NEVER! I REPEAT NEVER GIVE THIS DEALERSHIP A DIME!!! \nWow!!! Worst experience ever!!! Bought a NEW jeep from this dealership and within 100 miles I had to bring it back for repairs!!! TWICE! To sum it up this is the most DYSFUNCTIONAL service department ever!!!!! From management to the porters, these clowns could care less about you or your vehicle! Nothing but lies!  Had nothing but problems!! If I ran my business like this I'd be out of business within a week!! They need to replace the whole bunch and start over! They are trashing the jeep brand! Please take my advice and stay far away from these thrives and crooks!! You're welcome!
