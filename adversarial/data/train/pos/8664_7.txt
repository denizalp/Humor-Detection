Chinese food on Christmas Eve is a tradition. But we've 86'd all the usual takeout places we used to patronize closer to home, after appearances on KTNV's Dirty Dining in one case, and a change of chef in another, made them no-go. So I went to Yelp and found The Magic Noodle. Despite the name, it didn't occur to me that this wasn't going to be the typical Chinese food place of our past, but oh, well, we go with the flow. \n\nWe brought along a bottle of wine, just in case they didn't serve it. Not only do they not, it was tolerated because it was Christmas Eve, but strongly discouraged other times. Good thing we thought to bring a corkscrew. And since I drink exactly two things - coffee and wine - the coffee mugs we were provided (to sort-of hide the contents) were perfectly okay with me.\n\nService was very friendly, and our waitress was patient with our questions. That was good, since there are virtually no explanations for menu items with Chinese names.\n\nWe started with a Szechuan dumpling appetizer, which was very tasty. I ordered Lan Zhou noodle soup, and my husband got the Szechuan beef brisket. But as soon as they were delivered, we switched dishes. He expected the brisket to be sliced, but these were chunks, and covered in fat. The Lan Zhou was sliced.\n\nI thought I could handle the chunks of brisket, but it turned out to be so fatty that there was almost no meat to eat. I filled up a small plate completely with nothing but fat, and in the end there was virtually only soup and noodles. (The noodles were excellent and broth was good). The waitress brought me a small plate of the sliced Lan Zhou beef. I have no idea what kind of cut this is, but it was ice-cold, looked greenish in the center, and tasted weird to me. \n\nThe restaurant is clean and modern, the noodle-making show in the open kitchen is fascinating, the prices are reasonable, but to us it just wasn't worth the trip.
