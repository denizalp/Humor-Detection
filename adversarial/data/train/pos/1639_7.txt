It's been a couple months since I was here, and I'm a little behind on my review. I didn't stay at the hotel, so I have no opinion there. It's based on the shops and the casino. \n\nI stopped off here for a visit to the casino late one night during my weekend in Vegas, and it was really fun. I love the casino, it is huge. It wasn't terribly crowded, so I had the opportunity to walk around and find a good game to play. Oddly enough, another casino visitor and his wife ended up explaining the game I was playing to me, and it was really fun. \n\nAfter I was done, I was trying to find the way out and back to the parking garage. I ended up finding the shops instead and wandered around to check them out. Unfortunately, it was too late in the night for any of them to be open, but it was definitely cool to look at and decide if I wanted to come back later that following day when everything was actually open. \n\nDue to walking around so much, I had no idea how the hell to get back to my car. I was driving a rental, so I didn't even know what car was mine. Lol. I had to set off the alarm once I reached the parking garage to find it. That's always fun. Lol. I had to stop and ask someone working how to get to the parking garage, and they were super helpful and actually gave really good directions. Once I was pointed in the right direction, I was set. \n\nThe things that stood out to me were the fact the casino was really clean and nice. It was quite large with a wide variety of games to play. The customer service was good too. I appreciated the person who took the time to give me directions to the parking garage and help me out there. \n\nWould I return? Yep, I had no complaints. It's a gorgeous hotel and casino with a lot of great draws to it. Definitely worth a stop while in Vegas. \n\nReview 154 of 2017.
