I'm giving 3 stars because my husband loves this place but I would give it 2. Reason is, I went on half price whiskey night and they charged me full price. When I mentioned it to the bartender that I was overcharged, her response was \"that sucks\" and that was it.... so yeah, I'm holding a grudge. But their bowls are alright.
