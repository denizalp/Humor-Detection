Very friendly service here, if you need your clothes for a certain time they will get them done for you. My clothes always come back clean, unlike a location I  went to on Yonge Street and didn't realize it until the night of the event so I had to go in a dirty dress!\n\nIf you are looking for a fast, nice, and friendly service for your dry cleaning needs, come here!
