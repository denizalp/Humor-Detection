Experience was mostly good, just a couple concerns...however, after reading other negative reviews (not recommended) I'd suggest you really do research before boarding here...Firstly, the price. Seems to be a little high personally, but I'd like to think the facility is exceptional... We left our dogs here for three nights (4 days). I left specific bags of food for each measured for each day and gave the girl instructions on how to feed (nothing complicated), yet we picked them up with leftover bags... I'm choosing to believe the dogs weren't eating as much out of stress, but no one discussed this with me, and even told me that they were eating fine and didn't seem upset or anything when I called to check on them. My older dog even seemed a little traumatized when we picked them up, but I overlook that because he is a timid breed. Also, I'm not sure what the bathroom situation is, (we had them in the large run), but our 6 month old was completely potty trained prior to boarding, but since he's been home he has had accident after accident. This causes me to question the attention given to them. All in all, it is a boarding facility and they have MANY animals to look after, so I wouldn't expect it to be perfect, but a little more communication and attentiveness would have been nice. And I really don't like some of the negatives I've heard from other people.
