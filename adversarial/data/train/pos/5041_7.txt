Jardin, I am soooo sad that you have less than perfect reviews.... Hopefully my review will take you out of the orange zone and into the red zone....\n\n\nOur breakfast experience at Jardin was nothing but perfect. We asked to be seated on the patio. It was a bit chilly so we asked for the heaters to be turned on. The employees were very attentive and nice.\n\nThe Coffee: It is from Fonte coffee roaster in Seattle. Steve Wynn made a special trip up there to choose this coffee to be served at Jardin so it is super special and ofcourse one of the kind.....Just do yourself a favor and order it.\n\nThe Nutella french toast was amazing..... It had walnut on the top.... I don't like any kind of nuts in my food so for next time I will order it w\/o them.\n\nI don't usually say this, but if you find yourself within 100 miles radius of Wynn hotel, get to it.... Just to try that heavenly coffee.... Yup it is that Good!
