I was super hungry and decided to come here because I love the one downtown. The service was prompt and my hotdog was what I expected, if a little worse than the original. I was so disappointed when I got the chips and they weren't made on site.\n\nI was there alone, sitting at the bar and after I placed my order the two employees played on their phones the entire time! At least attempt some conversation. This one also did not have alcohol.
