I felt like I was joining a club. There are rules and regulations, but luckily my brother knew them. You get in the long line, you scope for hints that people are leaving one of the three tables, you figure out what you're ordering in advance to getting to the counter, you get it spicy. \n\nIt's not really much of a task to figure out what to order; besides the baked goods at another counter all they do is chicken. And my, they do it well. \n\nI ordered the quarter chicken meal: chicken, salad, rice and French fries. The chicken was so tender, so fall-off-the-bones, I didn't want to use any cutlery. Spicy wasn't spicy, just spiced and just right. \n\nI didn't get the rice, still not sure whose fault that is. The salad was unnecessary. A lot of it just got soggy and cooked beneath the chicken. The fries on the other hand were great. A bit over-peppered at times, but still rank A. \n\nThe portion was HUGE. $6.99 for a Styrofoam meal box. And then they give you a bun at the cash register too! I guess it's like them giving you a business card to try out their bakery. I say take the plunge, the roll was a nice addition and all the treats on display looked really good. \n\nFour stars for the fries (I'm disregarding the other sides), five stars for that chicken. So I'm rounding up. Oh, that chicken. \n\nIf you can get past the dozens on rotating chickens, the black gloves the intense looking men use as they wield their meat cleavers and that long line then go.  Join the club.
