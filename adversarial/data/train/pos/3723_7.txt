So happy to have our wonderful Chef Desyree back in action, and better than ever! A lot of you may remember her from Art of Flavors downtown. Same concept, super cool location! I have been here quite a few times since her opening last year, and never once have I been let down. \nAnd of course the creative Chef is at her finest creating new and unique flavors that you never expect to fall in love with like jalapenos & peanuts or fruit, or mustard apple pie. I have a few favorites that she continues to bring back like creme brulee and spumoni. Recently I tried an affogato, (espresso & gelato) with a brown sugar butter flavor and it was truly one of the best things I have tasted, in MY LIFE!\nThere are also pastries, coffee mugs, and other random goodies you could purchase here. They usually post their \"Flavors of the Day\" on Facebook and Instagram. Everything from fruity, savory, spicy, even cheesy. Who makes cheesy gelato? THIS PLACE!!\nIt is always busy, even when I come at 10:00 PM! Happy to see such success here, they really deserve it.
