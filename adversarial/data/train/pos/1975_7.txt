Back again! This time we got a 1-bedroom suite on the 35th floor of Tower 2 (Room 720) - hence the 1 star upgrade as well.  We usual get a strip facing room, but went for the poolside and actually loved it. Wet Republic kept me entertained day and night, but that is another review!\n\nI took a zillion pics of the room. Fixed the bad bathroom lighting by moving the bedside lamps to the vanity in MY ginormous bathroom equipped with two vanities, tub for 5+, shower and private water closet. My b\/f said the small bathroom off the living was nice and functional. \n\nIt's two rooms with a full kitchen. What I LOVED was all the closet space. I turned the closets in the living room into a shoe closet (see pics) and used the one in the bedroom for my clothes. I took the silverware sorter from the kitchen and used it as a makeup caddy in the bathroom; worked like a charm! The most usable bathroom storage ever in a bathroom in Vegas. \n\nIt does get crazy hot in the mornings on this side of the building, so if you want to sit outside in the am, be aware. Loved the view of the Grand Pool Complex (more pics on that review). \n\nTower 2 is fantastic because you can still go out the back - we walked to the Cosmopolitan for dinner at STK. About a 7 minute walk. Love my rollup-shoes!  The bed was super comfy, the room had plenty of blackout shades and the roll-up tv in the desk was cool, but never used - we're not in Vegas to watch TV!\n\nWe pretty much spend all day, and I mean all day, at the pool; then, go to clubs at night. Love that there is a Starbucks in Tower 1 and that little cafe Delights in Tower 2. \n\nCouple of things that sucked about the room, but not enough to dock stars this visit because other that the following the room was awesome:\n1) The slider was so hard to open that my b\/f had to do it for me each time and he said his veins bulged in his arm when he opened it - Seen his pics? Should have not been an issue ;).  2) the TV won't turn off in the bathroom unless you push the GFC button on the electrical switch, as this is where my lamp was plugged in, I had to push reset to turn the lamp on. 3) WHY THE HECK ARE THERE NO ROBE HOOKS IN THE BATHROOM!!!!!? 4) bathroom lighting sucks.\n\nDOS: 8\/28 - 9\/2\/2014\n\nLinks to my related previous reviews - more & updates on the way:\nGrand Pool Complex\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/grand-pool-complex-las-vegas?hrid=Z-No0npK2EiyZAtRygaxJg\n\nHakkasan Night Club\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/hakkasan-nightclub-las-vegas?hrid=1rN6uGIV82-rTZzJ0AVPqQ\n\nWet Republic\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/wet-republic-ultra-pool-las-vegas?hrid=dim7jHTr8AKxuzd2DlvR4Q\n\nDelights\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/delights-las-vegas?hrid=UtDg4NwNxwa62EPpBIgVog
