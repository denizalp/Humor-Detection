I've visited this store quite a few times over the last 5 years. Apparently, today is my first time my checkin has been captured.\n\nIt's Thursday afternoon and they are busy as usual. The huge parking lot is more than 1\/2 full already. Imagine how much of a zoo it is here on the weekends.\n\nCustomer service has been consistent and I pretty much expect the same great service each time I visit.\n\nAs with any IKEA don't expect to just breeze in and out quickly. \n\nOf course, the cafeteria style set for the food is always efficient, cheap and tasty.\n\nAfter finishing my shopping I noticed a little reminder that it DOES pay (see photo) to dine in at IKEA \\^_^\/!!!! YAY ME!!! Also, coffee and tea are always on the house when you sign up as an IKEA family member!
