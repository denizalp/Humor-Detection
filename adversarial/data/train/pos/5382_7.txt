The sign advertises this place as Paleo friendly; however, when I asked which smoothies they could make Paleo friendly, the guy behind the counter said \"what's Paleo?\" From a customer service standpoint, the person at the cash register should be the most knowledgeable about your offerings, particularly if it's one of your selling points! I went ahead and placed an order for a protein shake, paid $12 (what?!), and waited. What I got was not great - I've made better shakes at home. They were very friendly; however, the lack of knowledge on the part of the staff and the pricing means I will not be back.
