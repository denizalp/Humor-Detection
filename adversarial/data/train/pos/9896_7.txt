I'm not sure how many history channel\/discovery channel specials I've seen on the Hoover Dam, countless no doubt. Being a guy I'm fascinated by things that require large metrics to measure them. Great wall of china, Angkor Wat, The Great Pyramids.. That kind of stuff. \n\nSo obviously I'm going to take to liking to the 700,000 ft tall, 18 bazillion tons of concrete, 1034 trillion gallons of water Hoover Dam. (I just made all those stats up.) \n\nAnyhow the Hoover Dam has always been very interesting to me, the sheer scope of the project is the stuff that the inner child dreams about. And I love art deco, something about the facades of the turbine towers, the statues and other ornamentation wonderfully date the Hoover Dam, and give it a great feel. \n\nSo I've always wanted to go, and this last trip to Vegas was the perfect opportunity. Coming from the Nevada side, the only parking we found was a $7 parking garage which, truth be told was a bit steep. \n\nThey then have two tour options, the Discovery tour and a new tour that they are \"beta testing\". I chose the Discovery tour, as it was $11 and I wasn't sure I wanted to shell out 30 bucks for the new tour that they were testing. \n\nThe discovery tour includes a 5-10 minute film, a trip into a room that sits above one of the tubes that feeds the turbines (not so interesting), a visit to one of the turbine rooms (pretty cool), and ends at the observation deck. All in all, I don't think it's worth the money unless you really want to see the turbine room. Everything else is kind of blah. \n\nYou could get equally spectacular pictures from vantage points outside of the tour area and walking across the actual dam. My advice, if you are really interested in the Hoover Dom or the turbine room, go on the tour. If you want to save some dollas and just want to take some cool pictures, you might just want to walk across the dam first and see if that works.\n\nAlso, you do go through an airport style security check point before going on the tour.
