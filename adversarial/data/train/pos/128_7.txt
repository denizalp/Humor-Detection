Total utter garbage.  When I order desserts from this place, it feels like amateurs whipping up crap from their kitchen at home.  Food does not taste like its made professionally.  Taste like a 10 year old whipped up something non edible.  The sesame soup was 100% watery and clear color as heck, the almond soup was extremely clumpy with 0% almond flavor, seems like it was just all starch.  The tofu pudding(dau fu fa) was completely runny and watery(complete liquid).  Strawberry shake tasted like water because they were too cheap to put any strawberries inside, the color of it was even completely water clear.  Taro Sago had only 5% taro and 5% sago and 90% coconut milk.  Disgusted that they serve this trash to customers.  Filthy owner and staff.  Avoid this dumpster.
