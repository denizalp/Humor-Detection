So I'm sitting in Alternative Grounds, drinking a pot of lemon tea, eating a samosa, enjoying the music, when this wasp flies over and starts helping itself to my mango chutney.  It would not leave me be(e). My first instinct was to kill it ... it was being slow, sluggish... but then I remembered where I was, and didn't want to be judged for killing a creature. So, I get up to move tables, and it stings me in the neck. Can you believe it? It was the worst! The staff were nice and gave me a garbage bag of ice (no paper towels, I guess). But after making a huge dramatic scene about it, I had to leave and go to Timothy's down the street (bee-free fyi). \n\nAside from the wasp, the snack was actually quite good. They have an all-vegetarian menu with salads,granola, empanadas, roti, salad, sandwiches, etc. The options change daily. I've had the potato\/pea samosa and the tofu\/spinach - both are delicoius -baked not deep-fried. The service is a bit slow for food - but they'll bring it out to you, which is nice. \n\nIf I'm not too traumatized, I will return.
