So my friend and I were \"upgraded\" to a king suite from the queen...notice the sarcasm dripping from my sentence. \n\nMy friend and I, both 24, walked into the hotel, and everyone was at least 30 years old. The whole place reeked of cigarette smoke. At first glance, it looked fine- it was clean, and nothing was obviously wrong with it. We walked into the \"non-smoking\" room, and noticed the awful smell of cigarettes. Ew.\n\nThe room was huge- there was a full couch, the king bed, a little bar area with a sink and a bar with stools, and a mini fridge. It sounds great on paper. But the feel of it, the atmosphere, the smell- everything was just not to our taste. It sort of felt icky. ;( \n\nBut I guess you get what you paid for, and we paid $20 a night. I didn't wake up with bites, or see or hear anything crawling or scurrying. And it was in a nice walking distance to the Fremont street dealio. I just personally don't care to go back to it.
