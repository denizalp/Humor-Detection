Uhg, I want to so badly love this store because it has been in this exact location since I was a little girl, despite all of the shopping center remodels! But the past few times that we've been in, the items that we were looking to buy were SO much more expensive than other stores like Home Depot or Costco. Today I popped in for 9 volt batteries and a pack of 4 was $15! We needed a bunch to replace all of our smoke detectors and I thought this was a little steep. Sure enough, they were half the price at Costco. They were also out of the other few items that we needed so I left empty handed.\n\nThe staff working is always friendly and helpful but this bargain shopper just prefers to get the deals elsewhere. Just not for me I suppose!
