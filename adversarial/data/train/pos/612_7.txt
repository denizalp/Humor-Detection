What a letdown.\n\nI was expecting to find something more like the Vegetarian Food Festivals I've been to, with a bunch of vendors selling delicious spicy food, daring you with hot and sour soups, spicy appetizers and some Mexican insanity peppers. Instead it was just rows and rows of hot sauce vendors. As far as I could tell, there was NO FOOD, save for the grilled corn guy and the same food place that are always there. I'm not really one to buy hot sauce, I prefer to make my own, so after taking a big tour around all the vendors, we left.
