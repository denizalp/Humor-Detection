This new location in Downtown Summerlin is very spacious with a nice patio area.  We came by for a drink and I immediately spotted the Honey Vanilla Latte on the menu.  As I've had their famed Lavender Latte at the Main Street location, I wanted to try something new.  I ordered a small with almond milk and it was ready in no time.  I loved the flavor as it wasn't too sweet. I'm looking forward to another visit soon when I can sit down, enjoy the patio, and some food.
