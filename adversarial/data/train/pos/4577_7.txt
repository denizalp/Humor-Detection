In the neighborhood for lunch, Earl's Grocery fit the bill. A nice market of interesting and unique micro products to browse while waiting for your fresh sandwich to be prepared and a huge cooler of different and unique drinks, plus a number of local micro brews if you're so inclined.\n\nI had the \"Back Porch BLT\" today and was seriously impressed. Jalapeno bacon, pimento cheese, fried green tomato pickle, lettuce, Duke's mayo on grilled sourdough. Terrific crunchy texture, perfect bacon and a lovely firm sourdough. Perfect sandwich, absolutely.\n\nDefinitely need to get back to Earl's. I can completely see why this is one of the Top 100 on Yelp in Charlotte. Awesome.
