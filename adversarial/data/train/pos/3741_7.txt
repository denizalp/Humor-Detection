Recently came in for a small meal to conduct a class project. I came in with no expectations (since I am not vegan) and had my stereotypical doubts. OMG was I totally wrong. Green is absolutely delicious!! I tried their Chili Cheese Fries and you would never even guess they're vegan! My friend got their Boneless Buffalo Wings and they were great! I would totally come back. Service was extremely fast and the ambience was super chill.\n\nOnly knock I have is the limited parking and the confusing line\/waiting area. Also, the menu is not on the wall, but physical handouts you have to look at in line. I wish instead of alcohol they had some food items on the chalkboard. Consumer Behavior theories would back my ideas ;) \n\nEither way this is such a great place for a great price!! Love that they also have the Nami across the way for dessert. :)
