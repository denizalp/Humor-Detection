Update: 2\/20\/18\nI am still receiving harassing phone calls and voicemails from Direct Fairways. At this point, I'd estimate that my shop has recieved a few hundred phone calls in the past 6 months. No definitive action has been taken to cease their calls. I will be contacting my lawyer if this continues much longer. This is blatant harassment and is becoming a distraction to my business.\n\nUpdate: 1\/10\/18\nSo immediately after I posted the original review, my business information was put up on Craigslist in a fake ad. Immediately before I started receiving calls from people inquiring about the fake ad, I got a call from a blocked number, from a guy who sounded identical to the salesman I had spoken to before writing my review. The unidentified person left a very odd voicemail and told me to enjoy all of the phone calls. I can't prove it was the telemarketer that called earlier in the day, prompting me to leave a bad review, that posted the ad on craigslist, but I firmly believe it was him.\n\nAbout a month later, I was contacted by Direct Fairway's Customer Service Team - I believe it was Jeff. Jeff was incredibly professional and kind, and offered me a year of free advertising at two local golf courses as an apology.\n\nLong story short, I accepted, and received proofs of the ads, inside of the Yardage Guides for Woodcreek Oaks and Diamond Oaks Golf Courses. The ads are relatively small (1\/3 of a page) but it's free advertising, so I'm not going to critique it - the ad looks professional and fairly well designed.\n\nI want so desperately to add stars to this review, based simply off of how professional Jeff was, however I still receive at least one call a day - I've received two so far today. I have requested multiple, multiple, multiple times not be contacted further and they continue to contact me. I am also on the national do not call list.\n\nIt's hard to fix a mistake when you keep making the same mistake. The owners need to dig deep, cut out the bad practices and exercise some ethical boundaries or they're going to end up going out of business. \n\nOriginal review:\nThis company is out of control. They are why the \"do not call\" registry was created. I've asked several times for then to stop calling, and they continue calling. I don't know how you settle for cold calling businesses about ads in scorecards - I can only imagine that the sales personnel must add zero value to society. Really - how useless to society do you have to be to take that job? Sad.
