Q:  What does a redneck consider a seven-course meal?\nA:  A hot dog and a six pack of beer!\n\nNothing screams, \"great eats\" like a semi-permanent food truck parked outside a tire shop. Welcome to Arizona! They have a storefront on 83rd Avenue and Indian School Road but this food truck is legit. They set up shop at 6:00 PM and are there until midnight on most night and are open until 2:00 AM on Friday and Saturday. Dogs are about $3 each.\n\nThe Sinaloa, Arizona, and Sonora dogs are among my favorites. The Sinaloa has Ruffles on top. I mean c'mon! The Arizona is super cheesy which is also great. As for the Sonora, it's an Arizona staple so you gotta get it. Wash it down with an ice cold apple soda and it's a tasty meal. So if you need a quick bite to-go or in the mood for some grilled bacon-wrapped wieners nestled in a warm toasty bun, stop on by. Grab three and have yourself a wiener party! You'll get a kick right in the mouthpants and have a mouthgasm!
