I went here on a whim, and very hungry! I was surprised to find a favorite in their meatball sub. It is delicious on so many levels. The bread really makes it I think. I'm not sure if they bake it in house or buy fresh and local, but it's always toasted perfectly but soft on the inside. Plus, they pile on the mozzarella cheese and have a good ratio of sauce (I love my marinara sauce!). \n\nJust keep in mind if you're popping in you may have to wait for about 15 minutes, but that ensures you're getting a fresh made dish. If you're really in a hurry make sure you call ahead. I really need to take a break from the meatballs sub, if possible, and try their pizza next!
