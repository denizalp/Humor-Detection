Imagine a Giant Eagle Market District miniaturized and this is what you get. \n\nI do have a nearby Market District Express in Harmarville but, it doesn't compare to this location at all. This location offers a Starbucks, deli, produce, pharmacy, bakery, sushi, beer and wine section and even a soup, salad and yogurt bar. The only thing really missing is a butchered meat section but, I guess that's what a regular Giant Eagle or Giant Eagle Market District is for. There is even a cafe where you can sit and relax\n\nThere is also a Get Go and a car wash out back so you can fill your and your cars belly at the same time.\n\nDo not be mistaken as this IS NOT a full store but a compact version. For some things you will have to go to either the full sized Market District, Trader Joe's or The Fresh Market.\n\n I hope one of these eventually makes it to the eastern suburbs, cough Penn Hills, cough Monroeville, cough Wilkins Township. Just saying.
