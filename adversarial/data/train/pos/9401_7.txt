I thought Arabs cooked the best kabobs until I tried some Chinese ones. The lamb kabobs were great and had a nice level of heat. They were more flavorful than Mediterranean lamb chunks on skewers. The menu is not as expansive as some Chinese restaurants in the immediate area. The food is consistently good. I have dined with different groups of people and each time every person left happy. I would like more Asian and Arab foods fused.
