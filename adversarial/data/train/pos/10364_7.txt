If you like your iced tea with a hint of Italian dressing this is the place for you. \n\nAlso, my server was polite but the cook kept walking through the empty dining room. One time he gave me a funny look and said \"Your food will be ready in a few minutes pal.\" I don't know if he was just pissed because they weren't busy or what but I didn't get a very friendly vibe.\n\nI ordered the cheese ravioli which came with a meatball. The dinner came with either a soup or a salad. I ordered the salad. Although, the salad was just boring iceberg lettuce and tomatoes it did taste fresh. The ravioli wasn't bad and they baked it so it was kind of like a casserole, which I like, and the meatball was quite tasty. \n\nUnfortunately, I might not visit again because of the strange tasting iced tea and the rude chef.
