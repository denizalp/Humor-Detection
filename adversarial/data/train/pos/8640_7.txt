After preordering product from these people, they took my money and sat on it for months after the release date and refused to send me my order, citing problems with their distributor. To make matters worse, they also refused to do anything proactive to make up for this, trying to keep my order open as long as possible.\n\nAvoid, avoid, avoid. There are better comic & game retailers out there.
