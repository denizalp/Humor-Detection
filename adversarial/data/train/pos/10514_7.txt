Dear Electronics employee, I am so sorry to have troubled you to unlock a Nintendo DS game and a Wii game yesterday afternoon. I realized when I pressed the button for an associate and you took 2 minutes to come over that I was disturbing you. I also apologize that in your haste to ring up my purchases I failed to mention to ring them up separately since my daughter had a gift card for her Wii game and I was buying the ds game as a gift. I do, however appreciate the rolling of your eyes and the confounded sigh you let out when I apprised you of this. I have never felt more unwelcome and under appreciated while spending $85. I hope that your future endeavors reward you more prosperously then your job at Target that you clearly despise.
