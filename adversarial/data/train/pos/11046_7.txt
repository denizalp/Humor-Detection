These guys play the bitter old i hate women card. Sitting that office you watch the Secretary get verbally abused and yelled at just about everytime i have been there. The guy heading that place up is angery at women. The family courts can care less about their angry stance at women. The lawyer they refered me to was cheap and it showed in court. I needed them to file a new motion to be seen in court to drop my case. I was put in a situation where i couldnt afford to continue to fight because i was ordered to pay 1650 a month in child support. After hearing i want to drop my case they refused service to me even after i donated 300 dollars to them. I was then attacked by Earnest outside. These people are a joke. They are not about equal rights and have too angry of a perspective on women and really have to much anger and hate to bring to a court case to show that you as a father can peacefully resolve issues through mediation. Again they are just a glorified paralegal service who hate women. In family court anger will not get you jack and thats what these people bring to the table is anger and hatred towards women. All you have to do is watch how the Secretary there is belittled and yelled at all day.
