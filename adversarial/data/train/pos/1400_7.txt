Brow is as brow does! If your bushes start to look gnarly and need some weed whacking, Divine Threading is a great idea if you are in the Centennial area. \n\nI came in and there wasn't a long wait at all! There was one worker, but she was quick = maybe 10-12 minutes a person. She really takes her time to make you look beautiful! \n\nIt costs $12 for eyebrows right now, but they do offer a prepaid service for a certain amount of visits--it changes price a lot, so it's better to ask. \n\nRemember, there's nothing more pleasing for my eyes..( and everyone else's) than for all of LV to look gorgeous! \n\nSo within minutes, your brows can be thinned and trimmed and ready to go!!! All I can say is that my fantasmic brows are ready to impress people tomorrow ;)
