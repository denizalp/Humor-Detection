Me and my brother ordered seven dishes and we  asked to be seated at a bigger table but the waitress told us that she cant do it, instead she let us sit at a 1 person table with 2 seats and she didn't even try to help us get a bigger table , it is not comfortable to sit at such small table and order so many dishes. Although i told her that we want all the dishes at once she  ignored the request and brought us each dish by its time, which is absurd since we want to share dishes. We got 1 dish and we canceled the whole other dishes.\n\nVery disappointing experience.
