Cute bakery, but nothing more than that.\n\nI was extremely excited to try Paris Baguette. I unfortunately left disappointed. The staff was really nice and the design of the bakery is really cute, but when it came down to the food, they need to learn a thing or two.\n\nTheir bakery items are displayed in glass shelves and are self-serve. These items were all dry and hard! It may have to do with them leaving the baked goods in the shelves, but baked goods shouldn't dry out so quickly. The sweet desserts in the fridge all looked super good, but I decided to pass on trying them because they are all too expensive.\n\nThey have a variety of coffee, but their machines were not working so I'll have to go back to try their coffee.\n\nGreat location in the Chinatown Plaza with plenty of parking!
