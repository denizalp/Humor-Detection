We use reviews a ton to travel.  I feel the need to write a couple things here.  We travel to Vegas 2-3 times a year.  \nThe Golden Nugget has good restaurants.  We ate at each one during our stay.  The pool was fun, we rented a cabana.\nChecked into the Rush Tower special desk.  It was fast, but SO unfriendly.  The guy checking us in didn't smile, ask us a question, nothing.  \nOur Jr corner suite room was HUGE.  the bathroom was incredibly big.  A nice treat.  The only thing we did not like was the little window .  It was the only form of natural light in the room.  It was over the pool and fun to people watch.\nWe like to gamble.  The casino floor is VERY packed in.  Actually, it is so crammed with machines that I found it hard to maneuver around.  There were several times I had to ask someone to squeeze by just to wiggle in between the walk space.  It was ridiculous.\nThe dealers were fine.  Not one dealer was friendly.  A smile and friendly conversation was rare.\nUBER.  Yes, you can get an Uber car in front of the Starbucks door.  It was so handy to go to other casinos and others restaurants.  \nFremont Street is crazy.  It was fun to pop in and out just to normalize yourself.  There are some serious coo-coo's out there.  \nI love to dress up in Vegas.  You just don't get dressed up in this part of Vegas.  I still dressed nicely each night.  But I was always standing next to the lady with the visor and fanny pack on.  \nWe were glad to experience downtown, so we can say we've done it.  But really, we will not be doing it again.  \nIf you are getting a Landry card, get it a month before you leave so it has time to come in the mail.  You do get some discounts in the Casino.
