Looking for a \"light\" meal? Radish is definitely the way to go.\n\nI went with their popular South by Southwest salad which goes a long way, but definitely not the best salad I've ever had. It has avocado, pico de gallo, queso fresco, corn, grilled chicken, black beans, jalapenos and tortilla strips on a bed of their green mix with honey-lime dressing on the side. Small size is a decently sized portion. The salad to me was just okay, it was pretty clean but found the dressing did not suit the ingredients. I was not a fan of it or the tortilla strips, it made the Southwest theme a bit too commercial and gimmicky. It was filling however and I did eat the whole thing.\n\nThe only con about Radish is the price point. I understand buying pressed juices for $11 and frozen yogurt for $5 a cup but nearly $10 for a salad is a bit much. Plus, it wasn't amazing just okay. I believe that because of the price point made me want to finish the salad in the end. Would recommend other salad places like Mad Greens for a more well put together salad or at least a salad bar to get more bang for your buck. Would be interested in trying their juices, however.
