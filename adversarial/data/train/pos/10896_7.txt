My taste buds were very surprised by the balanced flavors of the Ramen! I expected it to be very salty because it was the saltiest ramen but it was just PERFECT. The spicy miso ramen is a little too sweet for my taste but most people would probably like it. It has a lot of flavor and definitely not salty like a lot of other ramen places. Although it's not as salty as other places, it packs more flavor. The pork gyoza was cooked to perfection. The ramen #1 black was very rich, but it balanced out the saltiness. There was black garlic oil that made the ramen soup rich but it wasn't overpowering it at all. It complimented the thin noodles. Definitely the ramen I will remember the most. The takoyaki was pretty average because everything else was phenomenal. The Chashu bowl was average because there was only a little amount of Chashu and it was cut into pieces. It would have tasted better is it was whole in my opinion.
