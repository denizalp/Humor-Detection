After having dinner here I can't say I'm hooked. My wife loved her pasty but I didn't feel the same way about mine. I had the Italian Pasty and there was a good amount of meats like salami, capocollo, pepperoni, ham. It also had mozzarella cheese and came with a side of marinara sauce. The inside of my pasty was really good. I didn't like the \"hot pocket\" type dough so much though. Before my pasty came I grubbed on some Oven Chips with jalapeno. The oven chips were very greasy and somewhat burnt at the same time and I didn't like that the jalapeno easily fell off since there was no cheese or gravy to hold it all together. We were eating with yelper Loon E and his woman and they felt the same way about the oven chips and found their dishes to be too salty. \n\nOur waitress was nice and took good care of us. I can't say I'd hurry back next week but since my wife liked her pasty and you can order them for pick up to take home and cook yourself, I might give a different pasty a try.
