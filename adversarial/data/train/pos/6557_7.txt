Beef brisket for $7.99 and an overall rating of 5 stars on Yelp. I went the very next day after finding this place. Its a different take on beef brisket for me. I'm use to have the smoked beef brisket at BBQ joints. Not sure what cooking style they used here but the beef was soft and tender and was swimming in a soup of amazing sauce. \n\nDon't even think about getting this sandwich to go. Its just so juicy that every second counts. By the time I took my first bite at the bar stools in the front of the store the bread was already getting soggy. The outer part of the bread still had a nice crunch though. Amazing beef brisket and I was tempted to go for another sandwich seeing as how good the first one was. I talked myself out of getting a second sandwich because I need to start watching my weight, plus there was a bakery right down the road so I had to save space for some sweets.\n\nService was excellent and friendly.
