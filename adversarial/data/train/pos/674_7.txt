3.5 Stars.\n\nSo...I had not been to a Smashburger in years.  The last few times I did go to one, I left disappointed.  There are better burgers to be found, a lot of the time, for a lesser price, too!  I saw a commercial pop up though that was advertising their new \"Pub Triple Double\" burger and it looked\/sounded right up my alley.  I headed down here yesterday to try it out.\n\nReal quick, before I get into my review, one small gripe.....I downloaded their app and your \"welcome offer\" was a deal that had \"buy a side and a drink, get a free entree\".  I go to use the coupon and wanted the Pub Triple Double as my entree, but they told me I could not use it due to the burger already being at a discounted rate.  First of all, that doesn't make any sense.  The Pub Triple Double is only $4.00 on its own.  Their other burgers are $6.00 or more.  As a business, wouldn't you want to lose less money ($4.00 compared to over $6.00) and allow your customers to choose the lowest priced entree?  I didn't push the issue, and will save that coupon for a different time.  Anyways................  I went with a Pub Triple Double, a large fries and a glass of water.  My total was just over $7.00.  Here is how they were....................\n\nPub Triple Double-  First of all, this is what brought me in.  Two patties, 3 slices of American cheese, garlic grilled onions, Guldens mustard on a pretzel bun.  That's how I normally order my burgers (meat, cheese, onions and sometimes mustard), so I was really excited to try this one out.  The person came out and dropped off my tray of burger\/fries and the first thing I noticed, was that it was a bit skimp.  Think of Wendy's Double Stack, but on a pretzel bun.  Not a 2 bite burger\/slider, or anything like that, but I could have easily ate 2 of these things.  The flavors were fantastic though!  It was perfect with the 3 slices of cheese on it.  One of the slices didn't really melt all that well, but it was still tasty.  The onions were nice and soft, the mustard complimented the pretzel bun really well, and the beef was freshly cooked and nice and juicy. Guessing maybe 1\/4 lb of meat on it?  Would have been better with 1\/3lb. Pretty messy to eat, but worth it.  Just wish it was a bit larger.  For $4.00, it's a good deal.  If it was $6-7.00, I would pass.\n\nFries-  These were great!  Some of the better fries I have had from a fast food joint.  Incredibly hot, crispy and tasty.  Damn fine fries!  \n\nOverall, I am glad I stopped in to try this particular burger.  Delicious, but small.  Their fries were great though, and their app\/rewards program sounds like it should have some decent deals going forward.  Not racing to come back, but I'm sure I will sometime in the near future.
