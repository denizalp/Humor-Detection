Not the worst buffet, but -definitely- not the best. It's gotten more expensive as time passes, and for no reason. Because this buffet does not have the kind of quality anymore to be hiking prices up like that!\n\nAmbiance: 3 - This buffet is always very clean at its stations and very organized. At the tables, not so much. Tables are rather scattered, disorganized and a bit dirty when you sit down. \n\nService: 4 - Our server was very good and extremely funny. He really always took care of us, constantly refilling our drinks and even getting us extra plates when one of us ate some crabs or crawfish! \n\nFood: 2 - The only things really worth eating at this buffet was crab and dessert. But this time, even the crab legs were just sub-par, only having a little bit of meat inside. The rest of the food was just average--there's really nothing that I can say because, well, nothing really stood out!\n\nCarnival used to be a better, cheaper buffet with bigger crab legs and with slightly better food! But now, going to Village Seafood Buffet is just a way, way better idea than spending that money at Carnival.
