This grand and historic church, located in \"Old Montreal\", is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. It is built in an ornate Gothic Revival style with a wondrous deep blue ceiling and golden stars. The sanctuary is toned in deep reds, blues, golds and silver.  While we were there, we watched the floor being raised for a special tour.  I imagined Monks in the basement making wine.\n\nDo not miss the small sanctuary behind the pulpit.  It is charming and ornate and features an amazing bronze relief wall sculpture.
