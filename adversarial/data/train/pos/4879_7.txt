I had wanted to attend the opening performance here with Penn and Emily Gillette but was unable to because of prior tickets for other shows.\n\nI did come here last week to an Alice Ripley concert.  Ripley is a talented Broadway actress\/singer who has won a Tony award among other honors.\n\nThe Space is in a converted warehouse with a setup pretty much like black box theatres although this venue is a bit longer in length than a traditional acting black box.  For this show, the room was set up with round cocktail tables with four chairs at each table.  There was ample room in the aisles.  The last two rows in the back main area were two rows of plain chairs.\n\nThere's a box office to the left when you come in, a bar to the right, and also on the left is a bathroom door that goes into a gender neutral area where there are four or five stalls with solid walls for privacy.  A smart move on their part.\n\nThe acoustics in the Space were very good and Miss Ripley could blow the roof off the place if she wanted too.  \n\nI am very pleased to see one more piece of the Las Vegas locals' theatre puzzle coming together with The Space.  It is a great addition to our performing arts.
