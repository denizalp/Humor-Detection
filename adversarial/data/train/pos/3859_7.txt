Coming from Toronto and also being a huge Rodney's fan, I had to give them a go! The location is prime and you can't miss it at the corner.  As we entered the restaurant, was greeted right away from their friendly hostesses.  I had made reservations online and we were seated immediately. The decor was mostly clean white with wood furnishings.  It was really pretty inside and quite comfortable of an atmosphere. \nOur server was great and she took our drinm orders promptly. Their housemade lemonade was tasty!  They also have a nice wine list to pair their menu with.\nWe ordered a few dishes to try: new England clam chowder,  lobster roll (had to order 2!), tuna poke, bison tartar, pan fried oysters and fresh oysters!  We let our server pick out our selection. Everything was good but I will admit my favorites were definitely the chowder and the lobster roll!  \nI was a little disappointed that their lunch and take out menus offered different selections and next time I will need to ask why.  Especially since the take out menu us only offered a other times. Odd!\nAlso a little note to those bringing children, the washrooms have some very provocative art work selections.  I suggest using the wheelchair washrooms when taking your children. Don't say I didn't warn you!\nOverall a fun experience! We will be back!
