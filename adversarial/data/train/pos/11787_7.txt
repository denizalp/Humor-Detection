Dropped my car off here after someone ran a stop sign and hit my car. Normally I would save my review for after my car is fixed, but I've been blown away by how amazing the customer experience has been so far. The receptionist was very professional and kind. I dealt with Brandon, and he has been nothing short of outstanding. He has always been punctual with phone calls, keeping me updated. They had no issue showing me the car before it was done and showing the steps of repair. I had to leave for a business trip during the repair, they took care of my rental car and even gave me a lift home (I live near Square One). From what I've seen so far, their work is very good, paint matching very well done. I'm anxious t see the final product and will update when I do. But so far, the experience has been extraordinary!\n\nUPDATE: I have now received my car, repair completed. It looks brand new! As stated before, the paint match was spot on, and the car looks pristine. I hope that I will not need to use a body shop again in the future, but if I do, I'm definitely coming back here. I'm not even consider going anywhere else. As far as body shops go, the customer service, professionalism and workmanship here are unbeatable.
