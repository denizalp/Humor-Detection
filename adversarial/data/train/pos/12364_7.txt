CRCE,\n\nYou were such a huge part of my college life, and only now I realize how much I took you for granted. Is it wrong of me to say how much I miss you, considering that when I had you, I just used you?\n\nI was there when WIMPE closed, and you opened up, shiny, and brand new. You were the most modern thing I'd ever seen on campus. Large...airy...imposing.\n\nI planned events for my RSOs here. We needed sporty fun, and you delivered, with your large multipurpose gyms.\n\nI wanted a structured way to lose weight, and you gave me not just an entire floor of fitness equipment, and fitness classes, you let me into your incredibly fun pool, and let me swish down your slides in joy. Oh happy days....\n\nAnd as if that wasn't enough love from any one gym, one of your racquetball courts converted into a squash court. I spent many sweaty early am hours here, challenging my opponents with my ability to hit a small rubber ball. A rubber ball that has left many marks on you, my love, and yet, you, always patient, endlessly forgiving, never complained. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, when I'd worked up myself into exhaustion and warm glows, you welcomed me graciously into your spacious changing rooms and the miles of lockers and showers within. I'd groom myself into presentableness, and leave, without a second look at you.\n\nIf only I knew then what I know now, dear Circe. That the city had nothing like you. That the city's clubs were old and worn, and nowhere as beautiful as you. Perhaps then, my darling, I would've been more appreciative of you. Maybe I would've realized how much I loved you. \n\nAlas, now, it is too late. I move to New York soon, and our little post graduate meetings must come to an end. It is time for us both to move on...and I see, darling, perhaps with even a little jealousy, that you already have.\n\nThis, then, is goodbye, beloved Circe, until we meet again.\n\nAll my love.
