For a table of three, they gave us one menu. \nWay to be efficient?\n\nI ordered a tomato beef brisket noodle. They served me a curry beef noodle. \n\nI told them this is not what I ordered. \n\nThey then ask me if I've eaten here before. If I have, then I'd know this is how it looks like at pho 88. \n\nI told them I have eaten here before and ordered the exact same thing but it didn't look like this. \n\nThe server walked away. I was hungry, I ate it anyways. \n\n\" Excuse me, this is not what I ordered. \" I hear from the next table. \n\nThey clearly switched our orders and the server responded the same way. \"  if you've eaten here before. If you have, then you'd know this is how it looks like at pho 88. \n\nI gave less than tips than usual and they chased me down to give a tip.
