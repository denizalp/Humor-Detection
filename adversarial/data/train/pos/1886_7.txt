Awesome experience!  It's not just a bar it's a destination.  You walk through the door and are immediatly overcome by the old stale smoke smell.  I almost turned around and walked out but the ambiance is just so great! You get over the heinous smell of dingy old cigarette smoke quickly.  It's Vegas after all so get over your bad self!!!  \n\nWe were greeted by the friendly female bartender with the unforgettable voice.  She offered us the drink menu that I would normally say no to.  The wife had to have a look and well I am glad she did.  I had the \"Fink Bomb\" and it was quite tasty.  I ended up having a few more they were just that good.  \n\nThere is a great selection on the drink menu.  From blended drinks to fruit juice and booze drinks.  There is even an option to have your drink served to you in a tiki glass.  \n\nThe bar is very dark with a great tropical vibe and weird fitting music and random videos playing on the big screen TV.  The don't offer food unless you count the fruit served in your killer cocktail.  Careful when using the bathroom as there is no real distinction for men vs. women.\n\nWe will be back to this bar next time we are in the area.  Service was great and the bar is truly entertaining and fun.  Will probably be back next time we have family in town.
