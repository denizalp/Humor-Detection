I came here during their 50% Off promotion. Whatever we ordered, was 50% of the original price.\n\nService = excellent; the servers were all charming and the folks who did the hosting were great\nPrice = regardless of the promotion, I felt that the meals were quite reasonable\nFood = this is where the OSF lost points in my book; food is mediocre and the portions are too big to the point that you no longer enjoy what is in front of you\n\nCome here if you're short on cash or if you're with company who have not eaten anything in days.
