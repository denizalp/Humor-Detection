Houston we have a problem..! We've been invaded by burger bars! Grindhouse is another inductee into the seemingly never-ending aggregation of \"burger bars\". \n\nI'm pretty sure the reason Grindhouse is called a bar to begin with is because there are sooo many bars at this restaurant. You're greeted with an unmanned massive take-out bar right when you open the door. Then, there is an even bigger bar with alcohol, LCDs and the lonely diner. The space itself is creatively done but very much on the cold side and I don't mean the thermostat. \n\nThe burgers are surprisingly small for their price: $7 for a normal beef burger $2 each for toppings. And no fries?. Wait, did you just charge me $11 for a burger with NO fries? Organic inhouse buns or not, that is Madness. The Indian sweet potato soup is really good and exactly what I needed on a cold night. \n\nService is good and friendly. Have the sugar cane coke it's a real treat
