Last week we stopped on a Thursday and got free breakfast entrees. In addition, we ordered a side of fruit. I decided to save the fruit, and held onto it until Friday. I was quite surprised to see mold on the strawberries. Yuck! Fortunately for me, I held onto my receipt and politely took the bad fruit to the establishment where I'd purchased it. Please note, that this is NOT the reason for this poor review. We stopped for breakfast again and sat in the drive-thru line for every bit of 8 mins; though it seemed liked 20. \n\nWhy hold up the line for someone's missing waffle fries\/tater tots? Why can't they pull to the side and have their meals brought out when ready? Sort of like their nameless neighbor on the East side of the building (eh'em!). There no apologies, no explanation or anything. I find it completely unacceptable to have customers waiting that long; but in the early am commute? Seriously? Who does that? Then, to top it off, we get 15 miles away to find that the key piece to those biscuit chicken bites is no where to be found. No honey! Even after it was confirmed that there was some in the bag. Argh!\n\nThe ONLY thing that Chick fil a can get me right now is a strawberry milkshake.
