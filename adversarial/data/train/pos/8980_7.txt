I HAVE TO GIVE THIS PLACE 5 STARS. They have always been so good to their customers since the year they've opened. Their boba comes in many different sizes so you have variety, they also have a LARGE size for if you want your drink extra big lol but their boba is just always fresh and their drinks are always stellar  and to also add THEIR FISH BALLS ARE SO FREAKING DELICIOUS! They actually make their fish balls really spicy (how I like it) and they never disappoint. In fact today I may even go just to get some fish balls and maybe a Thai tea boba (btw their Thai tea is FUEGO ) they also do frappes now I think like caramel fraps. This place does have wifi and little game machines if you get bored. The inside is very clean and spacious, interior is designed decent. The service is never that great but it's never really crappy so service is mediocre but other than that, their food and their drinks are worth a try id def recommend
