Seriously, someone (Pam C) gave Casa Rey's a 2 star review over $1... that's petty.  Stay home an play with your cats!\n\nCasa Reys food is amazing, using old family recipes.  I've had food from their mobile kitchen several times now and it's always been top quality and delicious.  I've also been to their old restaurant in Chandler and one of their families other restaurants Casa Reynoso several times.  Hands down, it's my absolute favorite Mexican food in town, and the salsa is addictive.  \n\nTry a little bit of everything, because it's all amazing.  My only complaint is that that I'd like to see a regular schedule on their website or Facebook page so that I can find them more easily and seek them out.
