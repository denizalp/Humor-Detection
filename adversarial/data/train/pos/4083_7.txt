I have been going to the Great American Foodie Fest for several years but have never left a review- very strange! This is a great event for food enthusiasts as it really is a Foodie Fest!\n\nEvery time this festival comes around it is different. The food trucks and booths come and go while others stay. It is exciting to see who has made it to the fest. There was a Bison truck that came out from Montana a couple years ago while several from California make it in too.\n\nI have found the best way to do the Foodie Festival is in a pack. Two people or more who eat the same way you do works well because you share the food! \n\nThere are some great local trucks that come like Strip Cheese and Dude, where's my hot dog. My favorite this year was Love Bird from SoCal and Venetian Gold, who are local. \n\nLike I said, every event is a little different that is why you should try to make them all! Yum times!
