Ok so from now on when there is one around I am going to go to Blimpie over Subway and Quiznos.  Why?  Because this place was awesome!  Advantages over the other two chains:  Marble Rye Bread is amazing.  Much larger variety of chips to choose from including my favorite Baked Cheetos!  Fresh sliced meats.\n\nThe owners at this particular location are great, very helpful and friendly.\n\nHighly recommended!
