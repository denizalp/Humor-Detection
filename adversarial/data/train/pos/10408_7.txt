A sneakerheads candy store! I was pleasantly surprised to see this store inside the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood. This store reminds me a lot like House of Hoops (all basketball gear) by Footlocker, but instead this is all Jordan stuff and by Footaction. If you're like me and love snatching up them J's to add to your collection that you'll probably never wear, then this is the place to be. Prices are pretty in line with what you'd expect from anything Jordan related: expensive!
