Stopped by this place during a Gorman Football game, which was going on down the street.  This place was packed to the hilt!  There was literally no room to walk around, let alone find a place to sit.  Luckily, I scored a seat in the rear corner of the bar.\n\nI ordered a drink and wanted to try their Double Stacked Sliders.  Wish I could remember what was in the Sliders, but I can't.....let's just say it was a long night.  I can tell you that out of the 3 Sliders, I really liked one of them and didn't care for the other two.  The Fries were OK, not great.\n\nDespite the large crowd, the bartenders were on top of their game and the service was really good.  The food was hot and fresh and my glass was never empty....for this, they get 4 Stars.  If it was purely on the food, it would get 3 Stars.\n\nWill I return?  Sure.
