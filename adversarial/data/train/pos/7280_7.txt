The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) is a government controlled quasi monopoly for liquor sales in the Ontario province of Canada. I say quasi monopoly since beer and wine are sold at \"The Beer Store\" and a few exceptions to distilleries, breweries and wineries. At the LCBO you can find your typical hard liquors from all over the world and premixed alcoholic beverages that I don't even see at specialty alcohol stores back in the states. \n\nI was so intrigued by the wide selection at the LCBO. I was definitely not trying to dehydrate myself on my trip, but I was just curious by the variety of flavors available. I decided to get: \n\n- Snapple Spiked Peach Tea Vodka ($2.80 CAD)\n- Rockstar Watermelon Freeze ($3.40 CAD) \n- Crazy Uncle Hard Root Beer for Grown Ups ($2.85 CAD) \n- Crazy Uncle Hard Cream Soda for Grown Ups ($2.85 CAD) \n- Black Fly Sour Raspberry ($2.85 CAD) \n\nThese cans have a 10cents recycling fee per can and a 13% already included tax. I like that the tax is already included in the prices so there are no surprises at check out. I can definitely see how a 13% tax affects more pricey liquors. No wonder why I was asked if I brought over any alcohol when I was checking in through customs. Nevertheless I respect it. Canada has REAL healthcare for everyone so at least the tax is going to the right places. \n\nI really enjoyed my pre spiked cans of alcohol. I especially liked the Snapple Spiked Tea Vodka and it is definitely something I would drink all of the time if they had it in the states. The sodas were a bit too sweet for me since I do not usually drink soda. I will keep that in mind the next time I find myself at an LCBO. \n\nI was especially pleased at check out when the sweet young man behind the counter asked to see my ID. The legal age to drink in Canada is 19!! I feel extra extra flattered that he asked me for my ID and I slightly giggled as I reached for my passport. I was complimented on how young I looked. Canadians are the sweetest!! \n\n~\n\nAnd I believe this to be universal... \n\nIf you drink, don't drive - Si vous buvez, ne prenez pas le volant ;)
