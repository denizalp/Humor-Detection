We've seen this place every time we've come to LV but usually, on our way back to the hotel AFTER we've had our meal. I really wanted to try it because I've seen the Chinese writing as we've whizzed by and it says they have things like jook, wonton noodle soup and much more.\n\nWe ordered wonton soup, bitter melon with beef, pei pah tofu (House special tofu) and some gai lan with oyster sauce.\n\nWon ton soup -- this was the most disappointing ever. The wrapper was mushy and soggy, most probably overcooked! the filling wasn't tasty either with bits of gristle which I had to spit out. Don't order this!\n\nBitter melon with beef -- really flavorful! the beef was tender with generous portions of bitter melon\n\nPei Pah tofu -- a lot of places don't do this dish because it's a lot of work. this dish consists of mashed tofu with bits of shrimp and sometimes with scallions although this one didn't. I didn't think the tofu was as flavorful as it could've been, but still very nice, served atop a bed of garlic spinach.\n\nGai lan with oyster sauce -- all prime gai lan bits, very tender and perfectly cooked!\n\nI liked everything except for the won tons. I would come back again for the regular dishes, not the won tons. The only complaint is that the food is on the greasy side. Otherwise, not bad at all.\n\nI'd say 3.5 stars
