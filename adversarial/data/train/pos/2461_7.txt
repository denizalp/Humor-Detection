I always enjoy the food at La Mere in Scarborough and I am excited they open another location in Richmond Hill.\n\nOf course, I highly recommend their Signature Pie. All made to order, serves pipping hot! But there are also other dishes worth trying and all the cooking just like something a mother would have prepare at home....\n\n牛肉餅($5.50) Beef Meat pie - Juicy and delicious!\n小米粥($1) Millet Rice Congee - A healthy option for carb\n麻辣凉面($5.50) Cold Noodle w\/Spicy Sauce - homemade noodle cooked al dente with great bite\n鸡汤鮮肉小锟钝 ($4.99) Wonton in Chicken Soup - the soup garnish with seaweed is just so good.. and love the bite size wonton\n秘制金錢牛健($8.99)  Beef Tendons w\/Soy Sauce - beef is tender and the dipping sauce is quite interesting: sour and garlicky\n京味蝦皮洋白菜 ($4.99) Dried Shrimp and Fried Cabbage - tons of baby shrimps that add unique flavour to this simple dish\n京味八宝油炒面 ($3.50) Traditional Peking Assorted Dried Fruits & Nuts Paste Dessert - meh, baby food texture... \n芝麻醬糖餅 ($4.99) Sesame Peanut Butter Pancake - so hot, so fresh, so crispy... yummmmy\n\nAlmost all dish are under $10! Chinese style tapas great for sharing!\n\nAnd there is really a \"La Mere\" (old mother) in the kitchen cooking for you too!\n\nService can be spotty at time...  but is that part of the package?
