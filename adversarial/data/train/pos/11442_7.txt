i've been to this club 2 times and the first time i really enjoyed it because it was really packed and they opened up the entire roof top and had great music. \n\nthe second time i went which was on a tuesday, (supposedly a really good night) wasn't too packed but i guess being too packed isn't all that fun anyway.\n\ni think there are 3 rooms, 2 on the bottom floor and 1 upstairs level which is on the rooftop and has a pretty cute view. the first time i went they were playing house upstairs but the mash up was kinda lame. i'm a really big fan of house and there were a lot of people dancing but i wasn't feeling the vibe of the music. it was like a mash up of latin\/salsa and house. \n\ndownstairs was really packed both times and they played the hottest hip hop songs which is always pretty nice but god damn it's so packed! i seriously can't possibly get through without feeling groped on (intentionally or not i dunno).\n\noverall, i am a fan of this place and i'd probably come back only on a busy night though
