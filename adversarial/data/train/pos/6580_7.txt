Yummy in my tummy when in Vegaaaaa!\n\nTheir seating booth area is shaped as half wine barrels - pretty neat!  Service was attentive and nice!\n\nFood for happy hours was happening!  I love their salmon sashimi carpaccio.  The vinegar sauce with the smooth textured salmon, was delicious.  Do order up.  Also, the sprinkled salt asparagus, was swell and crisp to my liking.  Eat it if you need some veggie in your dietary system. \n\nThey have a lot of variety on their menu to choose from.  I like the raw oysters.  It was refreshing for the hot weather Vegas - if you go during the summer heat.\n\nBathrooms were a change of theme.  Instead of a standard or Japanese styled themed restroom, it was French themed with classical music played in the background.  Interesting. \n\nI got my sashimi sushi game on here and enjoyed the restaurant entirely.
