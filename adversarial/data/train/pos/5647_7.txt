My wife's flight was canceled tonight - she was stuck at the airport. I called the club and asked if she could enter the club - I would fax them a copy of my card, pay the fee, etc., etc. They said not no, but hell no. Now she's sleeping in the terminal. Great going American Express. The sooner American Airlines builds a Admiral Club in Las Vegas the better. But I just got finished cutting my American Express card up and I'l just use my Master Card when traveling from now on...
