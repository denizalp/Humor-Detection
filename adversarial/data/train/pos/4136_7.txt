Bah Humbug! \n\nI have a bad case of sinus pressure (my eyes are even twitching, making reading on a day off not even possible), and after getting on a full 72 bus, then getting on the wrong Orbit bus (that is how confused I was w\/my headache), I decided I better get my prescription filled at the brand new pretty CVS, instead of my usual Walgreens on Broadway and Mill, since I might as well walk home after taking a 20 minute Orbit joy ride.\n\nI was surprised when the associate with inked in eyebrows, super chimney sotty eyelashes (mary poppins?) told me the wait would be like, 20-45 minutes. I should have probably just taken my prescription at that point back since that is a seriously long wait time. But I figured, well, I can kill some time at Borders and look at art for while. I gave them a half hour, and after getting pan handled by 'punks' dressed better than I am, I just wanted to go home.\n\nI get there and a young Ron Howard tells me another 20-40 minutes. W. T. F. I am trying not to be livid, I don't want to be an asshole, but are you for fucking real? After I gave it an extra 30 minutes to be sure? Sure, I've got time to dick around in a bright flurescent space, thanks! Oh, is that the new Oprah magazine? Perfect-would much rather stand here since there are no chairs around the Pharmacy for another half hour or so, than like lay down with my meds to treat my bitch of a headache, Ron!\n\nFinally, I ask for it, they have it. The pharmacist apologizes for the wait, saying she is the only one on duty. Then who the fuck are all the other fucknuts on your staff, lady? Are you telling me you are the only pharmicist among 8 other people milling behind the counters? When I go to Walgreens, there are like five people, like five PHARMICISTS, ready and willing to help me with my questions, seek out meds, with helpful advice and ready with 15 minutes.\n\nOh, and your generic was like 5 bucks more than Target, thanks.\n\nFuck this place.\n\nAnd Katie G. can bite me.
