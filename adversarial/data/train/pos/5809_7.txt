My fiance just picked up a king caesar wrap with a kiwi quencher around 11 pm. My wrap was rolled in a regular wrap that tasted like a flour tortilla, not a garlic herb tortilla. Also, the wrap was almost completely flat, it had very little substance other than the smear of caesar dressing. \n\nThe wrap was rolled in a small, white, thin sheet. Not even in their traditional logo sheet.\n\nI wouldn't have even eaten it if I wasn't starving. I only picked at it.\n\nOn top of that, the worker wouldn't accept my tropical smoothie rewards so I may get the credit for this purchase.
