We came for a \"Sommelier Showdown\" event. This was the third time we'd come for one, as previous experiences were very good. Tonight's was far off the mark. \n\nFirst, they shifted us over to the Kazimierz bar, as they apparently booked two events for the same night. Second, they changed the menu from what was published. The first two courses were made up last minute. Third, the food was cold. Fourth, service was slow. Fifth, the food was not good. Sixth, since this event was focused on wine, I thought it cheap that on the last course they served us the same cheap wine they had given us on the first course. \n\nLastly, they had the audacity to automatically add a 20% gratuity before handing me the bill. This after I had decided the gratuity would be minimal. American Express and I will have a little conversation about that one.\n\nSorry Cowboy Ciao, we're done giving you our business. There are far too many other great restaurants for me to bother coming back.
