Well I must say there was plenty of food to choose from...  fruits, salad, sushi, desserts, seafood, Chinese, and some American.  There was nothing really that made this buffet stand out from the rest.  It was mediocre at best for me.  Thankfully I didn't go at dinner time when it gets a bit pricey for a family of 4.  If you want to go, I would suggest going at lunch time when the price is more reasonable.
