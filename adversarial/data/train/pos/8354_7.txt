Great quaint Thai restaurant with as authentic as you can get in Phoenix! Excellent service with Thai humbleness.  The decor is classy and not over the top.  Get the chicken, basil veggie dish!  I enjoyed the Tom Yum with shrimp. The shrimp was huge and succulent with mushrooms. The broth was very flavorful with ginger, lemon grass and lime leaves with tomato. But it didn't have any other substance to it. No other vegetables. So although I liked it I would probably opt for the other Tom Yum's that have much more in it.  I hear the lunch specials is wonderful.  I will definitely return when in the area. :)
