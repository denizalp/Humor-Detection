I know what you're thinking: why am I giving this smaller, cluttered store a whopping 4 stars when all the stores in the blocks east on St. Catherine are way larger, airier, fancier and swankier. Why, indeed. In one word: the merchandise. I just love the wares this store sells! And it helps that the folks who work here are pretty cool and friendly, too!\n\nBackstory: I was born and bred in Montreal. Lived my first 22 years here and have returned very, very often in the decades since (I usually visit at least once a year, and I even moved back here for over 3 years quite a while ago to attend school). Montreal will always be my home. \n\nSo it was with great joy that I stumbled in this store to discover a TON on non-kitsch Montreal-related merchandise. I'm not referring to the typical fare found in all the souvenir shops on every corner, oh no. You won't find postcards and snow globes and key chains and cheap t-shirts here. Instead you'll find well-made colorful canvas pouches resembling Metro bus tickets. Cell phone cases depicting photos of depanneur facades and other Montreal landmarks. Small decorative throw pillows in bright orange with bold words \"RUE BARRE\" (resembling the street closure signs on every corner in the city). Montreal-based graphic magnets (bagels, smoked meat, poutine, etc). Bright colored shoelaces with Montreal streets printed on them. Bagel earrings or cufflinks. And more. All cute and well-made and oh so Montreal. \n\nYou'll also find major brand-name clothes and accessories and shoes here, like Vans and Converse. I almost got my kid a Vans lunch bag. It was very cool. \n\n(Note that there are five Neon locations, and this store has been around a gazillion years, in other locations. My family used to shop at Neon at least 30 years ago. It was located in a suburban mall in those days, as I recall. M dad still has some bright colored Neon polo shirts - and they STILL look good!).
