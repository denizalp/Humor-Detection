Awesome and delicious Thai food!  That is the short version...\n\nDecided to try this establishment after hearing and reading many good things about it. \n\nThe inside is on the small side, and there was a short wait for a table. Staff were very friendly, and the menu has a large selection of dishes. \n\nWe started with the Thai egg rolls. These were excellent, crispy, and delicious. Then we went for the Beef Pad See Ew and the Chicken Pad Thai. Wow!  Both were excellent.  The meats in both dishes were tender, and both dishes had their own unique and delicious sauces. The noodles in both dishes were perfectly prepared, and the portions were definitely ample. The only slight ding - they served sodas in cans instead of having a soda fountain with unlimited refills. It's always so silly when restaurants do this, but it's not worth taking away a star since the food was so excellent!!
