9\/23\/2016 (Drama) Another private message from the owner, Jon: \n\n\"Thank you for your update and showing your unprofessionalism to the other yelpers. Like you said, yelp is to review businesses and not use it for personal vengeance which you just did. I wasn't insulting you by saying Mc Donald would be a better place for you to go, and looking at your past preview I was absolutely right about that.\"\n\nI am posting this here because I believe in transparency and I believe Yelpers should understand who the owner is. My comments are here for all to see, while the owner privately messages me and insults me (I am blocking him after I post this). I am surprised at the owner's reaction considering his \"professional\" background. I don't think he handles criticism well, or maybe the stress from running his own business has made him too quick to react rather than to hear what is said. Regardless, I am done posting about this matter and I will not be sending any of my friends to Rosallie. I wish his business well and hope future Yelpers see him for who he really is. ( Maybe he is peeling too many onions ) \n\nc'est la vie
