This place has the best kimchi fried rice! the meats are a bit too salty for my taste.. I have been here twice i recommend it if you like Korean foods. They have the all you can eat menu. Servers are a bit snooty, but that do you expect from asian servers.. \" im allowed to say that im asian\" haha!
