Even though the prices and portions are decent, the food ranged from okay to needs improvement. Here's the lowdown ~\n\nTHE GOOD:\n+ ambiance\n+ presentation\n+ original bruschetta\n\nTHE DECENT:\n~ service\n~ prices\n~ portions\n~ mushroom bruschetta\n~ clams and mussels entree on brunch menu\n\nTHE BAD:\n- avocado bruschetta\n- steak and eggs \n\n\nWhile the clams and mussels were cooked fine, the fries lacked salt, and the sauce had a tad too much. As for the steak and eggs, the cook and flavor on the steak was fine but tough. The eggs came sunny side up even though my boyfriend ordered over medium, the potatoes were slightly undercooked, and the salad was hot from sitting under the heat lamp too long.\n\nOverall, I probably won't be back any time soon. For six pieces of bruschetta and two entrees, it totaled to around $50. For that price range, I think there are better options to meet my brunch needs.
