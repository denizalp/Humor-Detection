Quite expensive and very fru-fru, this place would have earned only three stars had not our waitress been so impressively good.  A consummate professional.  She was also Miss Champaign County at the county fair a few years ago. Very impressive, even for this guy who lives and eats in downtown Chicago.\n\nThe food came in very small portions, but it tasted good.  The $10 Pork Belly appetizer was smaller than a golf ball.\n\nThree people and the two cheapest bottles of wine gave us a tab of damn near $200 before tip.\n\nThe men's bathroom is literally carpeted with Astroturf, and there is a putter and golf balls next to the urinal in case you get bored.  Very weird, but pretty cool for Champaign, Illinois.\n\nAs pretentious as Bacaro sounded, I humbly admit I was surprised by the quality of the food (if not the quantity) and the professionalism of the waitress.\n\nI will be back.
