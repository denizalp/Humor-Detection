I love a good manicure and pedicure as much as the next girl, but I would not come here to get one. Serendipity lists that they have a spa manicure ($20) and spa pedicure ($40), but they are just basic versions of both.  There was no massaging or anything you would expect from a spa setting.  \n\nThe good thing about Serendipity is that you can get two salon chairs next to each other.  They also had a large selection of OPI colors.\n\nWhile my nails turned out much better than my companion's, my nails chipped eight hours after getting them done.  Within three days, my right hand looked like a two week old manicure.  My previous nail color was also under my nails because they did not clean out under the nails. My godmother's nails were not even filed, and as she opened the car her nail chipped.  Cuticles were not cleaned up very well for either of us.\n\nThe real kicker is that they did not have anywhere to let your nails dry so they push you out the door with wet nails!  Eek!!!\n\nThis is a fine place if you just want your nails painted and not much else.
