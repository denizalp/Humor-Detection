I was a regular customer at this location for the last year or so, but have recently been turned off by certain events.  I've been here several times, and I pretty much always go with the same people.  Splitting our checks has never really been an issue, except the last two times that we've been.  We usually just ask for an even split between two or three cards- not a huge deal.  However, my friend has been charged TWO times for one order, meaning, they haven't charged one of the cards given.  The first time this happen, they took care of it quickly, however, the second time, they gave her the run-around and wanted her to ask the person whose card had not been swiped to come back in with it.  What if she was dining with someone she didn't know?  How is this her fault?  \n\nNeedless to say, I would only visit again with cash in hand.
