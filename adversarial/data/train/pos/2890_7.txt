One of the most classic properties to grace the mid Strip, the Flamingo has endured the test of time through the multiple demands and changes of Vegas culture. It remains an iconic front to Sin City, an all encompassing resort with the cheese of a gimmick theme without the sleaze of downtown. \n\nUntil the hideous Imperial Palace (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/imperial-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas) came into the Harrah's \/ Caesars family, it was the lower end of the property totem pole and often the butt of many jokes in today's contemporary resort renaissance. The corny decor, the antiquated amenities, and the lack of anything substantial in the resort sense has made it a lower end property. And that's precisely why I like it.\n\nGiven its location, the Flamingo is very budget friendly in every sense of the word. The occupancy rate is likely to be high, considering its awesome low prices during the week and doable rates on the weekend. The regular rooms are comfortable and semi-spacious, not nearly as junky as early perception would lead on otherwise. There is good value in their higher end suites and in an attempt to modernize their hotel game, the GO rooms and FAB rooms will definitely surprise people with how contemporary and sophisticated they are.\n\nBarring no plans for renovation, the casino is predictably small. There are a good number of table games with a heavy emphasis on black jack (Spanish 21 is also available), various poker games, and craps + roulette. Slots, whose inventory makes up the bulk of most casinos is lacking in inventory compared to their property counterparts, but rest assured most games will be available, though perhaps *unavailable* when there are too many grannies plopping down to build on their player comps if you catch my drift. WIth regards to comps, TotalReward points are easier to apply here but accumulation will be the same anywhere.\n\nAll forms of dining are going to be close to lackluster or borderline horrendous. If there is any dignity left in your palate, you'll do your best to skip any outlet of food here unless you're in a dire situation. Snobby eaters, wannabe foodies, or anyone with tastebuds aren't soon to be caught  dead eating at Hamada of Japan (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/hamada-of-japan-las-vegas-2) or Paradise Garden Buffet (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/paradise-garden-buffet-las-vegas), or any of the Margaritaville, LA Subs, Johnny Rocket spots within their sad food court. Is there a worse Mexican restaurant than Carlos n' Charlies (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/carlos-n-charlies-las-vegas-2) on the entire strip? When Taco Bell owns you, that's when you know there is a problem.\n\nThe best thing at the Flamingo for me, is the pool. Some might call it one of the better pools on the strip and locals tend to come here more often than not. There is no elaborate nightlife centered around the pool, just good people watching, sufficient space to swim or float in, and quality pool side service for all things outdoor.\n\nAnd of course, for a (cheesy) photo op or children's activity, visit the Flamingos when weather appropriate. After all, like any great college or pro team, a brand is nothing without a proper mascot.
