Really yummy boba house in Phoenix. Strawberry lychee slush with lychee jelly!!! Oh yes!!! Delicious!!! Love lychee? This drink is for you. I was a bit worried it would be too sweet but it really wasn't. \n\nThey have the split cups too but they only the milk teas and teas to be put in them so it limits your options if you choose the split cup. \n\nSuper cute glass milk containers too! Of course we had to get it.
