There are too many sales people here.  You can't look at anything in peace. It is extremely uncomfortable to shop here.\n\nIf I need help, I will ask otherwise leave me alone, let me look and make a decision on my own.  I am not coming back, anywhere else is better.\n\nIf there was less than one star I would have given to this place, maybe minus one star.\n\nGood luck.
