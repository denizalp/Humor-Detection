We stopped in last night for cocktails for the first time.  We were immediately amazed at how cool and welcoming the interior actually was.  The owners did an incredible job at decorating the bar.  The colors are rich, actual candles burning, book shelves and books, intimate seating areas, etc.  The staff were very attentive to detail provided excellent service.  We decided to order a cheese and meat plate.  The quality was just as good as what we've come to expect from a establishment in Ohio City....but this is Old Brooklyn!  The skills of the bar staff were top notch, resulting in superior quality cocktails.  I know this establishment is referred to as a \"bar and grill\", but once you experience the visual ambiance together with the Jazz music playing in the background, you will see it is definitely more like a classy cocktail lounge.  This place is one of those amazing \"undiscovered\" secret spots.  I'm sure once more people experience how great it is, the crowds will begin to form.  There is plenty of parking behind the building.  There is a back door to enter through, if you parked behind the building.  You've got to experience this gem for yourself, you won't be disappointed.
