Daughter and I went here the other night for diner.\nWe both had the special which was filet mignon and a baked potato and french onion soup.\nThe filet was delicious and the french onion soup was among the best I have ever had.\nThe service was super fast and waitress was really friendly.\nThe price for two of us with drinks and tip was like $42 a bargain for such a delicious meal.\nIf I am ever in that area again I would definitely go there again.
