Short Story-\n\n                     ***************Breathtaking View*****************\n                     Farm to Table Great ingredients but Technically mostly Flawed.\n\nLong Story- \n\n                   The menu on-line looks amazing but when you take the hike to drive here the menu is very abbreviated with few choices. We started off with two appetizers. One was a deviled local duck egg. The egg came from a very small duck because it looked hen sized. The filling was runny and lumpy and not flavored so great. The egg sat on top of chopped up egg whites that were very similar to rubber. Not a good start my stomach was turning after ingesting a very rubbery egg white.\n\nThe Seared Shishito Peppers were good but the Blueberry Sugar didn't make an obvious appearance in this dish. I don't know if I got any Blueberry Sugar.\n\nI had the Melon Salad that was Almost Very Good but it was missing the radish flowers promised. My salad also contained Guanciale that was cold and greasy straight out of the refrigerator. This was suppose to be a meal and if you take the time to look at the picture you will see that this was not enough to be a meal. I feel that this plate should be on the appetizer menu. My server tried to be a comedian and said to me, \"WOW you ate all that!\" I felt like smacking him.\n\nMy husband had the Smokie. Everything on his plate was house made. He said the meat was packed very tight and was ground very fine. I think what he least liked about the sandwich was that you can't pick it up to eat because the roll was too tiny for the sandwich and you have to eat it with a knife and fork. \n\nI was still hungry and was hoping dessert would be the saving grace but instead it was the nail in the coffin. Our server said one of two of the most favored desserts was the Strawberry - Lemon Icebox Cake. On my first bite I got something IN MY MOUTH THAT RESEMBLED A LUMP OF SILICON GLUE. I pulled it out and showed the waiter. He ran it back to the kitchen and they said it was gelatin. I don't know what it was but it seemed just like a lump of silicon glue. Here goes my stomach turning again. Even if the cake didn't contain that foreign object I thought it was not a restaurant quality dessert. It was like something from a box mix. It was like something a neighbor or an aunt would whip up and not something I was looking forward too.\n\nSmall Duck Egg with runny lumpy filling over rubbery egg whites\nMissing ingredients - radish flowers and possibly missing Blueberry Sugar\nSalad should be salad sized or be listed as an appetizer \nCold Greasy out of the refrigerator meat\nSmokie was not well thought out and should be functional as a sandwich\nSilicon-like object imbedded in dessert\n\nYup I've had better......\n\nIf you eat with your eyes all is ok\n\nGood Luck
