One of the few airports that is so easy to navigate through without feeling like you're in a maze and it's a cluster mess of random restaurants, terminals and people. This place is pretty organized for a mid-sized airport. With experiences in LAX, this place is a beauty! \n\nThis is also my birth state and birth town so for me, it's kind of nice to see my hometown with an organized, clean and inviting airport for people to come visit.
