Cute and trendy.  \n\nSome are pretty good knock offs, until you feel the material.  I usually spend a little more for nice classic pieces that I can mix and match that would last me years.  But, trendy clothes only last a season, anyway.  So who cares if this falls apart after several washings.  Although, I'm surprised some have lasted me awhile.  The clothes range from $8 and up!   We found this place while shopping with my nieces who grow taller every month and in need of new wardrobe!  This has become their fave, too!  I just have to make sure I don't get anything they buy...holy! I don't want to look like those women who tries so hard to look 10 years younger!  On second thought...\n\nWhen you mix match designer with this stuff, no one will ever know...unless you tell them.
