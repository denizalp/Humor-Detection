Damn you Scottsdale for taking all the best restaurants away from the rest of the valley!! This is yet another one of Scotty's finest: the freshest ingredients with the awesomest service.\n\nAfter reading some funtastic reviews from my main man Yelp, swung by here a little after the lunch rush on fine Tuesday afternoon. Had the smoked turkey on ciabatta, rosemary steak ciabatta, with the yummus\/tzaziki\/olives appetizer. WARNING do not get an appetizer unless you are hungry as a hippo!! The sandwiches and wraps come with these deelicious sweet potato chipperoos, both of which will fill you up like a cactus on a rainy day. \n\nThe tab came up to ~$35, an eency bit steep for me for lunch as I probably could have had the same quality of food\/service at the Jungle (of Pita, that is), but nonetheless just as excellent and well worth another visit the next time I stop by Scott's and Dale's hood!
