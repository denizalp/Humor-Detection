Huzzah! Eide's had Amazing Spider-Man #700! And they were stocked in depth! Man, were they busy too! What an event!\n\nUnless you've been in Tibet over the past week, you know that Spider-Man \"dies\" in the issue I just mentioned. \n\nAnd if you think it's permanent, you don't know superhero comics well enough. \n\nAlso snagged metal-wise was Grand Magus' first CD! I thought it was out of print!\n\nEide's is still king.\n\nP.S. I neglected to mention that Eide's now keeps their back issue comics in drawers as well as in longboxes at eye level, making their shop even more coordinated than it has ever been. \n\nP.P.S. Check out my photos to view the rest of my haul.
