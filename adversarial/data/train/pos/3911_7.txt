First let me tell you I do not work for Black & Bleu and I don't even live in Scottsdale.  My wife and I went to the Black & Bleu on a whim.  We are from Gig Harbor WA and looked for a steakhouse and saw this place when we were cruising by.  My wife is not a big steak\/beef person -- she is a take it or leave it sort of person; this comes into play here in a second.  So to appease me she agreed to stop in, assuming she would be ordering some seafood or chicken.  Again to appease me she agreed to order the Filet Bites for our appetizer -- I love this woman.  The bites were amazing.  So amazing my WIFE ordered a SECOND helping (that in itself about blew me away).  Onward, I had the rib-eye steak.  I know it's tough to screw up rib-eye but what I have found in my many years (65) chefs can't seem to get the steak right.  I like a medium-rare steak.  Most chefs make it bleeding rare -- nasty!  I like it red, not bleeding so when you put the fork in it the cow screams -- no no no!.  But the steak at Black & Bleu was PERFECT!!!  Man was that good.  Every bite melted in my mouth.  Plus the blue cheese butter on top is something I want to put on my steaks from now on, as well because it was the perfect condiment.  The chef, Jimmy, is amazing an cooks up a great meal -- this place is not to be missed by locals and alike.\n\nOur waiter, Josh was great.  Did a wonderful job of making sure we had all we needed and made great recommendations.  His timing with us was perfect -- never hovering just there at the right times to make sure all was well.  \n\nThe manager, Scott, came by and we let him know how pleased we were and we will ALWAYS make it a stop for us when we are in town.\n\nAll in all it was a perfect dining experience.
