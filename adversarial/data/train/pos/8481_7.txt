WORST SERVICE EVER! okay, to be fair, the food was good, the ambiance: so-so - nothing special... actually, I would have been totally fine with the place: I heard good things from my brother, and there seemed to be a lot of positive posters on the wall. \nUpon eating my delicious food I thought perhaps the waitress maybe was under a bit of stress? so I would give her the opportunity to make it up.\n\nthat never happened.\n\n\nshe  was a complete wretch!  \n\nWe walked in at 1:24pm, the joint closes at 2pm - BUT, we were timely with our order and didn't take our precious time eating (we left around 2:15pm). The few times I did try making small talk with the waitress -who was clearly not in the finest of moods- she walked away as I was talking!  we cleaned up our table before she took the plates and were cheerful the entire time. \nShe was so terrible, I actually said to myself: \"self, I'm gonna write a review on Yelp because her service was terrible...\"  \nThere was not a thing that transpired the entire meal that warranted such rudeness, and, for the first time in my entire life I left a tip that was less than 10%. \n\nABSOLUTELY the worst service, I think that the 55+ year old \"blond\" waitress should retire... or possibly find a job that doesn't involve customer service (maybe she was the owner's mother? ... ... still, I think if she is a relation to the owner, is it really worth the reputation of your business?) \n\nMy family that lives here won't be going back. \n\nThere is a common belief among restaurant owners that regardless of service people will still come in for good food, that is simply not true... if you go to a place with terrible service you will never go back. never.
