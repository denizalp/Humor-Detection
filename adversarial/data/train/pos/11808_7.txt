Garrett is right on the money (sorry John), as far as strip clubs go this is the dregs...only thing going for it is its fairly cheap as far as dances\/cover\/drinks go..this is the old PALACE strip club...last time is was in (SEPT 08) you have a probably 5 mo.pregnant stripper,  one that probably topped out at 200 lbs, a cpl of skinny chicks who looked like they were tweaked out of their gourds and a cpl decently attractive girls who didn't have a clue how to pole dance (but were friendly)....and I like out of the way clubs, i'm no fan of these corporate clubs like MENS CLUB, or UPTOWN CABARET, but this is pretty grim,,,and i also sat in plastic Lowes lawn chairs....but to be fair everyone should go at least once
