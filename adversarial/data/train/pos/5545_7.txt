Big store buy super dirty and crowded. I came to this sams club because I was in the area and wanted to pick up a rotisserie chicken. The patrons here were savage! There were no chickens so I stood by and waited 15 minutes. As soon as the associate displayed the chickens some mature women were ruthless in taking 2-4 chickens at a time. I only wanted one ! I eventually got one but wow. I thought I was going to get beat up by people there. Other than that experience there were many more Snack options however the floor was filthy! I know this store was recently under a remodel however the joints were black and disgusting. I could only imagine how they clean elsewhere.
