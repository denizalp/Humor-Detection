This place is like a 17 year old girl and a raver decided to open up their ideal bar. \n\nCute concept, sweet drinks  all served with candy and you look like your inside rainbow bright's pirate ship but it gets old REAL fast! The drinks are more sweet than strong and after 2 you wanna stop because you have a stomachache.\n\nI can see how this can attract girls, and therefore boys and it had that general feeling too, like people where looking to get some or at least have it proposed to them. \n\nWhatever, it's cool just not my taste.  If you like candy, 90s music, muscle men, made up girls and don't like the taste of alcohol then it may be for you.
