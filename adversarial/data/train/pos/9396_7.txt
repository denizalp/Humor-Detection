Not happy. I called in to speak with \"Jose\" and his original posted ad is below.....\nIf one is asking $300 yet they say, \"call me I am reasonable\". Wouldn't one reasonably assume that they would be willing to work with you? Am I confused regarding the meaning of the word , \"reasonable\"?\nDoes reasonable mean we will put you on hold for 20 minutes and have 3 other sales people answer the phone?\nI started the conversation with Jose, he's the one who posted the ad, he put me on hold then went to speak with another customer and left me with some random sales guy who didn't post the ad.\nI live and work right down the road, I have cash in hand, they were beyond \"UNREASONABLE\".\n\nAnd I am freaking pissed about it.\n\nA reasonable offer would be accepting $200 or $250.\n\nOh here's the best part, the sales guy told me, \"we originally were charging $400\". Well that wasn't reflected in your ad, don't you have any responsibility for what your store posts?\n\nWhy would they tell me it's listed for $400 if the ad says $300, thats a slime ball tactic and I am livid about this interaction.\n\nI hope this post helps others avoid wasting their time here. I am hoping someone will reach out to me after leaving this post. I doubt it...\n\n \"I am selling a Tag Heuer Men's Professional Watch WK1113-0 in great condition, includes original case. \n\nFeatures: \n-Water Resistant 200 meters \n\n-All Stainless Steel \n\n-Vintage Blue Face \n\n-Professional Model \n\n-Quartz Battery \n\n\nI am asking $300 I am reasonable so if you are interested give me a call at \n480-990-3739 ask for Jose thank you..\"
