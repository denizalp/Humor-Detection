WOW!!!!! A++++++ Best show I have ever seen both performance and technically!\n\nI am not sure I can describe or put into words how wonderful this show was..\n\nWe were searching for a show to watch and were torn between the Le Reve and the Beatles Love show. After watching the commercials of both of the shows we decided on the Beatles Love show.  We searched on-line for discounted tickets and found a couple of sites. But ultimately decided to go to the box office and try to wheel and deal with them. As you might of heard Vegas has been suffering during this \"economic downturn\" (I hate that saying) but anyhow, the shows in Vegas have been having a hard time selling out. That's a good thing for us the audience. We were able to get ticket for 50% off. Score! \n \nUpon entry of the lobby you start the whole Beatles Love experience. The lobby has all kinds of colors and different surface types. Also they have a snack bar much like a movie theater. They sell popcorn, soda, candy and Cocktails! Yeah! They sell regular drinks with one shot for $14 dollar and with very little arm twisting these mega 32oz cocktails with 3 shots in them for $20..... 3 times the alcohol for 6 bucks more, No brainier.\n\nWhen you enter the theater you notice a bunch of screens\/scrims all over the place . At first I was like darn, we might have had bad seats... Later I found out I was I wrong. We were in the most perfect seats possible. Middle section and middle of the row seats. It's a 360 stage with seats all around the stage. After patiently waiting for around 25 minutes the announcement started. \"Please no photos, blah blah blah... Here it goes, I thought let's do it! Show me the money!\n\nFrom the moment the show started until the very last second I was completely entertained and wowed with the design, technical execution of the show. I think the designer and producers of this show should win some award in they haven't already. I have been involved  in the production and entertainment industry for years and I was simply amazed with how well the performers performed and how well the technical and production staff put on this show.\n\nI don't want to give away any of the details of the show but the integration of the Beatles theme and music was done wonderfully and the storyline just flowed perfectly. I don't encourage any type of drug use nor do I use any but I can only imagine how trippy this show would be if you were under the influence. I was trippin and I was completely sober.\n\nThere have been very few times I have seen a performance that just blows me away..... The Beatles Love show did just that.... If you are in the neighborhood and or just undecided on a Vegas show You Must see this one!\n\nDino...)'(
