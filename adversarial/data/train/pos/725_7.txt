I love this park. If you enter on Trop, you can walk down a flight of stairs to this huge grassy field with a 2\/3 mile concrete walking trail surrounding it. I come here on my lunch sometimes to get in some exercise. The trail is never crowded and it's so big that you don't really run into anyone else. If you enter from the Decatur side there is a playground, tennis courts and a dog park. There were lots of benches around the park, but I didn't see any tables where I could sit outside and eat my lunch. I am sure they are there somewhere so I'll have to go back and look for them. The park looked clean and well maintained. Also the bathrooms were clean and had actual toilet paper! This is surprising for a park in Vegas, but it may be because this park is newer. I did see a few homeless sleeping on benches, but that doesn't bother me. I probably wouldn't come here alone at night though because the area is pretty sketchy.
