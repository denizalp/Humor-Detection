That the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust took a once sleazy part of Downtown Pittsburgh and transformed it into a bustling center for the arts is enough to warrant a 5 star rating. 20 years ago, I recall avoiding Liberty Avenue as a teenager, worrying that I might be approached by drug or sex peddlers while heading to and from school. Today, Theater Square, The Benedum, The Byham, The Harris, and The O'Reilly (to name a few) have usurped the outlets for peepshows and pornography. As ambivalent as I am towards gentrification (I'll admit to being uneasy about the encroachment of the well-to-do), I'm appreciative of what the PCT has done for this section of our city since the organization's conception in 1984. \n\nWhat prompted me to write a review about the PCT, however, was their sterling customer service.\n\nA few nights ago, I was waiting for my paycheck to clear through direct deposit so that I could grant my lovely Kay, a former high school marching band member, a wish; to witness the musical extravaganza known as \"Blast!\" live at Heinz Hall. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.blasttheshow.com\/\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=76gaGr1I_pU\n\nEarly Friday morning at around 1AM, I placed an order on PCT's website after almost forgetting to do so. Immediately upon looking at my online receipt, I gasped in horror for I had ordered tickets for the wrong night! I wanted to order tickets for the Saturday night show, but instead, I mistakenly ordered tickets for the Friday night show! I don't get off work until 8PM, which means we would have been late! \n\nSo I forced myself to get some sleep and called their customer service line at 9AM. Without any difficulty, the representative honored the exchange when I explained what I had done, and the following night, we picked up the tickets at the venue's Will Call window. The teller didn't even ask to see my ID or credit card. Our weekend had been rescued from certain disaster. \n\nTry doing that with Ticketmaster. \n\nWith apologies to the late, legendary pro wrestler Buddy Rogers, it's class that counts, and it's written all over The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.
