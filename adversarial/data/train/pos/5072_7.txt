How people can be so sour serving ice cream, I'll never know - you'd have to ask the people behind the counter at Gelato Simply Italian. Judging by the long history of similar reviews, this was to be expected.\n\nThe gelato is fine but beyond overpriced - our \"large\" ($8.50) today had three small scoops with the bottom of the cup left empty. You're much better off going to the Whole Foods around the corner and getting a deluxe pint. I liked the melon gelato but I won't be back here to have it again. I get my withering dirty looks for free from my parents.
