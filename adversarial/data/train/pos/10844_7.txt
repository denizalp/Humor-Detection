Joined a friend for happy hour last night & sat at a table (no bar seats avail) it was fairly busy with screaming kids (ugh!) never witnessed so many kids at HH before. Anyway, the service was absolutely horrendous (food 4 stars) the server seemed irritated that she had to serve me & it took way too long for a happy hour menu & my first round of drinks to arrive.\n\nNote to St Francis: your HH menu is very confusing and misleading. I thought all food items on the lunch menu\/HH menu were $3 off and you only showcase a few wines, even though every wine by the glass is half-off.\n\nI was surprised to see my fingerlings weren't discounted even though they were on HH menu. Anyway, they need to work on hiring more staff and I would appreciate my server letting me know HH is ending so I can order another glass of wine for $5 she did give me my second glass at the HH price because it was just 6pm when I finally flagged her down.\n\nThe food is solid so I will return in the future but I must sit at the bar.
