Many people say you can't compare Shake Shack to In-N-Out.  Burger to burger, I say you can.\n\nTaste\nBeef for both are well seasoned, but In-N-Out wins for having a perfectly toasted bun.  Shake Shack's was soggy.\n\nPresentation\nRelatively comparable in terms of paper wrapping, but Shake Shack's patty was bigger.\n\nValue\nIn-N-Out is about half the price of Shake Shack.\n\nWinner - In-N-Out.  \nI don't mind paying more to get better quality or taste, but it didn't seem like SS was offering me either of those things.
