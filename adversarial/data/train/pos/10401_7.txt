First phone call, didn't even make it to consultation. I didn't speak with David but one of his employees and he was so rude! Just kept telling me he charges $5000 and I couldn't do any of the process on my own. \"it would be like doing your own surgery\" I just wanted to ask one simple question but couldn't get any words out because he kept interrupting me, degrading me, and making me feel stupid. I am sure there are nice people here but with even one man as rude as this guy whose not been fired it's not even worth it to spend your money to support this law firm.
