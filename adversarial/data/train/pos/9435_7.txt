Getting ready to paint the town and celebrate my birthday, we stopped in the View Bar to get the evening started. There were few patrons so seating was easy. A nice couch and a deep seat and the three of us settled in for a couple of beers and a cucumber martini that the mad russian ( my lovely date) raved about. The cocktail waitress was very friendly and came often to chat with us and make sure we had all we needed- she even brought us some really good wasabi peas in a big bowl because she saw how much we enjoyed them. Good drinks, great service and good snacks make this a convenient little place to get your evening started in the Aria Resort.
