Today I was very excited to have my first \"Gourmet Ramen\" experience and found the hype of Futo Buta to be promising. We arrived and although it was busy, seating was available immediately either outside or inside. Since it was such a nice day we sat outside.\n\nTables, chairs and individual umbrellas were very clean, as was the patio itself. Depending on which side of your table you sit on you can have a gorgeous view of uptown as well as the light rail as it zips by the Bland St. station on a regular basis.\n\nAppetizers first: Me and my girlfriend decided to try two different steamed buns. We tried the Duck Confit w\/ Leek & Arugula, and also the Pork Belly with Slaw. These were by far the best part of our experience. The buns themselves were very springy and just the right amount of moisture. Meat was cooked perfectly on both offerings, delicious flavor combinations. I wouldn't have minded just getting double orders of these!\n\nRamen was great too! I got the Tonkotsu, which had a very mellow earthy\/hearty broth and featured pork belly and big hearty mushrooms. My girlfriend got the Miso ramen which also featured pork belly, a sweeter broth (not too sweet) and fresh crisp veggies. I will tell you that both dishes were VERY filling. Expect to get a to-go container! The prices on the ramen were a bit of a sticker shock until you see exactly how much you're getting.\n\nThe only thing I wish were more up to par was the service. Our waitress just did not seem to be with it today. Didn't come off as rude, just inattentive, going through the motions. As I looked at the waiter serving the other customers he seemed really passionate about service. This was really the only thing missing that would have made our visit a top-notch lunch experience. We will definitely be back and will update after the next visit!
