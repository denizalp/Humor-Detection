This place is great. I'm definitely a carnivore, so the fact that there is no meat on the menu is usually a major bummer. But you can't argue with good tasting food, regardless of how much delicious meat there is or isn't on your plate. Besides, they have fake meat! The mock chicken in lemon sauce is super delicious. Definitely free-range tofu. The mock chicken with mango in toro nest is great too. \n\nAlso, my wife says they have the cleanest washroom in Chinatown,which is kind of like winning a Juno, but still worth mentioning.
