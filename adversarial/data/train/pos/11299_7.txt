BOOOOOOOO I like Rosati's Pizza but not this location.  Seriously they are bad.  Rude on the phone, delivery takes forever and the pizza shows up cold....SERIOUSLY?\n\nAnd, if you request to change out bell peppers for jalapenos, they charge you.  No other Rosati's does that.\n\nToday I am ordering from Little Chicago's Pizza.  The girl who answered the phone was a doll so if the pizza is as good as she was sweet, I am in for a treat!\n\nI am so glad Rosati's did not answer their phone today....yes I was going to order even though I cannot stand this location because I have a hang over and was being lazy...It's true :)
