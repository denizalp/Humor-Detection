I had a wonderful experience here.  She completely revamped a dress that no longer fit, and also altered a suit that needed to be taken in.  Her high quality work is meticulous - and I believe her pricing is fair (if you want cheap alterations she is not your girl - but if you are willing to spend the money, you wont be disappointed).  Her hours are a little unusual - but they have worked perfectly for me.
