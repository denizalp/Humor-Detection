I've eaten here about three times now, and I have to say I'm a fan. I've eaten at their location in Gilbert several times before, so I knew what to expect when walking in.\n\nThe place is colorfully decorated, with different colored tables and chairs of all sizes for seating.  Their food is cooked fresh, they will make what you want to order on or off the menu.  I usually go with the shredded beef taco with some kind of beans and rice.  This is a hearty meal, and let me tell you, its filling and delicious. I love their shredded beef, as its really moist and juicy. Their tortilla's are made fresh by hand, and you can watch them  make it as your standing in line.\n\nOverall I love this place, but at times, I feel rushed through line. I also have a hard time hearing the guys behind the counter when they ask me stuff like what I want on my taco.  Honestly, I know my hearing is good, so I think its the noise from behind the counter that drowns them out.  I have to ask them a lot to repeat themselves, and its not that they aren't loud enough....but in between the glass that's separating you and the noise from the kitchen, I have to keep saying \"HUH? ONE MORE TIME PLEASE.\"\n\nAlso, sometimes i feel rushed at the register when i pay. I take my time and put my money back in my wallet and make sure I have everything before I take my tray, and sometimes I feel like they want me to hurry up so they can keep the line down, and not have it pile up.  (I know, fussy, right?)  LOL\n\nOverall, I love their food here and I really enjoy eating here. I plan on coming back in the future to eat more, and even though its on the pricier size, I'm definitely a fan!
