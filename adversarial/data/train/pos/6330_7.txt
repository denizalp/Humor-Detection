3.5 stars\n\nIt was not the food that drawn me into Insomnia Cafe... it was their daily drink specials.\n\nI was suppose to meet up with my yelp friend to have a quick bite before watching Yelp's Hot Doc Superhero. And since I was down at the Annex early and need a place to hang and Insomnia Cafe ended up to be an excellent choice.\n\nNice and Friendly service. Cheap Creemore Pint for $4 on Monday (different everyday of the week). Nice and classy decoration. I felt really comfortable having a pre dinner drink at the bar area waiting for my friend to show up.\n\nFrom now on, I know where to park myself aside from the Green Beanery next door... And Insomnia Cafe even have Free WIFI access... hmmmm Am I going to make Insomnia my Yelp's office?? Drinking beer and uploading photos??
