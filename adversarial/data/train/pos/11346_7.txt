Hey, why didn't I read these reviews? Jokes on me, this place was no bueno. Came in for a breakfast burrito and a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary looked like watermelon juice, and the breakfast burrito had bacon in it. When I told the waiter I hadn't ordered it with bacon and actually don't eat bacon, he looked at me like I had two heads. I asked for a new one without any extras and guess what? It came out with corn and squash, and no beans like it was supposed to have. Color me surprised!\n\nI realize that yes, I am eating in an airport restaurant. I know the quality of food I'm getting. Because of that, I'm rating entirely on the service and the wrongness of the meal. Skip it and go to Popeyes. At least you know what to expect.
