I eagerly decided to write my 50th review of Bally's Sterling Brunch, unfortunately, this visit wasn't like previous ones.  After having made a reservation about 3 weeks ago, we arrived a bit before our time and were promptly seated at noon. Since it was just the two of us, we were seated at a small two person table off to the side. No problem.\n\nI mainly come to the brunch for the seafood treats and the Perrier-Jouet (always yummy).  I was surprised to learn that the Stone Crab claws had been substituted with Jonah Crab claws (which are a cheaper version of the Stone)  Ok, I thought, I will gladly try them out.  They were basically tasteless and small;one tasted like ammonia and rotten fish. Strike one.  If you are going to charge $95 (yes, the price went up) please use fresh, high quality seafood without using cheaper substitutes, diners deserve that. \n\nThe second strike involved the Alaskan King crab of which I'm a major aficionado.  The size was average.  But, and this is among the worst aspects, when I went to \"crack\" them, they bent, which means when defrosted they were left to soak in their own water for a long period of time instead of being properly drained. They were Chinese buffet soggy, if you know what I mean.  Inappropriate for a $95 brunch. \n\nOn a positive note, the Neuske bacon was a major hit.  Very thickly sliced portion of smoked pork heaven.  Really fantastic!\n\nOur server was Lupita who was friendly and provided some nice recommendations, but was slow on the draw when refilling our champagne flutes.\n\nI will have to really think twice about returning to this brunch.  It's definitely not like it used to be.  Sadly.
