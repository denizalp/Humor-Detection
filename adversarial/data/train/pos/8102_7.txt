Awesome experience!\n\nLuis Morales was my guy - super awesome and easy going! The process was so easy and fast.... kinda like guys I know.... LOL. I literally looked online, which I have been for a few months, found the perfect car and inquired about it. Luis called me, we chatted as he was helping me do the application and 10 minutes later I was approved!\n\nThe car I wanted was in Utah, so that came with a $199 transfer fee that sucked, but, no pay - no play. LOL. The car took one day to get here once it was shipped, all together like 5 days for everything.\n\nFinancing is awesome here - perfect credit all the way to bad credit - they have you covered! \n\nI love that you don't have to sit here for 10972304971 hours with the sales person and haggle, which, I wouldn't mind with Luis (Ladies, he's so easy on the eyes with his colored eyes!) especially since he really listened and was completely helpful with all my questions. \n\nOnce my car arrived, I went down to the dealership and an hour later I was driving home with my new lovely car (which was cleaned inside and out and loaded with a tank of gas) and so happy I made the decision to buy a new car. Lord knows my Hondaratti was done, it served me well.\n\nOverall this has been the BEST experience I've had purchasing a car. The CarMax team is awesome - if you go, ask for Luis!! \n\nYay!
