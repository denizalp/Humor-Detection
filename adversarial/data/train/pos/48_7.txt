One major thing that was always missing from Baldwin Village was a great coffee shop to compliment its various restaurants. So when TAN (whose Queen location was a favorite of mine on the coffee passport) opened up a few weeks ago, all my prayers were answered. No more going to Tim Hortons and Starbucks when in need of coffee while at work. \n\nThe latte and americano here are amazing, especially the latte which has the perfect amount of foam and strength for my tastes. The prices are also not that bad and possibly a little cheaper than your average indie coffee stop.  \nNot the greatest variety of food options but every time I have been here they have been out of sandwiches so I assume they must be pretty popular. The Queen location had more food on display, so this will hopefully catch up on that front. \n\nStaff are very friendly and the manager has always been in (being a new location I assume she wants to see everything is running smoothly at first).\n\nApart from the food another slight negative is the lack of seating, only 8 seats are available but the general area while small is very spaced out. If you manage to score the table near the window, it makes for great people watching.\n\nAdd reliable wifi in to the mix and you're golden, but don't take too long to check this place out as I assume it will be crowded very soon once word gets out of it's existence!
