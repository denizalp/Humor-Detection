This place was so good I just had to bring my room mate to show her what really good Mexican tacos and Horchata tasted like.\n\nThis time around I got to try their Spicy Chicken Tamale and of course some tacos and a side of Horchata to accompany it. Also decided to dine in.\n\nThe Tamale was good, moist masa but not too thick or dry. The chicken actually had a bit of heat, but so flavorful. The tacos were amazing just how I remembered them.\n\nFull 5 stars for the owner(?) who asked if I wrote the review that had a missing taco and said they would give me one on the house. Which I didn't feel was necessary, but was so nice. I ended up tipping them for it anyways.\n\nThe food here is amazing and miss my local eateries in San Jose, California so much because the flavor of the food is so similar. \n\nGreat tacos, cheap prices and I give props to establishments who do take the time to read reviews here. \n\nThank you Atoyac, I'll definitely be back for more Taco Tuesdays!\n\nP.S. My room mate had never had Mexican food- besides Taco Bell and Chipotle (which you can hardly call Mexican\/inspired) but she thoroughly enjoyed this new cuisine and left satisfied!
