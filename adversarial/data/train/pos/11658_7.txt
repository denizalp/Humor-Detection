This is where The Dude would hang out if he lived in Lakewood. This is a real, American bowling alley. Don't waste your time going to the abomination to the world of bowling alleys on E. 4th St.  I don't really enjoy bowling but coming here makes it all worth while. The only thing that is missing at Mahalls is the ability to smoke cigarettes while bowling. If they still allowed smoking, I would probably come out of smoking retirement and burn some heaters.
