Gosh this place is going downhill, fast. Each time I visit, the wait is a little longer, the floors are a little stickier, the booths\/chairs a little more run down, and the bathrooms a lot stinkier. (Seriously, today the bathrooms were so unbearable I walked back to Salsaritas to wash my hands.) And, don't even get me started about the parking situation! \n\nThe food is so uniform and hard to screw up, it keeps me coming back. If I'm in a rush and want something relatively healthy, I'll stop by for a half salad and cup of soup. But, I swear, each visit lately makes me question why I come back. A few more gross visits like the recent ones and I may just start leaving the house earlier to give myself extra time to eat at Namastay (just behind Panera) instead.
