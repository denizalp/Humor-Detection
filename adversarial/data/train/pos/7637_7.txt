Cool new place. It's a lot like Steak and Shake except without the shakes. It's like Steak and Custard. (badum bum) We ordered the traditional California burger, the chili cheese fries, and a turttle custard concrete. \n\nThe California burger is what you would expect a traditional California steakburger to be (it tastes just like the steak and shake california burger). It's got the thinnly sliced steak burger with the all the California burger fixings.\n\nNow, I do love their chili cheese fries! I'm not a big fan of chili cheese fries only because it's so filling and I get full off it so fast. It's got the steak burger chunks in it with nacho cheese and mini cubes of onion on it. The french fries are also those thinly cut fries which makes it all the more better. You taste more of the chili cheese than the thickness of the fries which I loved.\n\nNow, the turtle custard concrete. DELISH! The custard was nice and thick and super solid! It was rich and creamy. It had all the fixing of a turtle any thing. So the pecans, caramel, and chocolate just made that custard taste so good. If you prefer it premixed and you want to just sip on it, get the concrete. If you dig the helpings on top where you can eat the best of the best first, get the sundae.
