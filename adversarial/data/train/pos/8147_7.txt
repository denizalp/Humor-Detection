Worst. Experience. Ever. Tonight.\n\nWhat should have taken a 3 minute phone call took a 30 minute phone call to order some pizza and wings. The guy was seriously frustrating me because he didn't know anything and couldn't answer any of my questions. On top of that, the order went to the wrong house. Took over an hour. And the food wasn't even correct or great. And we still had to pay.\n\nOver cooked and sloppy pizza. \nNo sauce. \nNo cheese. \nBurnt pepperonis. \nBone out instead of bone in wings.\n\nClearly a bunch of wrongs.\nChanged our minds about Pizza Hut, and now we're gonna have to get our pizza somewhere else. \n\nAvoid avoid avoid!!!!
