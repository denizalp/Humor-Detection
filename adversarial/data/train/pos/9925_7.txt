I rarely say it, but this place TRULY is totally ghetto. Only eat here if you are desperate. \n\nThe food is cheap and completely nasty. I sat with my two friends (visiting from Sarnia, extremely broke and wanted cheap food) as they devoured countless kitchen nightmares - grossly overcooked burger, burnt wings and the most greasy onion rings I've ever seen. \n\nIt also took an obscenely long time for the food to come out and it all came out at different times.\n\nThere is absolutely no decor to speak of, there are random furniture bits like couches and armchairs that look like they came from Salvation Army.\n\nSeriously - there are countless cheap options in the Annex and there is no reason to consider eating here.
