Ugh... what a disappointment!  \nAtmosphere was a little blah in my opinion.... had a cheap feel to it.  \nNo lunch menu so we were force to pay dinner prices $34 including tip.\nChips were okay, but both the green and red salsas were awful!  I don't even know how to explain the flavor... no bueno!\nI ordered the Chile Relleno and my girl ordered the enchilada\/taco combo.  We weren't impressed with either dish.  Mediocre at best.\nEverything seemed a bit over seasoned (and maybe just not seasoned well)... \n\nReally unfortunate because we were hoping for a good Mexican restaurant close to home :(
