The place where 4 hour buffet happened.\n\n5 girls ate from lunch til dinner and changed server 3 times. I don't remember what exactly we ate...but I knew we sure ate all of our money's worth.\n\nBest part: maracons for desserts.  Devine left over cookies and naans at 3am post clubbing.\n\nI didn't wear stretchy pants, but I think the food has digested long before we went clubbing at HAZE.\n\nBest bang for your buck...$20 lunch that lasted til dinner time.
