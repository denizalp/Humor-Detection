Since they didn't ask me how it was... here's my voluntary review:\n\nhow do you know a relationship is at its caliber? when both parties are able to withstand all obstacles, right?\n\n\nwell, for me, it was cold and windy and about 9:50pm when my friends and i decided to go to the nearest pho place next to our house. luckily Sidestreet closes at 10:30pm, so we got there, got sat, and ordered by the time is was 10.05pm. my two friends barely opened their menu, and the lady already was trying to take their order. \n\nmy one star represents that our soup came out fast and they weren't blatantly rude--at best.\n\nwhen we got our soup, it wasn't even that hot, it was barely warm. i assure you, the meat was decent but the soup wasn't hot, therefore the pho wasn't the best experience. the staff didn't even come over to see if our empty cups needed refills. granted, they're closing up and setting up other tables taking care of other things. i noticed the staff greeting nicely to others but just because we were the last ones there just ten passed closing, not the same type of \"genuine\" service, as if we're a burden. [insert big eyed-emojicon here] Not a big deal for you, just for me. On that note, i'll just make my way to spring mountain where im worth their business. \n\nour customer relationship was not at its caliber. case closed.
