Customer service means a lot and Joes does not have it. Found Joes by accident and it looked inviting from the outside. They make their money off serving the after clubbing drunk crowd who just want the closest food. Someone needs to tell the counter employees to treat people who come in there on a Wednesday afternoon with appreciation & respect. \n A strange non-feature is that there's no iced tea. No sweet, unsweet brewed, or fountain tea. Also not a large selection of fountain drinks and one of the flavors was not working. \n The veggie sandwich was really good (see pic.) Thats the only positive thing I can say about Joes. \n Got an order of cheese fries and they were disgusting! The fries were soggy with no seasoning. Don't know what kind of cheese was melted on them but it wasn't good either (see pic)\n The only reason I didn't try the pizza was that it had flies all over all the pizzas and the employees clearly didn't care. Since they leave the doors open the small, crowded restaurant has many flies all over you food. \n Even after the next time I leave the club in search of munchies one night I will NOT be going to Joes.
