Was in Vegas for a friend's birthday weekend and looking for a place to go eat brunch\/lunch at and one of our friends mentioned Bonito Michoacan, we all thought it sounded great so off we went!\n\nWhen I got there, I check in on my handy dandy Yelp App and guess what! Just checking in I scored a free margarita, how sweet is that!  But they also had a little text promo too that gave you a free margarita as well, so the table of 12 was already set with free margarita haha.\n\nThey start you off with homemade chips, bean dip & salsa, the bean dig is great, mix it with the salsa and it becomes amazing!  Just take note, 1st round of homemade chips, bean dip & salsa are complementary, additional orders are 2.99, but we were a party of 12 and there was plenty.\n\nAfter checking out the menu I went with Zitacuaro - 2 enchiladas in a Verde sauce, I picked chicken for my meat, and I have to say these enchiladas were great, the corn tortilla I believe was homemade, it was perfectly cooked, the chicken was shredded and it was moist and very good tasting, however they season\/marinade the chicken was delish! The Verde sauce was delish too! One of the best I have had, full of flavor and the perfect texture. These were some great enchiladas.\n\nService was great and friendly, glad to have found this lil gem in Vegas!
