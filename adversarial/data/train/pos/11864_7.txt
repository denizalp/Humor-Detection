Decent vape shop with only like two brands of juices, but some of them are pretty good. \nThey are the kind of place that feels the need to brand everything like they're the ones who invented vaping, which is always funny.\n\nIf you come during the day there are some women on staff who are actually nice and helpful. But every time I show up at off-peak hours it's like the employees have recently upped their dose of slacker dudebro pills. I'm going to give it another shot but if the frat boys behind the counter look at me again like I'm interrupting their cool hangout time by actually entering the store wanting to buy something I probably won't return. Also if they even try to call me \"he\" one more time I'm going to ask to speak to a manager and make a big stink about it.
