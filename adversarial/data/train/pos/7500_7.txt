I remember when the only places to get a boba drink in Vegas were this place and Tea Station (Tea Planet?!). \n\nNow that the boba scene has exponentially grown, so has my awareness for better drinks!\n\nPrior to my recent visit, I had not been to this place in years. I came back out of curiosity. Ah, regret. So what's new-ish? A slight remodel, K-POP everywhere, and snow ice (fluff ice). What's the same? Same lame service, fried food menu, and of course boba drinks. \n\nThe boba drinks are very mediocre. That is all. Next!
