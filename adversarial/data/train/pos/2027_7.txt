This place has been on my radar for a while now, especially since it is so close to where I live. Finally decided to check it out last night and I was wildly impressed!\n\n(+) Service was top notch! All employees were incredibly nice and helpful! This was only our second time enjoying a Korean BBQ place and Judy really went out of her way to help us out! \n(+) We tried several of the meats, but the steak and the short ribs certainly stood head and shoulders above the rest! Don't get me wrong though, the bulgogi, pork belly, and thinly sliced brisket was also tasty as well.\n(+) Sides were good too! My personal faves were the mac salad, kimchi, and salad (greens).\n(+) Prices were good. I had dinner II ($23.95) which included 1 steak (Yummy!), while my friend had dinner I ($19.95). I definitely feel like I enjoyed my moneys worth of good food!\n(+) Cozy, but clean and comfortable dining area with amusing K-Pop videos playing on the wall! lol\n\n(-) That vent totally blocks you from seeing the other people at your table. Wish there was a better way of setting that up.\n(-) Shared sink outside the restrooms is visible from the dining area. Just an odd set up for that.\n\nThis was a very enjoyable experience and I will certainly be back to enjoy Doh Korean BBQ again! Highly recommended!\n\n5 stars.
