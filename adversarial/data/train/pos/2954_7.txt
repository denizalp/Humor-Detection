This has been my go to place in the last 2 years.  They have good prices and the service is quick.\nTonight, my friend and I had our craving and went to our go to place.  \n\nEverything was expected until we had a visitor stop by.  It was a RAT that ran across the dining area.  I thought I was seeing things and I asked my friend to look - she confirmed and we both screamed.  The rat was a size of a shoe - we had lifted our feet up away from the ground.  \n\nThe servers heard our screams and came to inspect but the RAT had already escaped.  We were terrified and disgusted - dessert was brought to us but we had to leave pronto.  We paid and left.\n\nI can NEVER go there again.  And it disappoints me as all our many visits to this place was great.  But a RAT the size of Splinter is NOT ACCEPTABLE.\n\nI have been left with no choice to retract my previous reviews and lower the rating.  Tonight is the last EVER I will be dining at this place.
