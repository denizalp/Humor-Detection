Advice for any Sprint user dont call their Customer Service and definitely DO NOT go to a 3rd party store! MOST say Sprint on them but their are only a hand full of official Sprint Nextel store's in the Valley and you should get to know them they have repair in house now too. It is dope. I went thru hell trying to get a repalecement on the old mans new Instinct. They were out of stock everywhere and it was defective what do you do?? They gave me a brand new replacement here within minutes they even gave me the entire box with all the batteries, chargers, etc. The girl was so helpful unlike ANYTHING I have ever exerienced with Sprint seriously. I wont be wasting my time anymore! I will never go anywhere else I have wasted so much precious time over the phone and at other stores!!
