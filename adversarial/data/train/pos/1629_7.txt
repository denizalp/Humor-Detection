Dimly lit with stone walls, wood beams, heavy linens, and art-glass chandeliers overhead it was to formal greetings and a rose for the ladies that we arrived in the Cellar and whisked away soon to a booth in one of several rooms the action soon commenced, each waiter presented by name as a trio of warm breads with a butter rose plus the famous tableside salad engaged the senses - the later a true crowd pleaser carefully customized for each and every guest.  Large in menu with a bar that promised to craft \"anything you like\" it was with a stiff pair of $7 cocktails that our proper order progressed and soon plucking tender snails under delicate pastry from their dish one really couldn't help but smile at a classic done so well, a theme continued with each of three superlative entrees following a raspberry palate cleanse - the tableside whole duckling a showstopper gathering looks from around the room while the Wellington rivaled that at Ramsay Steak beneath a pile of mushrooms and foie gras.  Truly a class act it was prior to desserts-proper that a trio of chocolate dipped fruits arrived to be dressed in hand-whipped cream and with more sweets offered on the house to celebrate a duo of birthdays it was tableside we turned again - the smolder and burn of booze, fresh fruit, and cinnamon ladled over rich ice cream a refined finish to a true 'experience.'
