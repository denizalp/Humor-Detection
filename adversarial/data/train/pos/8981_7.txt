Okay, Renaissance. Your lobby is grandiose. And I appreciate that. I really do. But would it kill you to spend a little to upgrade your rooms?\n\nNow, those rooms are small, so you could go for an ultra-modern New York theme, but that would obviously clash with your admittedly impressive lobby.\n\nOr you could go for something comfortable yet upscale, but then that kind of interior design goes better with a larger room, which your hotel does not provide.\n\nOr, I guess, you could just leave everything the way it is, with crappy furniture, a crappy bed, and a crappy bathroom, to go along with your gorgeous lobby.\n\nAnd I take it that's the route you've gone. And I get that. I really do.
