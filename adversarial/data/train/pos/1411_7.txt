ive been using td meloche monnex for my house and car insurance for a number of years now they have always been quite efficient in terms of sending me copies of insurance documents if ive misplaced them...which inevitably, happens at least once a year.\n\nwhen i had a car they worked with me to give me the best deal possible, though not without my prodding - can you expect anything more from an insurance company?  doubt it.  plus, jesus, use some of my premiums and get more operators so i dont have to wait on hold for fifteen minutes.\n\nanyhow, i ended up getting pretty good deals on my car insurance and my home insurance and unless there is something phenomenal that comes up in the world of insurance these guys seem fine.
