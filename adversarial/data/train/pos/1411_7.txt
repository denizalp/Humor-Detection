To sum things up, my flash drive crashed with important files, and One Stop Wireless (specifically Chris), saved them, and my life! Their customer service is extremely top notch, and I left completely satisfied. They could really sense how anxious I was, and tended to all my needs. If your phone breaks, your computer crashes, your data gets lost, or if you run into any technical difficulties, I'd recommend them 100% :)\n\n(PS, they're business hours are until 7:30pm, but they helped me out until 8:30pm so they're extremely flexible and reliable! A big thanks to One Stop Wireless!)
