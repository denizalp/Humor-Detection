I try to avoid going to No Frills for one reason alone, I worked at one in Scarborough for a little while just out of high school, and I cannot unsee what I have seen!\n\nThe first thing they had me do when they hired me was to shovel out dead mice from behind the reduce rack in the back room.  \n\nAs time went by they asked me to do things like clean out all the shit from from under the elevating loading dock.  When I showed them the sign ON THE LOADING DOCK that said not to go under there, they just got somebody else willing to do it.  \n\nA friend of mine got reprimanded by the manager for NOT changing the expiry dates on the meat!  Ever read, \"The Jungle\"?  \n\nThe floor of the back room was sticky with years of sludge that had built up from spills of rotton milk, expired chicken, broken eggs and decayed potatoes... but when a skid of berries turned over and spilt onto the floor, I had to help put them back in the containers that read, \"Pre-Washed\".\n\nA friend of mine asked for a raise and they recommended he work the night shift because they pay an extra 25 cents an hour!  The manager also told him, \"Raises are a Frill.\"\n\nI went to The No Frills in the Junction and it's you're regular, run of the mill No Frills.  Sure the employees are not helpful or knowledgeable... but what do you expect?  They're teens who need some extra cash for beer on the weekend and as soon as they find anything that pays 10 cents more an hour, they're gone!\n\nExpect nothing from a store named NO FRILLS!\n\nThen again, it's tough not to go there at times.  The Junction is filled with overpriced \"Organic\" stores that charge you almost double just because there is a sticker on the fruit that tells you it's Organic.  Here's a tip; fruit and vegetables that claim to be organic are only organic based on their country's organic guidelines.  So a banana from Jamaica only needs to heed to Jamaica's \"strict\" organic guidelines, and an orange from Mexico only needs to heed to Mexico's \"strict\" organic guidelines.  It's all different no matter where you go, and it's all bullshit.\n\nAnyway, try to avoid No Frills as much as you can and if you need some fruits and vegetables, go to Bloor West Village.
