If you don't speak Spanish, it is not a problem there will be someone to help you. Unless you look Spanish but aren't Spanish and don't speak Spanish. This is always a problem for me because I get treated a certain way for not speaking Spanish when they think I should based on my looks but I just gotta deal with it and get over it.\n\nI haven't sat in and ate here, so I can't testify to the service of being waited on. First time I walked in and took my order to go and second time, I called ahead and placed my order to go. Calling ahead, saved me a little time but not a lot of time. I still had to wait a bit to get the food.\n\nThe food overall is okay. Not the best and not the worse. But for a quick Mexican lunch it does the trick. The refried beans here are actually okay and not so bland. Some of the food can be on the greasy side but it is what to be expected from a place like this.\n\nI would come back if I wanted a quick Mexican lunch again just wouldn't be my first choice.
