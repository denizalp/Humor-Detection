This food is so delicious!\n\nMy friend recently moved here from the Bronx and he said he already found a place that makes the perfect Puerto Rican food - this place is mmm mmm good.  \n\nWhen I sat down I asked the server what she recommended and she started off by  saying that the pernil had been slow roasted for 14 hours - I didn't have to hear more, that was what I was getting.  She also brought out some plantanos with some oil and garlic, very tasty.  Her suggestion did not disappoint, the pork was so tender and flavorful.  The service was outstanding!  I loved my server, so funny and attentive. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try something else.
