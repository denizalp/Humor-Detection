I was in Chandler searching for a quick lunch when I found one of my favorite Scottsdale restaurants. Pearl Sushi is now open in Chandler and they have hit it out of the park! The decor is fantastic and the food is even better. Pearl has both the classic sushi items and their spin on your favorites. If you are looking for a friendly place to go have some sushi in the East Valley find Pearl Sushi. And if you are looking for a great Happy Hour definitely find Pearl Sushi. You won't be disappointed. I know I'll be back many times
