I just wanted to get the bird poo washed off my car before it started eating into my Everest green metallic paint. The $3 one at the Chevron by my house will remove bird poo, so for $5, it seemed like a reasonable request. After this car wash, the dust was gone, my hood ornament was crooked, and I am pretty sure I left with some new scratches on my trunk. What I also left with was bird poo still stuck to my paint. Apparently it wasn't such a reasonable request after all.
