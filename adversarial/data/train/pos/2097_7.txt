Ok YAROPB (yet another review of pizzeria bianco)\n\nThis place is just ok...nothing to brag about, and definately not worth the 2-4 hour wait.\n\n6pm...arrived...put a table for 4 on the list\n\n7pm...hunger set in we ate cheese and had a beer next door...the cheese is by far the worst tasting cheese ever.  (but i am no fine cheese connoisseur)...beer was great\n\n8pm...did nothing...still hungry...played games 8 games of solitare and bubble breaker on cell phone\n\n9pm...sat and placed an order for 4 different pizzas\n\n9:45pm...took the first bite and thought there is nothing special about it...took a second bit and said the freshness of the ingredients was grand.  The quality of ingredients were really good.  The crust burnt, the dough tasted nothing more than naan at an indian restaurant cooked in a clay oven.  Sauce fresh tasting...cheese far better than the shit next door.\n\n10pm...got bored of the pizzas decided to try others...sadly same effect.\n\nall in all this place is okay, is it worth 3 hours...NO.  is it better than little ceasar's YES...\n\npersonally BJ's Pizza and Brewery, Nello's, Oregano's, Grimaldi's, and especially Spinato's is far better, and you have less of a wait at any of these places...\n\nwhy the long wait then?  cause the place is tiny, maybe 25 seats, and an hour and a half to two hours dining time...plus media hype\n\nwhy the good reviews?  cause after 4 hours of hunger and or boozing even taco bell's mexican pizza would be the best thing you ever tasted that night.\n\nNeedless to say Jack Bauer does more in 4 hours...and this is 4.5 hours I will never get back.
