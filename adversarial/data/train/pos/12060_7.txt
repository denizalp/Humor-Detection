Visiting for the weekend, two of my friends were participating in the Spartan Race Super. I had a few hours to spare before heading to the race and another friend of mine needed a bikini bottom. \n\nFrom the outside, the store looks beautiful with blue tinted glass held by metal frames. The inside is spacious with a sea of clothing racks from floor to ceiling. \n\nThe clothes are well kept and organized. Finding my size was a breeze but some parts of the store were a little difficult to stroll through because of too many clothing racks. They don't have a Men's section from what I recall which is a little strange but perhaps demand is different in Summerlin. \n\nI went on a Saturday morning and it wasn't busy at all. There were plenty of employees but some how there was a line at the register. Also, there wasn't one staff member that asked if I needed help. \n\nOverall, this location is no different from others I've visited. It's one of the prettier ones but that's about it. They might be a new addition to the pavilion and is trying to  get settled.
