On the strip, but not really. The South Point is a great location for locals. I have never stayed in the hotel but recently I have been coming here for bowling, movies, bingo and dining. They have great locals deals and since it's pretty close we are able to get in and out pretty conveniently. The parking situation isn't crazy and I can usually come any time of the week and get a good spot. \n\nSouth Point hosts many conventions and has a lot of inexpensive entertainment options as well. We have actually come here for New Year's in the past because it usually not a madhouse compared to other locations on the strip. \n\nOverall, South Point has a lot to offer locals and tourists alike.
