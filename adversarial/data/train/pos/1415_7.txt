So remember that movie Las Vegas vacation and they are playing guess the hand and other obscure games well this is the place... Not really but what a strange, old, grungy dive of a casino.  We only came because of the living social deal and will never come back.  Old school, hoopty and somewhere never to frequent at night for safety reasons.  I was nervous the whole time there.  Creepy!  Living social should be ashamed of being associated with them.
