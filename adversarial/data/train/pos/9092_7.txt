It was our first time at this particular location and probably our last. This one is so much smaller than the Rainbow location so the wait for a party of 5 was significantly longer. \n\nService was so much slower but the food was consistent with the other Egg works so that part was good. Didn't appreciate having to flag down someone though every time we needed something. \n\nBeing that it's a new year hubby decided to try something new as opposed to sticking with faves, lol not the wisest idea as the Cincy Chili Loco Moco he opted on was probably the worst tasting item in the menu. Looked like dog food and most likely tasted just as bad. Lol definitely stick with tried and tested faves!
