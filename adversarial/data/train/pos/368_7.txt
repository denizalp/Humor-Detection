Their website states \"We offer a wide range of vehicle cleaning and detailing services, designed to help prolong the life of your vehicle. We are the number one car wash in Toronto!\"\n\nTruthfully I have to agree. \n\nI just received my second car wash from Soap and Suds at the Distillery District location and I have never had a cleaner car. I have experienced numerous  shotty car detailing jobs in and around the GTA but this company does it best. The first time I got my car detailed here it was by fluke as I was in the District and seriously needed a detail.  I paid roughly $40 for an in and out and was extremely pleased. This time I had a groupon from Buytopia which ran me $30 and I paid an extra $20 to have my seats shampooed, so all in all $60. Both times a gentleman named Donovan cleaned my car and this Jamaican goes beast mode on your vehicle. Such a nice guy and such a hard worker. He uses some serious elbow grease to clean your car. \n\nI am so pleased. This is as good as it gets.
