There's a learning curve to this place - for one, get there early, otherwise you will have to hover and then vulture down upon someone who is just leaving (I was not prepared for this during my first attempt of dining here, but came prepared - and at 4:30 pm - the following night and was able to score a seat outside on the patio). The patio tables are only four tops, which made me feel like a little bit of an ahole since I was in Scottsdale on a work trip and was here solo, but c'est la vie; it was gorgeous out and the outside space was perfect. \n\nI arrived with plenty of time to enjoy happy hour, and decided on the green salad and grilled fish tacos to eat, as well as a glass (which quickly turned to two glasses - hello, I was eating alone) of the $5 happy hour Cabernet Sauvignon, which was delicious. \n\nThe salad with feta and candied walnuts ($6 for HH prices) arrived first and was delicious, followed by the grilled fish tacos ($10) that were some of the best I've ever had. I do wish I had the huckleberry margarita, as basically everyone around me ordered it and it looked AMAZING. Because I was there by myself and everyone probably assumed I was stood up on a Tinder date, I played into it by ordering the creme brulee for dessert, which had a perfect hard shell and was absolutely delicious (and well worth the four miles I had to run the next day to work it off). \n\nThe service was also good - my server was attentive (probably pitying the fact that I was eating there alone, so he was very quick to offer a second glass of wine and dessert menu), and to bring me the check at the end of my meal. For everything I ordered, because of the phenomenal happy hour prices, my bill was $36, with an $8 tip, I ate all of that for under $50 (not sure if I should be proud of that or not). \n\nThis will definitely be in my rotation for future business trips to Scottsdale, especially now that I know it does pay to get there early.
