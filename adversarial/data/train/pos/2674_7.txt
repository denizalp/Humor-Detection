Coming from New York City this library is very impressive! This library is unique because the building that it is in is also is an art exhibit! The library has two floors and the main floor has international books, new release and videos(DVDS). The checking out and returning system very technological advanced. You check out your own book and return it through a conveyor belt system that require no human interactions. The second floor holds a vast majority of the library collection. I came here to study for my MCAT and it is a really nice place to get a lot work done. The interior of the library is really well designed. The second floor also hold a children area which can be loud at times but if you stay far away the noise will not reach you! While some individual do decided to answer cell phone it is rare. OVERALL a very nice place to study and to get book because they do have a large collection.
