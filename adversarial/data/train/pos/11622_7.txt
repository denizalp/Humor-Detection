Yes, a poorly run business. We signed our daughter up 3 weeks before the start of classes. They called a week later asking us if we'd be interested in a differently schedule class, but when we called back we didn't get a return call. After waiting a week, we called requesting to drop the class as we were no longer able to take the classes at all (our scheduled changed and we can't make it). We asked for refund and they give us some kind of run around about needing to give \"30-day\" notice, but we could get credits. We were not interested in taking classes and we had not even set foot in the studio (purchased online) until today - to cancel and get refund. I was told by receptionist\/front desk person that she'd bring it up to the owner but she herself was not able to give refund. (Most other studios ask for 24 hour notice, like Gymcats.) We didn't even have the full 30 days to \"give notice\", so not sure how THAT is fair. I'm not even sure that it is legally binding...\n\nJust stay away. There are better studios, with better service, and better pricing policies. If you need more information, check out some of the reviews on \"Citysearch\" (just weed through the ones written by the teenage students and\/or staff... they're easy to pick out).
