What to expect from a tiny bar in a small residential part of the city.  I had no idea either.  The Tack was popular on the 70's before changing to Gilligan's and now the new owners have paid homage to the original name.  The drinks are on par with any mixology bar but at reasonable prices between 8-12. The food options are limited in number but the taste was far better than what you would expect from a bar.  The fired chicken fried rice is excellent. Definitely going to be a regular stop this summer after work.
