Another day at the zoo!  It's April and 68 degrees at 9am...a breeze to boot?  Was I teleported somewhere tropical?  \nMy son loves those red ear slider  turtles by the entrance.  \"Mommy, look!  There is a baby turtle riding on mommy turtle.\"  He pointed enthusiastically.  I look over and there they were, mating in front of all these little kids.  \n\"Yes, sweetie, the baby is getting a free ride!\"  I'm not ready for the birds and the bees talk yet.  I was a little skeptical to proceed inside.  Is this mating season? \n\"It's a Komodo!\"  My son yells as he entered 'The Land of the Dragons'.\n\"No!  It's a Gila Monster!\"  An older kid tries to correct my son.\n\"You're wrong!  It's a Komodo.  A Komodo!!!\"  My son retorted.  By now, people around us were watching the faceoff.  LOL!  I wasn't sure if they replaced the Komodo with a Gila.  \"A Gila Monster has orange on it!\"  My son yells back.  I look at the information board.  Sure enough, it's a Komodo Dragon.  My son is a nerd!\nThere is a new Orangutan exhibit that just opened up.  The zoo has spent a lot of money and time on this one.  Half of it was still under construction. Thick  plexiglass surround about 180 degrees of the covered building.  I'm not sure if the ventilation is in the works, but it felt like a sauna in there.  Some fans would help circulate the air a little bit.  I'm skipping this one in the heat of summer.  We'll hit the spray pads anyhow.\nCheck out the Stingray Bay after the spray pads (near the exit\/entrance) and leave the kiddos swim clothes on.  If they want to feed those rays--they will get wet!  This is an extra $3 for members and $4 for non members.\nGreat for any age!\nPeople try to compare this to the San Diego Zoo.  Don't.  It's in a different class on its own.
