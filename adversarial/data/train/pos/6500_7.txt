Never has I left a restaurant where I like the food and left completely unsatisfied. I ordered the tandoori chicken and my girlfriend had the tiger prawns. I got 5 small peices of chicken that were more bone than meet for $13 and she got 7 modest shrimp for $14. The menu said it came with a salad, not sure if they meant the small garnish on the plate or if they just failed to bring us salads. I can only expect that they wanted us to fill ourselves up on rice and naan, but I left hungry.\n\nThe food was delicious, but portions were small for an expensive price. Place was empty and staff seemed bored and uninterested in customers. All that and being tucked away, I do not expect this restaurant to last. We were in agreement that we would never go back.
