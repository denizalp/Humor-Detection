Went here on Monday (actually next door at Bruno Mali's) for the hip hop night, and it was sick.  About 50 or so people in the smallish space. Cheap drinks, edgy urban art sale (lot of Che paintings), early 90s hip hop (think A Tribe Called Quest) , freestyling, and an eclectic crowd sum it up here.  Check out the cute blondie mastering the turntables....damn!
