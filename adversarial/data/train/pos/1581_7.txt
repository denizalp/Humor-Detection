Pretty sweet place. We walked around it after we ate dinner. They just opened like a week ago. They have all sorts of stuff, paintings, very large animal statues, chandeliers, glass vases, tables, living room furniture, just to name a few I remembered.\n\nShop owner was really nice and chatted us up.
