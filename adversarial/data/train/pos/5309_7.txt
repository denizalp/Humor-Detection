I Always hit this place for after hours in Las Vegas.   Still going strong after many years.     Good music, stiffly poured drinks, and 'cool' peeps.\n\n  It's pricey, but I definitely recommend getting a table.  This way, you will be able to access both dance rooms (hip hop & house), take a break and have a place to sit after getting busy, and meet new and interesting 'party' people.   \n\n  Once again, it gets expensive.....but hey, you came to Las Vegas to blow your money and leave with a smile on your face!
