SO EFFING FAR FROM TORONTO!\n\nI trekked nearly 2 hours in snow over maybe 3 diff transportation authorities (TO's, Brampton's, some others...)\n\nPoutine there SUCKED! No, I take that back More like:\n1st bite: um, good?\n2nd bite: hm... kinda good.\n3rd bite: mm, this is GOOD!\n4th bite: hm. kinda salty.\n5th bite: meh. this sucks. \n*throws in trash*\n\nGot me a churro con dulce de leche from one of the latin vendors selling empanadas, arroz, etc. Wait a sec... this is CANADA.  Wtf is going... \nOh. One of the biggest bachateros in the world are playing in an hour.\nAlmost forgot.\n\nWas sooo close to sneaking backstage. Would've if I didn't want to be deported before I got to make out with my Romeo. Sooo nassty ;)\nInstead, snuck from nearly the worst seats available to the BEST (1st section, 5th row, stage left!!) at the insistence of this awesome Seating lady. Afterall, was there anyone else out of the thousands who traveled over 11 hours to see Aventura?? Didn't think so.\n\nTook amazing photos (check my profile and the ones here), got a drumstick at shows end, told Henry  that I came 12 hrs to see them, and that \"quiro un beso para mi cupleanos!\"--I want a birthday kiss, and he blew me one, to which I yelled, \"No! Para (from) Romeo!\"  Romeo = sexy lead singer who ALWAYS brings girls up on stage to kiss...except *that* show. :( :( :(\n\n Wasn't sure how to get back so late so good thing I made friends there who drove me back to my doorstep in Toronto...and for free! (that's a $70 cab ride btw)\n\nThanks Powerade for having Aventura during my trip! I wouldn't have seen them otherwise as it was the day before the very last show date! I hear Daddy Yankee is next?! :D
