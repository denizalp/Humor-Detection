I want, no not want, NEED to get a Brown Bag Sandwiches T-shirt if such a thing exists.  If it doesn't I'll have to pitch them on the idea.  I can safely say that my affinity for T-shirts for places, people or things that I like has been somewhat of an obsession over the years, but I save this compulsion for only the decidedly deserved and BBS is more than deserving.  \n\nThis is a place that you immediately feel at home in., No one will judge you if the guac or chipotle aioli from the delectable Fried Chicken Sandwich slides down your chin, because chances are the person sitting across from you suffers from a similar affliction.  The sandwiches are so good here that you will literally drool as they are being created before your very eyes.  \n\nThe fried chicken and guac sandwich is a killer combo.  The chicken is tender and moist and the guac has a zippy kick which is complimented perfectly by pairing it with the crispy house made chips.  And is even better when washed down with Coke in a bottle.  YES COKE IN A BOTTLE!!  They do most things on site here, including homemade ketchup and smoked bacon.  And they are not afraid to experiment with things that may not be typically associated with standard sandwich fare, such as  house cured pork belly with charred tomato relish and salmon with maple syrup sandwhiches.  And although I have yet to try these two, know that I will, and you dear Yelpers should too.\n\nSo if you happen to see a man strolling somewhere in the Annex, or just loitering outside BBS donning a tee with a familiar brown bag emblazoned across the front, chances are I was successful in my pitch.  This is a shirt I will inevitably wear with pride and hope that they consider me on any subsequent merchandising kick backs.  I won't take any form of monetary compensation though,  I will only accept payment in snadwhich form.
