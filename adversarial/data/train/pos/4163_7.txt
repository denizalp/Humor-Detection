I gave New Look a second opportunity after upper management reached out and wanted to redeem my repeatedly unfortunate first experience. \n\nThe manager, Paul, went above and beyond in more than one way to apologize for my experience and make things right. It was evident how remorseful they were about the situation and wanted to ensure I wasn't left with a two star impression of their business. By going the extra mile after my initial repair was complete, I felt genuinely valued as a customer and know my concerns ultimately didn't fall on deaf ears. \n\nI wholeheartedly feel they redeemed my previous experience and would definitely choose their shop for any future work as the workmanship has proven to be excellent quality. While I hope I don't NEED their services again any time soon, if I do, I'll hope to update to a 5 Star with improved customer service from the whole New Look team.
