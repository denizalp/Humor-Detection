Very upset. I bought a leather jacket and when I got home, I noticed the security tag was still on! Like you would've expected the sales associate to have it already removed. Now I have to go out of my way back to the store. Seriously, what a bummer!! I also dislike their customer service, they're not quite helpful and I would like it if they smile more. Like c'mon..you work in sales! There was only one girl that went above and beyond for me last time..too bad she wasn't there today to help me. #sad
