Applewood Pet Resort - What a wash! \n\nI have been going to Applewood for about 2 years now and my dog has loved it for boarding.  The grooming has been a bit of a struggle but until today i was pretty satisfied with the experience.  The past couple of times I have taken my dog in for cuts i have been not totally happy with the cut, but explained to them what i would like differently, tipped them and continued to return because the experience was  more positive then negative. A younger man out front had encouraged me to bring her back, keep trying and was so friendly that i continued to return until today. \n\nI called to try to get her in for a groom and they told me her groomer did not want to groom my dog anymore and that i would probably be happier elsewhere. While this is probably true i was totally shocked to be turned away, no discussion with the groomer, a manager, nothing.  I asked to speak with the manager who had nothing to say except that the groomers managed there own business and could make such decisions on their own.  Also that they did not speak English so it would all probably be lost in translation any way. \n\nAs a local business woman, I understand that relationships and how you treat people is everything. I wish Applewood all the best with their attitude and management style.  I am sure exactly what they put out will come back to them.  Luckily there are so many great new grooming spots in the area.  I can't wait to try them out and find my dog a stylish new look!
