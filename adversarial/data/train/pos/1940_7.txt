First visit and definitely not my last. Glad I did my homework though because what could have been a VERY expensive visit ended up not being so bad. \n\nThe slides and kids' area is well staffed although a tad bit micromanaged. I get it because safety MUST be a priority but there is a fine line that must be hard to dance around. We went in the middle of the week and the lines weren't terrible, but as the day wore on, it got pretty crowded. The Lazy River is a bit TOO lazy for my taste, but the wave pool is fun and the little kids' play area is just right for a variety of age groups. \n\nHere are the tips I was given to make W-n-W a fun visit that won't break the bank. \n\n1) Get there early so you can get a spot in the shade. This is critical because well...Arizona is hot. (duh)\n\n2) Pack your own lunch in a cooler to leave in your car. When you want to eat, go out to the car and enjoy a picnic lunch there. This saved me AT LEAST $100 because food is RIDICULOUSLY expensive. \n\n3) You CAN bring in sealed water bottles to the park. Sippy cups have to be empty so unless you are breastfeeding, don't expect your little ones to have their juices or anything like that brought in.\n\n4) WEAR FLIP FLOPS or AQUA SOCKS. The ground is searing and when you are waiting to get on some of these slides, your feet will melt off--literally-if you aren't wearing shoes. \n\n5) Save-Around guide has discount coupons if you're only going once and Luke AFB has discounts for Vets and current military. However, if you are planning to go multiple times this summer, the summer pass is worth it. \n\n6) Only bring in what you absolutely need. Lockers are pricey and if you buy your tickets online, you won't even need to bring in your wallet and can lock it in the trunk of your car. \n\n7) Sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen. Oh and sunscreen.
