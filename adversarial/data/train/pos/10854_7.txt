edc is always a blur for me... and that's the way i like it... :D\n\nWith a crowd of 180k+, you know you're going to have a great time.\n\nEDC is like Halloween during june.  Almost everyone is dressed up and girls are in their usual slutty costumes.  Cute backpacks all over the place.  LED lights everywhere you look.  Free rides open for anyone to enjoy.  Bleacher seats to sit down. random art installations for you to look at.  A vast land to roam around in and get lost to the visuals and music.\n\nEDC always brings out the biggest EDM djs and the greatest sets.  You will not be disappointed.   \n\nThe only huge con is the massive lines to get into the venue, get food, get water or use the bathrooms.  It's a complete cluster fuck inside.  Since it's so crowded, they sometimes close off the main field. oh, and they rape your ass with water prices.  wtf.  5 bucks for a bottle.  \n\nPS: do not come here if you are a prude.  You will see a copious amount of drugs and sex going on inside the place....
