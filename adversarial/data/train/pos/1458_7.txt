I remember staying at this hotel back when it was the Aladdin, and when it became PH, I was a bit curious how they integrated the \"Aladdin\" theme into their overall space, because they didn't change the Miracle Mile shops or their buffet, which is still named \"Spice Market.\"\n\nWe finally had the chance this past weekend to stay, since it was one of the more reasonably priced hotels for a trip on a whim, and it was a great location - super central, close to the Cosmopolitan (where we like to eat and drink), Paris (more eating) and Aria (even more eating).  Husband booked us a Strip-view room, and we were in the north tower on the 37th floor.\n\nGreat views - we were directly across from the Cosmo and could see (and hear) the Bellagio fountains.  However, the amazingness of the room pretty much stops there.\n\n-The bathrooms were outdated\n-We had a nice little accumulation of dust on the side tables (and even after housecleaning came by, they were still dusty), and the entertainment unit\/shelving looked pretty tired\n-There wasn't much of a theme to the room, basically one or two posters of old movies\n-Saturday night there was this strange whooshing sound around our window - it did that every few minutes for about an hour, then went away\n-The worst part was when I turned on the sink Saturday night and no hot water came out.  I waited a few minutes, then gave up and continued to brush my teeth.  The next morning, still no hot water (just from the sink, the shower was fine).  We told the front desk upon checking out, so hopefully they went and checked it out.\n\nBasically stay at PH for the location and price, as it's cheaper than Cosmo and Aria but still near shopping and good food.  But for a nicer, more modern stay, go to Aria or Cosmo.
