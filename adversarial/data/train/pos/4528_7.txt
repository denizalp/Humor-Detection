It does not even deserve one star. The owner thinks you should kiss his feet as you enter his establishment. He did not have half the menu available and what he had was overpriced over salted garbage. I will never go to this Restraunt again. I have never given a one star to a Restraunt this gets a negative one star. Don't waste your money or your time.
