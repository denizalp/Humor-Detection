This place sucks, man.  From the 45 cents they charge you for a debit transaction fee, to the crazies who howl and bark at each other outside, to the woman wearing sandals with bloody scabs on her feet complaining about how she can't get the buy 1 get 1 promo for Monster Energy Drinks on two entire cases of them.\n\nThe one cashier who has a beard and looks like Zach Galifianakis after 16 years of meth abuse is a fucking asshole.  \n\nThis place is just a hotbed of horrid human behavior and the worst kind of depression will strangle you and take you down after coming here to buy anything, whether it be a Choco-Taco or a tall can.  One time I stepped outside and these three meth-people were all listening to another meth-head guy talk and one of the inane ramblings I heard were, \"My name?  It means prophet.  It means I'm a prophet.\"  Prophet of what?  Crazy Town?  waaahwaaaahhhhhh\n\nNo, I seriously hate this place because they charge you to use your card and it's no longer the 1990's, the guy with a beard is a dick and overall it's just a terrible place to go in a terrible location in Tempe.  I don't know why the tweakers feel comfortable here and not the Circle K across University, but I'm glad they found one place and stuck to it, because I will go through another light to avoid this place like a squirrel infected with black death.
