Oh god! Worst store ever. I just moved to this area and thought it would be a good idea to go grocery shopping after 11 pm big mistake. Tweeters and homeless people abound! Not to mention sickly looking homeless people who may be in desperate need of medical attention. Looks like UMC on the fourth or something. Please stay away. Not to mention ONLY SELF CHECKOUT. NO REGULAR LANES!!!  Screw that. I don't need to be looking up the codes for parsley and such. I don't work there, the convenience of self checkout, makes for a longer shopping visit with much anguish.
