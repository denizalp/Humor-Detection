Good food (when they get your order correct)  HORRIBLE customer service.\n\nWe have been ordering from them for that past year or so, and almost every time, something had to be wrong with the order.  At first we didn't complain, but after a while, I started getting annoyed that I was paying and TIPPING for missing items, or items made the wrong way.\n\nLast month there was an issue with an eggplant parm SUB that came as a meal over pasta, and when we called in, they wanted the meal back.  Not an issue, but we thought it weird, because I thought that once food passed the counter that they could not take it back.  I could be wrong. So don't beat me up, but I mention it because I thought it was odd.  \n\nTwo weeks ago we order a sub with no oil and vinegar and one with.  Don't you know the order was reversed and the the one which was to have no O\/V had it and the other which was meant to have it didn't.  Called up, got a credit.\n\nToday, A LARGE sub that was ordered came as a SMALL, and absolutely plain.  When we called to complain, their excuse was that the order was read back to us when it was placed and we agreed to what was repeated.  Which we did, because the order was repeated back to us CORRECTLY, but was MADE wrong.\n\nThe food isn't bad (again if they get it right)  but not the kind of place I would recommend to people, since I really don't enjoy the headache of waiting on do-overs or paying for something they mess up and refuse to replace.  The attitude of the manager I spoke with today.  Confirmed my decision to not order from them again.  Not worth the time or money.
