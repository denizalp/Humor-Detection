My Overview- I went there with my boyfriends for a couple of drinks before we actually went out for the night. Not really sure what to expect, we were very surprised to see how cool and \"ultra\" it was , from the out side it reminds me of a basic everyday hotel but stepping inside its like walking into a hip vegas hotel. As I spend a lot of time at The W in Scottsdale , it reminded me of a sister to it! So we checked out the place , nice furniture , patio with fire, whoo hooo! BE sure to order the Bubbletini ! We had such a good time we ended up staying the whole night! Awesome times!\nHidden fun  that I hope people discover!
