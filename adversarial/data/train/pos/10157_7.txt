The kids had  fun, however there was a spat with one of the new guys. Kids are kids. Treat them fairly.  Don't let the other kids cut while my 2 were waiting for the bungee contraption. Then tell me he didn't see them there.  That put a damper in the adults fun,  but the kids didn't know any better. Chris C. I believe was awesome! Taught my kids how to flip and to jump high.  He alone gets 5 stars.  And did i mention how rude the pringles looking man was? Sir i asked you for 2 wrist bands for my kids.  I don't need you telling me it can't hold me because I'm not under 7. Just do what I, consumer, asked you for.  My next visit, i probably won't go back.  And by the way,  there isn't a dress policy? Since when little girls in short shorts and half tops\/sports bras was legal? That's not the place fault,  but still you need a shirt little girl to jump.  That is all
