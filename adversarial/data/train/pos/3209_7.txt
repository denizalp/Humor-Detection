If there was only a way to rate the W zero stars...\n\nI attend gatherings at the W essentially when I'm compelled by friends. I've now been several times, and I'm now at the point where if I do go, I will do my best not to give them a dime of my money. \n\nPretentious is the theme here. The W is a souped up Westin with dim lighting and DJ Douchebag spinning his iTunes library -- why do they require six bouncers and two sets of velvet ropes just to enter the bar?  \n\nThe last time I was there was a rainy wednesday. I arrived at 5PM to meet friends from out of town (who were hotel guests) for a drink. The roof deck bar was empty.  The pool (next to the bar) was empty.  After spending a wad of money on drinks and food, I left to walk my friend to her room, intending to be back in 5 minutes to hang out with some other friends.  Upon my return, I was denied entry by the bouncer who declared my attire as a \"dress code violation.\" Apparently, you cannot wear shorts by the pool, in the summer. Keep in mind I was OK five minutes prior, but the sun was descending in Arizona and I was no longer welcome.  \n\nThe bouncer allowed me to say goodbye to my friends, and then escorted me out like a criminal.  The bouncer actually apologized to me, but claimed there was nothing he could do unless I changed into pants.\n\nI wasn't going to write this review, but I wrote a sincere, cordial letter to the hotel's General Manager and received no reply. This was four months ago.  \n\nI was back at the W last night for an event -- this time I was intentionally the designated driver.  They charged me $3 for a club soda.  \n\nWhomever runs the W needs to step down from the ivory tower and take a business class or two.  Customer service is more important than bottle service.
