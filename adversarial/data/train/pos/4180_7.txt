I came here with my daughter to get her passport renewed. Yes, this is one of the place in Charlotte who does passport renew and I think it's best if you make an appointment. However you can do a walk-in as well but just be sure to come early because the line is long before they open up. \n\nThe service here is same as any other government agency where you don't see a smiling face but they do a good job of getting your work done. They needed different type of copy done so they were helpful enough to let me use the copy machine in their office (I paid for it) and I didn't loose a spot in that big line. \n\nAgain, if you are doing a walk-in make sure to come in early because line gets long pretty quick. \n\nGood luck ya'll
