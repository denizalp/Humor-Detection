How does this place got 4 stars? I don't get it! \n\nThe service is horrible. The host seem like she doesn't even like to be working there. She has an attitude N don't even look at you when she greeted. Anyway that is not the reason why I gave them 1 star. The food, omg, is not good at all. \nI know its Caribbean fusion; however their sushi roll is so dried. Ramen soup is lack of flavor. It's just spicy that was it. \n\nIt is so over price!
