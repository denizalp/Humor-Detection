The food was okay; average quality that you can get anywhere. Came in at 2:50 for the 20% at 3pm, and they made us wait for the deal. When we came back we paid for the buffet, and most of the options were not refilled. Then the employees were very rude and snobby. Afterwards, I got food poisoning, called to get a refund, and was promised $30 back. My husband went to get the refund, and they only gave him $10 back. I will never go here again. There are way better places to spend my money
