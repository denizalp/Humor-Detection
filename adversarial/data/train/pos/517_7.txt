No thank you. This was the worst service that we've ever received.\n\nDO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!\n\nI REPEAT...\n\nDO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!!\n\nTHIS IS A HORROR STORY!\n\nWe contacted them about a promotion that we received in the mail. We booked two double-bed rooms over the phone. We were really excited about staying at this new hotel. We had heard that it was beautiful and lively. They gave us great customer service when we called. It sounded so awesome that even my brother and his family wanted to go! They asked if I can call and book one more room.\n\nSo I called and asked to try and see if we can book one more double-bed room. They said they were more than happy to book one more double-bed room! We just had to pay an extra 30$. Great. \"Will the rooms be close to each other?\" No because the other two rooms are single-bed rooms. Hmmm...that's not what we booked and what the sales girl told me. So they told me that I had to pay an extra 30$ per room for the double bed. Fine. I'll pay it but I am not happy that I was misled to begin with. I want to talk to the girl who gave me the wrong information or her supervisor to file a complaint. If I hadn't called back and added the additional room I would have showed up with 8 adults and 1 infant with two beds only?\n\nWell, nobody ever called me back. Whatever. And I showed up with three parties. But we were informed that...we all had single bed-rooms?\n\nAll double bed-rooms in the hotel are booked. On December 28th? Tuesday? Really?\n\nNow I'm pissed.\n\nI want to raise hell! I want to talk to the manager! I want to talk to the salesperson who signed us up for the room. I want someone to make this right! I want double-beds so we don't have to sleep on the floor. The supervisor in-charge told us to sleep in our room that night and tomorrow they would contact us when rooms opened up.\n\nWell, as you could have guessed that never happened...\n\nI had over 15 people at that hotel! We slept there, ate there, and bathed there. We gambled there. We spent a lot of money there. And all I wanted was for someone to keep their promise and follow through. When I contacted the front office they said they had no record of any complaints and they would call us back if a double-bed room opened up...\n\nI doubt that.\n\nI asked for the general manager's name and they gave me her name and number. Awesome. So I ask a couple of people on the casino floor about the general manager and just kind of want to get an idea of what kind of person she was...\n\nAlison Lopez, General Manager.\n\nThey had never heard of her.\n\nThey had fooled me for what felt like the 100th time. I had NO peace of mind. I will never stay there again. I still am having trouble contacting any kind of management. Nobody can follow-up with their customers. For regular Vegas visitors, we have NEVER felt more disrespected. I'm still trying to contact Alison Lopez...no one knows who she is.\n\nFront desk girl name was Vanessa, second phone salesman was Alan, supervisor was Eva. All terrible and misleading.\n\nPlease do not stay at this hotel. And if you do, just call and verify your information. This was a NIGHTMARE.\n\nBy the way, we did not get any kind of housekeeping over 3 nights here. This was minimal compared to the other problems but still...
