Lets just say the girl who rung me up was Ghetto!\n\nI was running late to a Christmas party\/ gift exchange, walk in I go up to the counter. I asked for gift cards, not one word was said from the girl ringing me up. She points in two directions so I walk over to the other card swiper. I swipe she goes \"no\", pick one \"where is it?\" lol without a chance to look at the design she swipes the card for me.  I tell her \"have a good night!\" Cashier \"mmmmkdfodf, next!\" what? \n\n#FAIL
