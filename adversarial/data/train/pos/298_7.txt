Why do so many people in Pittsburgh love this place? The other day someone asked me... where's your favourite Vietnamese food? I told them that I didn't know which was my favourite, but I could tell you which was my least favourite: Tram's. \n\nI don't even care about the decor or seating etc. Usually the best Vietnamese comes from fairly sketchy looking joints. \n\nI had their \"Special\" noodle bowl which is their version of Bun thit nuong. It looked a mess. The spring rolls were cut up brutally and then everything was tossed in. Usually when you order this at other place, it doesn't come \"pre-mixed.\" Honestly, it looked like someone had already starting eating this. I thought to myself... \"Okay they have a different presentation style.\" \n\nBut as I ate, I was even more disappointed. They hardly put any fresh vegetables in it, and the vermicelli is overcooked. The spring rolls were completely soggy. \n\nI don't think their menu is limited though, it seemed fairly typical. I don't know, maybe their Pho is better, but I'm already too disappointed to come back.\n\nAfter reading other people's reviews and trying other Vietnamese places around the city and then having Vietnamese food in Toronto(at an average place), I'm throughly convinced that people in this city have no idea what Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like.\n\nOh and one last thing... do you actually believe that their food is vegetarian? I guess the joke's on you.
