I came out for dinner last night and had the deluxe quesadilla. My friend (10 year old Layla) had the 3 soft shell tacos, refried beans and rice. The queso was an excellent decision and Meg came around to refill our chips before we ran out. Everything was delicious - but let's talk about our server Meg for a second. She was awesome! Super friendly, energetic and helpful. Not once did we have to ask for anything, she was on top of extra napkins, drink refills and drinks to go! Meg really made our visit wonderful, and I highly recommend her. She bumped it up from 4 stars to 5 stars.
