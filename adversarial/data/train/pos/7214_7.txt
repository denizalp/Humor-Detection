Absolutely with no Doubts I say that this place DOESN'T DESERVE any better review than just a 1* on Yelp.\nTheir Ramen is AWFUL! \nIt's so messed up that you can barely put up with the smell! It's INSANELY FAT! I'll attach a picture of Tonkotsu Ramen I've ordered and what happened to it 5 minutes after! The fat on top just doesn't look attractive at all.\nAs soon as we got our order ( me and my husband) we just looked at it, tried it and asked the waiter immediately to change the order because he first of all should have said that they make ramen out of boiled fat, not broth ( otherwise there is no chance the broth would look like that). We try ramen everywhere we go and that's like over 25+ places in the past year and we have never had anything that much disgusting. We tried to handle it politely, since we didn't eat it and ask them either to cancel the order or to replace it with a light broth. \nYou know what they did?!?!\n\nThey replaced just one order! It's like \"YOU GUYS CHOOSE YOURSELF WHO's GONNA STARVE AND WHO'S GONNA EAT, BUT YOU ARE PAYING FOR BOTH MEALS, EVEN THOUGH YOU EAT JUST ONE\". This is insane! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!\nSo we just paid for the stuff and went away. \nYOU CANNOT MAKE THE SITUATION MORE RIDICULOUS THAN IT IS!\nAnd by the way, I lived in Japan for over a year and I know what the real ramen is.\nThe owner can convince me all day long that he've spend two years in Japan learning how to make Ramen, but you know what? He is a TERRIBLE STUDENT then.\nWorst place ever.
