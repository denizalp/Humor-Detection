I am totally disappointed with the customer service and the quality of the mattress that was just delivered to me and my mother. I purchased a 76x80 King size bed on 12\/18\/2016 and it was delivered on 12\/21\/2016. Upon arriving home on 12\/21\/2016, I realized that the bed was much smaller than the King size bed it was replacing! Being a six foot one and a half inch woman, accuracy and dimension is very important to me. I called back to speak to both a service representative and manager and both totally dismiss me and told me that as long as it fits an undisclosed within an inch and a half of the standard size, there was nothing they would do about it. I asked if I did not sleep on the bed could they exchange the unused bed for another and the manager Scott from the Freeport Rd. location said \"It's not there problem!\"  Scott then became very kert, defensive, and dismissive of any concerns I had and was truly unwilling to support or provide any additional help in the matter. He was only willing to sent out a service call yo prove that the size of the bed was not an issue they were willing to fix.  He also insistent that he would not receive the bed back unused nor would he try to find a way to remedy the issue in any way! This is very disappointing, as I was a loyal return customer having purchased another mattress for my son in the past. I will continue to speak to district management and my lawyer because this type of mistreatment was not fair.   Never purchase a bed from this organization. Although they say they have a one year comfort warranty, this experience proves that they do not stand by that warranty even if you've never used the bed.
