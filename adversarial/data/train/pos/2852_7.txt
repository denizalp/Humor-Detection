After my initial frustrating experience and subsequent negative review, the owner, Kurt, reached out to me personally and genuinely apologized. I think you can tell more about the quality and integrity of a business by how they treat an unsatisfied customer than by how they treat a satisfied one, and I greatly appreciate that the owner himself reached out to both me and my husband personally, over the phone, and wanted to discuss what happened and truly wanted to make it right. That's awesome.
