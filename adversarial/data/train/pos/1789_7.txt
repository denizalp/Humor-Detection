I always thought Tasti D Lite was a frozen yogurt joint... and it very well may be one, but this location seems like a grab & go\/one-stop shop for all your needs. \n\nNeed a Vegas souvenir? Looking for a quick bite to eat before the movies but you don't want to go to a sit-down place? Need to sneak in some booze to the theatre, or maybe just some soda? Check, check, aaaand CHECK!\n\nLocated next to the candy store, across from Yard House, and under the theatre, I suspect this place's purpose is to help people purchase items to sneak inside the theatre for a cheaper price haha.\n\nOne side of it seems to have food -- with yes, a frozen yogurt selection along with some crepes -- but also more solid food like hot dogs, nachos, sandwiches, wraps, and omelets.\n\nThe other side is a convenience store type of deal where you can purchase something to drink (beer, soda, water, juice). There's also small bag of chips along with \"Vegas\" keychains, bottle openers, tumblers -- you name it! You can put Mexican candies, bottles of wine, and random miscellaneous items to that list.\n\nI would say this is like the \"gas station store\" to Town Square. Tourists, come visit if you really need a souvenir! Locals, come and buy your soda here instead of the overpriced theatre soda!
