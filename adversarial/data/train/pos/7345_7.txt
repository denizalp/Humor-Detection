I have to say \"OH MY GOD!\" when I walked into The Little Dollhouse Company...... \n\nThis is a dream shop for all those that are obsessed with miniature and dollhouse. I know... I am not the obsessed one, but my sister who is really into dollhouse and I know how excited if she can browse and get ideas of how to decorate her own \"little\" dream house. \n\nTheir online website is really nicely done with all the items they carries and pricing... \n\nAnd for me, just admiring and dreaming one day I will have a real house just like one of those doll houses....
