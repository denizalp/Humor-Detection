So, since the D-Backs were losing 10-0 in the 4th inning on this particular night, the hubby and I decided to spend the rest of the game sitting at the bar in Friday's.  It wasn't too busy so service was good.  We shared both some boneless buffalo wings and a chicken club sandwich.  The wings were decent but the sandwich really had no flavor...not a big surprise for a chain restaurant.  Overall, this location is what you'd expect from a typical bar and grill, but with a fantastic view of the field and stadium.  I'd love to return and get tickets for one of the tables overlooking the game.
