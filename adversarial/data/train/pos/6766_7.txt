For Las Vegas, this is a fun and casual place to go to. It is in the Linq area across from the giant pink flamingo statue. I came here twice during my vegas weekend trip. Once was at night around 1pm when this places turns into a club with a mix of hispanic and hip hop music, we sat outside so we were able to eat food since we had just got off the plane about a hour ago. It was fun in that we felt the club vibe but still able to order food and drinks. The beers were around 7-9 bucks and drinks were around 9-15 bucks. The pear cider that I wanted was out so I opted for a sangria instead, which whooooo turned out strong and delicious! Our group also ordered the fish tacos and carnitas tacos, both orders come with rice and beans. \n\nOur second visit was in the morning for breakfast. Around 10am, it was fairly busy but with no wait. The chayo breakfast for two suited us perfectly for $26 bucks. The only thing I would NOT recommend at all is the freshly squeezed Orange juice. That thing is a joke! It was 5 bucks for a small glass full of ice and watered down orange juice. The salsa here though was great, a little bit of a kick and chunky, just like how good salsa should be!
