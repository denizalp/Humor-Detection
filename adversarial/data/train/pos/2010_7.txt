5 stars because this is the BEST facial spa I've ever been to in the past many times I've been to a Facial spa. Jane actually tries to figure out what could be the cause to your acne and she tries to fix it. She doesn't force you to buy a bunch of products the first time you visit either. She gave me these lists of what could be clogging my pores (like ingredients in face products) and what foods aren't good and what foods are and etc. so at least I know where to start with clearing my face up.\nThe cleanliness I would give 5\/5 and the interior as well 5\/5. She has books in the front if you're waiting you can read up on some interesting topics about life lol \nThe pricing id say it's about $$ but it's not too bad. \nI'd definitely recommend her to everyone because she's absolutely the best and she's really nice too and works fast but also does her best job!
