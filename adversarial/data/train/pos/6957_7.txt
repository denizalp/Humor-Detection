WTF?!?! \n\nThe menu claims everything is prepared fresh, which I'm sure it is, back at the restaurant supply distributor where they order from. If that's not bulk GFS or Sam's Club Salsa, then I'm Donald Trump and you should elect me for president. \n\nThen came the entree. I ordered a beef burrito with refried beans and rice. The rice was cold to the touch, the refried beans were the consistency of spackle with a crust of paint chips  (and also cold). The burrito shell was doughy and elastic, and the shredded beef filling inside was lukewarm to the touch, and had zero seasoning. There was also a little container of black liquidy stuff on my plate which looked like it was wrung out of a dirt mop in the deep sink of the janitor closet. There were some chunks of stuff in it, but I don't know wtf it was, and I didn't want to find out. Since I was starving, I dug out my bland shredded beef from the cold husk of dough that resembled a burrito shell and picked at that while I watched my table companions politely nibble at their equally cold and bland entrees. Someone at the table ordered a \"sangria\", which we determined must have been cranberry and apple juice with a splash of maybe Boone's Farm wine. I had a Dos Equiis Amber, which came with a little lime wedge, which was by far the most flavorful food item I received all evening.\n\nIt was crowded and loud in there, so I guess the locals must come here just to get sloshed on margaritas before heading out to Taco Bell for a superior Mexican dining experience. This must be what prison food is like. If that's the case, it should be enough of a deterrent to scare anyone straight. \n\nBleh.
