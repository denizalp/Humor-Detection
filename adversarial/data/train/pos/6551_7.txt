I've been to several auto shops around town, with and without the help of my mechanically gifted father. \n\nNo matter the service or repair, big or small, will I choose another shop than this one. \n\nI am not the most car savvy gal, but I'm savvy when it comes to tapping into resources when I'm not sure what something means. Never have the ladies and gentlemen at this shop ever tried to over sell me on anything.\n\nTheir pricing is consistent, and their customer service is awesome. They are always patient with explaining charges, and cut me deals where they can.\n\nAlso, check out Groupon, where there are always deals on oil changes and alignments.
