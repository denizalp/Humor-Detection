Remember the Carter Administration? Yeah, I do too, and I was reminded of it walking through this dump.\n\nIt's hard to believe that the Riv was once Dean Martin's home turf - what the hell happened?\n\nThis whole end of the Strip is extremely depressing: meth heads lurking about, various other shady characters (think People of Wal-Mart parts 1,2, and 4!) and this was during the day, my friends. \n\nMy friend's grandmother used to stay here all the time; she's been comped rooms here since the 70's, which was probably the last time the ash trays were emptied. I made a quick trip up here, just for nostalgia sake, and beat a path for the door as soon as I got a Bloody Mary in hand.  The bartender was very friendly and the drink strong (reason for the extra star). There's a lingering sadness about the place, one of better days, like taking a trip to Versailles.\n\nVisiting the Riviera is like watching your dog die.  I, for one, won't shed a tear when this puppy is finally put to sleep.
