so glad this place entered into my life\n\nfirst off, great atmosphere. feels almost like i am grabbing a bite to eat in my sweet little grandma's house who just happens to brew her own beer and have a pizza oven\n\nwhen you order food, use your mouth to say these words: \"please give me the Fico Pizza\"\n\nBurrata, truffle oil, fig sauce and arugula. i don't understand it. i don't question it. i just eat it and life loves me for it. seriously the best pizza I've had in the valley. \n\nnot to mention, the service was attentive and welcoming. these guys really do it right. support them and they will support you with love in the form of food\n\noh yeah and their beer is sensational
