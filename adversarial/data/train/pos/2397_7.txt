I wasn't completely sure what to expect when I went to the Heard Museum, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed myself.  We were there for almost 2.5 hours and the time flew by.  The permanent exhibit was laid out nicely and I truly learned quite a bit that I did not know previously about Native Americans.  In fact, I had no clue how many different tribes call Arizona and New Mexico home and reading the history and how they are now was quite fascinating, but I am a history nerd. The Remix contemporary exhibt was well-done and was my favorite portion of the whole museum, but I'm a sucker for contemporary art and installations.  We even wondered about the \"children's area\" and that was also well done with a variety of hands on crafts and activities for little peanuts (heck, my husband and I even did some of them! hehe).   The boarding school exhibit on the second floor was very nicely done and well laid out...the testimonials that played while you walked around were quite touching and at times I felt myself tearing up.\n\nAdult admission is $10 and students are only $5. My husband forgot his ASU student ID and when he mentioned it to the cashier, the guy was like, \"oh that's OK\" and gave us the student admission anyway. Very nice.  There were quite a few people at Heard while we were there, but I never felt rushed or that I was in someone's way, which I think speaks highly of the layout.  I definitely recommend the museum if you have an afternoon you are looking to fill and\/or just want to learn more about Native Americans.
