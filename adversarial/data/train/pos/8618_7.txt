Great service, great atmosphere and great food!  I absolutely love their bruschetta. Very good assortment of bruschetta choices and fresh ingredients. Today I indulged in dessert and ordered their chocolate lava cake (it was called boushon or something like that). That was pretty awesome. It was very good and light. They don't overdo it in the portion size of dessert. Just enough. The music isn't loud but I find myself m singing to many great songs.
