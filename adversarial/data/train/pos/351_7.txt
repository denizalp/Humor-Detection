I invited a group of colleagues here after work for happy hour following a stressful day. We sat in the lounge and had to specifically ask for the lounge menu with tapas portions and discounted wines, which is a pet peeve. I shouldn't have to be \"in the know\" to get your menu, either offer it or don't. The service was lackluster throughout but the food quality was good enough that I'm planning a group visit here with some wine-loving friends. \n\nLounge menu is limited but has a good variety, and we tried most of it. As for wines, I had a decent merlot and a great African red, which paired well with my meal. The mushroom bruschetta was so good that we shared two orders. Other standouts include the grilled octopus and the porchetta, though the latter wasn't quite what we were expecting. The crab cakes, margherita flatbread, and sausage skewers were just okay. Their meat, cheese, and wines seem to be what is most popular here.\n\nOur server wasn't around much and when he was, affected an overly friendly touchy-feely persona that was off putting. After having to hunt down the lounge menu, we were brought one copy for a table of four. My boss was billed for the wrong wine, to the tune of double the price, and the resolution was poorly handled and implied she was at fault. Needless to say, no one I invited wants to go back, which reflects poorly on me and now requires me to recruit an entirely different friend group to revisit despite genuinely wanting to try more of their menu.
