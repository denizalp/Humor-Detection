Literally THE WORST KBBQ EVER. Lee was the rudest server I've never ever encountered. She didn't ask all the patrons at the table what they wanted to drink and was just really cold and treated us as if we were prisoners. She constantly watched over us as if we were going to steal something and was literally standing behind us watching us eat. \n\nShe only came by twice to ask if we were ok, never offered refills, and if we asked for anything she made is seem as though we were asking for the world. \n\nOn the menu it says free ice cream or soda with Yelp check in. When I advised Lee about this she stated it's only if I leave a positive \"good\" review. I was a little bothered by that because that's not how Yelp works. I advised I would go ahead and leave a review and she wanted to see it. So I firstly wrote the other review, because I promised the little guy we were with some ice cream. Though truly this place deserves less than 1 star. \n\nThe WORST part, besides being treated like trash, is that they charged us for INFANTS because she saw \"the baby eat a leaf of lettuce and a few pieces of rice\" Our party was 4 adults, 2 infants, and a 2 year old (who we had to pay $11 for even though they don't charge for 2 year olds) they put an auto grateful of $17 because there were more than 6 PEOPLE. They stated the infants counted because of said lettuce eating. When we asked about this, the servers LOUDLY argued with us and wouldn't take the grat off. Lee did not deserve $17. She barely deserved anything maybe the cockroach we saw on the floor. \n\nDO NOT COME HERE. IT'S JUST PUTRID AND THE PEOPLE ARE RUDE AF.
