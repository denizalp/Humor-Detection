this will be my third review on bulwark and unfortunately I have went from a four star satisfaction down to just one.\n\nI had hired Bulwark a year ago to treat my home every other month and only had one problem which I had mentioned in a previous review (being told only once my side gate was locked after a few services). Because of that review, one of the people in charge of the company had called me personally to ask me to delete the review because it was causing them to loose business, but I refused.\n\nnow for the reasoning as to my one star review.\nA couple of months back I kept receiving phone calls from a number not programmed into my phone so I never answered, and whoever it was never left a message. Well one time my husband was using my phone and saw the number and asked who called since all other numbers had names. Told him I wasnt sure but whoever it was called a few times and never left a message.\n\nHe called the number back and a man answered. He asked who it was and the man on the phone was hesitant to answer. He asked if he knew who I was and gave him my name. The man claimed to not know me. I took the phone and asked what his name was. he said 'max'. I asked if he knew me because he had called a few times. He repeatedly denied any knowledge of who I was or how I was called and said that maybe a friend called.\n\nas this situation just looks FANTASTIC from my husbands point of view, this 'max' acted like a fool and played the innocent role. I asked him if he worked for a pest control company (because the day before he FIRST called, bulwark had called and left a message), and he said he didnt, and that he did personal security. \n\nTotally confused on why he or his 'friend' called me so many times without leaving a message, the man created some super fun problems and false accusations in my marriage.\n\na day or two later, \nthis 'Max' had talked to my husband again and thats when all things started to come together. He suddenly DID claim to work for a pest control company. funny, just a couple days ago when i flat out asked him he denied it. so what happened within the last 48 hours? hmm, suspicious. The next surprising thing was that 'Max' was able to describe in detail (while trying to buddy up to my husband mind you) that he knew who he was talking to and described him as the 'tattooed cuban' and even described the location and set up of our home. \n\nWOW!\nare you FREAKIN kidding me? within 48 hours you went from not having a CLUE who you or your so call 'friend' had called now suddenly you can describe in detail my husbands look AND my house?\ndo you realize how much stress you have caused? do you realize the problems you created? the situation you put me in? OH MY GOD!\n\nFinding it odd that all of this was happening,\nmy husband called the company directly to speak to a customer service rep. He had asked if it was company policy that customers are contacted from personal cellphones. the rep responded 'absolutely not.'\n\nso, what was this mans plan exactly?\ntake my phone number from the database, save it and call me from his personal cellphone KNOWING I was married aaaaand, what..?\n\nhow UNPROFESSIONAL that one, this man called me from a personal cell phone, two, that he LIED about not knowing who I was, and three, tried to buddy up with my husband after all the stuff he made up.\n\nafter all that was said and done,\nbulwark is no longer my pest control company.\n\nsorry this was so long,\nbut I think potential customers should be aware of how unprofessional this company ended up being.\n\ndont bother calling me,\nthe answer is no, \ni will not remove my review.
