Not sure at this age I can give any club 5 stars, but XS was def the most extreme of the 3 I visited this weekend: longest lines, most expensive cover (for the guys $30), largest space, most crowded, most dance poles, most chill staff, most places to sit, least stuffy, shortest dresses, highest heels, most panties flashed!
