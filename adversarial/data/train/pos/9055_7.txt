Quick Stop For An Ad Deal\n\nI don't do too much shopping and haven't really bought much in the way of new guns in a long time. I stopped in because they had an ad going for what looked to be some sort of coded boat carrier group with an ammo deal for only $119. I got there and it was just a five speed standard boat carrier, so the deal is it really bad but it wasn't what I was looking for.\n\nThe staff was friendly and greet you when you walk in the door. I feel like it's a pretty large facility that doesn't have an awful lot inside. It would seem hard to make any money off of such a small inventory.\n\nOther than that, it seems like they have decent prices and it would be a good local resource for anybody that lives in the area.
