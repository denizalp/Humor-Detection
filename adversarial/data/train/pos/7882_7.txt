Papa Murphy's I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! Why did you have to open this location so close to my house? Your pizzas are so much better than everyone else's that I can't help myself. This means I now have to walk extra long every day to even attempt to lose weight! Even your \"De-lite\" thin crust pizzas are so good. Thin crust? So what! I end up eating more slices. Your stuffed pizzas are ridiculously tasty. I'm going to have your pizza crust tested for habit forming drugs! .\n\nUntil next time Papa Murphy's Pizza on Stephanie!
