The lovely Phoenix CM, Gabi K http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_details?userid=dIIKEfOgo0KqUfGQvGikPg organized a UYE while I was in town, and it happened to be at the Vino Lounge at Tapino restaurant. The restaurant itself is really big, with a cool bar and interesting wine rack designs throughout. The Vino Lounge itself is an area located on the outdoor patio with low, modern seating and white, sheer, free-flowing drapery that blocks out the bright sun. We sat down around 6pm just in time to enjoy the beautiful sunset. We were able to enjoy the 5\/5\/5 happy hour menu for the first hour we were there and I ordered a glass of their Malbec, and we ordered a few things off of the food menu: lobster corn dogs and pomme frite. I agree with Stevey P, the lobster corn dogs were super disappointing but the fries were good. Later I tried their version of sangria....ummm....not so much. First of all, sangria should not be served in a martini glass, just my opinion. Secondly, sangria is all about the fruit, and there was simply no fruit in my drink except for the garnish. Still hungry and interested in what other small plates they had to offer, we ordered some manchego that came with a spread of quince paste (yum!) and almonds. Very nice! I also ordered the selection of warm olives and I have to say I'm not used to warm olives but they were pretty good. I thought that overall the quality of the food and presentation were excellent, however the portions were really, really tiny. I mean I understand the small plates concept, but c'mon!  Our waitress, January, was super helpful and filled us in on some random local trivia, and that was that Scottsdale tap water is ranked among the top 3 best drinking waters. Two bottled waters among them. Damn! That's some quality drinking water!
