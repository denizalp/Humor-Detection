We had a great time this Sunday. \n\nWe rode every ride they had several of them over and over again without having to get out of our seats. All the rides were fun, clean and seemed well maintained. \n\nThe staff was generally all pretty cool. They didn't seem to over love their jobs but who would. \n\nThe price seemed a bit high but we used a coupon to get $5 off each full day pass and it was only $87 for 4 of us. Not TOO much more then seeing a 3D movie but lasts ALOT longer.
