Don't get duped by expensive mini bars in the rooms of the hotels in Vegas, head over to one of the many ABC Store locations for all of your cocktail needs.  In addition to alcohol, they have everything else that you'll need for your trip like souvenirs, snacks, toiletries, t-shirts, and at great prices.  I made many visits to this store during my stay, there is just nothing that they don't have.  This location was just a short walk from the MGM, but they also have stores in the malls and other areas.
