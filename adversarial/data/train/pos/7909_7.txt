This is my perfect restaurant, food is decadent and unbelievably delicious. We had dinner last May and I still remember what we had and how phenomenal it was. I also liked that the decor is casual, so you can just release the fat kid in you and go to town. \n\nAn absolute must, unless you hate life.
