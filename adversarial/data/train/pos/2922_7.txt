This is one of the best hotels I've ever had the pleasure of staying at. I would describe the whole vibes as urban rustic with a sprinkle of chic. The hotel seems to take on the personality of Pittsburgh, and it was done very well. I'm pretty sure this hotel is still new. My room looked as if no more than 3 guests had there previously. I had a not-so-great view of 376\/The Parkway but if you looked just beyond the highway peaking out of the trees was the Cathedral of Learning. \n\nNothing in my hotel room shouted traditional in any sense. From the hardwood flooring to the glass bathroom barn door to the caged nightstand lamps, the urban rustic feel was alive. The bathroom was gorgeous and spacious. The showerhead sprayed like rain. The backlighting to the mirror was perfect. \n\nMy room was on the 6th floor with a fitness room that was pretty well-sized and a patio. The patio had it's view as well, overlooking the Monanagahela River. Beautiful to say the least! From the service to the lobby to the spacious rooms, this hotel is perfect. The only thing that is slightly odd is the entrance to the driveway in front and the very slim parking. There is a paid lot to the side of the hotel. The Pittsburgh Technology Center is still being built up so it was still rather empty in my opinion, but one day, this place is going to be bustling. \n\nI was originally supposed to be book another hotel but so so glad I got to experience this one. 5 stars recommend all the way!
