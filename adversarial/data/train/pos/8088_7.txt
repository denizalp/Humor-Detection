We started with the Fried Gyoza ($4.50); it's standard Japanese-style dumplings. It was fine, but I probably wouldn't order it again.\n\nJapanese curry with Chicken Katsu is one of my all-time favorite dishes. This one was a little disappointing. I had the Chicken Katsu Curry w\/ Brown Rice ($8.95). I was really pleased that brown rice was an option with no additional cost. The katsu was decent. The curry itself is what I wasn't really feeling.  The consistency and everything else about this dish was great, but the flavor wasn't what I like (or expect) in Japanese curry. It wasn't bad, but not what I want.\n\nAlso, I was really peeved that Fukujinzuke or any type of Japanese pickled vegetables were NOT set on the table or offered with your meal. I had to ask two servers because the first one seemed to have forgotten and we waited for some time. When we finally received it, they had only brought one dish for two of us. Although rather stingy, I thought one was standard for the table until I saw the party across from us had THREE things of pickled vegetables (and two types) for three people. Totally lame. What's Japanese curry without Fukujinzuke?!\n\nEverything about this place made me feel like I wasn't in a Japanese curry house. Besides the menu. The menu looks great and the options are fun and vast. The curry flavor, missing or shortage of wonderful pickled vegetables, and lackluster service made me leave feeling sad and disappointed.
