I love Gabes... this is the thrifty side of me talking.  Where else can you go and get American Eagle Jeans, yoga pants, converse socks, guess boots, NY&CO shirts, and a nine west purse all for under $100.00??? Actually I probably got more than that on my last trip... yea me! \n\nIf you aren't a patient shopper and don't mind paying full retail, by all means shop elsewhere.  This place will only frustrate you.  However if you are like me then just give yourself about 2-3 hours to browse so you can keep an eye out for bargains.  \n\nBe warned you may, actually you will run into an item you love just to discover a huge stain or a ripped seam or a missing button.  It happens, look for duplicates.  Also place isn't real clean continuing on with its frugal POV. Best advice...Try everything on before you purchase it...I mean EVERYTHING.  I have visually missed a broken zipper or a small hole in the arm, but upon trying it on, the flaw is quickly found.  Also they have a weird return policy so better off to play it safe...
