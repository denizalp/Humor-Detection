Last night was one of those nights where I felt entirely too unmotivated to actually leave my apartment in the pursuit of a meal. After a bit of searching, stumbled upon Edo. A Japanese restaurant that delivers? Heck yes.\n\nAfter waiting about an hour and a half for my food to somehow wander hopelessly across Madison to my door, we hungrily tore into our brown paper delivery bags.  my boyfriend and I were disappointed with the quality of food - especially considering it was on the pricier end.\n\nMy boyfriend reported that the gyoza were ok, however the chicken and steak hibachi came absolutely drowning in some vague, tasteless sort of sauce. Seriously. The tupperware container it came in was half full of some grayish sort of horrible hibachi stew that was miraculously flavorless. Unfortunately, the blandness somehow permeated the meat - how can you make FLAVORLESS MEAT?! :(\n\nI ordered the Spicy Tuna Bowl and a Spicy Tuna Crunch roll - unfortunately both came absolutely covered in tasteless, manufactured tempura flakes. These were not the crispy delicious tempura flakes that I have found at both Ginza and Takumi here in Madison, but rather the bland, crumbly white sort that you shake out of a can from the grocery store. Paste-flavored, gritty and disgusting. You couldn't even taste the tuna - or spicy mayo beneath the sea of absorbent, kitty litter tempura.\n\nThe spicy tuna bowl would have been a delicious idea - had it come with some sort of dressing that I could detect, had not been absolutely buried beneath the tasteless tempura grit and if the lettuce had not been of questionable quality at best.\n\nSave your money and your time - get out of the house and go find some real food.
