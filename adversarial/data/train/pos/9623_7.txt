I went to La Esquina at a time\/date that shall remain anonymous.\nLet's just say it was a Lunch that was worth the Hour(s) away from office-space.\nWhen was the last time you had Argentinian meal in Vaughan or York Region?\nPlease note:  I did attend during a SavourYork Prix Fixe.  Wise decision indeed.\n\nFirst thing was the space very brownish leather, wooden mid-scale chic decor.\nWhile I try to imagine the place hip-hop Salsa dancing on Wednesday nights.\nMy Friend sank into her comfy booth\/bench seats further with smile on her face.\nNot quite her $4.99 Lunch Specials, but this ~Spring SavourYork $15~ is pure value.\n\nWhen the Chimichurri came... Se√±or, Why did you give me Chinese Chili Oil?\nSo the waiter explained... Long story short. I only knew of one of many variants.\nThe one presented to us was an un-green version. I'm not Argentinian, OKAY? :P\nAlways a pleasure to eatducate and update my mental library.\n\nHumitas - Grinded Sweet Corn wrapped in a Banana Leaf\nSopa De La Abuela - Homemade Ground Beef Potato Soup [Enjoy]\nLa Esquina Steak - 8oz Sirloin Steak marinated in Argentinian Chimichurri\nCamarones Catalanes - Shrimp in Spicy Red Wine Tomato Sauce with Saffron Rice\nEmpanada de Queso- Cheese Pastry with Sprinkled Sugar\nFlan - Homemade Custard with Cream Cheese\n\nLa Esquina is deserving of a bookmark to experience a culture's cuisine.\nOne that's not common place in the Greater Toronto Area with pleasant space.\nPlease note: Non-promotional prices are slighlty pricier as you may expect.
