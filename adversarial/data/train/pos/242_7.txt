Small little salon. I ended up here, because it was the only place I could find that was open on July 4th. I need a quick under arm wax, and they did a good job. Took me with no appointment, after I called to let them know I was on the way (actually to see if they were open) \nThe girl did a great job, it lasted longer than I expected. I was in and out in about 15 minutes.\n\nI'd definitely go back.
