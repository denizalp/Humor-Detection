Absolutely won't be back. This is one of the worst Indian \"restaurants\" I have ever been to. I eat a lot of this cuisine across the country and this was an effrontery.  The navrattan korma was frozen vegetables in Velveeta cheese sauce. I'm disgusted. It was even the same color. \n\nThese people should not be trusted to cook for you. They have air fresheners on the walls spurting chemicals at you while you eat!  I asked about it and the guy said it was to cover up the bad smells!  I asked what bad smell and didn't get an answer. It should smell like delicious Indian food not whatever was loaded in these units. \n\nI heard they're owned by Mintt and the cakes are made there. I'm wondering what else isn't made here.
