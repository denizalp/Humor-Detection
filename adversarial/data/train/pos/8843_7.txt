I love this Mitchell's location because you can see the magic of ice-cream making happen right in front of you in their kitchen. This is the main location in Cleveland's Ohio City neighbourhood. It is Mitchell's official ice-cream kitchen shop. This location is HUGE but still has a very inviting feeling. There is an upstairs area are as well for additional seating.\n\nI came here such a long time ago that I forgot what I ordered. Whatever I got, it was yummy. I even remember trying the flavour that my friend got and she loved it too. You can sample flavours as you decide on which one you'll get. \n\nThere is also a Rocky River location as well which I have gotten ice-cream from there too.\n\n****\nThis is my 129th Yelp review overall. \n83 reviews for 2018.\nI am aiming for 100 reviews in 2018.\nReviewed on 28 June 2018.
