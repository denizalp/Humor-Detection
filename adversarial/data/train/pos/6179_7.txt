This place was super fancy and I'm talking pinky out for sure! Decided to check it out with a few friends that were also in town and we were super impressed. In a place like Vegas it takes a special spot to really stick out and leave an impression and this place does it for sure. Now you definitely are going to be paying a \"view tax\" or the beautiful and amazing views of the strip but honestly it's probably worth it. \n\nI'd also like to mention that all the cocktails we tried were beyond amazing and the staff was super polite and accommodating. Kudos team, and I'd recommend giving this place a try for a nightcap or date night.
