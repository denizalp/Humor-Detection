I went here for the third time now since the shop was opened and let me tell you they've really improved!  The owners are the same owners as Green Tea cafe and I am always a fan of their Curry Pork Katsu.  \n\nMy first visit was the week they opened (thumbs down) and 2 weeks later the owner of FAMU (the next door butcher shop) told me they've improved so I went for second (....nahhhh) and Finally i went back there again last week (a year or so later) and saw some improvements.  \n\nThe Menu have changed to include a bigger selection of dishes (Which i really think they shouldn't as most Ramen Shops you find in japan concentrates and serves only ramen and Gyoza.  The result---pretty damn good ramen!!)  but I guess the owner has to suit the North American \"taste\" where it's not about the quality of food but rather the quantity and options and the ability to make choices, create your own combo BS. (ok...enough of my bs)  \n\nDespite my previous disappointments, the owner have really improved on the ramen... no way can you compare it to Japan..but pretty damn close!\n\nPS.  Nite time always attract 20 - 30 something \"cool\" HK \"Kids\" dressed to impress in a $10 ramen shop.  Go at lunch time if you don't want to lose  your appetite.
