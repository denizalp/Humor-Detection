Yes, I am writing this... But when on a Bachelorette party, this is the place to go for some eye candy.  You don't see much, but they did bring the bride to be on stage and give her some extra love.  And, during one of their cheesy singing numbers when referencing that men all love boobs, about half of them pointed to me in the 2nd row.  :)  And, the hottest dancer ripped off his white undershirt and threw it to me in the audience.  I nearly fainted.  Plus, they come by the lounge after and sign autographs, take pictures, and chat.  The man who sent me his tshirt, stopped to chat with me. So sweet!  :)
