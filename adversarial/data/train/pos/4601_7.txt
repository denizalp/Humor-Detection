My review of this restaurant may not be wholly accurate of the general experience one night have at Gojo as I went with a large group and we had our own buffet that we each paid 20$ for. Regardless, I got to try many different dishes (I'm sure I wouldn't have had the variety with a smaller group), and they all were so good! We had a chicken dish, a lamb dish, yellow lentils, Brown lentils, potatoes, spicy greens, etc etc... Not a single bite was bad! The injera bread was perfect for eating all the different dishes. I would love to return to experience Gojo as a small group and plan to in the near future!
