Food so beautiful it seduced me before my first bite. Rarely do I take time to note presentation, but the plates here are so meticulously crafted it would be a disservice to the chef to not recognize. From chips and salsa that come with mini-bowls of seasoned salts to a taco plate delivered with four separate saucers artfully displaying the ingredients, everything looks immaculate. Even better, it tastes as good as it looks. \n\nThis was my second visit to Diego, and granted, on my first visit I had ordered a fruit salad that was good but not a substantial enough experience to judge the restaurant. On this visit, I decided to go for heartier Mexican fare and ordered the skirt steak tacos. \n\nAlthough I was not sure of the best way to administer the selection of signature seasoned salts onto the basket of chips, I really loved the creative touch. The salsas were delicious, and the salts provided a fun way to experiment with the flavors. \n\nThe tacos were amazing. I would order them again without hesitation. The ingredients are delivered separately, so you are able to construct your own tacos. I love this because the tortillas do not get soggy, and you can customize the tacos to your exact personal preference. The steak was tender and cooked perfectly. And, although, I am not eating a lot of rice these days, their rice was worth cheating. It bursts with interesting flavors. \n\nMy husband's steak looked amazing, and given the average price of a steak on the Strip, it was also a great deal. He loved it. \n\nAnd for the booze-lovers, they have an amazing tequila list. \n\nGiven the attention to detail, I actually find it hard to imagine that anything would be less than tasty. We will be back!
