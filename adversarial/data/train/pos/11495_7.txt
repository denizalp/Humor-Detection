Makers & Finders makes a lavender latte and it is fabulous. I've had it iced and hot. I've taken it to go, I've had it in the restaurant, either way it is delicious, refreshing, and made perfectly every time.\n\nThis cute little restaurant\/coffee shop is located on Main Street, south of Charleston, so it is a little ways off from the many restaurant openings of Fremont. This makes the restaurant a nice retreat in the Downtown area. \n\nAs for food I have had the Chicken Tinga Empanads which are awesome. Perfectly fried with succulent, spiced chicken inside, served with a small bed of lettuce. I have also had their tomato bisque soup, which is creamy and bursting with flavor.\n\nI will miss Makers & Finders for sure. I hope I can find an equivalent when I move to Texas.
