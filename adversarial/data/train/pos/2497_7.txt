By far the freshest AYCE in town! I can't tell you how excited I am that this place is close to my work. I have a new favorite AYCE sushi place! \n\nI visited on a Friday afternoon around 2:30 and they weren't very busy. The waitress was very friendly and took my order right away. I never once had to ask for a refill on my drink, the service was beyond efficient. The sushi chef recommended some nigiri and came through with some amazing selections. I tried the following: scallop, salmon, white tuna, ahi tuna, and cajun albacore. Every bite of the nigiri was delicate, fresh and savory. I ordered a couple of rolls which were executed perfectly: volcano roll and a spicy crab hand roll. The sides I ordered were: dynamite, shrimp tempura and green mussels. Everything was delicious. I was amazed at how wonderful every bite of food was.
