I don't own a boat and I don't get out on the water much but I figured I would step into this store and see what it was all about. A helpful clerk asked if he could assist but I was just browsing.\n\nIt's like Autozone but for boats. Lots of spare parts and accessories from propellers to hoses and wires and connectors. A bunch of swimwear such as suits and shirts and hats. A large selection of inflatable and rigid boats like kayaks.\n\nIf you do need boating supplies, here's the spot.
