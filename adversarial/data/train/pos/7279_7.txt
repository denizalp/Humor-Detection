I'm only giving this four stars because I'm comparing it to other shows such as O and Le Reve but if I didn't know any better, it would have given five stars! \n\nThis is a really good show with lots of acrobats and fight sequences.  Get ready to have your mind blown when the stage raises and rotates! There's an Asian influence in this show with dragons and fight scenes.  It's definitely more of a story and the show flows more than the usual Cirque show with a bunch of amazing circus acts, interrupted by French clowns.  I fucking hate clowns.
