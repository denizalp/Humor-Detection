Fantastic tacos that are worth the wait!\n\nEach taco is tiny but full of flavor. Be sure to buy a set of three--you get a small discount, and since the tacos are small, it's the right portion. Each taco has 2 flour tortillas (fresh off the griddle) and you can select which tacos you want. It's not \"make your own taco\", but that's not a bad thing as the flavor combinations are great. Each order does take a while as they are prepared to order.\n\nFavorites: spicy sweet potato (the only spicy one out of the bunch) and savory pork.\n\nIn addition, the horchata is awesome.  It is super rich and creamy (btw, it is not vegan--it has rice milk and dairy) so it's somewhat akin to a liquidy rice pudding.  A bottle of sauce is available for your tacos as well, but it's not a hot sauce as it has more of a vinegar base.\n\nThe line was long shortly after opening, so if you're planning to get these tacos--be the first in line to try them!
