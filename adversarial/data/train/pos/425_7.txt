This is the second Vig restaurant I have tried and I enjoyed both experiences.\n\nThis Vig is well situated to downtown yet in a less well traveled area. You shouldn't have to worry about the sound of heavy trucks disturbing your meal.\n\nThere are distinct areas where you can be seated to eat. You can sit at the bar and enjoy whatever is on the TVs above the bar. You can sit in the bar where there are a few booths for a sports bar experience. You can also sit outside if the weather is agreeable. You can sit in the restaurant area for a more traditional dining experience.\n\nThe menu is not too extensive so it should be easy for you to decide what you want to eat. I ordered a hamburger and a bowl of pozole, the highly recommended chili side. An excellent choice. All the food seems to be very tasty. Their roasted Brussels sprouts are awesome.\n\nThey have a full bar and their happy hour is a great deal if you are a wine drinker as you get a 9 ounce pour for the price of a 6 ounce pour.\n\nTry out the Vig and enjoy a fun meal.
