Went here for dinner and I love their sashimi and sushi -delectably fresh with wonderful (almost blissful) seafood sweetness, and the texture another sweet surrender.  No miss in having any fishy after-taste.\n \nI'm so close to giving them 4 stars (for a fine dining Japanese restaurant) but the setbacks would be the mediocre rolls and, I may have been too hungry but, the amount of rice in the sushi was noticeably too little.  The menu looks satisfying yet, should I say, humdrum.   \n\nOverall, I`m not too impressed but I would go for another visit as friends who`ve been here say some good stuff about the other items.  \n\nThe Asian transitional classic interior and ambient lighting makes this big place a lovely and intimate venue for groups and families with young kids, without undermining romantic dates.  \n\nGotta try that sushi bar - its is really inviting for another visit.  Service was excellent: quick, nice, and friendly; frequently checking on us and always just-in-time for our requests.  \n\nIf you`re looking for good food and a pretty impressive venue, you can add this to your list.  ;)
