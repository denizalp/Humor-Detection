I'm a pretty experienced ice cream eater, and after my many years of eating ice cream, this is my new favorite place. Great ice cream, delicious cone that complements the ice cream, and great service!\n\nI tried the thai tea, french toast, pumpkin pie, sweet potato pie, and salted caramel. And these are the most accurate flavors I have ever had. The french toast actually tastes like french toast! I felt like I was at brunch, except I was actually eating ice cream. And they even added maple syrup on top of the scoop! I thought it was a nice touch. With the thai tea flavor, they also added condensed milk on top. Each ice cream flavor here is truly perfection. Creamy and flavorful. And the flavors actually taste like what they say they are! Also, the array of flavors here are vast and original. I have never seen a sweet potato pie flavor! And it is exactly what sweet potato pie would taste like too.\n\nThe cone here was also beautifully crafted. They are made in house and go well with the ice cream.\n\nOutside, there is seating with cute lights. And there's a mural of an ice cream cone too! (Very IG-able)\n\nAlso, the staff here are very friendly, and didn't get irritated by my sampling. They even offered me more samples after I had ordered my ice cream! They never seemed annoyed or anything.
