I've been working out at this gym for about two and a half years now and I was introduced to it by my trainer Fred, who is an exceptional trainer and comes highly recommended. They have a deal with a free week trial right now with one free trainer session. Take advantage of this opportunity! Despite the recent turmoil in regard to the ownership the dust has now settled and things are running smoothly once again. The first thing one notices when pulling up to the gym is the plentiful and spacious parking. The facilities are new and up to date. The front desk staff is courteous and alert. The refrigerator is always well stocked. The equipment is for the most part in great condition if not brand new. The equipment is cleaned daily by the staff and the bathrooms\/lockers are well maintained. An upgrade in the tv department would be a welcome change. Overall the gym is good and well worth a membership!
