Do you like loyalty-card programs?  Do you like massages?  If you like both, then I have some great news for you!!\n\nEver since I started getting weekly massages at SWIHA in June '08, I've taken advantage of their \"buy four, get one free\" program.  An hour of massage by an LMT (licensed massage therapist) costs $45.  With the loyalty program, an hour costs only $36!  (If you elect for a student therapist, the costs are even lower, but health insurance, at least mine, won't cover them.)  I really like the fact that the time allotments are at 30-minute increments- I started out with one-hour sessions (first two visits), but then I tried a 90-minute session and was hooked!  (So far, I've only found one therapist here who's willing to give two-hour sessions.)  But I digress!\n\nAs of Jan. 15th, $160 will buy you 5 hours of massage w\/ an LMT, or $32 per hour!  Hmm... I just checked their website and just found out that this price will increase to $200 ($20 markup, from the original $180), presumably on April 2nd.
