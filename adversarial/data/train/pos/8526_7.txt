I don't go to Olive Garden often but when I do, I only go for one thing. And that one thing is the chicken gnocchi soup! \n\nWe ate dinner here during the week and it wasn't busy. We were seated right away by the hostess and dropped off our menus as well. \n\nOur server came over right away and took our drink orders. We had made it right before 5pm so we still had time to order off their early dinner special. We could pick an entree and unlimited soup or salad for $8.99.\n\nI ended up ordering the grilled chicken parmigiana and my friend ordered the fettuccini Alfredo. We also ordered a spinach dip and two soups. I started out with chicken gnocchi and she ordered the zuppa toscana. \n\nMy soup was great as always and the breadsticks were delicious. My grilled chicken parmigiana did not look at all grilled but instead it looked like the regular breaded one. Maybe the waiter didn't hear me right? Who knows. \n\nThe dip itself was delicious though but we did not like the chips it's served with. Ours were hard and felt reheated so they didn't taste so well. \n\nOur server was attentive at first but then it would take him some time to come back to our table. We sat around a couple of times wanting more soup, drinks, and breadsticks, and he would just disappear... then we'd have to wave him down. \n\nI will be back again though when I'm craving some more of that chicken gnocchi souppppppp!
