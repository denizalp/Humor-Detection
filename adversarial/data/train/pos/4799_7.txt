I was pretty hammered one night from gambling at the Luxor so I wanted something greasy. We went to Ri Ra since it was close and wanted greasy fish. I ended up drinking like 5 more black and tans so I my judgement was not the best. Of course my dumb arse saw the Guinness store while stumbling out and thought man I could sure some t-shirts with a black beer on the front. I bought a cup, a cup I mind you, for $50. Granted it is a cool cup. I asked the clerk why this cup was so much and she said \"because it's made of pewter\". I say out loud \"what the f__ is pewter!?\". She must of thought I was an ass. Anyways I bought the cup along with a Guinness fedora that looks like shyte on me. Yay Vegas!!!
