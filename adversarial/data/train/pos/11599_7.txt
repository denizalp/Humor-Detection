Well my wife and I tried the Pizza Hut down Mcknight which was a disaster. Thinking that the one in Wexford might have better service and food, we went a bit out of our way to get carry out here. \n\nGranted it was peak time on a Friday, the service was terrible. It was impossible to get them on the phone and once I got there, I found out why. Easily 8 people were waiting for their carry out orders. One lady had been standing there for an hour. No one was answering the phones. I watched two people cancel their orders. Only after threatening to cancel mine after waiting 30 minutes did I receive it. Staffing was a clear issue here. The food was good and definitely better than the Pizza Hut down the road but the slow service left a bitter taste in my mouth. With all the other pizza options in the region, I have no plans to return to any of the PH locations in the area.
