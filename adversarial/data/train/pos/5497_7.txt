Here's the thing about Hungry Howies...it's cheap.  The pizza isn't great, but it isn't bad either.  It falls into that weird in-between zone where you still order it, but at the same time you know there are many better places to get some pie. \n\nIn college, my best friend\/roommate and I probably had Howie's on speed dial.  And somehow, every now and then, we used to be able to talk them into delivering us a free pizza.  I still don't know how we did it.  \n\nBut when we did have to pay, it would never cost much.  They always had these great combos for around $10 that came with a large pizza, Howie bread and a liter of soda, not too shabby.\n\nIf I had a Hungry Howies close to me, I'd probably still order from them when I want decent pizza at a cheap price.
