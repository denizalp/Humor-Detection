Sunil!\nThat's how this review has to start. He brought the flavours, the humour and the celebration even with our picky, confused and probably frustrating tribe. The menu is diverse enough to please even the most uncertain Indian food newbie and traditional enough to appeal to the true foodie (self defined of course). We had to wait - the restaurant lacks sufficient parking and speed. Perhaps due to the demand of the patrons and the desire for REAL food rather than fast food? I wish we had slowed our dive into our delightfully presented edibles because had we you would be viewing colourful choice dishes of vegetarian curry, butter chicken, scrumptious paneer, prawn korma, and garlic naan - served up classically in copper (?) dishes so beautifully you could practically smell the spices through the photos. Oh and I must not soon forget the triple heat of the chicken entree one of our party enjoyed. A jug of water unsolicited (but definitely wanted) and an unexpected birthday treat complete with song made this a special night and a special place. I recommend you visit, soon, and I further recommend you make reservations and say \"hi\" to Sunil. He is worth the drive - even from the SE!
