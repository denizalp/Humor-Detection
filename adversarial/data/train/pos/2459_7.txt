Like that 1980s Wendy's commercial, I was thinking \"Where's the Chicken?\" the whole time I was here. While their pasta dishes were ordinary, the lingering thought throughout the dinner was where's their signature dish - the rotisserie chicken?  Granted, the penne with red sauce and sausage was my favorite of the two, it wasn't exactly stellar or distinctive.\n\nI'll preface this by writing that my experience here wasn't exactly typical.  I appreciated the comped pre-theater dinner buffet from Sonoma for the Yelp event at the Arizona Theatre Company, but I wasn't all that impressed.   I was looking forward to this place for the fact that it seems like a laid-back downtown lunch spot that actually stays open for dinner and given its reputation in California.  If they were looking to impress their guests, they should have \na) served their rotisserie chicken, at the very least, small samples and \nb) made sure we were the only comped buffet party there.\n\nThere were two comped parties there, btw, so if there was any hint of making guests feel special it was drowned by a \"We comp parties such as yourselves all the time\" message.  There was some confusion upon entering as there was no host.\n\nI thought the Caesar salad was probably the best food of the several dishes served, and while others at my table seemed to like it, I'm not exactly eager to give it a second shot.\n\nFour stars for effort and potential, two stars for delivery.
