This place is AWESOME!  Aside from the fact that it's one of those rare-in-Vegas artsy-farsty bohemian hangout-type coffee shops, with bookshelves full o'crappy old paperbacks and lots of comfy seating...it also serves A*M*A*Z*I*N*G food! I had the \"Aliens Kidnapped a Burrito From the Middle East\" and it was nothing short of jaw-dropping! Crammed full of healthy shit like fresh spinach leaves, avocado, couscous and hummus...very hard to find quick, healthy eats like that, and it was only $5.99. \nI will DEFINITELY be spending more time here. It's become a destination thing for me -- if I ever happen to be in that part of town, I will make a point to go there. It was that good!! I can't say enough fabulous things about this place!!
