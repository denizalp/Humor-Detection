Yesterday will be the last time I bring my dog and cat here. I dropped them both off 20 minutes before appointment time.  They made sure to question if I knew what time my appointment was for since I was early.  I was told I would get a call when they were finished...about 2 hours after appointment time.  I don't live nearby so I stay in the area and do some shopping.  I haven't heard from them yet and it's been more than 2 hours so I go back thinking it will be any minute.  I also have my two kids in tow.  We arrive only to be told by the clearly annoyed at our presence groomer \"we said we would call. He (as in my dog) will be impossible to finish with you here\"...she than promptly shuts the doors to the back so we can't see anything.  The girl in the front says another 30 minutes.\n\nSo over 3 hours later they are finished.  I go back to get them.  My dogs fur is so short I don't even recognize him.  I told the groomer I didn't want his hair as short as the dogs they were working on when I dropped him off....she said it wouldn't be. I didn't feel like getting into at the store....nothing can be done to change it anyway.  I paid the bill and ever since regret not bypassing the tip option.  \n\nDuring previous visits I've felt that the groomer is a little condescending but this time the whole experience just turned me off.  We are the customer.  We are what keeps you in business.  There are lots of groomers in Calgary and I was going out of my way to bring them to Paw Spa.  Not anymore.
