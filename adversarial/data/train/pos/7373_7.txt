This the most inflexible gym ever. They would not even let my 10 year old daughter sit in their lounge area. There is a ridiculous alarm that goes off if you even set a weight down on the floor.I felt like i might injure myself trying not to set off the alarm.It is basically a gym that should be connected to a nursing home bc everyone who attends it is about 70.
