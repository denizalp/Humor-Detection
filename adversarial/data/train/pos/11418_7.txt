Is anyone else out there completely sick and tired of the plethora of Scottsdale restaurants serving mediocre food at hefty prices by an apathetic service staff???? ME TOO!!!  And that is why I am making the time in my crazy life to Yelp about a place that does everything right by their patrons.  Merci, at the risk of repeating myself, THANK YOU!!!! Thank you for taking the time to choose a soothing\/cozy decor. Thank you for the extremely high level of cleanliness. Thank you for hiring a staff that is not only friendly, but as my fianc√© put it \"You can just tell they are kind people.\" Natalie and Kat are absolutely the nicest, most down-to-earth service staff I have encountered in a very very long time.  Thank you to Duke, the owner\/chef for his dedication to his craft.  If you've ever seen \"Like Water For Chocolate\" you'll understand that you can actually taste the love he has for creating culinary excellence.   And Thank You for not charging appropriately for your amazing food!... I can actually afford to eat here. Yay!  This place has won my heart and has now become my \"Treat To Myself\" meal... You know the various scenarios; Bad day at work, Horrible menstrual cramps,  fight with your bf, zombie apocalypse nightmares... all the reasons you decide you want to be extra nice to yourself.  Merci is my new goto place which I am super happy about because my last \"Treat Myself\" restaurant is in Chicago... a mystical land far far away. \nSadly, the pictures I took of Merci are not loading properly. Sorry guys, go check it out for  yourselves!
