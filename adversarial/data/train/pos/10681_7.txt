Buyer beware, I talked to this guy, the owner of the so called company. Not even a business, works from the kitchen table of his rented home. Calls himself a marketing company with 10 employees. More or less a guy cold calling companies try to sell social media marketing etc. Everyone with a computer and a phone is doing the same thing. The 10 people who work for him are not even in the state of Nevada. Stay away from this scam company.  In my 5 minute call to James, I heard so much bullshit about marketing, code, data. I new it was crap due to what he was pitching he was making up with big words. This business is a scam.
