Dang, I'm a little surprised to see this place is barely pulling in three stars. I guess that shows you what a foodie I'm NOT. \n\nCame here for impromptu lunch w. a friend. Had a ham\/swiss panini. It was your typical sandwich press panini... really, nothing more than ham\/swiss toasted on mulitgrain bread and a salad w\/ a light vinaigrette. It was as promised - simple, but I was cool with that. We wanted a light-ish lunch so that we could shovel pie in our... pieholes after. The quiches LOOKED delish but unfortunately, I did not try one.\n\nMy friend ordered a key lime pie slice after having always wanted to try it. I ordered coconut cream and we split. The coconut cream was more of a large personal tart than a slice, and the slice of key lime was monstrous. As one other reviewer said, the crust was hard(ish) but I thought the pie was delish. The key lime was good, too, but would have preferred a trad. graham cracker or regular crust to the chocolate graham they made it with. Coconut cream was the winner; I'd holla at that one again for sure.\n\nI'm no pie afficionado. My grandma used to make killer ones, but as far as store\/restaurant bought goes, I eat them like once a year. I was fine with these pies, but what the heck do I know?\n\nAnd yes, it was pricey and the service was slow, but... I've sorta come to expect that with \"quaint\" small places in TO. \n\nOh, and the mint lemonade was mad refreshing.
