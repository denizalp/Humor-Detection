I do love a good curry. And that is what I got from Japanese Curry Zen today at lunch.\n\nI was seated right away in one of the few open tables. Its a small restaurant and it was pretty crowded. Not as bad as Monta Ramen across the parking lot but still a busy place.\n\nI ordered the chicken katsu curry which is apparently their best seller. I can understand why. Tender, crispy fried chicken, a big scoop of rice and a plate full of Japanese curry. Its hard to beat.\n\nI ordered my curry with a spice level of 3. It was perfect for me. I could maybe go as high as 4 but more spice than that might be too much. This was just right. It made my sinuses open up just enough. And it wasnt so spicy that I lost the taste of the actual curry. Japanese curry, to me, has a certain nuttiness that cuts through the pungent spice. Its not as sweet as say Thai red curry or panang curry. This is more savory. The thickness and color is reminiscent of Grandma's gravy on Thankgiving. It warms the soul.\n\nI would give Japanese Curry Zen another go in the future. I like curries of all varieties but Japanese curry stands out in my mind. When I am in the mood for a good curry away from an Indian or Thai restaurant, Curry Zen has my vote. Good food. Fast service.  Ok pricing.
