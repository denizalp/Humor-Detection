I've been a fan of Sakura since I started eating sushi about 10 years ago. Now that I've traveled a bit and managed to sample some of the best sushi around, Sakura still holds up as a very good establishment for the price, quality, and atmosphere.\n\nThe restaurant is situated, as many things are situated in Akron, in part of a strip mall next to an obnoxious family-style restaurant, formerly a steak house. Sakura itself is a kind of minimalist modern Asian-inspired place but not obnoxious or pretentious. They just set up a nice little seating area with places to sit and eat, and make it comfortable for everyone.\n\nThe menu contains a lot of mainstays in therms of maki rolls, special rolls, sashimi, bento boxes and so on, and there are a number of house specials included within. Every week, they have an additional board of new or special creations, as well. The quality of the ingredients is good and the presentation is quite nice. I've never had a bad meal at Sakura, though occasionally the rolls can be a little too salty... whether the salt is in the rice or the sauces, I'm not sure, but it doesn't detract from the taste too much. It could simply have been my selections last time that led to the salt-overload.\n\nLast, the service is normally quite good and very friendly. They not only tolerate but encourage me and my friends in our sake-bomb habit. I think, because of us, they actually added that to the menu.
