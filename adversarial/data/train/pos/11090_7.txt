I adore this tiny hot dog stand. \nIt's authentic, simple and beautiful in a city that's short on all three of those counts.\n\nFor $2.50 you can get an Especial which is a grilled dog loaded with avocado and pineapple. Sublimely delicious, and only 40 cents more than one measly taco at Taco El Gordo just up the street. \n\nForget TEG, go to Fernandez every time.
