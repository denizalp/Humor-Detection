Nope.\n\nWent there for \"brunch\" on a Sunday morning at 11. Granted, it is called a \"seafood brunch\" so you'd expect the usual suspects of spindly crab legs that are scooped up the second they're put out and the oysters on the shell that no one ever eats  (pretty sure they're safe just buying fake ones and trotting them out every day), and in that aspect there was no disappointment.\n\nProblem was, I came here expecting BRUNCH. And what exactly is brunch, kids? A blend of breakfast and lunch, you say? I thought so, too! But after a late Saturday night, this was a loooong drive across town to roll in and discover that they had not one breakfast item! I kid you not- not an egg, not a slice of bacon, no form of breakfast potatoes, muffins, danish - anything that could pass for breakfast.  The closest thing they had was a huge coiled intestine of some kind of sausage that did not look appetizing in the least.  I found some dried up biscuits but somehow they're not the same with brown gravy. And they did have some little crepe things on the dessert line (I was trying here, fellas), but they crumbled strangely under the fork and had to be made of what I can only assume was wallpaper paste. Yuck. Poo.  How do you advertise brunch and not throw out so much as a pan of scrambled eggs? \n\nThis was a long and winding road of silver dishes filled with absolutely nothing I wanted to eat. (Family members did timidly announce that the prime rib was ok, but knew better than to press the issue.) So if you don't feel like chow mein and lasagna for breakfast, you're basically spending like like $40 for a cup of coffee.\n\nMight as well just go to Starbucks.
