Cool, eclectic vibe right on Central. they have a nice little bar, but I particularly like the lounge area with the couch and pillows. If only pot were legal....but the should seriously considering offering Shisha here-they would make this place perfect. They have a very cool menu.... the lamb kisra is particularly fab! And overall a good atmosphere for drinking
