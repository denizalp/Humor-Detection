7\/6\/11\n\nArrived early for the OYE party at bld, so I decided to check out their happy hour.  It's a good thing I did, too, bec. the margarita I had here (priced $3 on the menu card, but I was charged $3.50) http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bld-chandler?select=-iHx38oezn6KQER2Aw8ytQ#-iHx38oezn6KQER2Aw8ytQ was one of the beverage highlights of the evening!  The meatball mac 'n cheese, however, needs a tweak-- while I enjoyed the mac 'n cheese portion of the dish, I found the meatballs and sauce to be too acidic. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bld-chandler?select=UFsIK9G_6MZxb-GvezRedA#UFsIK9G_6MZxb-GvezRedA  If I wasn't trying to slow down my body's absorption of alcohol (I'd just gotten a massage before, too, so circulation was revved up!), I wouldn't have eaten as much as did, and I left more than half in the bowl.\n\nStill, what I had tried was enough to keep my mind open for more happy hour adventures here.  Take a look at the interesting HH food menu!
