9\/2016\n\nLiving in Centennial Hills for almost 5 years we finally decided to get a dozen of donuts from here, you have to come early to get them real fresh!\n\nWe did not see what the hype was for this place.  Unless we bought the wrong donuts we did not think these were anything great. There was not enough jelly in the jelly donuts. We thought they were a bit too cakey and not real soft for being fresh.\nThe day we got them they were out of fritters which I really had my heart set on.\n\nI guess being a fan of Krispy Kreme it is very hard to match their donuts of being super delicious and soft.\n\n Maybe we just caught a off day! But for the price over $10.00 a doz they just didn't do the WOW thing. Neither one of us thought they were that great.\n\nNot a place we would recommend sorry it just did not do anything for us. *3 star for the place being clean and the staff being friendly.
