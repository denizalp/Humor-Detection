This place has an amazing selection and cheaper prices on hair than Hair Plus BUT I would recommend Hair Plus over this place because of the ambiance, customer service and free samples. \n\nThis place feels like I'm shopping at Costco. I did not like the feel of this place at all. \n\nThe guy didn't ask me if I needed help, he just told me that I was looking at braiding hair, as if I didn't know. He didn't offer to help me which was odd. I then had to hunt him down and ask him where stuff was. I asked him if he had cheaper braiding hair when I was checking out and instead of showing me where he points me in the direction! I didn't have to do that at Hair Plus, the lady walked with me to show me what I was looking for. Then when I asked for samples the lady did not give me any but instead pointed me to the overpriced ones. I did not ask for those samples I asked for the ones you should be giving to your customers. The companies provide those to the suppliers specifically for that. If I wanted to buy a sample I would have asked for those!\n\nI got the feeling that certain customers get better service so maybe I got the bad end of the stick. I had a much better customer service experience there and so they will get the majority of my business.
