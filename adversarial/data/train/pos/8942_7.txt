This may be the most convenient \"value hotel\" in Toronto.  Recently renovated, the ol' Day's Inn has had a welcome face lift.  It's lighter and brighter.  Still not the Royal York but not bad, especially if you can score an internet rate of 100 or less.  \nRooms are pretty quiet, considering the location.\nDownside is the new new renos didn't include the heating system.  No AC until April 1.  Too hot in the room? Open your window.  Yep, even in February.\n\nConvenience wise, however, it is right across the street from the College Subway station, a Tim's and two good grocery stores.  The Loblaws, next door, in the old Maple Leaf Gardens is amazing.  Great grocery store, snack bar, and in Canada's historic hockey mecca.\n\nAlso, has a Shoppers Drug Mart and a Bulk Barn nearby if you need pantyhose or macadamia nuts.
