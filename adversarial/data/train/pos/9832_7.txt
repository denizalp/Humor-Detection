So I originally reviewed this place 5 stars and I have since deleted that review and I won't ever be back. Sorry, Charlie! Let me begin by saying that I had a rough time with this place a few weeks back and I assumed that my experience was a result of a new bouncer that was trying desperately to display his newfound grip of authority. I brushed that night off and figured that I just picked a bad night. Whatever.\n\nA few weeks go by and my friend hits me up about showing her around downtown Phoenix for her 21st birthday. Valley Bar was our second stop after having one drink at a neighboring bar. We all get drinks and I begin showing them around the place. As we are walking around, one of the chicks stumbled on a cone. She didn't fall, nor did she spill her drink. She simply stumbled. None of us thought anything of it and we end up sitting at a table. A few minutes go by and someone comes up and grabs her by the arm and tells her that she has to leave. The group laughed thinking that they were joking around with the group of the birthday girl, so they continue hanging out. Maybe a minute goes by until a group of macho men eager for action come storming in absolutely terrifying these chicks. The group of chicks all saying, \"Relax! Relax! We will see ourselves out!\". One of the bouncers even apologized to us once we were outside saying that he realizes that none of us are intoxicated. So yea, we got kicked out because a clumsy chick tripped on a cone. I should mention that this was the first time at Valley Bar for all six of the people that I was showing around. Needless to say, none of these people will be back. \n\nMoral of the Story: Don't stumble as you walk through the Valley of the shadow of angry bouncers.
