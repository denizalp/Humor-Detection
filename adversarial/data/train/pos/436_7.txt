Zoes is a fast-casual Mediterranean-inspired food chain that has over 200 locations across the US. We've got quite a few locations here in the Valley. This one just opened in Chandler a couple years back and I finally was able to grab dinner here. Like most chains, they cater and deliver and you can order your food ahead of time online or at the kiosk. Prices are average compared to most fast-casual restaurants. We had a nice experience one early evening. The restaurant was pretty clean and it wasn't too busy. Zoes likes to promote the Mediterranean lifestyle of eating. Their menu consist of soups and sandwiches, pitas and piadinas, kabobs and bowl. I personally love the pita sandwiches and the power grain bowl. The power bowl has some of my favorites like lentils, quinoa, rice, tzatziki, cucumbers and dill. It's nice to have a Zoes in my neighborhood as they are a great place for lunch or a quiet dinner when I'm in the mood for a fresh and quick meal.
