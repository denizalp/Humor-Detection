It's as good as what you can get in the Midwest. Seriously, I'm a slider expert and could have a PhD in sliders. It's not Vegas food, but my sister misses White Castle, which is not available in Phoenix. \n\nCompared to other white castles, these were really good. We ordered 20 cheese sliders, fries and onion peels for three kids and three adults. Everything tasted fresh and hot but that could have been from the 110F heat traveling to the hotel room. \n\nIf this was a review for Vegas food in general, I'd rate it a 3, but these were damn good sliders.
