Conveniently located next to UNLV, always expect this location to be busy busy busy. I mean cmon, you've got a university full of people from the east coast who've never had In N Out before! \n\nThis location never fails me. They're always fast, nice, and clean. Also very accurate with my order (because I am needy). I usually get a number 2, with no onions, buns extra toasted, extra spread, extra tomato, chopped chilis, and the fries done light well (you know how they have flimsy fries, well this way they're a bit crispier, and not as hard as if you would order it extra crispy- that makes them either hard as rock or stiff like potato chips). Pink lemonade is a must! And ketchup with pepper mixed (and a splash of chili juice) is the way to go.\n\nUgh I'm drooling and craving once again.
