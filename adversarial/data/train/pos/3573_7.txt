When you walk in, be prepared to wade through a sea of Macbooks to the \"MacRegister\".   Pretty sure the term \"hipster\" originated as a password for PC users to get through the door here.   Atmosphere is half of the experience for the coffee shop lounger and though this place has zero personality, it's definitely neck-deep in \"trying too hard\".  \n \nAs far as the coffee goes, it was nothing exceptional.  However, I will give them credit for not burning the hell out of the espresso, which seems to be a popular trend these days.  The staff was also friendly which brings a 1 star rating up to a 2 because friendliness is just as important as quality when I'm giving my money to an establishment.\n\nPeeking through the reviews, I saw, \"free range, organic only, vodka marinated, all natural (american spirits only, thank you) smoked people to eat\" so if someone could cue me in on that, I might reconsider this place (yeah cannibalism) since there was nothing else spectacular enough to make me willing open that door again.
