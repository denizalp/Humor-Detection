staying at the marriott grand chateau was very pleasant. my party of six stayed comfortably in a 2br suite.  \n\nthis hotel is indeed intended for the older crowd. around 2am on a friday night, one of our neighbors ratted us out and told the front desk to tell us to keep it down.  which is strange since we occupied a 2br suite.  we were in the common room where there were empty bedroms on either side.  so are the walls really THAT thin that you can hear us a whole bedroom away or were you jealous that you werent working your way towards your own century club?\n\nwalking in and out of the hotel you'll see posters for the luxurious rooftop lounge, Sky Bar on the 38th floor, focusing on great drinks and awesome night views of the Vegas strip.  so up to the 38th floor we went for the midday happy hour.  we were eagerly discussing the shots and drinks we were going to order, oh liver, beware. \n\nout the elevators and through the double doors, there it was - 2 kiddie sized pools filled with all the grandmas and grandpas in their freckled leathery skin. um, what? upon further inspections, there were about 15 lounge chairs, and too many kids. where was the bar?! oh there it was... a cart sized bar station on the other end, where the only way to get to it is to walk right alongside the pool and risk slipping on the wet pool deck.  because we're alcoholics, we decided to move forward and get our drinks.  as the bartender was pouring our shots, i kindly asked her if this was the sky bar, in which she replied \"yup! that'll be $73\".. daaaaamn what kind of happy hour is this?!\n\nalso other items to note, they dont do room service, elevators are tricky to operate, and the complimentary valet service (as nice as it is) can take awhile getting your car, which isnt great if you're in a rush.  but this is definitely a family\/kid-friendly place to stay.
