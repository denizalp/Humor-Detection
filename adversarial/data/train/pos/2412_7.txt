In my ongoing struggle to find truly good Vietnamese food in Las Vegas, I finally made it out to the supposed best sandwich shop around. I ordered the Banh Mi Dac Biet (house special) and the Banh Mi Thit Nuong (grilled pork). Both were $3.25.\n\nI ate the Thit Nuong on the night of purchase, and I saved the Dac Biet for later. The latter held up nicely after a quick toast in the oven, which is a pretty standard result.\n\nI won't really go into too much detail on the sandwiches. The components taste nice and seem fresh, but I don't think there's enough meat, pickled veggies, cilantro, or even jalapeno. In other words, it's kinda like Subway but with fewer veggies. The overall result, unfortunately, is that the sandwiches are not very filling, and they leave you with bread as the main after-flavor.\n\nMaybe I'll check out some of the pate chaud or banh bao on the counters if I'm ever in the area again. Otherwise, I'm going to wait for something good from California (and no, Lee's Sandwiches does not count).
