Fucking Gross. \nSo I came here in 2006 and I really liked it back then it had more variety. I was very ardent to come back, knowing that this place was great. I asked, \" can I go walk around to see what is available?\" So I walk around and it looks clean as you can see I took some pictures.\n\nI then decided to stay. To my demise I regret. I went to get some food sat down and the first this that happend was there was a cock roach on my fucking table. I was so grossed out. \nAt this point I then decided to leave, I picked up and asked for a refund.\nShe was kind of hesitant to give it to me but I then explained that if I stayed I would around telling everybody about my experience. \nThere aren't enough words to describe how disgusting this is.\n I wouldn't even give it 1 star.
