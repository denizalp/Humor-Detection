It's so sad to read the reviews on Yelp for this dealership. \nFirst I want to say I've had nothing but great luck here. As with any car buying experience NO-ONE will be happy unless you are getting something for next to nothing??? That is just the way it is. When DVD's first came out they were $600+ now you can buy one at the grocery store for $40 hmm...\nWhen you have to get something like your car fixed that is just a pain in the neck, no-one budgets for that expense it's something you just don't want to pay EVER!!!\nI recently had to have some work done on my vehicle I took it in, and they handled everything that needed to be done in a timely manner. What they could run through the warranty they did, what they couldn't they did as inexpensively as they could. They didn't gouge me...They did what they could to make me a repeat customer. My 08 Accord came from Bell Honda and it's great, I got an awesome deal and went through finance with Robby he joked and laughed with us the whole time and made the process as quick as possible since we had our kids with us. He showed us the programs available and didn't force us into anything we didn't want. I understand it's a business like anything else, money makes the world go round so if he doesn't make a little the place will go out of business, if I don't make any I can't buy a car...It's America PEOPLE!!! At least for now...
