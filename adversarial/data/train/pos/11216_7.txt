It's been a week since I was in Vegas and ate at Sushi Samba... and I think I've thought about it at least once a day since then...\n\nThis place is great for groups.  I was with a group of 8 and we were in party mode.  The ambiance added to it... I would say that it has sort of a loungey\/clubby atmosphere, but dress is casual.\n\nOur waiter was awesome.  I wish I could remember his name.  We basically told him what we liked and didn't like and he created our menu for us.  We had so many different plates that I can't remember them all.  We had a lot of sashimi, a lot of rolls, and some in-betweens.  The ones that stick out in my mind are the Yellowtail Seviche Taquitos and the Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass... DELISH.  They also served us these raw, semi-thin slices of Kobe beef with a bunch of different sauces and spices that we could dip it in before searing it on a hot rock!\n\nWe also had a few bottles of expensive sake and were taking shots all throughout dinner...  KUNG PAO!\n\nWith all that said, there are two reasons I didn't give Sushi Samba 5 stars.  The quality of most of the fishes was good, but not great.  This was more evident in the sashimi-style dishes.  Also, the pricing is a bit steep.  Our meal ended up being about $200 per person.  While it was really good and the service was great, I didn't feel like I had a dinner that equated to that much money.
