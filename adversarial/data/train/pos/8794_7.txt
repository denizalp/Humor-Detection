Chuy's is a chain and there is nothing surprising about it, it is cheap and decent mexican food. This particular loaction has a great staff. They are always friendly and chatty. \n\nThings that are cool~\nThey give you a stuffed animal instead of a number. That just cracks me up, so instead of the runner looking for number 23, he looks for the purple crocodile haha. \nThey have a salsa bar, the tomatillo and pico are both pretty tasty. \nThey don't put lard in their beans (eat up).\nThe fish skewers and shrimp fajitas rock.\nMatthew K. may be there all hot and dirty
