What happens when you misplace your keys while traveling and your other set is inside the condo? Well, if you're us, you immediately look at Yelp and find a high-rated locksmith to call. Being a Sunday, we were worried that the locksmith would be closed, but most were open. We called one company but the price seemed a little steep, so we shopped around and gave Mr. Lockout a call. Their price quote came in $20 cheaper and they had a five star average on Yelp so they quickly became the chosen locksmith! \n\nWe waited about forty minutes and then Bill showed up. He was extremely friendly and quickly grabbed his tools to get our door unlocked. I liked the fact that he was a friendly guy who made us feel very safe. If I were a solo girl, I would trust Bill to help me in a time of need. Within minutes, Bill had our door open and he also made us two new keys. It was very reasonably priced compared to the other quotes ($65 plus the price of the keys which were a couple dollars). \n\nThanks to Yelp we now have a go-to locksmith in time of need!
