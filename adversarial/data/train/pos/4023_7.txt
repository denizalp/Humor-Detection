Room rate is super cheap. \n\nThe view is good too- we got to see Bellagio's water show from 7027.\n\nI do not trust the slots here. I lost $20 in less than three minutes. Cry.\n\nThe casino has a \"basement\" food court, which is nice. I got crazy food poisoning though(Nathan's Famous), which is not so nice. I am also pretty sure that the food court has a Krispy Kreme location in the morning that turns into a fried chicken place(Nathan's Famous) at night. Also no five dollar foot long Subway... but yes ten dollar foot long Subway. Cry two.\n\nThe hotel cleaning staff were very attentive. I slept on the \"chaise\" in the room and used both of the queen beds' linens (I don't really know the bed sheet terminology, but the beds had three layers of blanket\/sheets and I stripped the beds' outer layer sheets) as blankets. The next day, the staff neatly folded the make shift blankets and left them on the \"chaise\" and replaced two new sheets for the queen beds themselves. That was really appreciated.
