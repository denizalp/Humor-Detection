Dear. Baby. Jesus. This is the best restaurant I have ever been to. The white chocolate apple french toast (forget the exact name of it) nearly made me weep. I wanted to sit there for the rest of my life and try every item on the menu.  The tortilla of my boyfriend's breakfast wrap was made out of tomatoes.  TOMATOES.  HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?? If there was a natural disaster\/biochemical warfare\/zombie apocalypse and I had to pick one place to barricade myself and my loved ones, it would be Max Brenner.  Or maybe Costco.  I haven't decided.\n\nIn the near future I plan on writing Congress and petitioning them to pass a mandate that demands Max Brenners to be built in every major city of the United States.\n\nI think they put drugs in their mocha cappuccinos.
