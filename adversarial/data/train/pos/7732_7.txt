Park'NFly.   Not so fly.\n\nWe tried Park'N Fly for the first time last week, and it was a disaster.  I don't know  how we didn't have a heart attack; alas, I kept my cool although with us being the only ones there, it really felt like we were on a deserted island.  \n\nWe ALMOST missed our flight because we waited not 5, 10 or 15 minutes, but over 30 MINUTES for the Park'N Fly bus to pick us up!!!!!  If the bus had not come when it did, we would have surely  missed our flight--and we were there more than early.\n\nOn top of that, there were two buses that drove right by us without saying a word.  When I pressed for help in our cabin, it was constantly busy and once I finally got through, the non-chalant representative just informed us it was \"slow.\"  I'm sorry, but TIME is of the essence.  Aren't the buses supposed to come every 10 minutes?   \n\nOverall, HORRIBLE experience.  The bus driver did not say one word even when we asked why it was so slow.  \n\nI don't think I'll use Park'NFly ever again.  I would rather spend the extra couple of dollars on valet than suffer a premature heart attack.
