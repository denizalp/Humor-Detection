This would be a 4 star review (for airport food) except for the complete and total fuck job pricing. Are you honestly telling me that a breakfast sandwich and iced tea is $12???????????   \n\nTWELVE DOLLAS????     \n\nWhatever, I'm expensing it but come on these are crazy prices for what is $5 elsewhere. My sandwich was fast-food tasty meaning they charged me TWELVE dollars for like $1 in food costs.\n\nWho says the Mafia doesn't still run Vegas?
