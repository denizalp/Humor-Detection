This place isn't even that bad!! \n\nIf you've grown up going to Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral you'll be fine. I mean, everything here is edible and is gonna end up in the toilet so these bad raters need to stop being total DIVAS!!!!!! The ones who depend on ramen for survival have it worse.\n\nIt's a cute place to take your family of 8 if you're poor and just got paid from your landscaping job. Good memories.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n- the food is good and thoroughly-cooked; you're not gonna fucking die I'm sure they have their health cards!\n- cheap (probably the cheapest buffet in town) you get what you pay for. Don't expect Bacchanal-quality
