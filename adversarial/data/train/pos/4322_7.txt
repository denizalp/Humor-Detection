I really wished this clinic worked out since its only a block away from me but I was disappointed. \n\nI woke up with an eye infection and wanted to see the doctor asap. My fianc√© reminded me of the walk in clinic across the Starbucks that was open at 8am. I walk over for 8am and it was closed even though signage outside said 8am. After googling the clinic, it looks like the hours changed to 9am. Sigh. Good thing this place was down the street. \n\nI come back for 9am and there's already people waiting. I check in with the receptionist and she tells me there might not be walk ins today. What???!!! \n\nShe informs me that the walk in doctor won't be coming in today....at a walk in clinic. Wth? The only doctor available could only see his patients and wouldn't see any walk ins. \n\nAfter asking that this was indeed a walk in clinic, the receptionist apologized and recommended going to Apple tree on Esplanade because they only do walk ins. It just blows my mind that there wasn't any offer of accommodation for walk in patients. They simply just turn people away after advertising that they are a walk in clinic. \n\nNeedless to say, I'll probably never come back here or recommend this clinic to anyone else. I went to Patient Networks on Richmond and Yonge and was in and out in less than 10 minutes. The wait for my prescription took longer than my entire time at Patient Networks. Go there instead.
