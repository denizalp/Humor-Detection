Ok, so I should just get this out there: I don't have any issues with GM foods and crops (I even strongly support the increases in global food production yeilds that they often provide). I'm one of those evil people who likes my apples red and giant and uniform. Even my love of healthy and natural related stuff comes and gos, and I am probably part of the problem and not the solution.\n\nI am not, in short, the target market of Community Natural foods because I mostly just don't care. That being said, I quite like it. I like seeing the organic foods (which sometimes do taste better) and the selection of weird and healthy products that I would never see at say, Superstore. I enjoy the hazardous-chemical free natural products that the store provides. \n\nI like the community atmosphere of do-gooding that the store tends to provide. But mostly when I'm in here, all I can think of is how paying through the nose for all-natural seems to be a primarily yuppie affliction, and that it just doesn't seem worth it. The stuff here is prohibitively expensive for a lot of people, and I think sustainability comes with (social) accessibility. I find myself examining the hypocrisy of the place more than the products, simply because of the message it carries.\n\nIt is conveniently located downtown.
