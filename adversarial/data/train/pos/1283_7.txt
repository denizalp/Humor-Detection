PARENTS AND STUDENTS BEWARE!!!!!!!!! NO STARS.  DO NOT RIDE THIS BUS.  This review should have been written 3 years ago after they sent me through hell and back.  This evening, they sent someone to serve my Mom papers for a court appearance in URBANA in less than a week.  I NEVER STEPPED FOOT ON THAT BUS.  You know why?  Because when I called them SEVERAL TIMES along with two other students beside me they never bothered to mention exactly where they would pick us up.  Not to mention...WE WERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING 20 MINUTES PRIOR TO THEM ARRIVING.  THEY WENT TO THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING AND NEVER THOUGHT TO TELL US WHERE SPECIFICALLY WE SHOULD WAIT.  My parents talked with our credit card company because I was obviously in hysterics (it was my first time away from home and it was family weekend so I had planned to be reunited with my family).  It's like calling a taxi driver and the taxi driver charging you before you even step foot in the cab regardless if you took the ride or not.  THREE YEARS LATER I am graduated, and NOW they want to SUE US FOR WHAT?!?!?! NOT USING THEM?!  THE BUS WAS DRIVING AWAY AND WE CHASED AFTER IT AND IT WOULDN'T STOP.  \n\nI don't understand how this man keeps on getting away with all of this.  But I assure you...it is going to be my PLEASURE to ensure that this ends.  Right now.  He will NOT be getting away this time.
