Inside Harrah's you'll find a food court that contains no fast food chains. For a quick bite that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, this is a great spot to stop and eat. We found it as we got off the monorail station located in this hotel. What impressed me the most was the healthy options here. They had a noodle bar, a sushi bar, pizza place, dessert\/wraps place, froyo, and a build your own salad spot. We enjoyed the build your own salad spot, which included 6 toppings, and choice of greens for $10. Meat is extra. The ingredients were fresh and they had some interesting toppings, like fig. My salad was huge and I couldn't even finish it all, I was so full! They also offered baked potatoes which we tried on another visit as well. Since our hotel's food court only offered fast food like McDonald's, hot dogs, pizza and no late night eateries, we found ourselves hopping on the monorail for a quick, healthy and affordable meal.\n\nAnother plus? This place is open 24\/7!
