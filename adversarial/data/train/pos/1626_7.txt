We ordered four slices;  pepperoni, mushroom, Buffalo Chicken(monthly flavor), and Garlic Mushroom (monthly flavor). Slices are $5, but are about 2-3 normal-sized pizza slices. A large pizza w\/toppings  is $38 but is ridiculously large. I finished A single slice and was stuffed. \n\nMy favorite part of this pizza is that it's crisp on the bottom. No soggy sad pizza here : )  My one big disappointment was the canned mushrooms. You're better than that Benny. \n\nJust a reminder to those who need it, this place is a pizza joint. Pizza has dough. Dough contains Gluten. Probably not the best choice for someone who has an intolerance of this nature. To give a poor review because they make a dish with a main ingredient you're allergic to is kind of crappy. That would be like someone with a lactose intolerance expressing dismay at an ice cream parlor .. you mean they serve dairy with lactose here? --shocking. Just my opinion. I think sometimes our expectations are a bit over-inflated especially because there are a lot of places that do cater to allergies...which is certainly nice, but shouldn't be expected.
