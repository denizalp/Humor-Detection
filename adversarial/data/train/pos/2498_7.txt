I've been lucky enough to experience two other superb churrascaria to know that Pampas Churrascaria is no good. \n\nFirst of all, the benefit of going to a churrascaria is to be able to sample many many different types of meat. I honestly feel like at Pampas, they only have about 5-- that is including the grilled pineapple. None of the meats were top quality like what I've previously experienced and they have no chicken hearts!! Bleh. \n\nWe also ordered the seafood option as well and it's pretty much as bad as the meat. The scallops and shrimp were tasteless, ahi tuna overcooked and the rest of the platter left me feeling unappetized. \n\nThe pitcher of sangria we ordered can hardly pass for sangria. With no fruits in it and no fruity taste, it fell short of being just cheap wine.\n\nLucky for us, our friend had a coupon for $100 off. We all ended up paying short of $50 each which is not bad for a churrascaria but I will never come back to Pampas again.
