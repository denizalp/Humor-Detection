We have had our Dyson vacuum for about 5 years now. A little over a month ago, a plastic piece broke off and the vacuum could no longer stand upright. At the time, I wasn't sure if we were still under the warranty period, so I called Dyson's customer service. Luckily, the warranty was good for another 3 months! Phew! The process was easy enough. Explained what was wrong, sent me here and said that they would send the information and work order right over to the store. \n\nWhen I got there, the only employee on the floor was helping another customer. But a few minutes later, another employee came out to help me. He was friendly and told me that the repair would take 1-2 weeks. He also said that they rent out vacuums if I needed one. Fortunately, we had another one at home. \n\nTwo weeks went by and I never heard back from anyone. So I called the store to ask what the status was. The guy told me that they had ordered a part for my vacuum, but they haven't received it yet because it was on back order from Dyson. I think a phone call to let me know that would have been nice! This is my only complaint about this place. If a repair is going to take longer than expected, at least let your customers know what's going on. A week after that, the repair was finally done. I also paid $40 for them to take apart the vacuum and clean everything out. Yeah, kind of expensive, but I know I don't have the time or patience to do that myself, so it was worth it for me. \n\nOur vacuum is working great now, thanks to the staff at Vegas Vacuum and Sewing! No more lugging one vacuum up and down the stairs! Highly recommended. If I ever need my vacuum repaired again in the future, I would definitely come back.
