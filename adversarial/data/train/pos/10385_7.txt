Stay far, far away from this place. \n\nI went in April for my annual exam. My appointment was scheduled for 4pm. \n\nThe first issue I had was that they couldn't seem to get my insurance figured out. They couldn't get it to go through because they were using an old insurance policy, even though I handed them a new card and repeatedly told them I no longer had the policy they had on file (I had gone to a different office the previous year) and I no longer worked for the company that the old insurance came from. After about 30 minutes they told me it was figured out. Well it turns out they still billed my old insurance anyway. They also provided the lab (Sonora Quest) with the wrong information for my address, so now one of the bills from SQ went to a collection agency because they used the wrong zip code. I'm working on resolving that right now and am really hoping it is not affecting my credit. \n\nBack to the appointment. They told me they were running behind because a doctor called in sick. I didn't get called up until 5:30pm, and hour and a half after my appointment was scheduled. It was an additional 20-30 minutes before I saw the person who would be doing my exam. She was short with me, and I had questions but the ones I did have a chance to ask weren't even answered. For example, I asked if I should have the Breka (sp) test done because a lot of women in my family have had breast and ovarian cancer. Her response was \"how old were they when they were diagnosed?\" And that was her answer. Then she disappeared and that was it. No opportunity for me to discuss any concerns with her. \n\nI realize they were working later than they were scheduled, but you know what? I also worked that day, and was about as excited about being at the doctor's office as they were to stay late. Their horrid customer service on top of their inability to properly document changes in address and insurance is why I will never, ever, return as a patient.
