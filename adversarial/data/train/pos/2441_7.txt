The only thing going for this place is the ambiance and the rose latte.\n\nHorrible service. They don't cut the brick toasts, the don't come back to check on you and they give attitude when you ask questions lol.\n\nThe waffles were along with the icecream.\n\nI've heard from others Unionville location is way better so i'll give that a try.
