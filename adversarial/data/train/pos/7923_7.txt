Please....do yourself a favor and do NOT waste your time or money. This club is for the most part ridiculous (as in, BAD).\n\nI have been on 2 occasions: one for Kaskade and one for Above&Beyond. There are so many issues that they need to work on. Both times they had a hip hop opener on a house music night! WTF? The #4 DJ in the world and you open with lame ass hip hop (that's a bad DJ as it is)?? Way to drop the ball Marquee.....\n\nThen, you probably pay off the fire marshall to WAY OVERPACK the club to levels where dangerous mobs of people will literally crush you between between. You can not walk anywhere... and everywhere you try and stand the bouncer says, \"You have to move. You can't stand there. Sorry, you can't stand there either. You have to move.\" Move WHERE?! \n\nThe dancefloor is *tiny*. Too bad they wasted all the space on the patio. The stage\/light show set up is amazing and the sound system good, BUT, amidst all the bad stuff, please... stay far, far away. \n\nSide note: my girlfriend and her dude ordered 1 round of 2 drinks at the bar and the tab for those 2 drinks?? $55!!! Insane. Also, 80% of the club is asian so you better be OK with that too.
