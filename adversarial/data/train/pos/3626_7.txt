This pink and white box off of Queen is very fun to visit! \n\nIf you're looking for little things like plant hangers, ways to display pictures, chairs, stools, bathroom and kitchen gadgets, etc. this is your place.\n\nLong ago I put Umbra into the expensive category. This isn't to say it is expensive, at the time I could barely afford Ikea. I recently popped in with a friend on a mission and realized it's hella reasonably priced and has all the house extras someone with simple taste could want. I'm especially into all of their copper\/rose gold-y stuff at the moment, and will be back and I will be cruising their online store, well... right now!
