Where to start... OK I always thought that Silvercreek was a good place to go if you were A) Old, B) White, and C) middle-class and want to feel good  about your middle-classness. Which is why I never went, because I A) Feel old, B) am really white and C am horribly middle class. I don't like to go places where I all I see is clones of myself, but we went to Silvercreek for the first time 10 days ago, and have already been back another time since!\nFirst things first, the decor will suit anyone's parents, but isn't so stuffy and lame that you want to rip the crocheted crap off the walls and scream. The service is good, although knowledge of the wine list could be better (from both servers so far). The menu is really interesting, with a lot of options, and some cool creative twists on some meals which would otherwise be your typical American bistro fare. Prices are worth it, HUGE portions (generally speaking-but the pork chop especially is Massive and the Hangar steak notsomuch).\nI fully intend on going back, frequently.
