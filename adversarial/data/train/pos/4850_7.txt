The best thing about this place is why it is now called Betty's.  It was formerly the Betty Ford, but a certain rehab clinic in the States fired up their lawyers and before you could utter the words \"cease and desist\", we got a new name.\n\nThis place is a great, friendly, nick-knack adorned pub that is brimming with local character and local characters.  A main dining bar at the front, two large dining areas and a secluded patio in the rear have made this place a great venue to go in, have a beer, and chill.  The food is the better of many bars I've been in.  You'd be good to go as simple as the burger or the signature appetizer The Deep Six, a dip that is truly fantastic.\n\nThey perform stand-up comedy there every Wednesday in its upstairs room which completely took me by surprise.  Because in the years leading up to their comedy show, I didn't know Betty's had an upstairs.  A good sized space that has a stage, tables and chairs for a show or private party and I never knew it existed.  Must have been more late nights for me there than originally expected.  Oops.
