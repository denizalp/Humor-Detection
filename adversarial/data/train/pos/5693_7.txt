ummm... i don't get it.\n\nexcept for the music and sound system, i liked this place better when it was RA. i dunno, just cuz LAX is the birthday spot for celebs doesn't make it more appealing than it actually is. i guess i'm not much of a starf*cker. there is nothing that stands out that really makes it \"vegas\". it's like a spundae sponsored event on a larger scale.\n\ni think the problem with LAX is that it's overambitious. it doesn't know what it wants to be. is it a club or restaurant? an ultra lounge or a concert venue? whatisit, what is it, WHAT-IS-IT??!?! or it makes the patron confused with what to expect that it sets itself up for failure. with all the competition in the area, i expected more... hospitality.\n\nis there something nick lachey, kim kardashian, and jude law know that i don't? sex in the champagne room? *shrugs*
