I like the layout of the Backstage, Bar & Billiards, but I'm not really sure what they're going for; is it a live concert venue or pool hall? \n\nI was here last Saturday and just decided to pop-in for a bit to check out the place. They were charging $5 at the door, but if you're playing pool you get in for free, how do they regulate that?...\"Ummm, yeah. I'm here to play pool\", I told the door guy. As I walked in and looked around the first thing I noticed was the decor; Led Zeppelin framed tour-shirts, a lot of label issued gold records on the walls, and the use of road-cases as stools surrounding the bar, these looked cool although I can't imagine them being too comfortable after awhile. They also had Limp Bizkit and House of Pain stuff everywhere and this almost garnered a two star review. But after doing some homework I found out that one of the co-founders of the BBB used to be the DJ in these two bands...or something.\n\nThe drinks were strong and fairly inexpensive by Vegas standards. The place was pretty empty and the band was still setting up, so I decided to play some pool after all. The cost $10 an hour so depending on how good you are; this is either a great deal or highway robbery, I'm somewhere in between. My GF and I played pool for a while and watched a few of the local bands performing that night. I might have just been here on a off night, but the crowd felt very young and almost \"high school cliquey\". A lot of \"kids\" were running around to each group and whispering stuff? I don't know what was going on here.\n\nAfter our hour of pool was up we decided to call it a night at BBB and said our farewells. The staff here was great, the drinks were strong and the venue has a cool look, but I'll definitely have to come back when they have bigger acts playing. Maybe a few more booties in the door and a couple more shots of whiskey will liven this place up next time.
