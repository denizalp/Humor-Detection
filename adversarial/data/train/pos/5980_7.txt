Stopping by on a Monday night before seeing the \"Raiding the Rock Vault\" show, Biscayne was virtually empty. The hostess let us seat ourselves in their lounge\/patio area, which is a narrow space outside the restaurant that looks out into the hallway. Not exactly a great atmosphere. \n\nScallops were artfully plated on a long narrow plate. Three well seared, buttery scallops alternated with criss-crossed asparagus to give the dish an X's and O's look. The Biscayne chop salad was beautifully plated too, with tomatoes, olives, artichokes, red peppers, chick peas and more sitting atop had a head of lettuce. It was great until we found a hair in the salad. Our server tried to laugh it off, but eventually took it off our bill.\n\nWith our appetites suddenly gone we stuck with some wines by the glass that were as reasonably priced as any you'll find at a steakhouse on the Strip.\n\n2.5 Stars
