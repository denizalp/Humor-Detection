Everything was great, except for the fact I was emotionally distraught that they forgot about my order and I had to wait 20 minutes before I got it while everyone else ate their lunch.  It only takes them a couple of minutes to whip up a sandwich (which are more like wraps) and I stood there watching them make other food orders that came after mine thinking mine would be the next one...but no, hello?  It got me hangry.  I just wanted fooooood.  Hopefully this was just bad luck and it won't happen to you and you'll have a 5 star experience because their food is delicious.\n\nThe decor is nice and the upstairs looks pretty cool from where I was standing downstairs.\n\nThis place was busy during lunch time, and we stood by the cashier to place our order.  The lady was very nice and friendly even though she was busy and very pretty.  I give her 5 stars.  The $6 freshly made mango strawberry smoothly was sweet and delicious (with no sugar added).  I wonder how they get this drink so thick.\n\nThe $7 beef shawarma sandwich was full of fresh ingredients (including parsley, onion, turnips, pickles, tomatoes & tahini sauce) and was easy to eat.  My coworker likes it because they have Halal meat.\n\nThe baklawas here are AMAZING! Again, 5 starts right here.  I've never said this before, so take this seriously, THE best baklawa I've ever had at a restaurant.  They have a variety of them, some stuffed with pistachio or cashew nuts.  They are soft and not too sweet.  $26.00\/kg.
