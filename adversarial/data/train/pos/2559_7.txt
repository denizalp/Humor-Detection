I am a very lucky man! I have had some amazing meals in my life and my recent dinner at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon was one of the best ever!  From the moment I arrived I was made to feel important and comfortable by the staff.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, elegant and modern.  I wanted to eat at the counter so I could watch the action in the open kitchen, but sadly it is not wheelchair accessible.  I am pointing this out for the benefit of my fellow yelpers, but I am not factoring it into my Star allotment.  Now onto the food.\n\nAmuse-Foie Gras Parfait Port and Parmesan Foam\nWonderful combination of richness,sweetness and saltiness.\n\n1st Course-Langoustine Carpaccio with roasted Poppy Seed Dressing and Espelete Pepper.\nLight and Clean with nice acidity from the lemon in the dressing and a nice note of heat from the pepper.\n\n2nd Course-Poached Baby Kussi Oysters with Echire Butter.\nI am not an Oyster fan and thought about asking for A substitution.  I am really glad I didn't.  The Oysters were mildly sweet and the combination of their briny juices , butter and chives was so good I drank it right from their shells when I finished the Oysters themselves.\n\n3rd Course-Scallop with Seaweed Butter and Curried Cauliflower.\nPerfectly cooked Scallop with nicely caramelized crust and sweet, tender flesh.  The Cauliflower was interestingly different.  It  was served chilled and almost mashed, but still maintained its crisp texture.The curry did not overpower things at all and added a nice heat factor to the dish.\n\n4th Course-Pumpkin Soup with Chestnuts.\nVery Rich and Creamy with a wonderful Pumpkin flavor.  The Chestnuts added a nice textural component to the Soup. I loved the fact that this soup was more savory than other pumpkin soups I've had, which are usually way to sweet for me.\n\n5th Course-Steamed Seabass with Spicy confit peppers.\nMy most straight forward dish of the evening, but beautiful in its simplicity!\nThe fish melted in my mouth and the confit added just the right amount of seasoning. Before this course I had mentioned to one of the myriad of staff who attended to my every need during my meal, that I was hoping that one of my dishes would have Potatoes Robuchon with it.  Lo and behold, a small crock of the \"Holy Grail\" of mashed potatoes appeared as a side with the Bass.\n\n6th Course-Foie Gras Stuffed Quail with Truffle Mashed Potatoes.\nCrispy skin, tender meat and the rich Foie worked wonders together!  Served with more of those unforgettable potatoes.  This time decadently studded with black truffles.  WOW!\n\n7th Course-Lychee Panna Cotta with Mango, Macadamia Nuts and Coconut Sorbet.\nThis was amazing. like a trip to Hawaii on a plate\n\n8th Course-Green Apple Sorbet with Calvados Sabayon and Citrus Custard.\nTasted like eating a fresh apple right off the tree!  The Citrus Custard added a nice acidic note to the dish.\n\n9th Course-Tart Tasting\n\nFive small bites that were all good, but my favorite was the Chocolate Cinnamon.\n\nBefore my meal I mentioned to the Sommelier that I didn't think I could handle a wine with every course, since I had several other drinks earlier that day (It is Vegas after all!). He was very helpful, and selected three wonderful glasses that he spaced out through my meal.  My night at L'Atelier was amazing and is definitely in my top five meals ever.
