Can we, as a country, just make the leap to all leather recliners in all theaters already??\n\nI can't wrap my mind around why anyone would go to a theater with old school movie theater seats anymore...\n\nBut anyways.\n\nThe theater was nice, and well kept up. I just have a few minor complaints.\n\n-They do not have the Coke 100 machines yet. I really crave Grape Hi-C and you can only get it in those machines... Get with it Cannery.\n- The recliners were super squeaky. Like they need to take three bottles of WD-40 and grease those bad boys down.\n\nI do like that their recliners were all separated. I've been to some that are in pairs of two. I also like that they had little pull over tables.
