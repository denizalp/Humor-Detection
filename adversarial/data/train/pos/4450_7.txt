oh my gawd. This place blew my mind! If you have a car, this is definitely a must go in vegas off the strip. Bring a HUGE appetite, because everything is massive portions. We ordered a ratio of 8 dishes to 12 people, and we were BEYOND stuffed. Now, I'm able to write this review because we practically tried everything on their menu! :)\n\nMust tries:\n-Banana maple pancakes (SO FLUFFY, carmelized sugar, and baked in bananas...WOW!)\n-Corn beef hash (great presentation, liked it way better than the HH Famous Meatloaf one)\n-Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict - This was AMAZING. the eggs on it were drenched in really interesting sauce. Definitely not your typical eggs benedict.\n-Kiwi watermelon lemonade. When you order this, and your friends see it, they're going to want one too. fair warning ;)\n\nWe also got the chicken and waffles (man vs food), and the porkloin benedict (which was kind of dry). They were all good. but I liked the top 3 i mentioned the best. \nEverything was shocking and amazing. The portions were humongous. We all got drinks (mimosas, oj, and kiwi watermelon lemonade) and the bill only came out to about $15-16 a person. Such a great value meal!
