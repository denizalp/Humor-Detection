I'm reviewing only their breakfast buffet. Didn't partake of their regular menu. It's a small breakfast buffet -- obviously not your standard Vegas mega-buffet. That said, it didn't cost as much as your standard Vegas mega-buffet. Just $17 each. \n\nIt was a decent selection of breakfast staples -- waffles, pancakes, eggs, french toast, biscuits & gravy, sausage, bacon, and even not so typical things like egg rolls, pot stickers, and fried rice.\n\nService was quick and on top of things, even with the Memorial Day crowd. So if you're wanting a buffet, but looking for a smaller, less crowded breakfast buffet, head over to NY NY and check out Chin Chin.
