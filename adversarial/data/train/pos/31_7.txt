I want so very badly to like this place.\n\n...so very badly.\n\nIf you can overlook my grammatical errors, maybe you could take a moment and listen to my tale?\n\nThe way I see it, Cajun and Creole food is some of the most inventive cuisine on the planet - I mean, who else could make simple beans & rice a world famous dish? And the best part is that most Cajun or Creole is made from the simplest of ingredients, just put together in such a way as to make them scrumptious.\n\nOkay, I like Louisiana cooking, so you would think I would spend endless hours at Rhythm Kitchen - right? Oh I so wish that could be true, but the fact is every time I go there, it's a near complete disaster.\n\nHere's the kicker - you see the food's not bad. Actually, the little special twist the chef puts on it makes it quite unique. I wouldn't dare start comparing it to Commander's Palace, but it's really not bad.\n\nOkay, I hear you asking - \"well, what's the problem then?\" \n\nThe problem is - the service sucks, I mean it is god-awful bad. This is quite possibly the most inept staff on the planet.\n \nThe truth is, I don't know what the reason is for the poor service - and frankly I just don't care. Someone in this place (i.e. management) is incapable of seeing the forest for the trees.\n\nNow comes my plea to the amazing culinary scene that is Las Vegas - could someone please open a great local Cajun\/Creole restaurant that doesn't suck?\n\nThe food gets a rating of 4.\nThe atmosphere gets a rating of 3\nThe service gets a rating of -5\n\nTotal rating = 1 (I rounded up).
