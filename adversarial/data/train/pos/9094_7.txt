They tow customers' cars! Seriously, I got there at 8:45 pm to meet up with my cousin while he was in town, had a couple of beers inside, and then walked out at 10:30 to find that my car was missing. I had parked on the end of the other cars, which was not a space, so my first guess was that it had been towed.... Yup.\n\nI found the phone number for the towing company on a sign on the wall of the establishment and called them. They had no record of having towed my car. Then I walked over to ask a bouncer and he confirmed that my car had been towed. I asked why, and he said that it was because I was parked improperly. I responded, \"but I'm your customer and you guys went straight to towing?!\" He said that he felt bad about it, but yes. Then he told me I could get the number for the towing company from the other bouncer. I called the number he gave me, and a young woman answered with a simple hello. \"Uhhh, is this a towing company?\"  She responded that she worked for a towing company. \"Okay, I'm looking for my car and was given your number,\" I said. She then told me that she would text me the towing company number.... and it was the same number that I had previously called. Brilliant. \n\nI called the towing company again. Yes, they had my car and no I could not have it back -- not right now, anyway. They open tomorrow morning at 8:00. I must bring $90 to get my car back. This absolutely sucks.\n\nSo let's back up a little bit. I picked Coach House because I thought it would be a good spot to escape the obnoxiousness that is more typical of the Scottsdale club scene and enjoy a beer in a laid back environment. But I guess it's the holidays.... the older cougars were out hunting and the staff were generally unpleasant. Then my car got towed. The end. That is the last $90 that Coach House ever gets out of me, so I hope their cut was worth it.
