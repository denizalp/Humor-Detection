Over-complicated and over priced food. I am a pretty decent foodie but the ingredient list in each dish left me in the dust! some descriptions had 10 ingredients or more.\n\nAnd, yes, I now know what a $12 piece of carrot cake looks and tastes like. Again, covered in lord knows how many quirky subliminal super gourmet doo dads. And, worst of all, the cake did not have much carrot or spice taste as is the norm amongst the common folks.\n\nThe owner might cook for super gourmet types and they will scream how great it is. For ordinary folks, I would pass it by in a heart beat\n\nI am just too plain a person to need all this hype and cost.\n\nTake your wallet !
