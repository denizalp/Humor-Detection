This place is all about one thing.... the monte cristo... I didn't order this unfortunately, but the husband did... and it was fabulous... potentially life changing. I, on the other hand, ordered a pesto omelette aaaand it was just ok. The coffee was good, the service was on point, and the prices were decent. We'll definitely be back!
