OMG yelpers all I can say is yessssssssssss!Aaron was AMAZING! The price was good abd the portions were plentiful! EVERYTHING was well seasoned and the OJ was ice cold and pulpy just the way I like it.  Yes I know pulpy isn't a word...lol I am so full I need a nap! It wasn't on the strip so it wasnt packed!
