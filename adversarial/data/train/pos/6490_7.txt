I thought the pasty was yummy, the one I chose at least. I ordered the Carne Adovada [$10] - comes with salsa and sour cream. It was realllyy good. My friend ordered the Lovely Bit a Salmon [$11], which had some kind weird herb to it and made it taste unpleasant. I don't think the accompanying sauce helped much. The pasty is also very filling. I ate half and I was pretty much set.\n\nThe interior is dark as all hell. I walked in and I nearly bumped into someone. It's probably the darkest restaurant I've ever seen. Each table gets this tiny light that comes down from the ceiling. I can't imagine eating inside.\n\nSo we ate outside on the awkwardly too big wooden tables and sat on the immobile seats that are placed too far from the table.\n\nThe waiter was very chill. Too chill? Like skater boy chill. \n\nI read that the other locations are better, so I would probably eat at one of those places rather than the tempe location.
