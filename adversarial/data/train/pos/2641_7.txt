Grilled goat cheese with butternut, cran-pear relish, and spiced pecans on 9-grain... Festive, but you know what'll really take that vegetarian grilled cheese up a notch? Ditching the squash and adding BBQ pork ribs.*\n\nSince these sammies take a small eternity to come out, don't stay together well, and cost a pretty 1,000 pennies, I have to dock a couple stars. The BBQ rib creation really is fairly tasty, though.\n\n*may not be vegetarian according to certain standards.
