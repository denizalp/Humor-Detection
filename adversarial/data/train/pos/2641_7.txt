SUPER FRIENDLY STAFF!  I havnt bought sporting goods since M.C. Sporting goods in the 90s so Im outa step (like the Minor Threat song goes).  My lil one needed soccer stuff.  I had a coupon for 10 bux off and they even combined it with a deal they had going on for a ball, sox and other stuff.  Ended up spending WAY less than I thought.  The manager and sales peeps help us out immensely!  Never huffed and puffed and were genuinely glad to help us rookies.  I cannot believe the selection this place has.  Im not a huge fan of Corporate, Cracker Park but I will come here early in the day if I have to.  Also, now I know where all the Suburbaintes get their head-to-toe Northface and Under Amrour gear.  That's the white people starter kit!  :D
