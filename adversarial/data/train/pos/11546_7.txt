Welcome to Las Vegas! \n\nIt is the symbol of Las Vegas that almost everyone knows.  You've seen it in movies or on postcards but I think you should see it in person.  Located south of Mandalay Bay, the entrance to the parking area is off of Las Vegas Blvd heading south.  Sometimes the parking is a bit hectic but they've added more spots which eases the pain.  \n\nYou might see a long line of visitors waiting to capture a Kodak moment, but it does move quickly.  If you don't have someone there to take the picture, there are usually people there to take the group picture for you for a tip of course.  \n\nA few minutes of your time is worth the stop.  If you don't remember anything from a Vegas trip, at least you will have a picture 'safe' enough to share.
