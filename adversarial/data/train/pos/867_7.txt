Sadly Al's Beef is gone but Fired Pie is a nice addition to the Northsight neighborhood!  \n\nI came here today for a late lunch. There were no cars parked in front and the inside was cavernously and deserted. Fired Pie I've learned believes their market is providing \"a fast, casual and customizable options for your pizza or salad desires. We use local brews, organic foods, cognizant of sustainability and the ...\"  Yeah, yeah but do they make a good pie?  In a word, yes. \n\nThis, in some ways, is the pizza world's answer to Jimmy Johns. In essences, \"Pizza so Fast you'll Freak!\"  LOL  They cook their pies in a wood fired 700Â° F degree oven, so they're done in less than four minutes. Nice!\n\nThe crust is ultra thin and the toppings are very good (see photos). I'm not sure if one individual 10\" pie will satisfy you if you have a hardy appetite. But I thought it was very good and filling.  \n\nI had the Tomato & Basil, which has the look of a Margherita pizza, but Fired Pie adds garlic and several types of cheeses for a nice taste.  \n\nThe cost was a fair $7.75 (not including tax) and seems like a good alternative to the sandwich\/subs guys over near the 101 and Pima.  Specialty pizzas are $2.00 extra. \n\nSo Three and half Stars+ and we are a Fan!
