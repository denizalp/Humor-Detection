I am a 30'ish yr-old female. I went to Woodie's at 5:45pm on a Thursday evening with an almost-flat tire. The tire was not punctured, it just needed some air. I informed the employee at Woodie's that the nearby gas station air pump was out and that I needed to get some air in my tire before it got dark (during Winter, that's around 6pm). The man told me that he was doing some paperwork and could not assist me. Excuse me?!? You don't close until 6pm and it's only 5:45pm. Further, I am a woman with a flat tire and it's about to get dark! WOW! I was shocked at the poor customer service and the lack of concern for the safety of a potential customer. I will NEVER return to this place.
