I generally try not to start an early morning at work without a coffee from Crema for fear of falling asleep in a meeting and drooling on my VP's important files.  I think that's what they call a CLM (career limiting move).\n\nStopped into Crema to grab an Americano ($3.10) and a citrus bran muffin ($2.50).  They had a nice assortment of pastries including scones, croissants and cookies all priced at $2.50.  I do remember that in the summer, they had a special that was get a free pastry with the purchase of a coffee so that was a nice surprise.  I ended up picking the lemon scone.\n\nService is friendly and chatty.  No complaints here.\n\nThere are many other options for coffee in this area (Timmy's, Starbucks, Timothy's, the coffee machine in my office's lunch room) but Crema is a nice treat from the norm.
