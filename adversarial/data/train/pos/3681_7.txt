Lets get this out of the way - If you want service, smiling employees and staff that will remember your name and indulge you in pleasant conversation go to AJs or Safeway or any other place but here. \n\nNow if you want Korean food, esp Korean food you come here. They also have a huge section for Indian food, I would know (hint hint : Im brown) and while its not Lee Lee big, its big enough for me to have everything I need. They do have a sizeable eastern european section too to boot, so if you are craving your eastern european candy then this is the place to go. \n\nI don't eat much meat\/fish so I have no clue what that section is like but I will tell you they do have a myriad of dead animals chilling out in the frozen area. \n\nSo all you Kimchi Kimbap craving curry loving, Borsec water guzzling folks out there, mosey on over ..
