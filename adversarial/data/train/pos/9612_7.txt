Oh Magia... You haven't aged well my friend. \n\nAbout 10 years ago I spent a year living a few blocks away from Magia. This was my favorite local eatery within a 5 min walk. \n\nA decade later, on a whim, I decided to return. It was kinda like running into an ex you haven't seen in a long time. A little fun for the first few minutes... but you're really left with \"wow... What happened to her?\". Sure the implants and Botox have helped, but it's just masking what once was. \n\nThe menu looks the same, but dementia has set in, they have forgotten how to make my old favorites. I started with the warm goat cheese salad. I used to dream of this salad at night! But what I got was, well, it was disheartening. \n\nAnyway... I won't be calling her back. It was too awkward, and I don't see it getting better over the next few years either.
