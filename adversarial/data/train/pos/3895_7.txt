Dun Dun DunDunnnn!!!  Time for Juany B's 2nd review!!!...of one of my FAVORITE places!!!\n\nGreenland is this half-Koreans dream come true!  This is where I go to get my Seoul Food on!!!...LOL...I used to always rely on Vietnamese markets to find my Asian supplies...until a friend told me about here...  Seriously kick @ss!!!\n\nSo your thinking Greenland, that doesn't sound Korean...well once u walk into the place you'll think differently!  There's a food court with yummy smells coming from each one!  Some of the signs r written in Korean but the folks there r always smiling n willing to help (I've been to 2 and there's like 8-ish different ones...). There's also a couple different shops...I just remember a hair product one and a coffee one I think, but the Bakery stand!!!  Ohhh this lady knws me cuz I ALWAYS stop for something!!!  Lil pastries for like a buck25 each or so...(hint hint--there's a lil tag on the back telling u what each one is, LOL...)\n\nOk, onto the shopping!!!  Always fresh produce!!!  Great prices, and some hard to find items too...the back does have a fish dept...a little bit of a fish smell in that corner (it really is minimal!), but not NEARLY as bad as some places I've been to...if your looking for fish it's always fresh w\/ good selection, they also have a small fridge area w\/ a sashimi selection too!\n\nThe high point in my book is the back section where they have marinated selection of meats!!!  Kalbi!  Bulgogi!  Spicy chicken!  I love the boneless rib meat the best!!!  Also they weigh the meat, make the price sticker, and then add the extra juice...Brilliant!!!  \n\nAlso have a meat fridge selection of Shabu!!!  Tons of different kinda, in different thicknesses...\nFurther down the line they have more made goodies, like rice cakes, Dop-po-ki!!!, Kim-bap...\nFor those familiar w\/ Korean food you have to have all your little side dishes right?!  Well they have a slew of them in little plastic bins ready for consumption...nom nom nommmm!   =)\nYummy yummy all up in my tummy!\n\nOf course they also have rows and rows of your staples like rice, sauces, ramen, etc etc...additionally also items like porcelain dishes, knives, serving dishes n all...best part you can tell this place is new and well kept CLEAN!!!  It's not crowded like 99market or some of the older ones...not doggin them but u feel claustrophobic n nasty coming out of some other places, not here!!!\n\nSince finding this plce I seriously do like 85% of my shopping here...and if your one of those odd hours working guys\/gals...they're open from 9 to midnight!!!  Corner of SpringMtn and Rainbow...enjoy some good shopping\/eating!      =)
