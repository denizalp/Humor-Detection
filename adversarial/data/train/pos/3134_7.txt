My parents were over visiting and we found this place and I couldnt get them out of here. The selection of food is fantastic, the cake selection is somethng else and the flans are a definite try. My step father had the white hot chocolate and said it was the best he ever tasted. I will definately go back there...in fact I may just do so today!
