This place is the best! Family owned with delicious homemade food. Formerly Vito's. Pizza and garlic knots are great-the sauce is delicious. Had the calzone today & it was filled with ricotta cheese. You owe it to yourself to check this place out. Great food at a great price. I guarantee you'll come back.
