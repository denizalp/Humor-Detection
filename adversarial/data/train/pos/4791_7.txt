Good vibes at the Hakkasan Nightclub. Got in for free through a friend, which made it worth it.... but it was so packed. Hard to get onto the dance floor because it was just jam packed.\n\nThe DJs they feature are always awesome. Definitely a good time in that sense. Drinks are ridiculously overpriced. I paid like $10 for a small Red Bull... and mixed drinks were like $20.... so ladies, find yourself someone to buy you a drink, lol.
