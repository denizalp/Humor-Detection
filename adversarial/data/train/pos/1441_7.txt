2011 has started beautifully and this meal was just one of the highlights of its' first week. \n\nFleur De Lys shut its doors (and broke my heart) and then opened up as Fleur by Hubert Keller (and soothed my aching heart). We were walking around Mandalay and saw that the place was open. We also caught eye of Hubert Keller going around the restaurant to the tables to catch up with diners. We made reservations for a late dinner.\n\nService was impeccable, the ambiance was great especially for a place that is priced so well and is a \"small plate\/Tapas\" restaurant. The only complaint I have is that the Sushi Bar across becomes a nightclub of sorts 11pm onwards. If you are willing to listen to a Santana cover band while savoring delicate food, plan for a late meal. If you are like me, I will be trying to avoid this assault on my ears and dine a little earlier.\n\nOur order:\n\n1. Ceci Frito ($5)- Fried Chickpeas (a little coating of cornflour) and preserved lemons. Best chickpea preparation I've ever had. We ordered 3 plates since we loved it so\n\n2. Hummus & Baba Ganoush ($6) - The highlight here was the flat bread (free refills). The bread was smooth, thin and had a sparse sprinking of paprika\/red chili powder that gave it a slight kick\n\n3. Onion Soup ($6) - This was one dish from Fleur De Lys that they've brought here. Served in cute shot glasses, one order is 4 glasses and tastes sweet, smooth and tasty with a dollop of truffle oil on it\n\n4. Risotto ($8) - With scallion, lemon and basil, this creamy risotto with generous parmesan shavings was a hearty bowl and very satisfying\n\n5. Wild Mushroom Ragout ($9) - Various mushrooms (oyster etc) in a medley and reduced in a creamy concoction. Star of the meal!\n\n6. Gnocchi ($9) - Velvety soft homemade pasta with a thick tomato sauce and pesto. Perfection in a bite\n\n7. Coconut Soup ($7) - Another import from the old Fleur De Lys. Passion fruit sorbet settles on top of a soup of coconut and sago pearls and sprinkled with freeze dried fruit. 2 servings per order. The freshest desert I have ever had. \n\nI'm brimming with joy that Hubert Keller is back with a vengeance. I love it and Fleur by Hubert Keller is once again one of my favorite restaurants in the world!
