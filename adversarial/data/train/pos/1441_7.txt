This grocery store was walking distance from the place we were staying.  It is not a large grocery store, but they have all the basic necessities one would expect.  Store was  organized and easy to navigate.\n\nPrices seemed reasonable.  Bought what we needed for our 3 night stay.  They had the Ketchup chips that I was craving for.  I got no complaints.
