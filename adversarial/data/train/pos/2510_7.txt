Jim G. and I have only ever eaten here during the late night hours, so factor that in to your own decision making process.  happy Hour is from 4-6 and midnight-2am!\n\nThe vibe here is cool, with loud, often good music, and a nice view of the front of Palazzo and Venetian.  Keeps the energy up! The only downside is that this place is far away from most of the other stuff in the hotels, but it's worth the trek (as long as you have comfy shoes. Trust me on that...).\n\nThings we've tried:\n-Philly Cheesesteak Dumplings: Very tasty, served with a sriracha ketchup to add a little heat =)\n-Lollipop Buffalo Wings: Tasty, but a much larger order than I anticipated. Be ready to share!!\n-Lobster Chowder: Not too impressed with this dish.  It's super big (which helps justify the price), but not as flavorful as I expected. I'd pass on this.\n-Tater tots with cheese (can't remember the type, but very flavorful) and truffle oil!: This dish was big on flavor and on fun! Crisp tots, nice gourmet cheese, and the punch of truffles. Yes, please.\n-For me, the reason to return: Macaroni and Cheese topped with Doritos!! If this isn't late night food, I don't know what it. The mac and cheese is good, the Doritos are awesome. Together, it's a cheesy, crunchy heaven. Order it. Just do it!\n\nI'll be ordering that Mac n Cheese again really soon. Hope to see you there! =)
