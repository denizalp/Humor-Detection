I absolutely love this place! I've taken almost every single family member here with me! Before I begin telling you how awesome this place is, I just want to let you know they have Stamp cards here!! Okay, now that I got that out of my system this place basically let's you make up any flavor of ice cream or custard you want and to top that off almost any combo of toppings as well! I'm sure you're thinking well duh most ice cream places are like that, well this one starts at liquid form and by the end of it, liquid nitrogen makes it into a solid right before your eyes!! It's super cool to watch, esp if they freeze gummy bears with it as well, in front of you and watch it shatter to a hundred little pieces, then stick it in your mouth to eat it and it turns all gummy again!  Yes, I'm like a small child at this place.. they also have a science like day every first Friday I believe for children, to show them what else liquid nitrogen can do! Anyways, love this place, staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and I will continue to come here as long as I'm alive lol..\n\nPs if you don't finish your ice cream and it's all melted,  but you love it so much that you still want to take it home, they can refreeze it for you! Or if you hate your ice cream concoction,  they'll remake you one at no charge!
