This is the best Boba in the city. So glad they finally decided to open one on the other side of town. This new location is amazing - it's cleaner, really well designed, and way bigger than the Rainbow location. This new location is a bitter\/sweet moment for me because I couldn't be happier that it's so close to my home, but I'm also dreading the fact that all of my money will now be spent at Brew Tea Bar.
