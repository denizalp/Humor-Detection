I don't think there is anything in this store that I would ever buy for myself but whenever I need a gift for a woman, I know where to go.  They have jewelry, clothes, and accessories.  They also have baby stuff and pet stuff but this place is here for girls aged 15-40.  If they wear it on Gossip Girl, you'll probably find something like it here.\n\nTheir pricing operates sort of like the airport.  Some things seem completely reasonable and others make you spit your coffee out.  I really don't get it...but they do have a sale section that is usually full of great bargains.  You are always assured of finding something cool and trendy here so I would highly recommend it.
