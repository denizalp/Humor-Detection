This Dillard's is now ONLY an outlet center. The whole lower level is empty and closed. The upstairs now functions as the final destnation for last season's, damaged, and odd-sized designer wear. It's kind of like Ross, without all the junkie off-brands and pee-pee scented changing rooms.\n\nThe minimum discount I saw was 40% off. Most racks are labeled 50% off, and there are several 75% off racks to be found. They are also conveniently organized by size. \n\nMost of the items are by well-known designers. I picked up a Michael Kors top that was originally priced around $50 for $18. \n\nClothes are their mainstay. But there is also some bedding, accessories, and shoes. I found the shoe selection the most disappointing. Unless you have tiny little tootsies or big sasquatch feet, or if you like super gaudy styles, you're out of luck.
