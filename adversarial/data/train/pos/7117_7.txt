I get sick of going out to the Strip.  Yes, there's a lot of stuff to do out there, but when it gets all super crowded and touristy and hectic, it's a pain.\n\nThe thing is what's a trip out to Vegas without hitting a casino or two?\nI guess not much of one.\nIt's why I dig Red Rock as much as I do.\n\nThe place has good eats, lounges that serve potent drinks, an awesome bowling alley, and a really clean movie theater.  The people at Red Rock also seem to know how to properly party: not too many folks passing out or acting up.  \nMost importantly, it's a chill place to go play.\n\nI get to experience a lot of the same stuff I go to the Strip for but in a less chaotic and more intimate setting.
