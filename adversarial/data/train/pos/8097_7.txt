Sometimes food can be an earth rocking experience, and that sometimes, summarizes every single visit I've ever had to Nobu.\n\nThere really isn't much I can say at this point that can convince you this is one of the finest Japanese restaurants in the country. 400+ Yelp reviews, and almost all of them are 4 and 5 stars.\n\nI will just leave you with some advice:\n\n1. Don't come here drunk. You will leave with a bill that is closer to a G. You may not enjoy it as much either.\n2. Order the Black Cod Miso. Hands down the best dish that I've ever tasted.\n3. You can come in a large group, but groups of 4 are best. They serve small plates. Intimate dining at it's best.\n4. Service is solid, be sure to tip well. This isn't the Outback or Chili's. Don't treat it like your typical Vegas fare.\n5. Yes, it's a chain now. It never used to be. But the quality hasn't skipped a beat.\n6. Go to Nobu in every city you visit (if there is one).\n7. Make a reservation.\n\nFollow these rules, and you will have one of the best dining experiences of your life.\n\nBe prepared to spend some coin. It is worth it. \n\nPeace out.
