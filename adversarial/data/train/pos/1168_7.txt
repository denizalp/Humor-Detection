my aunt, partner and I came here on a package the Saturday after Thanksgiving.  I think my aunt paid 218 for the three of us.  We got a 50 min massage, a 1hr facial with food scrub, microdermabrasion and eye treatment and another foot scrub with the massage.  The massage was ok, not the best I ever had, not the worst.  My facial with Whitney was great.  I loved the products and she did explain each step as it happened.  My partner was happy with her facial even though she didnt get extractions.  I asked for extractions so maybe thats why I got them.  It was good for the price, not sure I'd be happy paying full price.
