I literally hate going into any Verizon anywhere, ever. I get it, guys. The long lines, annoying customers, and time\/money suck can be a real downer.\n\nMy Dad and I stopped in to take care of some upgrades and do some device shuffling. We went in on a Friday about 3pm and walked right in with no lines! Luckily, Jaclyn assisted us, and she was THE BEST! She was super knowledgable, very helpful and didn't try to sell us tons of extras we didn't need. She was patient, smart with her numbers and fun to talk to while we waited on things like my phone backing up. Also, she loves Yelp, so YAY! \n\nI honestly think that a trip into a phone store is make or break depending on the person who assists you. If you can, ask for Jaclyn! She'll make the experience as least painful as possible and will do her best to genuinely get you in and out in a reasonable amount of time. I've experienced some folks in phone stores that have made me want to set my hair on fire. I think this was my shortest trip to Verizon, EVER. Thanks, Jaclyn!
