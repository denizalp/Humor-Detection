This Lee's Discount Liquor location can be found on the northwest corner of Blue Diamond and Decatur Road. \n\nThis place has a pretty healthy selection of alcohol! Just aisles and aisles of liquors I've never ever heard of before! It was kind of fun just browsing through all the aisles and just looking at some of the labels.\n\nI was not there for hard liquor or wine, however. I was there to try to find some Thai beer. I was just curious which one of the beers I had over in Thailand I could find in my neighborhood liquor store. It ends up they have three! They had Chang, Singha, and Tiger. At $7.99 to $8.99 per six pack, I found their prices to be pretty reasonable.\n\nThis store cannot be very old. They keep the place fairly tidy and clean and it looks like it is still relatively new.\n\nThe prices here are quite competitive  and the selection is massive. Whatever you're looking for, there is a good chance that you will find it here!\n\nThe service here was adequate. The clerks were friendly enough, but seemed a bit frazzled at the high business volume they were experiencing on the afternoon I visited. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, though.\n\nI like this place and I can definitely see myself coming back on those special occasions when I'm hosting a get together at the house and want to pick up some tasty adult beverages that will satisfy everyone's desires. \n\n4 stars.
