Have you ever been to a used car dealership?  This one is a little nicer than the others.  The selection here is pretty cool.  Seriously clean and nice looking facility.  As far as the salesmen go..  They are nice, but it is a used car dealership.  They know they have nice looking cars, still don't let them fool you.  They're still USED cars.  Mostly #blingblinghippetyhoppety#rollin'ondubs#drivethisnewcartoshit#hashfries type of used cars.  Just protect your neck and make sure they entail the warrantee information completely and clearly.  That is the only way to feel comfortable with getting a used car.  They actually are very responsible with their warantees.  As far as customer service goes they aren't the least bit sleazy and are very helpful.  After coming from a new Toyota dealership where the salesmen were crawling all around like roaches on a turd, it was nice to be approached like humans at Newport.  Newport Motors, the least \"used car saleman\" salesman.
