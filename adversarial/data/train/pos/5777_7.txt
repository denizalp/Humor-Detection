Houston's - you have not let me down yet... I've been on numerous occasions to this location, and I have not one complaint.  Today for lunch, I met my friend and future yelper Ryan H, and I not only enjoyed the amazing company, but the meal itself.  I chose the ahi tuna salad and a side of spaghetti squash.  Each bite of salad was better than the next; i especially love the dressing, avocado, sesame seeds, mango, and ginger... yum!  And as if the salad wasn't enough food, I had to order the side of spaghetti squash since it's a daily special and I love it so much! Ryan had the ribs and seemed to enjoy those as well!\n\nA few weeks ago Jared and I were at this location before seeing a movie at the Esplanade Theater upstairs... we each had a glass of wine and shared the veggie plate which was also divine!  Albeit a bit pricey, but worth the splurge...\n\nI'll for sure continue to frequent both this Houston's and the Scottsdale location - one of the few 'chains' in AZ that are worth it.
