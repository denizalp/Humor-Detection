3 line to choose from. Which one do you pick? Answer: Why, the one that takes the longest of course... Every. Singe. Time. There's enough space in the parking lot that you could actually form one line and go to the next available space which is WAY faster. Chances are you'll just confuse and upset other cars in the lineup though.\n\nI went on a warm Sunday afternoon and it was always full but never overly lined up. I waited between 5-10 for the door to open and then another 20 or so for the oil change, new air filter and windshield wipers. All of this came out to around the $150 mark. As someone who usually changes their own oil, I was a bit shocked, but when you stop to think about what's involved in the whole the price is pretty fair.\n\n$70 for an oil change including the oil (regardless of vehicle size) and a new filter. That's basically the same as a tank of gas. Well, for me it is. Maybe I should consider a more economical vehicle, but that's a conversation for another day.\n\nIf you don't like waiting in your vehicle, they've got a few comfy chairs to sit in and a coffee machine to keep you occupied. There's no real cool businesses nearby to hang out in for a few minutes, but if you're hungry you could use the time to pick up some Ginger Beef Express or Subway.\n\nFirst ever experience with a drive in lube shop (still makes me laugh to say,) and for the price VS the time it saves me, I'm sure I'll be back in the future.
