Long ago, in a land known as Norrath, I was a level 60 half-elf assassin. Meanwhile, in the non-online world that is known as real life, I was a fat teenager.\n\nWhile I may have slayed the titan of a teen that I used to be, his soul lives on in my now chiseled body. Every once in a while, I let the elven assassin take over my body, and most recently, he did so at the Bacchanal Buffet.\n\nYou ever been to Disneyworld's Epcot Center with all the countries? That's the buffet.\n\n- Mexicoland. Tacos, pozole, salsas, guacamole\n- Chinapan (Chinese and Japanese food are next to one another). Dim sum, stir fried dishes, hot and sour soup, sushi\n- Poseidonstan (not at Epcot). Crabs, shrimp, fish, more crabs, more shrimp\n- Italia. Pizza, pasta, charcuterie\n- 'Merica. Prime rib, barbecue, Freedom\n\nAnd then, off the boonies, lies Carblandia. Cheesecake, gelato, chocolate, caramel, sundaes, cupcakes, cake pops, tarts, and fruit.\n\nI, or should I say the elf, ate until it was impossible to consume another bite. I was literally in pain from the amount of food I consumed. I received a status message \"You are too encumbered to move!\"\n\nYeah. I'm aware. And it's okay. Cause it's Vegas.
