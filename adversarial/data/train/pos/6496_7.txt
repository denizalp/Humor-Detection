Do you like it hard and thick?\n\nYour pizza crust I mean : )\n\nSo we went here a few nights ago because we LOVE pizza and this place was super close to our apartment. We also go to Tivoli Village like 4 days a week :)\n\nWe cam here around 730pm so it was pretty dead; which was good!! We opted to seat outside since it was a nice night and my son like to run around. I took a look at the menu and we were trying to figure out if we should order the 2 slice plus a soda for 7$ or the 10\" pizza for 13$ (cheese only) and add some toppings (.50 for slice, 1$ for 10\" and 1.50$ for a 12\") we settled on the small pizza bc paying 14$ for 4 slices of pizza and 2 sodas is INSANE! We added pep and ham to our lil pizza and off she went and placed the order.\n\nWe waited for a few mins then went to Kidville to check it out. We came back and waited a little while longer and the pizza came out! We were sooo starving and were ready to eat! She set it on the pizza rack thing and I checked it out. It looked pretty yummy and I was excited to take a bite! I served my son a slice which was cheesy and hot, he got pep I got the ham. We each took a bite and I was like meh, its yummy but I expected a little more for the price. The slices were small and my son and I both ate 3 and were ready to go burn off the calories in the play area.\n\nThe pizza here is moderate, tastes fresh, and cheesy. Crust wasnt money by any means, I figured it would be soft and yummy... but it was kinda hard and thick... Dont get me wrong I love things hard and thick... just not my crust!! They arent greedy with the toppings and the pizza itself isnt overly greasy, or really that greasy for the matter. \n\nI maybe might go back if we have to, the waitress was super nice and the place itself is clean. I just wasnt enthralled with the pizza, I would not compare this to NYC pizza at all. I would compare it to the frozen digorno pizzas. Anywho, 3 solid stars for this place! Loved our waitress!
