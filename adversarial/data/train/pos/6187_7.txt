Great service Lori and David are an excellent team. They don't pressure you or try to upsell. We would not go anywhere else and the opportunity to support such a quality local business is an honor. Instead of trying to push me on new lenses and frame David suggested new frames and that I could use the old frames for parts. Great idea that you just won't get at the Big Boys.
