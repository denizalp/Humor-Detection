Ho, brah...heard dis place was da kine, went here wikiwiki at pau hana time....Finding ono grinds in Arizona is tough, yeah. Evens do, Arizona has choke local people. Whadda gives, you say brah? Do local people stop liking Hawai'ian food when dey come to da mainland? Ho don't look at me, brah, I'll nevah forget my first time grinding at Rainbows, washing down my plate lunch with a slush float...but anywayz....\n\nAloha Kitchen ain't Rainbows brah. It hints at da Islands with a linoleum floor and basic tables and chairs. (Dis assumes brah you come on a day other than Mondays, when da Kitchen is pau.) But as you walk around don't expect to see like shave ice, or spam musubi, or some guy with a wet okole.  Still, it's casual and relaxed and usually not loud n crazy.\n\nNot that I know fo sure brah. I always get da kalbi to go, and don't stick around der long. So you says to youzeself, brah, dis fella order one thing on da menu and he's gonna tell me how dis place broke da mouth? Brah, fo reals. Da proof is in da mac salad, scoops of rice, youze name it. Go to a chain like L&L or Ono....you see what I mean, bumbye. \n\nAloha Kitchen is strictly a counter place. Da grinds may come with a touch of ohana...but don't expect anyone to serve you. You order, you pay, an den you grind brah, An wen you done, you talk story until you're pau. Still, da girl at da counter is choke friendly, and never rude.\n\nWhuzzat youze say? Doesn't everything in Hawai'i cost more? Especially grinds? Fo sure brah...a trip to a supermarket in Hawaii can give you chicken skin. Good news is brah, da Kitchen won't do that. As of yet, nothing is over $10...but den again, is it gonna stay dat wayz fo evahs? No ways, brah, no ways. \n\nS if it is take out you crave, and you don't feel like Subwayz, or Mickey D's, den take youze opu to Aloha Kitchen, You'll be hundred of miles away from da beach, or waterfalls, or an ABC Store...But...you'll be full...an not just of aloha brah.
