Holy Mother of God!!\n\nI had been going to the WF location on Raintree, and assumed all Arizona stores were created equal. I had no clue that I was missing out on the most amazing grocery experience of my life!\n\nAlbert H. suggested I come here, because I am a craft beer geek and the selection at Raintree was good (in my opinion), but he said it was better here.\n\nIt's not just the beer selection that is better. EVERYTHING ROCKS! \n\nThis is just like the Whole Foods that I would frequent in Southern California--built for an educated, affluent consumer. There is a full-on cafe WITH a liquor license. This week they had a special on Sam Adams Cherry Wheat and Boston Lager, which you can enjoy with your delicious meal.\n\nThe craft beer bar (YES, bar), had over 30 different types of beers on draft (handles rotate regularly), and several wines for the oenophile.\n\nThe seafood bar is diverse with different Ceviches, salads and such. Soups are plentiful.\n\nI could go on and on about the rest of the stuff you already know. Perfect produce, fresh meats, etc.\n\nThe cheeses. Yeah, tons! Thank God, I'm not lactose intolerant. I won't even tell you how much I spent on cheese. \n\nTowards the end of my shopping trip, I hit the beer cooler. I spent a good 30 minutes trying to decide which beers would dance upon my mouth. I ended up going with some Dogfish Head beers and fell in love.\n\nIf you love good food, good beer (and wine), and don't mind dropping some coin, then this is the spot! \n\nMake it rain, bitches!
