What better way to end a hike than with a decadent donut? After hearing all the fanfare about Pink Box, I decided to give them a try to cure my case of the Homer Simpson's. I splurged on a 'gourmet donut' and went with the Cookie 'N Cream ($1.95), which was recommended by one of the staff members. I thought an iced coffee would complete my mini breakfast, but found out Pink Box only sells plain 'ol black coffee. *sad face* Seating inside is limited, but I was lucky enough to find a table outside all to my self. At first bite, cookies 'n cream donut was pretty good, but then I became overwhelmed with the filling. I have a huge sweet tooth - not even I could handle all the sugary whipped mass stuffed inside that donut. My final analysis? Cookies n' cream was all cream, no donut. I'll probably go back to Pink Box for another round, but I won't be getting anything that's cream or jelly filled!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #184
