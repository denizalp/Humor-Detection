LOL! I should probably be upset that I just spent $100 on the most mediocre meals ever, but it's so hilariously bad that I still left smiling. \n\nWe went in here with zero expectation, and boy did this place ever deliver! First off, the waitress didn't even understand the word \"p√©tillant\" in French or \"sparkling\" in English... not sure how else I'm supposed to communicate in Montreal. The inside was an absolute travesty - decor from a dilapidated French bistro and waterlogged bathrooms. \n\nNow, on to the food. The snails tasted like they oozed out of a can. The lamb shank was dry and covered in what I'm guessing was St. Hubert prepackaged gravy? In a word or two, the food here tasted like resentment and sorrow. \n\nWhen the bill was delivered it, they had \"accidentally\" charged us for two other tables' bills and seemed upset when we asked them to fix it. I had to hold my tongue when they asked how everything was, but thankfully for Yelp, I get to vent.
