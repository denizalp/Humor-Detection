I have been going to Marche Atwater for many years, principally for croissants at Premiere Moisson and Un Bol De Café Au Lait at  Brûlerie aux quatre vents, to me the coffee is some of the best in Montreal and the croissants at Premiere Moisson are legendary and for good reason. Also, the selection of meats, sausages and cheeses from the the various vendors is perhaps the best in the city. There is a smaller selection of fresh produce there when compare to Marche Jean Talon but still the quality is very high in both market places. There are several food vendors selling paella, sandwiches, plates of chicken pork  and the like as well as beer and wine. Atwater is always worth a stop and is quite interesting and there are other vendors, selling jams, jellies, honey and other types of homemade can goods.
