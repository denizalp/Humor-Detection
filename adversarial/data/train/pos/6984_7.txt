I've been getting haircuts here in the past 6 months and I have to say that today killed my experience and I'm never walking in here again. \n\nHorrible customer service. The barber told me to quit being a cry baby because I told him how I disliked my previous barber at the same place for making my head bleed several times. It's a haircut, not a head cut. Yes, even professionals make mistakes but that's not something you tell a customer.
