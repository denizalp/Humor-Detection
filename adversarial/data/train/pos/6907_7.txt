Went to Tartine after seeing all the rave Yelp reviews. I must say I was not impressed given all the build-up. I would have given a 4-star, but the service was really bad (I probably should have expected that given that this is a French place). They first gave us cold coffee - then acted a bit grumpy when we asked if they had hot ones (they did give us fresh ones, however). The water they served had a stale fish-like smell, which was vomit-inducing. None of us could drink a drop.\n\nThe food was pretty good. I had the Chevre Quiche, and sampled the Poire Tartine, the Peach Tartine, and the Salmon Tartine from my friends.
