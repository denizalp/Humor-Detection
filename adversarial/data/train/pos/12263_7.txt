First time I waited in line and payed to get in at a club. $20 a person on a Thursday night..... ehhh?? But even though there was a huge line... we didn't have to wait that long.\n\nYou take the Elevator (which by the way smelled and it must have been 110 degrees inside it) to the 51st floor. The place is huge!! You come up to a large sitting area with a small dance floor and a DJ playing House music. Wasn't our thing so we went straight for the outside area.\n\nThe outside was phenomenal. Two LARGE dance floors, a bar, and a gorgeous view (check out the pictures)! No place to sit unless you reserved a spot with bottle service. The music was ok and the dance floor was packed... till they had some breakdancing contest and started playing some weird shit. 90% of people left the dance floor and the friends I was with didn't feel like dancing to that music. I mean... I didn't pay $20 to wait in line and watch someone else dance (yes... I was dancing... leave me alone).\n\nThe drinks were kinda weak. Someone got me my first drink, it was $12 and weak as hell. After that one I knew I had to ask for something stronger (if I wanted to keep dancing, that is....) so I got a double vodka and cranberry ($24) which was much better but way too expensive.\n\nI'd recommend checking this place out at least once for the view. That's all.....
