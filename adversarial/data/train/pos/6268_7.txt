6 dudes in for a bachelor party and everyone had their hand out.   I mean I know it is Vegas but you don't need to act so slimy.  No really.   \n\n3 bottle minimum and they get you with the bait and switch of \"Sir, you need to buy 3 bottles and they are all $425 each.\"   Get there and the menu has nothing but $495-1500 bottles.\n\nIf you want to get every single dollar squeezed out of you this place is awesome...you will love it.   \n\nDancing on the small dance floor was impossible and was made even more impossible with the shitty techno music. \n\nWould I go back?  Maybe, but the strip and everybody rolling and and coked out is not my style.   All the wannabes are here and I stand by this review.  Weak at best.\n\nIf you are looking for real clubs head to XS or even off strip.   I don't mind paying the cash but hate having the feeling of being wallet raped and that is all that is going on the strip anymore.\n\nOh almost forgot the \"cool\" thing to do now.   They bring in local Vegas girls who are basically strippers and say \"We're from Vancouver\".  When you press them on it they don't even know Vancouver is in Canada. \n\nGet out of my box and quit trying to drink my overpriced bottle.\n\nPEACE....or in this case PIECE (of sh!t)
