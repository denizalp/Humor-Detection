The two of us for a Saturday night dinner. We have been to the NYC location a couple of times and really enjoyed the entire experience. \nHoping for the same here at our favorite Vegas resort.\nFun entrance with the whole pawn shop look and beat up grey door to push your way through.\nWe were seated at our reservation time at a 2 top facing each other. Not our favorite seating arrangement, we like sitting to each other for the intimacy and easy conversation. \nThe restaurant has low ceiling's and it is loud. Conversation across the table was almost impossible. one star \nService was the second star missing, very slow and spotty. Our waitress was slow taking our drink order. Then when we ordered our food, Lobster roll, excellent. Thai Shrimp next..... well almost next... When our entr√©e came out, an excellent fillet, we asked about the shrimp, she rushed over to the computer and we soon had our long over due app.\nA to go order for some excellent dounts with chocolate and berry dipping sauce.\nSo great food, service needed work and very loud... and I normally like loud.
