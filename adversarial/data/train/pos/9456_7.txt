The absolute WORST.  I would give negative 5 stars if I could.  \n\nRude. Rude. Rude staff.  Food was okay.  Portions were huge.  The frozen hot chocolate that I'd dreamed of trying for years wasn't blended properly so it had chunks of ice.  Do yourself a favor and get a frap at Starbucks instead. \n\nMy friends and I came to order take out.  We were ignored at the hostess stand and when I asked if we could order, we were told to go to the bar because they were closed.  Upon finding out that we wanted take out, bartender \"Jesse R.\" told us that we could not sit at the bar and that we would have to wait at the end of the bar.  Really?  I thought you were closed.  He insisted and we were too tired to argue.  So there we stood while the bar stools were empty.  When he handed me the credit card slip, he condescendingly told me \"Here is where you write the tip.\"  \n\nHere's a tip, pal:  Don't be such a jerk.
