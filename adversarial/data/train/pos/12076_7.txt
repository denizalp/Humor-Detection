Good old Culver's - my first experience here was almost 20 years ago in Madison, Wisconsin - little did I know endless cheese curds and butter burgers would eventually invade Tempe, Arizona.  I remember driving past my first Culver's and wondering what a 'Frozen Custard Butter Burger' was and in larger sense wondering what was wrong with Wisconsin, only to find out I read the sign wrong - which is more of an Arizona educational issue... .. .  Sure, the curds don't squeak - but they're still pretty tasty and the concrete turtles are hard to beat.
