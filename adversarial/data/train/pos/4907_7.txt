I came in here asking for my wisdom teeth to be removed which requires oral surgery since they are deep in my gum line.  Its been 8 to 12 months, Ive head my teeth cleaned 3-4 times in 6-7 visits with some bad and some good people, sometimes with novocaine and sometimes without.  I still don't know when they are going to pull my teeth out but they keep calling me in for a cleaning. \n\nThat means I pay $50 for 3 hours of pain, when I could pay 150 for a real dentist to clean it in 30 minutes.  Some people who work here (especially the professors) should get another job, maybe in a prison or mental health.  The seem to operate on a whoever wants to help whoever else policy.  The students werent as bad if you dont mind some 23 year old kid who thinks he is giving you a free handout by cleaning your teeth without novocaine for 50 bucks.
