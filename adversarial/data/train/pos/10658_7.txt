I'm all for hole in the wall type places, but I  felt like this place could use a facelift. \n\nPrices of around $20 for our entrees felt just a tad high, honestly. (Veal and chicken piccata) while they did come with bread and a salad, the entrees looked pretty small. \n\nDessert is where it's at though!!! Get the spumoni roll. Amazing.
