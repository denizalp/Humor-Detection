This place is wack.\n\nSeriously, I've been here what 20 times... and 19 of them (maybe 12) were\nactually \"open only to staff.\"\n\nFor 2-3 years, I'd walk by and think... maybe I should go in... but I recall, that even I don't hate myself that much. \n\nFirst of all, it's not a good place.\nSecondly, don't waste my time.\n\nBack when I was downing vodka like a Russian mobsta, I wasn't in the mood for your rude, cow-ish looks.\nAlso, if I went outside to smoke for a second... clearly, I'd be back to pay.\n\nIf I was nostalgic I'd say I met my first few Toronto friends here, and it \"holds a special place in my heart.\"\nBut, I'm not that much of a loser.\n\nSt. Louis Bar & Grill... I only ever returned to any... because of proximity to a friend. \n\nIt only exists --- because nothing else is here.\n\nLook around, most businesses here closed.\nTD, the Tuck Shop, Spot...\n\n\nI am not even sure how this place survives... I've seen far better bar areas in many of the apartments nearby. \n\nNo offense, but you are a waste of space. \nRating: Zero Stars.
