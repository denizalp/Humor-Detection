I went to Ritos expecting that I would love it, I have other friends that swear by this place and we have pretty similar taste. They had been telling me for months to go try out Ritos, so one afternoon I finally dragged myself over there. I went between 11 -  12 and there was no line and just a few people outside, I ordered a burrito aaaaand MEH. I don't get it, it wasn't a very good burrito. It wasn't bad or anything, but I didn't really enjoy it and almost didn't want to finish it. I told my friends this and they disowned and vowed to never talk to me again. I decided I better try to save my friendships and make sure my taste buds didn't die or something so I went to Carolinas the next day and their food was amazing as usual. So apparently something is wrong with me because I don't think Ritos is the greatest ever and now my friends won't ever talk to me again. I might go back to try Ritos again someday, but only because I value my friendships...
