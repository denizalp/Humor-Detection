Sometimes it's better not to ask.  For example... how did a pregnant chick end up at Christie's Cabaret?  Well... I think it has something to do with being permanent designated driver.  lol  \n\nChristie's is a nice looking club, with a center stage and $10 table dances.   Sonny was the best dancer in the opinion of my friends and me.  She had a bangin' body and did sexy dances.  \n\nThe music was good because there was variety but, the club could have offered a bit more variety in body shape and some real, healthy sized boobs. haha  But... for the most part, the girls were pretty and there were even a few good dancers.  :)  I will mention that one or two dancers were so anorexic looking, I felt they needed to get off the meth diet...    \n\nAll-in-all, we had a good time.  Even I did, no drinking involved.  \n\nSo... $12 cover fee, $10 table dances and a $12 ATM FEE... beware of that!\nI'd go back.\n\nSee ya there!
