I'm in loveeeee! The people are amazing and so are the sweet goodies. I found out about Mason's Creamery from the night market and boy am I happy that I did. So far I've had the flan, black sesame, Vietnamese coffee and jackfruit (all great flavors btw). Can't wait to try more flavors along with the sandwiches. Coming back soon!
