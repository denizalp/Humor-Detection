Who took 3 showers a day while staying at the Venetian Suites? \n\nI DID. \n\nyes, i took THREE showers in ONE DAY. i couldn't help myself. i felt so spoiled and pampered during my stay because my suite included THREE flat screen TVs -- 1 TV by the beds, 1 TV in the living room and 1 little TV in the  bathroom. The bathroom was bigger than my bathroom at my own house! It had a separate door for the toilet (for privacy), bath & glass shower with the BEST shower head. No wonder i took three showers in one day. \n\nMy friends and i reserve 2 Bella Suites in the main Venetian building ($259 a night). 5 people in each room and each of us had our own bed. The sofa can pull out as a sofa bed and there were two queen beds. However, i was kinda disappointed the room didnt have a coffee maker for me to boil hot water or anything. The suite also included two bathrobes for you to wear and if you like to keep them they were $80 each. If you plan to stay at Venetian try booking your room in the main building rather than the Venezia because my friend said it was inconvenient and he took at least 3 elevators to reach the main casino floor. \n\nThe customer service at the bell desk was very attentive and i didn't have to wait long to check in. I enjoyed my stayed at the Venetian and i would love to stay here again. \n\nI cant wait to check out the new Barneys!\n\nTip: if you are a quest at the hotel, you can get into the Tao for free without lining up in the main line. theres a separate line for hotel guests. :)
