First impression. Super awesome bright entrance! \n\nWe walk in....pretty setting. Totally wanted to eat on the floor tables. \n\nWe get a booth and we were game. I was looking forward to coming here, but after I tried getting a few people's attention and them just looking away acting like I don't exist, i got a bit annoyed. I get it, our table isn't there's, but when my hands in your face and I say excuse me, at least acknowledge it. It took a good 15-20 mins for someone to ask if we've been helped. It just sucks it took someone to wail there hands around like those blow up guys in front of car dealerships to get their attention.\n\nWe got Andrew, and he was phenomenal. Great customer service. He told us what the menus about, but since we waited so long, we already knew what we wanted. Get a la carte! No point on getting the combo. Too expensive, and you might not get everything you may want to try. \n\nThe meat was OK, but not to die for. Small portion for each meat you order. They range from $5-$8. Not unless you get the Kobe, then that's about $20. We also got a couple appetizers. The garlic chicken and the calamari. Again, not to die for. Also, those were the worlds smallest fried calamari I've ever had from any restaurants I've ever been in. \n\nCrunchy garlic sauce ppl were raging about...ehh. \n\nThe real reason I gave this 3 stars, which I think I'm being generous, is because from the corner of my eye I saw one of the ladies cleaning the table top with a dirty rag. I saw her wipe the grill from underneath and saw just dust and black muck on the rag. She then folds the rag, which is thin, and wipes the tables down with it. Then the booth and chairs. Soooo, ew. At least wipe the table top first, yanno? \n\nOh! And that playlist they played, I swear all the songs were from the 90's. They got that DDR music playing and made me wanna play it. Hah! \n\n\nI also admit, I kind of miss the goth bar that was there prior to it being gyu kaku. Good times. \"(｀´) Though, the renovation is pretty great.
