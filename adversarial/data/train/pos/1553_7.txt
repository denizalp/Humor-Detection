I first saw the Jabbawockeez dance team on TV many, many years ago on America's Best Dance Crews.  Their hip-hop dancing and white masks gave them an edge and persona that was unique and their acts looked real cool.  I had high expectations, but was a bit let down at their latest production called JDREAMZ at MGM Grand.  Although I enjoyed the music and the dancing, I found the performance a bit uneven for my taste:\n\n- Some audience interaction is good, but here I felt it was excessive and tended to drag on a bit.\n\n- The use of video choreography and lights were good, especially in combination with the music.  I wished there was more actual dancing with variety of moves and less of the \"skits.\" Some were indeed funny, but it seemed like filler for the next dance act.\n\n- I found the \"story\" a bit incoherent.  Their was some video with some narration focused around one of the dancers but then it got confusing quickly.\n\nMy take is that for overall entertainment value at Vegas, you're better off watching one of the many Cirque shows.  If you like dancing and choreography, then Michael Jackson \"One\" definitely does it right.  So 2 stars for me, mainly because there wasn't enough dancing.
