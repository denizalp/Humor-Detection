Based on summerlicious 2017, I found the place okay... and in comparison to other restaurants participated in the event, this restaurant menu was just so regular and so was the taste.  There was nothing distinctive about the food, although I was pretty impressed by their service. The Victorian style was impressive and beautiful. All the servers were very professional, and their attention of each customer was pretty good. \n\nThey start with butter and bread and they keep refilling it generously. bread was fresh and warm.\n\nI ordered - Strawberry Gaspacho for starters- it was served at room temperature, I would prefer it cold, for mains I ordered Tagliatelle with sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, olives and peas, it was much below my expectation, a basic pasta white with peas- that's all. I really did not like it at all. But the desserts Flourless chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream & Cream brûlée really saved the day. The Cream brûlée was fantastic. \n\nMy husband ordered Foie Gras pate & Salmon with sea asparagus and polenta- He can't forget that salmon, he really loved it. \n\nMaybe I should try out their regular dinner sometime, which might do the justice to this upscale price place.
