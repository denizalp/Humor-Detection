I hate writing bad reviews but this place definitely deserves it. There was nothing enjoyable about my experience here but the company I kept. The food was horrible and the place is disgustingly filthy. Get new menus! They are embarrassing. If the cleanliness of the restaurants reflects into the kitchen, who knows what it looks like where they are cooking the food you eat. Clean the bathrooms (shit stains, used tampon on the floor)! How hard is that! \n\nI hate to say it but I'm sure all the bad reviews on here are spot on, maybe nicer then they should be. Normally I wouldn't come to a place with such horrible reviews but I was invited. It is obvious this place is a fly by night operation, no manager in sight.  Definitely a candidate for Restaurant Impossible! Horrible! Make sure you do not order the meatloaf! \n\nThis place is a joke and unfortunately I wouldn't trust or believe one good review you read. I cannot believe this place is still open.
