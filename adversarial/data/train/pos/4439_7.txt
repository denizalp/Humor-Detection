I've been to this Mellow Mushroom on many occasions and I figure it's time to give my thoughts. When you walk in you'll notice that this isn't your normal pizza place, the art decor is very eclectic and dated but it makes the place interesting. The customer service and staff seem to be on point but it can be hit or miss at this location because sometimes our orders come out right and sometimes we just end up with another bad experience because they didn't listen to our order. The time it takes to get the order is about average, there have been occasions  when the food is on time and others where it's disappeared into a blackhole and I have to constantly ask when will our food be ready. \n\nThe taste of the pizzas are decent but I'm comparing the taste to mom and pops pizza parlors where they know what they're doing and that's what they specialize in. The menu is very large because Mellow Mushroom tries to cover all their bases from burgers, calzones, hoagies and pizza and also there's a bar if you decide to just hang out. For me, it's too many choices and I don't think there's one thing Mellow Mushroom does extremely well. I prefer to stick with a normal pizza but you can order something off the wall funky if you choose and it'll probably be the best pizza you've ever had. \n\nMellow Mushroom, as other reviewers say is an interesting restaurant and I believe that they cater to a certain demographic which is their niche but for my taste and expectations, I believe I fall out of that niche. Not to take anything away from them but for me it's so so. Hope your experience is better than mine.
