Actually I do not want to give even 1 star.\nI visit the store yesterday around 6 pm\nI just pick up 45$ sashimi and 20$ salmon and want to check out\nThere was no line up, So   I put that on counter and waited.\nThe owner sat on the chair and was drinking coffee and watched his phone. He did not come to check\nI was confused and looked around.\nNo one came, so I said 'Excuse me'\nHe asked me about chopsticks and soy source and ice. He looks so mad and annoyed to me.\nSo I asked 'what is wrong with U' \nHe said 'it was a long day'\nHe asked me about chopsticks and I replied agin.\nI paid with my credit but he did not give receipt\nSo I asked and waited but he said\n'I gave to U' \nSo I said 'no I have not'\nHe yelled to me 'I  gave'\nHe push my button. I could not stand anymore.\nI was so frustrated. \nFinally he found he receipt and said sorry to me but I return.\nI will never go the store. What a stupid owner.h
