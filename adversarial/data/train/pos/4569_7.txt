DuuuUuuUUuUde!\nThis place is the PLACE. I thought I was dreaming!\nSo good!! It's in the path - honestly I can't really direct you here but I know the path I take to get here.. only. There's always a line FOR GOOD REASON - it's bomb af. & don't worry, their assembly line method the staff use is SO effective. It's never taken me longer than 5 minutes to get my food.\n\nI've only tried one thing here and that's the only thing I need.\nF A L A F E L P L A T E ... aka heaven.\nTwo sides I choose - salad with sweet spicy thai dressing + rice with the mushroom sauce. Oh my geeerrrd, every bite was worth every macro. The falafel balls, let me tell you - they're the hugest falafel pieces I've ever seen in my life. Like, the size of a fist. It's crispy on the outer layer and warm fluffy goodness on the inside. Every vegetarian\/vegan's DREAM. \nAlso, did I mention the portions are huge?!?!?! Like.. food coma huge.. for $7-8.\nEvery time I forget to pack lunch, I come here. Right in the financial district across RBC. Convenient, fast and cheap. #thatswhatshesaid\n\nUgh, don't ever change, harvest green, don't ever change.
