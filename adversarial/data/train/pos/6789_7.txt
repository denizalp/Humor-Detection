Cafe Moulin is my favorite breakfast place in Shadyside. You walk down the steps into cute substreet level dining area with a space that can seat about 30 people. The setting is warm and open with plenty of natural sunlight shining into room and warm lightly colored wood floor.\n\nQuickly one of the bohemian waiters asks for you drinks and give you what I call an amazing menu. One side will have sweet crepes, from nutella, banana and fresh strawberries, where as the other side will have the savory flavors. Being a savory girl myself there is plenty of variety to choose from. Be warned, these are large and creamy. Most will have a sauce of sorts whether the herb creme spread of alaskan crepe or the bechamel that drenches the Bristol. Your tongue will have plenty to taste. Having been here 3 times, I have enjoyed each of my choices and always left plenty full. When you need to break it up you much on the side salad that home with a house dressing. All very delicious.\n\nNow to my favorite part of Cafe Moulin. They will do a Turkish Coffee fortune reading for you with the purchase of your coffee. Turkish coffee is brewed thick and grainy and sweetened for you. They will ask for light, medium or heavy sweet flavoring. You get it in a small 8 oz cup where you sip, sip, sip until only the bottom coffee granularity remains. Now, you quickly flip over you cup and wait for the grains to make their way down your cup. Depending on your personality and the spread at which you sip your coffee, the cup and therefore the grains will be a different temperature and therefore either make it down your cup more quickly or less quickly. \n\nThe girl will come over when you have waited the appropriate amount of time and will \"read your fortune\" .... I love having my fortune read. The girl is obviously not an expert and knows this cute party trick for her own fun, but either way, it's still pretty neat and a perk to your food.\n\nWill come often again.
