My friend invited me to their soft opening night tonight. While I am aware soft opening is not indicative of their normal service, I do like to provide a sneak peak of what may to come.\n\nI have never been to the other locations and thus have zero frame of reference, but it seems like Pearlz already has its own small Charlotte fan club from patronizing their Charleston location. My overall impression by reviewing their menu is that it offers a good selection of seafood options at a very reasonable price. If you don't like seafood (or allergic), they have plain salads, a burger and a steak to choose from.\n\nMy complimentary dinner started with half a dozen of raw oysters (this time from VA, $8.95 for 6 or $14.95 for 12). They were fresh and of good size but were little bland in taste. I was told they will have varietal oyster offerings (ex. West coast) which will be more expensive but tastier. \n\nMy appetizer was the peel & eat shrimp ($12.50, 8 to an order, enough to share since they are the bigger shrimps). Slightly seasoned with Old Bay, they are good for the cocktail shrimp lovers. But I am spoiled by my prior fresh shrimps eating days, I found these shrimps to lack that particular bounce and \"fresh from the water\" taste. \n\n2nd course I chose the Oysters Rockefeller ($11.95, 5 to an order). I may say this is one of the highlights. Very flavorful, not too cheesy, a hint of bacon but not overpowering. However I didn't see the crawfish\/lump crab toppings as shown on menu description, but still a solid excellent dish.\n\nLastly I chose the fried shrimp entree. The 2 side items semi stole the show - the homemade chips and the corn fritters. The chips (really chips, not fries) were perfectly crispy. The fritters were slightly coated in powder sugar, giving it a good contrast to the otherwise savory dish. The shrimps itself (I believe they are the same source of shrimps as the cocktail shrimps) were ok; the batter can be lighter in sodium and the weight. For $16.95 there was plenty of shrimps to go around.\n\nOk... I lied, that was not my \"lastly;\" the last item I had was the cup of seafood gumbo ($4.95) I added at the very end.  And it is legit. Not some tomato based fake stuff. This is the brownish good stuff - how gumbo really should be made from a dark roux. I promise, you want a cup if not a bowl of this!\n\nOverall from the food standpoint, Pearlz offers excellent value. So shrimps are not their strength in my opinion, but the Rockefeller and the gumbo were both solid. The portion I saw on everything is good. The tuna tartare looked divine. Fried calamari tossed with peppers is on my list to try. Local beers on draft ($5) and $9 signature cocktails - tho alcohol license wasn't ready as of today. I think Pearlz is ready to shake things up in Stonecrest, and give the big chain restaurants around the corner a run for their money!
