After reading the comment from one of the owners at Crown Electric Tattoo Company, I am even more frustrated with this company.  I have never had such a poor job done on ink, this looks like a child tattooed me.  I have NEVER had ANY issue with any other QUALITY ink work I have had done.  Half of the ink on the tattoo is either gone or faded, the center of the tattoo is still infected. NO ONE SHOULD GET INK DONE HERE EVER!!!!  We had appointments, specific time and date, we spent 4 hours there waiting around in a very disorganized shop, what is the use of having an appointment if they are not honored, I feel bad for the other 200+ people that bought the Groupons for this establishment, and now they too are going to be scarred for life.  I do not even know if this ink will be fixable by another artist.  I have reason to believe that once this poor ink job is healed I will have permanent scarring in the infected area.  I understand the need for touch ups, but having to re-do an entire tattoo because of shabby work or poor quality ink makes me sick.
