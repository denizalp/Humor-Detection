So... They made me go back to my hotel room to get my I.D. cuz apparently I don't look like I'm above 21 (I'm 27, btw thanks, Asian genes!) and the woman who i was talking to was kind of a b*tch, she even looked at me from head to toe and said in a snobby tone: \"I'd let you in if you looked... Older...\" so I went back to my hotel room and I was drunk as hell, so I was really pissed off about the whole thing. I came back to Moorea and the girl wasnt there (I wanted to show her how old i really was and maybe I can hear a compliment, unfortunately she wasnt there lol) anyway- they gave us a good spot (in front of the pool) so that was nice.\n\nMusic is ok, could be better. There was no DJ (or maybe there was? But the music wasn't really loud) Drinks are good. People are fun. Servers are attentive (and hot! Lol) make sure you put your sunscreen on!
