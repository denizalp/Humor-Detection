BEST coffee. I buy by the pounds. Ridiculous affection for their coffee. Also I love that they serve tea as it should, with an array that will transport you to a time of chivalry and manners. And not mention, alcohol is available if you need something stronger. I'm in utter love. My fave wine is the Stronghold Tazi. Why not? It's a local wine! The white chocolate beer is pretty good. What more can you ask for but marriage of those two things?\n\nStaff is awesome, the hiring manager has an eye for talent. They are all uber cool in the Seattle stylish way. I think every creative artist, startup mogul, and entrepreneur frequents here, albeit the tourists wandering Old Town for unattractive \"southwestern\" pieces to collect. The setup is spacious with communal tables and cute wood stumps to plop your feet or computer. Plenty of plug outlets for you looking to dock and get on the wifi. I prefer the patio as it is really lovely to watch patrons and also soak up sunshine and fresh air.
