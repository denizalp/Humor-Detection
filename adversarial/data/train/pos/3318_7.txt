I have always liked Sally's.  I get my hair color here nice it is better on the hair then the box brands.  I also come here because they have the protein blocker I apply before I dye my hair so the color will stay longer.   They have a lot of great products but I do wish their stores were bigger.  They all seem very cramped and you will have to squeeze by other people to get down an isle. But I guess smaller locations have less cost in rent which keeps their product cost lower so I am not going to complain to much about that.  \n\nThere is always someone to help you out there.  Some times I wish they were not so young, pretty, and great looking hair and makeup LOL.... I am old and not hip so they look at me like I am so blah when I tell them I just here to hide my grays and wrinkles.
