Can't believe I have not been to this place until now! After hearing rave reviews from others, I finally gave it a try, and I'm glad I did! \nCame in on a Saturday early afternoon, we were the only ones in the restaurant (which didn't bother me). We were greeted right away and the woman (who I later found was the owner) brought us a menu, as well as a picture book with all the menu items (extremely helpful!). We ordered a frozen coconut smoothie, and an iced coffee with condensed milk. The coffee wasn't the best I've had for Vietnamese style coffee, but still pretty good. The smoothie was pretty good as well, although a little sweet for my taste. \nWe started off with an order of the fish cakes as an appetizer. They came out piping hot, and were delicious. They had a strong lemongrass flavor, complimented with green onions. Definitely had a homemade feel to it, in the best possible way. \nFor our entrees, we ordered the Hue Beef Soup with Tendons and the Special Bunn. The Hue Beef Soup was right up my alley; full of deliciously chewy beef tendon and vermicelli noodles in a fiery red broth. The portion size was very generous, and had good proportions of meat and noodles. The special bunn was great as well, with a medley of shrimp, bean sprouts, small fried spring rolls, and a strong curry flavor. \nThe woman taking our order (one of the owners) was also very nice, and took the time to converse with us after our meal. \nCannot wait to come back here and try more things off of their extensive menu! Also think this place would be fantastic for take out. Would highly recommend to others who enjoy trying ethnic and\/or unique dishes.
