The staff was friendly, but would not come here again. Wish we hadn't spent the money. I got a basic tattoo of my son's name & birth date on my left hip, as I couldn't afford anything else. All of their tats start at $100, no matter what it is. This one was $170, and there wasn't anything fancy about the lettering or anything. My simple, black ink tat started to FADE after a couple weeks. I have two other tats, so I know they're not supposed to do that. One is black & & the other colored. My other black tat didn't start fading until years later (and I've had it for 10 years). The tat I got at Club Tattoo looks like crap with the letters fading away. \n\nMy mother got a more intricate one, and for $300, the guy should have been able to center it (she got it on her right bicep)  and it also began fading shortly after it was done. Hers was colored, so maybe it has to do with the quality of their ink? He went through the steps of tracing and all that, but apparently when he inked it, he changed it up at the last minute, because what he showed us before starting wasn't what he did. \n\nI wanted to get my navel re-pierced and because it was a re-piercing, the very nice guy who did it only charged for the jewelry. Unfortunately, about 3 days later, I had to remove it as it was all infected, even though I'd been taking care of it properly.\n\nAll in all, not worth the $$$$ AT ALL.
