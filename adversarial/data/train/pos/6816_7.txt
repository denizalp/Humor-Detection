I am a fan of Thai House, either this location or the one on Shea. I tend to go to the one on Shea more often as they are bigger inside, easily accommodate bigger group. It has been over two or three years since I came here and I was surprised they expanded.  Twice as big as they used to be.\n\nLunch menu is $6.95 comes with soup or salad. Portion is very generous. Panang curry I ordered in lunch size portion tasted the same as the one from dinner menu.  I normally come with a group of people, and order variety of food to share, so I didn't realize how nice their lunch menu\/portion size was until the other day I came in.\n\nThey were packed by noon. I came around 11:30am and was seated immediately.  Food came quick, service was good. Nice place for a quick lunch as long as you come early.
