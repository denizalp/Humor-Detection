Olive & Ivy, though somewhat hidden in the mix of Old Town Scottsdale and Scottsdale Fashion Square, is a popular restaurant frequented by 50-somethings trying to look like 30-somethings and 20-somethings showing off all of their 20-somethingness. The sunglasses are big, the shopping bags more expensive than I can afford over a lifetime and the tans as dark as they come. \n\nThe atmosphere is swanky and there is often a Jason Mraz wannabe playing his music just inside the door. I've been seated, at one point or another, in each room of the restaurant. The red room in the rear near the pizza oven can be a bit tight but is a nice choice if you want to hear each other from across the table. The main dining area can get pretty loud - but it makes for great people watching. The white room has a lot of appeal with its large chairs and high cloth-draped walls. The problem is, as I was seated here for a client dinner, is that the humongous circular table creates a yelling match across the tables. Don't make any important business deals here. Maybe it would be better for a bridal shower. Eh. It's cool looking.\n\nThe waitresses are attentive and deliver drinks and pesto and bread dip in a timely manner. The bread\/dip combo is delicious! I would go just for that if I could. I usually order the flatbreads. My favorite is the prosciutto with arugala. Delicious! \n\nOlive & Ivy also has a cafe\/market that is great for lunch. If I'm feeling simple I get the grilled cheese which is always satisfying or I get one of their delicious sandwiches.\n\nOverall a great place to eat and be seen, a perfect combo for Scottsdale!
