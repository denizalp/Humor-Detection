Watch out, froyo fans, there is a new game in town.  From what I can tell, the Frog is based in Virginia.  Unfortunately, their Twitter feed is completely stale, promising discounts that have yet to materialize after a year and their web site is dated, not even mentioning a Charlotte location as coming soon even though it is now open.  They do have a Facebook page, but it is mostly to express your love.\n\nIn general, if you have been to somewhere like Yoforia, then you know what you are in for here - grab a cup, load up with your yogurt, pile on the toppings, weigh in (at 39.9 cents per ounce) and pay the piper.  Unlike some other outlets, only one current offering - the 'original' - is billed as tart.  The others are more traditional ice cream flavors, such as cake batter, cookies and cream, peanut butter, raspberry and so forth.\n\nOn the taste?  It may be the smoothest, most normal I have tried - without that slightly off-kilter taste you can get into with some frozen yogurt.  Even the sugar free nonfat raspberry was pretty awesome.  You will, however, want to be prepared - the bright neon pink and green colors of the place are not always soothing, and the background music is appropriate for High School Musical, so you may want to pull up a chair outside.\n\nAlso be warned - the staff, while friendly, is CiCi's friendly: They greet you on arrival, as you pull up to the counter, as you leave, etc... wallflowers need not visit the Frog!
