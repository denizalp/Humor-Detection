Today I decided to try out Fry's grocery store for the first time considering I just moved to the area and it is the closest grocery store to my home but I will NOT be returning. I received terrible customer service today at this location. I had a cart of maybe 30 items and accidentally went into the express lane. The cashier told me after I had already put my groceries on the belt that I was in the wrong lane and needed to put my things back in the cart and move down to another aisle. This would not of been a big deal to me if there were actually people waiting in line behind me, but NOBODY was there. After I packed my cart back up switched lanes and got checked out by another cashier I look over and there is still nobody in her lane.  So very disappointed and frustrating. It might be a good idea to take down some of the decorations hanging from each cash wrap so you can actually see the sign that says express lane instead of wasting customers time.
