Im confused why this place has such high stars.  Came on a Friday night and the place was packed.  I have been here a few times since Klucks closed and it became this place.  Still looks like Klucks but with a random sombrero and maracas hanging around.  The only thing Mexican about it is the people working.  Didn't even see any Mexicans eating at any of the tables.  Not a good sign.  In past times I left feeling \"It was OK\"...this time it just felt blah.  To quote John Lydon: \" Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\"  That's how I feel now.  Girl working our section was super nice and fast but the food and drank was crap.  No flavor.  Drinks were watery (even though we payed more for the Texana).  The salsa even tasted watered down.  Even for gringo\/messican this is bad.  Hell, even Cozumel up the road is better.  Aren't they all owned by the same people anyway?  I miss Mi Pueblo.  Maybe I will have to drive out to Painesville for real tacos...or hit up La Plaza, deal with the occasional hip, foodie type that seems to infested this bastion of Mexican grocery goodness and just make my own. \n\nLarga vida a la mano izquierda cabra
