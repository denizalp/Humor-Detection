Okay used to be a 5 quickly turned into a 1 star all because of one night my family & I had been screwed over by this place.. If you have a family of 4 or more be prepared to wait wait wait and watch everyone else eat & leave before you even get the sight of food. I really enjoyed getting the hot tea they bring to your table before your meal I didn't even receive that we got one pot for 8 people including children.. two people were served food after 2 hours I honestly question myself why we waited so long waited some more, two people in our family finished their meal and the rest of us were still waiting. Did not even refill water, told the server continuously that other guests were eating and leaving before we even got a plate of something...we decided to leave we expressed our frustration to the \"owner\" if that's what she even was and we refused to pay for nothing we received, we stormed out of there and she had the nerve to run out and record all of our license plates.. are you flipping kidding me.. no one was kidding when they told us \"all they care about is, you got your food right?\" The two out of eight people that came to dinner came back to the restaurant asked for them to please throw out the license plate numbers they \"sightly\" discounted the bill for the two plates & we now vow to never return to this crap hole of a restaurant. I will miss that lemon chicken but im sure there is another restaurant out there that would gladly appreciate our money than this place...\n\noh & I went into labor a few hours after this to top it all off. thanks little shanghai, thanks for sending me into labor....
