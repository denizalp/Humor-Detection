My rating might seem a bit harsh, given that they did a lot of things really well. But some of the transgressions were borderline offensive, which makes it hard to recommend this place to anybody.\n\nFirst, the things they did really well:\n- Service was very friendly and attentive\n- Seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly\n- Concept is fun, and the atmosphere was very cool\n\nThese are good things, and the staff at Captain's Boil should be proud of them. What I cannot abide though, is the value you get for what you pay. That, and some of the stingy approaches to the menu items made me feel like I'd been robbed after eating there.\n\nWe ordered the shrimp and the king crab legs, and both were cooked perfectly. But the king crab was $35 for a SINGLE LEG. I don't care how well you cook it, that's ridiculous and misleading, given the pictures of multiple legs on the menu. Similarly, the menu shows a crawfish boil with corn and sausage. But they still don't have crawfish, and all the other items in that picture are extra. So we ordered corn for $1, and we got half of a corn on the cob. Seriously, that's so thrifty it's almost shameful. \n\nIn summary:\n- The quality of the food is great, but the prices are unreasonable given the small portions and the simplicity of what's being offered (seafood boiled in a bag with one of four sauces, and then \"plated\" in said bag). \n- It's a novel concept, but it's also a cheap way of cooking, and the price should reflect that. Novelty is not enough to justify what's being charged for a single crab leg. \n\nI get that the rent on Yonge Street isn't cheap and the grand opening discount helped make the price easier to swallow. Even after the discount though, you can get more food for less at Red Lobster, and they at least have the decency to offer free biscuits. In the future, I'm just going to go there instead, or better yet, buy the giant crab legs from Costco and just do it myself.
