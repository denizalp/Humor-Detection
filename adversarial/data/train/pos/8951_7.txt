I'm giving the KIDS MEALS 4 stars. So much BETTER than McDonald's!! Their chicken nuggets are better than McDonald's. They also offer a grilled cheese, which is pretty tasty, burgers, hot dogs and corn dogs as choices for their kid's meals.\n\nServing fresh, hot food is a challenge for this location!! I usually go through the drive thru, do a temperature check and park my ass at one of the spots with a menu and a speaker and request the food be replaced with fresh, hot food. \n\nYou have your choice of apple slices, tator tots or french fries and your choice of so MANY drink options, including lots of frozen frosty flavors!! I usually stick with chocolate milk for our guy but a frosty is a nice treat sometimes!\n\nThe toys are cool and the price is right!! From $2.99 to $3.39.
