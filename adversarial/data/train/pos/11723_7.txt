My wife is a die hard but that's because she grew up eating here. I can say this is not a bad place for food. They make a good everything. \n\nWe had \n2x 3 way burrito green chili, red chili and bean with green sauce on top. \n1x Pollo fundito with rice (excellent)\nA ton of chips and salsa \nThe bill was slightly over $20...lol freaking MCD'S is more.
