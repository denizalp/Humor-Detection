I'm just not impressed. I recently moved back to the East Side after living in San Diego for a few years and have been craving sushi. My hometown friends talked really highly of shuhei so I decided to try it. There was really nothing impressive about it, and I think the high rating is because it's a local spot, not actually high quality. People who say they've been going here for years and think it's great are reviewing out of ignorance of what good sushi and Japanese really is. Our table of 7 split many orders or rolls and sashimi and none of it stood out. The fish tasted like it was in the fridge for too long and any vegetables in the rolls tasted low quality. The best word I can describe the sushi as is stale. The salad tasted like a prepackaged lettuce mix. The calamari was the one saving grace of the dinner.
