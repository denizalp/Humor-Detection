This isn't the best musical I've seen.  But at the same time it was pretty amazing what they did with the backdrops, costumes, and making people into lion creatures.  \n\nLittle Simba's voice kind of bothered me.  Over-enthusiasm or something.  Nala did a good job and so did large Simba.  Rafikii was definitely a hit and so was Pumba and Timone.  \n\nIf you've seen the cartoon, the story line is exactly the same thing.  Maybe if it was different, I woulda been a little more captivated.
