I wish I didn't even have to give them ANY stars.  I didn't have the experience like the previous reviewer because we didn't use them.  Had them over for a free estimate and they were THE MOST expensive out of EVERYBODY we saw. Wanted to tile the living rm. and den and quoted a price of like $4500 dollars!  Only brought out 2 samples for us to choose from.  Just awful.  The were nickle and diming us for EVERYTHING.  Husband ended up doing the entire tiling job HIMSELF and did a BETTER job then the professionals and saved a ton of money.  Their commercials are a JOKE, they are NOT the least expensive, just the opposite.
