By far the foulest la fitness in the area.   So dirty,  not maintained, never cleaning supplies for equipment, stinks, mold and rust on machines.   The locker rooms are absolutely rancid and leaving them makes me feel like I need to shower in bleach.   If you're considering joining LA fitness, don't make this one your home base.   Paying $69 per month for cool springs is worth it.   It's clean, they have antibacterial wipes for equipment, the locker rooms and equipment is well maintained and worth the cost.
