Horrible horrible horrible. Not only was this place overrated, but good luck getting through their TSA security check. They opened my chapstick, tried to get all CSI on my tampon too see if it was unopened (which was pretty embarrassing to do so openly out in public) and we were treated as if we were sneaking in a boatload of drugs. Once you get through the fake renta cop security check, you get to the lackluster crowd and overpriced cabanas. \nThis place may be good if there is a performance taking place, but the staff\/security is rude and really put a damper on our trip (especially when we weren't hiding anything or doing anything wrong). \n\nWe went to the pool at the SLS at the Stratosphere... WAYYYYY better crowd and music so check them out for sure!! Cabanas were VERY reasonably priced as well.
