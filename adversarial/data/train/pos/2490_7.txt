I like wine. I like witty placards describing the wine and what you should\/could pair it with. I like wine tasting. So, overall, I like Winestore. \n\nPrices here are pretty reasonable, and there's a taste profile and price range for just about anyone. The store lends itself to meandering about, taking in the wine and checking out the different vintages. I'm also a big fan of the free tastings that the Winestore offers...weekly? I'm not sure, but it seems fairly often. There's also something to be said about buying a bottle of wine here and having the pleasure of taking into Yama Asian Fusion next door with no corkage fee! Hooray!\n\nWhile the service here is fine, I wouldn't mind a few more smiles and a bit more attention. The few times I've stopped in I haven't felt incredibly welcomed...but hey...I'm happy to welcome myself...with an extra large tasting, please.
