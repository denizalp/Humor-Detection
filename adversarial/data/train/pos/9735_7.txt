This Starbucks is just really useful for the tired, overworked, and wired. People like us NEED this place! We need a place to sit down, relax, and continue to work. This Starbucks is like my home. I use it to study for exams because it has a big seating area and it's open 24\/7. However, even though I need coffee to get through life, I wouldn't say Sbux serves the absolute best coffee. They also have the worst coffee shop food in general! Everything I eat is always stale or odd tasting. But, man, is getting frappes and sweet drinks here addictive!! I just can't get enough of it!!! \n\nSome of my favorite drinks include: Java Chip (my everyday drink), Shaken Iced Passion Tea Sweetened (my diet drink haha), and Caramel Apple Spice (my feel good drink on a cold night). \n\nOh, make no mistake, you'll definitely catch me here at finals week!
