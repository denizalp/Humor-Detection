\"Oh! When You Are in Calgary, You Absolutely Positively Have to Go To Nicks\"\n\n\nOk, I been there, done that, and I can tell you that you do NOT absolutely positively have to go to Nicks.\n\nIt's a steakhouse with Italian options.\n\nThe steaks are no different than the steaks you can get at any of the top 50% of steakhouses anywhere you go.\n\nNot tough. Not tremendously tasty but good enough.\n\nAnd the steaks come at steakhouse prices (Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow.)\n\nBeing no fool and facing paying that amount of money I got my top sirloin au poivre. This way if the meat was run of the mill, the sauce had a chance of saving it.\n\nWell, I tried the meat naked. The meat was nothing special. The peppercorn sauce was very good. So I had a decent meal.\n\nBaked potatoes are served in foil.\n\nThis is what the people want. \n\nI can't blame Nick for serving the potatoes the customer wants. But baking a potato in foil gives you a steamed poorly textured potato that needs a lot of butter or sour cream to save it. Baking a potato naked rather than steaming it in foil gives you a flavorful well textured potato.\n\nVegetables were quite nice.\n\nSalad? Zzzzzzzz.\n\nThe red meat hater at the table got the salmon with french fries on the side. She gave this plate a solid thumbs up.\n\nThe other dishes on the menu may be pretty good.\n\nAnd I am pretty fussy about steak houses.\n\n(You can buy good steaks at a good butcher or grocery store and make a better steak at home than you get in restaurants. Supposedly prime steaks are not always so prime.)\n\nCraig Claiborne once said, if someone gave him a good steak, he would prefer to grind it up and use flavor ingredients to make an amazing meatloaf.\n\nI think he knew something about cooking beef.
