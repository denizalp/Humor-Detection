I was vistiting lv and my friends brought me to this place.  \n\nOne star for the great food but minus four stars for the horrible service from Michelle.  \n\nIf your place closes at 1030p on saturday, please change your sign from 11p to the correct time!   Maybe you wouldnt have felt the need to rush our orders, payment and time out.  Really? Did you have to turn off ALL the lights on us while we were eating? And the immature attitude afterwards while speeding away from the place?  Unprofessional and definitely not acceptable.
