So I've been here before. A loooong time ago. I only come here when my coworker wants it and i fly for it. This place is so overrated. \nWhen you come in your greeted by a glum person at the counter. \nI only come here for breakfast, of course they only have 3 breakfast sandwiches. And ONE of them is vegetarian!  They have a side of potatoes, oh but only on Saturdays and after 1030. They're called welcome chicken and donuts but they have no chicken sandwiches on the breakfast menu. You have to come after 1030 for that...\nWhat are you welcome to? A soup kitchen? You can eat only what they have at that time...they serve certain things at certain times...Even though their 'claim' to fame is chicken...today they had a whole rack of chicken just sitting there behind the counter...at 855am. But they're not serving it until after 1030...
