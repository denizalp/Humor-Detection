Have you seen the Onion video on YouTube about the new keyboard-less Mac laptop where the guy being interviewed says \"I'll buy almost anything if it's shiny and made by Apple?\" Yeah, that pretty much sums up the Lux clientele. But don't get me wrong, I love me some Lux. \n\nSoy latte with a blob of whipped cream and fun patterns in the foam? Love it.\nVelvet latte with a blob of whipped cream and fun patterns in the foam? Love it.\nCroissant bread pudding with a blob of whipped cream to spoon into the fun patterns in the foam? Love it.\n\nPeople watching, alterna-hip vibing, Macbook-ing...Lux is the place to be for yummy fancy coffee and surrounding yourself with people who wonder, \"Are you genuine?\" (I was glad to see they finally changed that little message)\n\nHere's a fun game my husband and I played the first time we went there (on a chilly chilly day): watch all the people coming in the door that doesn't automatically close behind them, and try to guess which ones are conscientious and take a second to close it firmly. It's about 70:30 in favor of the assholes. We sat there with our Macs and our indie-band TShirts and smugged it up in the knowledge that we are so much better than, well, everyone.\n\nMore fun games to play at Lux: \n1)count the Obama bumper stickers on the cars in the lot\n2)count the Prius's (Prii?) (OK, one is mine)\n3)count the Macs\n4)count the non-Macs, then point and laugh at him\n5)count the hair colors\nOh, it goes on. But I kid. I go there every time I have a day off.
