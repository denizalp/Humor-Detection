The food here is amazing! but not the service I'm sad to say. Servers are extremely rude. what happen was my friend ordered a coke and was given a straw that had a hole in the middle which he couldn't drink out of. He politely asked the server for a new straw because there was a hole in the straw and rudely he replied that's the hole you drink out of. love the sushi but hate the service.
