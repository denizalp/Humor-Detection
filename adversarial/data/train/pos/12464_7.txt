Large selection and big showroom. This location used to be a Kay Bee Toy store a couple decades ago. Still has that vibe and plenty of room to run around with your Lego cars attached to a string.\n\nWent here looking for some New Leather for the living room. Been to most of the other stores including the really expensive ones off of N. Scottsdale Road. Most of the cheaper stores have either really thin leather or a mixture of cow parts and plastic like cheap sausage casing. The more expensive stores in Scottsdale are very nice but out of our current budget.\n\nCame in knowing what I wanted and met up with Jett at the front door. Just like the airplane. He was very friendly and most informative. I told him what I was looking for and what I was expecting and he took me directly over to a few choices that were just right. Nice!\n\nWent home and got the wife and came back that same evening. I typically know what she wants. The biggest issue is that I am tall and she is a bit vertically challenged. Found a Couch in a style she liked with a matching Chair in a slightly different style that fit my larger physique. 100% top grain leather for a reasonable price and no monkey bidness.\n\nDelivery was just when they predicted. Noticed a small defect in the stitching on one of the items and called customer service. They were happy to send out a replacement the SAME DAY to correct the issue. \n\nAsk for Jett and tell him Mr. Mark sent you. SCORE!
