Wow. My fiance and I came here for valentine's day after reading all of the wonderful reviews on yelp. I'm starting to wonder how many of the wonderful reviews on here are fake. I thought the food (besides the steak) tasted absolutely horrible.  The heirloom tomato and onion salad was gross. It had a vinegarette on it that tasted very odd and bland. The blue cheese crumbles on top even tasted terrible, because of the dressing. I was barely able to eat one slice of tomato, even after trying to season it with salt, pepper, and more vinegar. I'm pretty sure the waiter could tell that I didn't enjoy the dish when he came over and I had him take away the full plate of food, but he never said anything or asked. A good restaurant,would have been concerned that they had an unhappy guest. So that was weird... \n\nOur steak was delicious & perfectly medium-rare. The sides that we ordered, the  corn and the mashed potatoes were not good.  They both tasted like hospital\/cafeteria food. We each had a few bites and that was all we could stomach before having them take that away as well.  It was very disappointing. Also, the bread was served on a paper doily and looked like a cheap hamburger bun, I should have known better as soon as I saw that, it was a great predictor of what was to come. \n\nAnother thing I didn't like about this place was the overly bright lighting and the close proximity to other patrons. It was so unromantic.  And the decor was bad too, it was very late '90's\/early 00's-ish.  I could have sworn I was at Sizzler, not a nice steakhouse.  \n\nI should also note that we didn't appear to be the only unhappy guests that night, because we were so close to the other guests & it was so bright, we got to see and hear it all.
