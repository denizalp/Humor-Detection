I love love loved my time here last weekend at Marquee. I can say that it definitely made up for the first time that I came here.. The first time wasn't so successful.. but this time I had a lot of fun!\n\nThe lines are ALWAYS super long so be prepared.. remember... money buys you things... lol\n\nGot in around 1130-12, this was extremely late for us, we usually never go to clubs this late in Vegas but we were lagging as usual.\n\nDrinks are very expensive, bottle service is even worse.. but it is definitely a great time here.\n\nGood music, good company and GOOD TIMES.
