So, my dad and I went to go surprise my mom on a business trip. We drove 1700 miles from Indianapolis IN. I was pretty impressed. First that it was 65 degrees in January (hello Shorts and T-shirt) and further more how fancy it actually looked. \n\nWe roll up, Park the car on the ramp, I begin to head in, As usual an over zealous valet comes up. Much like a remora waiting to feed on the scraps of the shark. He comes up, first impression, total douche. Started talking down to me like I was some child. One star gone. \n\nI drive an OLD van, I mean like people were saying \"Damn that thing made it all the way from Indianapolis?!?\" So she's rickety. Anyway, While sitting on the ramp my radiator explodes. Sending radiator fluid EVERYWHERE!!!!! Then the valet (who I will gladly call out), Brock, went into \"GET TO THE CHOPPAH\" mode and told me to move my car ASAP. So as he continued to talk down to me explaining how \"Important\" it was that we move the car because it'll stain the ramp (which I can respect) and how it's so annoying when that happens because HE has to clean it up every time. \n\nI used to be a valet, I understand when cars break down, I know how to fix it. I ALSO know how do deal with it when the ramp gets slammed. This guy did not. He was in all essence, a little bitch. A week later I spoke to management. I called them up a few months later and they said the problem had been taken care of... Which in hotel terms means \"Slapped on the wrist\"\n\nAside from all of that bull crap. I had a pretty nice time. Great staff (aside from A-hole Brock.) and a wonderful neighborhood! I had a great time! \n\nWhile you're there, pick an orange! I hear they're divine!\n\nUPDATE (6 years later): \n\nI had a few people reach out to me to ask if the van was ok to drive back. I got it fixed in AZ. Super cheap. She ran for another 3 years before giving up the ghost in late 2014.
