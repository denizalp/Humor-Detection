I will always have a soft spot for Bally's.  I stayed in their penthouse after it was redone and it was absolutely beautiful.  We got treated like kings and queens and the staff was very nice.  Even better than the room was the location of this hotel.  I think that this and Planet Hollywood are arguably the best hotel location wise on the strip.  You really are in the middle of everything.  I even stayed in their regular rooms, they are ok, a little outdated but it's also not the most expensive hotel ever.  I will definitely be back.  Negatives are how long the check in line is and if you are staying in one of their regular rooms, they still just seem a little outdated.
