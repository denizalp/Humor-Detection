Just had the worst experience at Shucks after being a long term customer.\n\n Arrived and took a seat at the bar, thought I would order dinner. Was promptly greeted and given a menu then asked If I would like something to drink. Ordered a drink and took a look at the menu. The female wait person went back to talking with her friend and play on her cell phone about THREE FEET away. Since I have eaten at Shucks many times, I knew what I wanted to order. The wait person continued to talk and play for another ten minutes. A short time later another customer arrived and took a seat next to the other customer. Now there are three customers sitting next to each other at the bar and the wait person continues to talk and play on her cell phone all the time ignoring me. I thought I would give it a little time and see if this waiter is interested in taking my order. After sitting again, three feet away from the wait person and never being given the opportunity to order dinner. I got up and walked out. That was fifteen minutes of wasted time. \n\nThis female waiter has got to be the worst example of how to treat customers. She was more interested in her cell phone and talking with her friends rather than do her job.  My pervious experiences with Shucks over the years has been very good. \n\nHonestly, I don't know if I will ever return again.\n\nIf it were possible to give zero stars after this experience I would give it negative stars.
