All right, the pic, I know, I was super hungry. I'd had a long day climbing trees, lookin for food, I was starved. But the club sandwich was AWESOME. It only used two slices of bread so, maybe it's not a traditional club. The bread was toasted and buttered though, think grilled cheese bread, w\/ club sandwich filling. It was legit unreal, best club I've had in 8.6 years, which is huge on the Richter scale. W\/ the club you get a side,\nSweet potatoes fried,\nJust like the dude, \nYou should abide.\nThis jaunt is a good spot. Crowd can be a little rowdy, they have regulars, they have travelers, gypsies and marsupials. Any hotel bar that pays enough attention to its local scene to have rotating drafts, is good enough to check out. This place is good enough to do a double take.
