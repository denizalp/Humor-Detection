I've been to Pomegranate Cafe a couple times now.  Today I was really inspired to write a review.\n\nThe first time I went to Pomegranate Cafe, a neighbor and I popped in for breakfast.  The food was just okay for both of us.  It was nothing special.  I should mention that we both got egg dishes that day, though I can't quite say what we ordered back then.  \n\nToday I was low on groceries in the house, so I decided to bring the family here for breakfast.\n\nMy daughter ordered the pumpkin bread french toast, which came with fruit (some sliced apples and pears (I think) and a coconut milk ice cream sundae for dessert (topped with Vegan chocolate syrup and Vegan whipped cream).  She loved it, but the portion was quite small.  She is 4 and a light eater and she ate all her french toast in about two minutes.  I cannot imagine an 8 or 10 year old getting filled up on this portion size.\n\nI ordered the Lumberjack (made vegan) with tofu and vegan cheese. The sandwich was just alright, but the accompaniment was pretty yummerific.  I love sweet potatoes and yams, so anything with them included is already a head above!\n\nDH had the teriyaki \"chicken\" bowl and it not only looked fab, it was DELICIOUS.  \nNeedless to say, \"I'll have what (he's) having.\"  Maybe I am just a fan of mock meats!  \n\nThe expansion is great, but even at 10:30 on a Sunday... The place wasn't packed.  \n\nWith waters all around, our bill came to $30 post tax and tip.  \n\n*Once again, I wasn't thrilled about tipping at the register.  I need to start carrying cash for these situations. \n\nI will definitely be back to Pomegranate Cafe!  I can't wait to try their whole menu. :)
