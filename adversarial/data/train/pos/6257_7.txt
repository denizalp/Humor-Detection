Flirting between three to three and a half stars for Kaiju. I shared the Chicken Katsu with my co-worker during lunch in the office ($8.00). The chicken was fried well. It was tender, juicy, crispy. The main drawback was the thin cut of meat. A lower grade rice was used, as another reviewer had also mentioned. The grained lacked the traditional slightly sticky texture of Japanese uruchimai rice. \n\nMy colleague response was, \"four pieces of chicken for almost $10...I think I paid $5 for the sauce\". Realistically, the sauce, rice, protein and cole slaw could have easily fit in a small takeout contained. (Ritz Caribbean Foods has been exceling at that for years! Take notes Kaiju! ) \n\nWhile the flavours were great, we both agree it was overpriced.
