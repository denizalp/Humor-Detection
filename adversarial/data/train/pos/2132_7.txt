The Chandelier is a very chill lounge located in the center of the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  This 3 story lounge is inside a huge Chandelier. The Veil of Crystal changes it color every few minutes.  It is something I have NEVER seen before.\n\nPrices are reasonable for a Vegas Lounge.  It's a nice place to go to just to hang out.  We came here right before the lines opened at Marquee. \n\nI think Cosmopolitan is my new Favorite Hotel in Vegas!
