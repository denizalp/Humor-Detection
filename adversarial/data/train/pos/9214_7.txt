Do yourself a favor and don't rent here.\n\nIf you have an early morning job, you probably will not get sufficient sleep because people scream and yell at the pool often past midnight.  The security guard does not do his job in keeping people quiet after 10pm.  \n\nKids scream and shriek from noon until midnight at the pool and courtyard and will give you headaches, even with all of your doors and windows closed.\n\nI love to swim, but I am afraid to use the pool because there are tons of toddlers in it daily.\n\nOur rent was raised 18% at once.\n\nThe only good thing is that the fitness center is kept very clean and the staff is professional.
