Soooooooooooooo, I've moved to North Las Vegas for about a month now, and it's semi-tough finding potential regulars because the majority of the food here seems to be on the unhealthy side and non-Asian.  I mean...ethnicity charts do indicate this zip code to have under 5% of Asians...so that's expected I suppose.  Hence my somewhat generous rating for China Gourmet.  It's the most Asian Chinese restaurant I've found in North Las Vegas...so far.   Upon opening the doors, I see employees and customers who are all Asian--a rare sight around this area.  Looking at the menu, I see a large variety of options--both authentic and Americanized options.\n\nThis place is pretty good considering the gigantic portions!  I came here during the weekday for lunch and got one of the lunch special items: kung pao combination ($6.75).  It came with shrimp, beef, and chicken.  It had plenty of veggies and protein with plenty of flavor (maybe too much?).  The rice was okay.  The chow mein was a bit better.  The meal came with an egg drop soup that had corn in it.  It was pretty good with nice consistency.  As for the drinks, I wouldn't recommend the honeydew fruit slush with boba ($3.50) though--it tastes very artificial, but the tapioca balls themselves were chewy and tasty.  I might try a safer option like a non-fruit drink next time.  \n\nOverall, I'll come back.  Until then, I will slave away in my residency program until I get to see sunlight again.
