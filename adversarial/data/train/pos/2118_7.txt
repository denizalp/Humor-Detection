Cool interior, average service, but food was a little disappointing. \n\nWe came in on a Friday night and had made a reservation, but the restaurant was only about half full. We were seated quickly and were brought chips and salsa. Salsa was good but chips were really stale (like they were made two days ago). We mentioned this to the server and he kindly brought us a fresh batch. We started with the Mexican street corn and ceviche. No complaints about the street corn, but the ceviche was bland. It was almost like there was no lime\/citrus at all, which was strange. Enchiladas (verde) were okay. \n\nAll in all, our experience was a 3\/5. Nothing really stood out and gave us a reason to return.
