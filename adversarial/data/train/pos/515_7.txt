This Best Western is nice overall, but compared to all the others we have stayed in, it gets one star because of it's breakfast policy. Stayed here with my family on our way back from Montana to California. There are five of us, my mom and dad, my two brothers and I. There is \"free\" breakfast, but they only gave us two breakfast cards, and my younger brother eats free since he's under 12. If you want breakfast, and you don't have a breakfast card, they charge you $10 a person. What kind of BS is this? We have stayed in many Best Westerns in the past, and it has always been free breakfast for all guests, no need for the stupid breakfast cards. ( we stayed in a Best Western in Idaho Falls on our way up to Montana, and they didn't do this stupid breakfast policy) We already paid over $100 plus $20 for my puppy.( the only reason we stayed here, because they were dog friendly)  never staying here again.
