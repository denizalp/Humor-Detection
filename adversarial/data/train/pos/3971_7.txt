The Venetian wants to throw them out for obscenity violations. Why is it that whenever a truly Amazing Club opens in the US, someone wants to get rid of it and generally succeeds?  \n\nMoulin Rouge mixed with Eyes Wide Shut. Go before it is gone. Truly nothing like it and while some of the stage shows offended my conservative values I didn't throw the baby out with the bathwater.  Cirque's sexy show put me to sleep but this, true perfection.  If these guys get over the pain of losing Vegas, I will make it a point to vacation wherever they relocate to.\n\nMy new hotel of choice is now the Cosmopolitan. Grrrr Venetian and the Board of Sups that will likely support them.
