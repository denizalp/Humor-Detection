If I wasn't such a slacker, I'd be the first one to review this place.  Never too late though.  I've been here a bunch of times and love it.  I get the freshly made smoothies and juices to go on the regular.  The interior is fabulous, rich, and inviting.  The booths are insanely comfortable.  These guys mix up the great drinks you would expect from a Speakeasy type place.  Lots of beers and a nice wine list too.  The servers are always on it.  I tip my hat to the Chef.  Brilliant menu creation.  I am currently at the Panorama welcome happy hour with the samples coming around and can tell you this Chef is straight killing it.   There is even a pantry with beers to go, delicious deli items, and what have you.  Outdoor seating with cool strip views.  This place has it all.\n\nIf you come to The Blind Pig, chances are you will find me.
