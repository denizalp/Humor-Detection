Trader Joes, fro yo, nail salon, restaurants, a wine bar, shopping, soon-to-be drug store and now a bagel shop. Yes, this area absolutely needed the bagel shop addition! This is a pretty general Einstein Bagels but it's clean, in a good area, has friendly staff and the bagels are fresh and tasty! \n\nI really like how Einstein Bagels added thin bagels to their menu. I love their bagels but they can be to hearty for a breakfast, so the thin bagel is a great option. I also enjoy the bagel bites and bagel sandwiches (breakfast and lunch) as well. The cream cheeses are creamy and delicious, especially the honey almond cream cheese. My favorite bagel is the cinnamon sugar bagel. They also have great soda drinks, coffee, fruit, parfait and juices. \n\nThere isn't much more to say other than that this is a perfect addition to the area and I'm happy to have an Einstein's close by for my morning breakfast urges.
