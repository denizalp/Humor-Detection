I went here on a date and we started with the veggie spring rolls. They were the non-fried kind and were better than I was expecting (although more basil would have made them perfect). For an entree I had the Pad Prik Khing with Tofu and it was pretty good. You can do a spiciness rating of 1-5 so that helps adjust to your personal liking (I had a 3 and it was just the right amount of chili pepper). The staff split their tips so you get your food delivered to your table immediately and all of the waitresses were really good at making sure you had enough water.
