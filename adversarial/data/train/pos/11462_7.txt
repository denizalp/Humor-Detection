Red chille Carne is the best. Every Wednesday they have special priced menu where meals are 7.95 and kids eat for 1.50. Such a great deal and it is very filling. The food is always fresh and hot when they sever you. Bean dip and salsa with chips when u first arrive, um I'm good. Definitely recommend this place for any occasion.
