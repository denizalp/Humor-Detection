After researching about semi permanent makeup for brows aka microblading, I decided to trust Tiffany at Succulent Brows. She has extensive before and after pictures on Facebook and Instagram which helped in making my decision. \nShe started off by penciling in my brows. She was very meticulous in measuring the angles on my face to get the most appropriate brows for my face. Then she showed me the brows and I was able to tweak however I wanted. She also made suggestions and took my concerns carefully. There was also option on the colors. \nNext came the numbing process. It was little painful in the beginning but as the numbing medicine is continuously applied, the pain gets less and less. Overall,  very tolerable. \nThe process of blading in the brows was as easy as relaxing on a massage table. The best part was when she showed me the end result. The shape and color was spot on! I was so surprised how natural they looked. I am absolutely in love with my brows. I have very sparse brows and I'm not very good at applying makeup, so Tiffany will be doing my brows from now on. \nTiffany sent me home with after care instructions and retouch appointment. I sort of want to keep Tiffany a secret but at the same time I want her to stay in business so I can continue to go to her. She is a gem; highly recommend!!!
