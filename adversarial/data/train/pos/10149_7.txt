Come on Drai's!!  You are killing me with this music. I'm partying at you right now as we speak, fingers crossed praying for some deep or tech house. Wait. Am I really at drai's??  All I hear is hip hop.... I must be hallucinating. Maybe I teleported to Pure?!  It's a living nightmare. Homies humping leg left and right. Wait... Wait... Now it's a slow song!!  Hey Drake thank you for putting us all to sleep. If the DJ's goal was to clear this place out he is succeeding with valor. I WANT TO PARTY AND CAPTAIN LAME RAP ISN'T LETTING ME!!!!!
