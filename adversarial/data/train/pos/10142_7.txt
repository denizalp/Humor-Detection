I used to go to this spot on a somewhat regular occasion. When me and a few of my girlfriends would get to together for our Pho dates we would come here because two of them really liked the place. \n\nI recently went last week because a new friend loves this place and it was nice to be reacquainted. I quickly remembered why never minded coming to this place and I also remembered why I stopped coming.\n\nI got my typical bowl of Pho. The special combo, extra tendon. They slacked on the extra tendon. They were very skimpy with my extra tendon, you never would have thought that I had asked for extra tendon. \n\nBut they win almost hands down for their flavor of broth. It was perfect for me. It is intense with its aroma, delicious in its taste and if I had to it plain with no condiments I would and could. But of course, I always add a ton of siricha, fish sauce and sambal. \n\nWhere they lose me is the funky tinge of silver, green and purple on their meat. Maybe I am over picky or too sensitive to this. But this is completely unacceptable to me and my standards. \n\nI also ordered their charbroiled pork spring roll and I am not a fan of how they are open on the ends instead of being closed in. \n\nI would come back here again. I just wouldn't order the Pho which is sad for me because I LOVE their broth. Maybe I could order a beef ball Pho instead.
