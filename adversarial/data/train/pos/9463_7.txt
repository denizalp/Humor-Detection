Yup, this is just another greasy spoon with a busted sign out front, but it's got an authentic, nostalgic feel to it that I found comforting while waiting for my take-out order. Maybe the 4 star rating is partly because we were ravenously hungry, and I couldn't fill my food hole fast enough by the time we got home, with the burger, fries and rings replacing all conscious thought until every last morsel was consumed, but whatever, it was awesome. The wife and I exchanged a look afterwords, one that expressed quiet thanks that this restaurant was close, but not too close.
