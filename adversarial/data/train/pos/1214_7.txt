This Silver Mine has 2 strikes against it that apply before even entering the building:  It's on the same strip of vomit streaked pavement as Kam's and C.O.'s, and one of its other neighbors on the same strip is a Subway.\n\nSo why do I go there every time I have to buy lunch on campus?  Well, there are no scary cross-eyed employees there talking on their cell phones instead of making sandwiches (as at subway.)  Instead there is a totally friendly crew of regular sub-makers, as well as a delicious and satisfying selection of subs.  YUM!
