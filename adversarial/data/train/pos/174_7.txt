Absolute best place to refill water. The guy that is usually working is friendly and respectful. They have a huge selection of all things water bottle. I love that I can drive over after work and he always there to fill up the bottles for me. Great price and he will often give me a free bottle of water with my water fill up. Great customer service. They also offer the alkaline water and with their convenient hours and friendly service I can't imagine going anywhere else.
