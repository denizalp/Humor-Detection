Two and a half stars.\n\nThis Loblaws proves that size does not matter. This seems like a huge store that would have lots of selection, but everytime I go, I am let down.\n\nThe last time was before a camping trip. I came in with such high hopes, took a special streetcar trip thinking \"this is going to be the only store I need to visit. They'll have everything on my list.\" BOY, was I wrong! \nExample 1: you need graham crackers to go camping, right? What's camping without smores? The only box - seriously! 1 box! - was large enough for 10 camping trips and cost almost $10. I do not need THAT MANY graham crackers for camping. Strike one\nExample 2: pizza sauce in a plastic container. For adding to pizza when you make it at home. I looked everywhere. If they do sell it, it's well hidden. Guess what? Strike two\nExample 3: Dehydrated milk. No luck anywhere. I looked near the carnation canned milk, and near the real milk. They even had a section for milk replacements, but it was Lactaid and soy milk. Nothing useful for camping. Are you seeing a pattern here? Strike three for the big Loblaws. Yea, it's big. But big is not better. (I also couldn't find pesto there, but really you don't want my whole shopping list, do you?)\n\nSo, I went back to Yonge and St. Clair to the within-walking-distance Sobeys(http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/sobeys-toronto-2)  and guess what?? They had EVERYTHING on my list and then some. Damn, Should have gone there in the first place. Lesson learned.
