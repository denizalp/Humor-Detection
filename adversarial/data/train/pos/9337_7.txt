I love trying local coffee shops. This Hawaiian coffee shop will definitely be a return visit for me in the future. \n\nWe ordered an iced coconut latte and an almond joy latte. Both were delicious and the coffee was strong. Enough to give you that extra pep in your step that will get your through the day. \n\nStaff was friendly and the atmosphere was super chill....music wasn't blaring too loud either. This place is a great alternative if you don't want your usual Starbucks drinks.
