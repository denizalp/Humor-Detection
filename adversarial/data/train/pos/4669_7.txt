Well, I reviewed CJ's awhile ago and later decided to close my account not realizing my review would be gone .... Sooooooo I'm back.\n\nWhat can I say?  I've lived in this \"small town\" that thinks it's a big city since 06' having been born and raised on the east coast in Philadelphia.  One of my FAVORITE childhood memories is Pop's Water Ice in South Philly.  It was staple for me every weekend visiting my dad - back then we only had lemon, cherry, chocolate and vanilla (brown).  \n\nFor the past six years - I've missed water ice dearly especially when it's hot outside. I was SOOOO happy when I tried this place that we come back at least once or twice a week.\n\nThe owner and staff are personable, friendly and provide great customer service.  \nThe flavors are great and not overly sweet as compared to places like Rita's where your ice turns into a watery syrupy mess.   \n\nI'm still partial to my chocolate ice but I've tried just about every flavor they make and now that they're making my all time favorite mint chocolate chip cream ice - you can't get any better.\n\nPrices won't break they bank and loyalty cards to boot.  \n\nEVERYONE should try CJ's oh and I'm not normally a custard girl but the custard is great as well.\n\nSide note:  Was reading some of the other reviews - I've never had bad service in this place so perhaps you guys\/gal went in with a bad attitude? We've always been treated with a smile from day 1. Mmmmmmmm - I love pink Amoxicillin - it was my childhood favorite.  I'll have to be sure to try the watermelon ASAP.
