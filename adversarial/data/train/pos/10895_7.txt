Came in around 3:15. I ordered wine & a soup. Waitress behind the bar was fantastic.  Shift change happened at 4:00 & the new waitress has totally ignored me.  After 30 minutes she hasn't said one word to me & there are only 5 people at the bar!!!  I want to order food but I may have to leave before I have the chance.\nFinally got my food & it was delicious.
