Is it weird to visit a pet store on vacation? Whatever, I did. After I got myself some sweet Canadian outerwear, I wanted to find a coat for my dog.\n\nThis place had it! Shedrow, a Canadian brand of dog coats is IT. Got a cute coat for my pup, and was tempted by many of their other offerings, but a girl's suitcase is only so large.\n\nThis shop had a great selection of all sorts of pet products, and way nicer outerwear (Duh, it's Canadian) than anyplace I've seen in the US.
