Rising Star has risen in the east. Finally.\n\nI walk in and automatically love the ambiance. Located in Little Italy, along a cobbled road, in a university neighborhood; the shop itself is a refurbished home that on the inside looks like a New York loft.\n\nIf Folger's coffee is first wave, and Starbucks is second wave, then Rising Star is among the third wave of coffee shops that offer sophistication and opulence at a step above. For lattes, they offered me two blends: a mellow blend and a lively blend. I took the mellow blend and hands down, it was among the best cups of Joe I've ever had in Cleveland; rich, creamy, nutty, complex and flavorful.\n\nFor many years, Europeans, Italians in particular, have made fun of the American taste for watered-down coffee. In fact, the name \"Cafe Americano\" came to be, because this is what they had to serve American GIs in WW2 to cater to that preference. With Cleveland gems like Rising Star, Pour and Phoenix; we have something that serious coffee lovers can savor, and that might rival the stuff they serve across the pond, and at way less than the overpriced 5 to 10 Euros. It is rather fitting that this shop finally took root in Little Italy.\n\nParking is a challenge. But in the morning or off-lunch and off-dinner hours, the parking lot at Michelangelo's restaurant across the street is empty. But no, that's their parking lot and I would never recommend parking there. I did not do it, no sir, that would have been frowned upon.
