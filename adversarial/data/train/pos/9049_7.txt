I've lived in Berea my whole life. I'm very familiar with Scoundrels. When I heard they got a brick oven and a \"chef\" I thought I would revisit. Let me tell you that they may have a brick oven but they don't know how to use it. The pizza looks nice but it it's over sauced and the cheese is gross and not carmelized. I thought I would give the place a second chance and brought my family for dinner. Boy was I embarrassed! The prime rib steaks were lousy 1\/2 inch thick. My brother said the ribs were awful. And everything was overpriced.  I won't be back. This \"chef\" hasn't earned that title yet. He needs a lot more experience before he can call himself a chef and he aint going to get it on my dime! Don't let them fool you it is still Scoundrels!
