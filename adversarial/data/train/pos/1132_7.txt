Meh.\nI'm a bar fly so the weird service aspect never really affected me. I roll in, plop in a barstool, game on.\n\nThe service was very mediocre both times I've gone. \n\nThe bartender I had the first time seemed very aloof, not friendly. Some of the other staff were however, which seemed strange. I had a couple of beers and an appetizer and though it wasn't bad, it wasn't anything special.\nMy second visit I had the El Diablo burger and a couple of cocktails. Both were quite good, but again the staff did not at all seem like they wanted to be there, no smiles, fairly inattentive. I had opportunity to mention this to a manager and was accused by them of seeming annoyed, which was exceptionally odd. \n\nOverall, there's really nothing that would cause me to return. If you have low expectations this is the place for you.
