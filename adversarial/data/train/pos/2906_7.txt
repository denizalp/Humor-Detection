EVERYONE! MGM has been remodeled! We stayed this past weekend (1\/20-1\/22).\nI love the new furniture, NEW FLAT SCREENS(finally), the scheme is elegant and super modern, everything was clean, holy crap the bathroom is nice. \n\nIf you don't have m life, sign up to get cheap rooms. We got really good rates! Customer service is great. Housekeeping was up to par. \n\nI would totally recommend these new upgraded rooms (we stayed in the regular rooms).  \n\nWe also ate at the MGM buffet...idk why everyone doesn't like the food. I loved it. Wasn't to salty wasn't to bland. Yum\n\nIt seems that no one knows about these new remodeled rooms. So I posted a picture
