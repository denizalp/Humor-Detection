We arrived after 6pm, during dinner rush hour to a small, fast-moving line. While the menu seemed limited to about half a dozen burger choices and handful of other meat\/non-meat options, the product finished with surprising flair.  I had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger (minus cheese in my case) and rosemary-garlic sweet potato fries.  \n\nLet me say, THIS burger had that char-grilled black crunchiness you think of when biting into a perfect backyard burger in the mid-summer, with all the flavors of top-grade, savoury flavoured Angus beef.  Juices and oils dripped like rain off this sandwich.  For a fast-food joint, I never expected a simple order of sweet potato fries to have so much punch, either!  Ketchup was hardly needed, though I may have recommended a nice aoli dip to go with them.  \n\nStaff were mostly young teens, though surprisingly cheerful.  The cashier girl even made it a point to come to our table to ask how we liked the meal and if this was our first visit in.  As we leaved, every available associate either thanked us for coming in or wished a good evening.  \n\nIf you have the zeal of a deprived, starving carnivore, make this a definite destination.  It's a rich, meaty hamburger that doesn't disappoint!
