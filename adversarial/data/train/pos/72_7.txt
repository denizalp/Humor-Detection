The best part of this meal was the fact that I didn't have to pay. And the fact that I was living across the street at the time. My friend's father was visiting from Hong Kong and took a group of us out for a fancy pants dinner at this restaurant. I had peeked into the dining room during a fire evacuation (the hotel kindly took us in for a few hours...February in Toronto is NOT FUN) but never thought I'd have a chance to dine there. \n\nThat said, we enjoyed several dim sum appetizers, and delighted in Peking Duck prepared in 3 ways. The most memorable was in the classic Chinese pancakes. The waitstaff prepared everything for us, cutting the duck before our eyes and arranging the juicy meat and crispy skin in the rice crepes with some scallion and cucumber for good measure. The cucumber was a wonderful match for the duck. \n\nIf my memory serves me correctly, the second preparation of the duck was sauteed with vegetables and glass noodles, which was then wrapped in lettuce leaves as you would with bulgogi. It was yummy, but kind of like a duck spring roll and I was definitely over spring rolls at that point (While I was living in Toronto the closest restaurant that everyone could agree upon was a Thai chain called \"Spring Rolls\"). \n\nI had a very lovely dining experience here...I am guessing that the previous reviewers did not order the Peking duck and did not enjoy a free meal. I find that I enjoy an meal less when it seems to be overpriced. So...get someone to pay for you!
