Terrible customer service. \nThere were two employees and two customers, including myself. One employee was helping the other with a sale. The other employee just sat there. He did not acknowledge me once in the fifteen minutes that I was there looking around. When another customer walked into the store he asked him for help right away. The funny part is they are having a special for an ar-15 for around $800. I have a budget of $800 to spend right then and there. I could understand the lack of attention if he were busy but he was texting or facebooking on his phone or something. I'll gladly go somewhere else and spend a little more money.
