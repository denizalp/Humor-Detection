I am not one to eat too much Indian food (because of high spice levels), but at wondrous reviews and recommendation, I had to absolutely try this place. And I left with no regrets. \n\nMaharaja, as I understand - means King. And the interiors of this restaurant is quite luxurious and palatial. The menu is large and varied, and without a recommendation, I wouldn't know where to start. For my no spice palate, the Murgh Lababdar was lovely - think butter chicken but creamier and tastier. We ordered some rice with the chicken, which is the norm. \n\nShout out to the amazing service and the personable server as well. This place has my stars and my recommendation. The next time you're craving India food, skip everything and hurry in to The Maharaja.
