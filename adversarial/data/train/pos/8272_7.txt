After months driving past their \"opening soon\" signage, today the OPEN light was on! Went in to a clean and modern space, friendly staff, and boba drinks. Food menu will be available soon with Japanese snacks and desserts.\n\nFirst visit I tried the chrysanthemum milk tea with boba- the boba was just right but the tea was fairly light in flavor. BF really enjoyed it though, and I appreciated that it wasn't super-sweet as a lot of milk tea boba drinks can be.\n\nSpace is a little bare with nothing on the walls- would love to see them add games and a bit more personality to the d√©cor. Will be back to try the spam musubi and creative-sounding desserts like marshmallow tiramisu!\n\nEDIT 3\/14: They've added paint and a bunch of flat-screens for the menu, looks better. Finally tried the spam musubi and chocolate plantation tea, rice was unseasoned and tea tasted watered-down, boba was mushy. Girl taking orders is too quiet to be heard over the college kids playing hackey sack and shouting about videogames through the door to the neighboring business. Glad they're capitalizing on the college crowd, but the lack of quality and service are a deterrent for the post-college clientele.
