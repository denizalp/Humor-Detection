Oh mon dieu is really a oh my god ! I usually always play it safe in a patisserie and get myself an almond croissant but during my visit at this patisserie i fell in love with the OH MON DIEU chocolatine \/ croissant .. I usually dont eat allot of chocolatine because the amount of chocolate is never to my satisfaction and rare it is a real croissant .. I actually call it puffy pastry with a little bit of chocolate ! But at oh mon dieu is just a piece straight from heaven ! The croissant itself is so tasty if id remove the taste of chocolate for a second i couldve said it was an almond croissant .. But it was impossible to imagine that because the amount of chocolate there is in this specific chocolatine is mouth blowing ! Not a single bite without chocolate and not one spot without chocolate ! With icing sugar and lines of chocolate this croissant is irresistible !!!
