Even though I walk by this stretch of College Street all the time, I barely knew this place existed. That's probably because it's been a coon's age since I needed to carry anything larger than a body (not that I'm hauling bodies all the time, but that's a reasonable analogy mass-wise of the largest payload I've transported in the past couple of -- hey, why are you looking at me like that?).\n\nAnywho. I needed a rental for an out-of-town trip. There is a certain threshold of time and distance where hourly rental services like Zipcar and Autoshare become prohibitive. Spending the afternoon in Ancaster is one such vector.\n\nI showed up on Sunday morning at 9:00am a few minutes after they opened. It was busy with people returning vehicles, so I waited dutifully in line and listened to EZ Rock. After a 15 minute wait, I made it to the counter, plopped down my driver's licence and a credit card and I was good to go. Another five minute wait after that (it had snowed the night before and they had to clean the car) I got my wheels. A white(!) Hyundai Elantra with only 1,800 clicks on it.\n\nBecause this is a newish location, I think most of the cars were as new or newer than the one I took out. I can't really describe the vehicle or my drive. What do you think this is: Car and Driver?\n\nMy only issue with this Budget is that it's not set up to take cars back outside of business hours. This meant a bit of a rush to get back before 5:00pm, but the return was quite painless. The cars are clean and it was $50 for the day's rental (waiving all supplemental insurance). I'd recommend it.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Could God create a car so big he couldn't BUDGE IT?\n\nMenu Readability: Not too applicable, is it boyo?\n\nNeed to mention: This location offers a free pick up service.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I hate white cars. They should be banned.
