Ok, so let me just preface this by saying my review is NOT based on ANY experience at the hotel OTHER than a mere lunch and brief walk-around.  \n\nThat said. THEY HAVE A CLEAR TUBE-WATERSLIDE THAT GOES THROUGH AN AQUARIUM WITH SHARKS?!?!?!?!?! OMG! I'm SO staying here at LEAST once JUST for this reason.\n\nI have to admit, it's definitely not as upscale of a crowd as anything I've seen on the strip...but then again...neither is Old Town Vegas...\n\nThe hotel didn't seem like anything special...UNTIL.. I saw the pool with a tube slide shoving people through a shark-inhabited aquarium and poolside blackjack tables. Are you KIDDING ME? \n\nHow come I never knew about this place.\n\nPS $20 to ride the waterride if you're not a guest of the hotel...
