I swear, Marley goes to the salon more than I do. True story.\n\nIt appears all the reviews here are focused on boarding and doggy daycare. I don't use either of those things, so I would like to address the grooming portion of Dogtopia.\n\nWe moved across town back in May and it's just too time consuming (and inconvenient) for me to run him to his normal groomer. So, I let Yelp lead the way in my new hood. What's this? A highly rated Dogtopia is just five minutes from my house? Sold.\n\nDespite a super busy holiday week, I was able to get an appointment with just a few days notice for a Saturday afternoon. When I arrived, the workers had a thorough talk with me about what I wanted done. I was a little fearful because I had been a bad dog mommy. Marley was a giant, matted furrball mess. Some groomers would just say, well there's nothing we can do but shave. (Seriously, that happens at some places and it's awful) That wasn't the case here. \n\nWhen I returned to pick him up a couple hours later, he looked like a brand new dog. A fantastic Yorkie haircut complete with an adorable little bandanna. He was ready to get out of there though. A couple of barking dogs in crates were stressing him out big time.\n\nPrice was comparable to my regular place. Check in and check out were both a breeze. Dogtopia also had a cute little case of dog cookies on sale. I rewarded Marley for his bravery by purchasing three. He loved them. I almost took a bite of one because they looked that delicious. I refrained. Glad I could have self control to stop myself from trying a dog treat.\n\nWanna bring your four legged friend here? Just make sure they are up to date on all the shots.
