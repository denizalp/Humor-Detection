For several reasons, I do not think I will be returning. Actually, there is really just one reason: the lounge simply was not very loungey.\n\nThe Gold Lounge feels like a big, cold, generic hotel ballroom with some shiny things here and there and a giant horse lamp (which is cool) by the door. There are no surprises, no crooks or crannies, no interesting sight lines. I do not like to walk into a lounge and have the lay of the land with one glance. I want intrigue, and I want a lounge to feel comfortable and cozy. A lounge should inspire one to lounge, and that did not happen here. \n\nMy specialty cocktail-- a combo of tea and bourbon -- was very tasty and strong, but I would have to drink several to give Gold more stars. Sorry. I hate to seem mean, but I am always honest.
