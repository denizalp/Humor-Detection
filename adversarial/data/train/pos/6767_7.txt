Thought that I would go somewhere \"perceivably\" nice for my Bachelorette Party.\n\nShould've gone elsewhere.\n\nFirst of all.... I LOVE TO DANCE. I'm the girl who is panting cuz she's dancing so hard, and sits to rest, then can't because the next song is \"my favorite too!\" so if the music's good.. I can't stop. That being said, let me explain how HOORRRRIBBLLLEEEE the music at Bank was.. I thought if you go to high-end club.. you'd get high-end DJ'ing\/high-end music. NOT.\n\nThe DJ would mix songs that had nothing to do with each other (and hence confuse the shit out of my body). He would also stop a song right before the \"good part\" (hook) that everyone knows and is waiting for is about to play... then mix it with something totally off.\n\nExample: \"Dancing in the da-da-da-da.... da-da-da-da-da-dark-.. [cue, what would be the trumpet hook].... I put my hand up on your hip. When I dip, you dip, we dip.\"\n\nI like both songs.. but seriously..? Mixed together like that. HORRIBLE. And it was like that ALL night. There might've been a good 10-minute session.. but that's it.\n\nThat, and the lighting was also very awkward. You can slow lights down to make a blinky fast part more exciting, but this lighting guy would COMPLETELY shut off ALL the lights... which would make people feel like there had been a blackout. That makes people feel uncomfortable. These people have no idea what they're doing.\n\nSo, really annoyed and bummed at the music at my own bachelorette party (and we didn't want to leave cuz we had a table with full bottles)... I sat.. and people-watched. Obviously my drunk girlfriends come up as I'm seated and appearing not to have a good time, and playfully (not distastefully) lap dance me. Hey, it's my bachelorette party.. not totally unheard of. We lap danced my other friend at PURE and people thought it was hot.. no one minded.\n\nWell, apparently, they're really uptight at Bank and they kick us out for \"inappropriate dancing.\" Uhhh.. aren't we in Vegas? Sin City? Oh, and by the way, that guy and girl are pretty much having sex right now.. and you're telling US we're being too bad? Riiiighhht. Oh, and you can't have your shoes off.. not even in your own booth. I'm pretty sure EVERY club I've been to has allowed girls to take shoes off at their own table area\/booth.. These people are whack.. uptight.. and have shitty music and lighting. I can't believe we paid money to be patrons here and got treated like such shit.\n\nSo me being me... I talked to the manager afterwards. He supported his employees and said \"patrons are not owed explanations when asked to leave.\" That's just poor management if you ask me. If you have customers, paying lots of money to be patrons in your establishment, you'd want to take care of them, right? I guess not. Someone needs to send the staff and management of Bank back to Disney college or hostess school or something. Seriously.\n\nSo, pretty much..... Bank is terribly OVERRATED. EXPENSIVE. HORRIBLE MUSIC. UNKIND (I will go so far as to say, not smart) STAFF AND MANAGEMENT (except for our cocktail server and busser.. they were nice). Only go there if you want to be disappointed.. not dance.. and\/or be treated like shit.
