I wish I could give this place a negative 5 stars. Horrible customer service. I think they are racist and only appreciate Mexican\/white customers. They never get my order correct and the list goes on. That is the honest truth F*** them and I will never return to this location\n\nAnd the girl at the drive-through needs to fix her face she's always angry who would wanna come back after looking at that mug
