Busy day, many parties , one cook and the manager also manning the grills. So the timely service wasn't  happening today. That's ok  wasn't in a hurry. \n\nBut the waitress,  Brandi  ,  rocked and kept those things that could be kept in motion moving.  First I have to go off on the wings. I am  tired of promises of impending immolation  or  later cauterization  of hemorrhoids  only to be served up  \"weak sauce\" wings  that are  about as challenging as balancing a brick  in the center of a pool table. \n\nWing sauce was  also salty as hell.  Wings are a good size and taste good in their own right just  embarrassing that   news of my suicide turned  out to in error.  In this case  for anyone used to hot thai food suicide really is painless \n\nMain course.  Burgers,   Pretty good,  generous on the fries, baked potatoes. Was  good enough   but this is more sustenance than sublime .\n\n Partner  had  tenderloin sliders which were pretty  good meat wise, once you found it , but the buns are way too big for the task and you can't  really enjoy it as a burger but   hopefully someone just mismatched the bread types today.  If not this  dish is huge fail. \n\nKid's meal was  great value and HUGE  we  are used to   mini hot dogs and string  fries  . Prices hold with a Chilis \/ Applebees type  location.   Pleasant enough an the  menu has main sections for pizza, pasta, burgers, steak and wings as the main themes plus  the obligatory salads.  If it wasn't next to Cabelas, an I wasn't ravenous for \"anything\"  I could miss this place. Not   I really  want to give it 2.5 stars but have rounded it up.
