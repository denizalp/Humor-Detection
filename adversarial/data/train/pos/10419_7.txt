I was hoping the food would make up for the  bad service but...it didn't...\n\nMaybe since I'm from California, my sushi expectations are high but bad service is bad service anywhere. \n\nServer: \"hi, how many?\"\nMe: \"4, please.\"\nServer then walks away, assists another table and doesn't say a word. She puts 4 menus on a table and walks away. Nice way to seat us....NOT! \n\nSince I've never been here, I would have liked for them to explain that there is an AYCE menu and a regular menu. I had to ask them a few questions for them to tell me that there was a whole separate menu for a la carte pricing. She seemed really annoyed at the fact that I just didn't know. My bad! Geez!\n\nMy tempura shiitake mushroom roll was the first thing to hit the table and it was made WRONG. When I asked another server what was in it, they didn't know so I had to show them the description in the menu. They agree to make another one correctly for me. \n\nThe agedashi tofu was pretty good but it would have been even better if I had all of my food at the same time. My mushroom roll finally came about 10 minutes after everyone was done eating, which was about 40 minutes later. NOT GOOD. It wasn't rolled well and fell apart as soon as I tried picking it up with my chopsticks. \n\nWhen we finally got the check, we were charged incorrectly for our beers and I couldn't believe that they didn't comp me for my mushroom roll. Isn't that just good service and common practice? Plus this place is more expensive than most.\n\nSooooo...food was mediocre and the service was worse. Needless to say, I'll be looking for another sushi place when I visit my family. \n\nOn to the next one..
