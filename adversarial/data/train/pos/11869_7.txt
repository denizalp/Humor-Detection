I was pleasantly surprised by my first JetBlue experience! Largely marketed as a discount airline option, I have not found their prices to be competitive. They only provide service to certain larger cities, which isn't always convenient. \n\nHowever. They have tons of leg room if you're traveling with someone large or tall, they offer free name-brand snacks on board (as many as you want!), and they have built-in screens with DirecTV and SiriusXM. \n\nService was polite and friendly throughout out several connecting flights. We had limited service for the TV\/radio options due to our flightpath and one of our flights was delayed- as we were boarding, staff announced that the paid movie options would be free for the flight to compensate. Love that!
