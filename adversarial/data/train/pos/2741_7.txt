Hunger- you tricked me again....\n\nAfter a busy day I get home and am super hungry and don't want to fight traffic to get food (1st World Problem- I know...)\n\nPizza sounded good because it's a day ending in the letter Y. I realized I hadn't had dominos in a while so I place an online order- which was really easy- nice interface blah x3. \n\nThe pizza was delivered pretty slowly, the delivery guy was nice- I got my pizza and off he went. \n\nI think Dominos has invented a pizza oven that somehow saps ALL semblance of flavor from the pizza. I'm not sure what mad pizza scientist made this machine- but it's good, damn good. The pizza looks like pizza but that is where the similarities end. The taste is remarkable in its blandness. I have to imagine movie prop food would taste better. I struggled to find ANY flavor at all- and remarkably there was none. Don't get me wrong, I know when I'm calling Dominos or it's competition- I don't expect Cibo, Bianco, Il Bosco type quality- but can it at least be as good as my first pizza love, Peter Piper Pizza?  \n\nDominos pizza makes Costco look like artisan wood fired pizza in comparison. (It should be noted my love for Costco knows no bounds, but still.....)\n\nAnyway- it's nothing personal- I'm sure the people at Dominos are lovely- but their pizza is not.  I hate wasting food- but I had to throw out the pizza after choking down a slice. It's really, really, poor. Like if aliens landed and tried that for their first earth food- they would immediately nuke us out of the universe. \n\nSave your taste buds and pride- and go anywhere else for pizza. Learn from my mistake. Life is way too short for flavorless pizza. You know it's bad when my dog sniffs it and shakes his head while wrinkling his nose like \"Nah brah- I don't need that in my life.\"
