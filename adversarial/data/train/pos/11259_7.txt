In terms of taste, this was probably the best meal we had in Vegas. But it really is a splurge. I wanted to try a bunch of dishes that weren't part of their choose your own set menu option, so we went a la carte.\n\n*Chateauneuf-de-pape, paul jaboulet aine \"joel robuchon\", rhone valley, France, 2011 ($35 glass)\nI just ordered this without looking at the price. Good glass of wine, but I'm not sure if I would have ordered it knowing how much it cost beforehand. Regardless, it was a nice glass of wine.\n\n*Amuse bouche: Foie gras parfait\nYum! I got to eat two of them since the roommate doesn't like foie. Creamy and so good!\n\n*Bread and butter\nI normally don't eat bread and butter, but I had to try their freshly baked bread. Everything was light, fluffy and delicious. Even the butter was good!\n\n*Le hamachi: yellowtail served as a ravioli with sea urchin in lemon vinaigrette ($40)\nI love hamachi, uni and caviar. Roll it into a \"ravioli\" and I'm in heaven!\n\n*Le jambon \"iberico de bellota\" ($40): \"iberico de bellota\" ham with toasted tomato bread\nI never thought tomato bread would taste so good with jambon! It complemented the richness of the jambon well.\n\n*La langoustine: langoustine a la plancha with green curry and cilantro ($23)\nThis dish was good, but I wasn't really blown away by it. The langoustine was perfectly cooked. Super tender!\n\n*Le foie gras de carnard: Seared duck foie gras in a smoked sour-carrot bouillon, lemon confit ($35)\nTheir foie was seared to perfection. Still soft with the wonderful foie aroma and flavor. I loved this dish! And it was all mine!\n\n*Le ris de veau ($30): veal sweetbread with fresh laurel and stuffed romaine lettuce\nGood. I wasn't expecting a huge piece of sweetbread, but it was cooked nicely.\n\n*Le boeuf: beef grilled, served on a soft bed of rice and spiced avocado ($22)\nThis was good as well. Not exactly something I would normally order (since it has so much rice), but we wanted to order something with beef. The roommate enjoyed it. (He loves rice.)\n\nWe also got a small pot of mashed potatoes. I have no idea what that came with. Maybe the sweetbreads? But they were light, creamy and delicious!\n\nL'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is dark, sexy and modern. Lots of black, red and dimly lit. If you have a party of two, you'll be sitting at the counter. I don't mind counter seating. And at times, I like seeing what's going on in the kitchen, but for a nice intimate dinner, it's hard doing that with counter seating. Plus, the couple next to us talked incessantly. And loudly. They really were enjoying their wine. That took away from my experience a little.\n\nThe next time I go to Vegas, I might just say screw it and go to Joel Robuchon. I liked the food, but I didn't care for the ambiance. If I'm gonna splurge, I might as well go big, right?
