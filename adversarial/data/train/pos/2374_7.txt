Thank you guys for being so kind. I was terrified and your sweet employee tried to make me smile, with his \"terminator glasses \" joke. I am a new patient and I am so glad Dr. K is our new dentist !! I look forward in getting my treatment done with Dr. K and his staff !!\nYou know amazing service when you see it, I found it in all of you.\n\n\nThank you so much !!!!!
