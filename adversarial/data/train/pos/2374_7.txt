Finally. I have a neighborhood sushi joint in Snottsdale to regularize. I love Hiro and Shiro (particularly Hiro @ Shiro), but the drive is not always conducive to how I like my sushi: with a side, or ten, of LoudMouth Soup.\n\nWent to Dozo last night with some fellow long-suffering Old Town diners. This is the real deal. Exact opposite of Stingray and RA.\n\nIt's not gonna change your culinary world. But it's real sushi with an emphasis on good rice and fresh ingredients. So Dozo is now my place.\n\n\nNotes:\napparently korean run (update: chinese! the owners are from taiwan and they're super cool), i'm guessing you shouldn't  practice your japanese on them or you might just learn to say a lot of bad things in korean\n\nthey have okinawan beer\n\npretty good, and reasonable sake selection\n\nlamb chops? seriously? they're great!
