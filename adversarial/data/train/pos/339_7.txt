I'm in shopping heaven!! Usually I'm a little skeptical about going to the outlets. It's just overwhelming and I usually am dissatisfied. We were in Vegas for the Turkey Holiday and we decided to go Black Friday shopping at this outlet. \n\nOh jeez, parking was a nightmare. Hubs just shoved me out of the car so I could shop and he drove off to find parking. So many stores! Where to begin?? Just start walking. This place was so crowded, but it got me excited because there were so many great stores here. Much better than the ones back home in Cali. \n\nKate Spade, Coach, Michael Kors, Columbia, so many more!! All my money went here instead of the casinos. \n\nMake sure to stop by before you leave.
