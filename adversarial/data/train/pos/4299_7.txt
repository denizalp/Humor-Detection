I haven't eaten here so cannot attest to their food quality but this place is fun for a bar stop along the strip.  Been here twice and had fun.  Both times the DJ's were pretty good and kept the party going. They have go go dancers handing out shots for tips and dancing on the bar tops.  Drinks are standard...I think $11 for a vodka soda.  Not weak.  The second time we went there was the absolutely obnoxious girl MC'ing, if that's what you can call it.  Talking about virgins and circle jerking?  Um, I get that this is Vegas but she was just weird....like our WHOLE group, all 7 of us, desperately wanted her to shut up.  My advice Double Barrel? Get rid of the annoying girl that never stops talking, keep your DJ's and go go dancers and we'll be back.
