I have no idea what happened between March 2013, when Niyen wrote his review raving about the Fat Choy burger, and now, but the burger is completely lackluster and worthy of absolutely zero accolades.  \n\nThe patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and there was an egg on it, but that's about all I can say- visually, yes, there was short rib, but it didn't have any flavor. The other ingredients mentioned on the menu, bacon and roasted tomato? So sparingly applied that I didn't even detect them. Niyen's original description includes onion jam, and that is now missing from the menu altogether, but that bright bit of acidity would have cut through the fat and added a pop of flavor. As I ate this burger, I was asking myself why I was continuing to eat it. That's how underwhelming it was.\n\nThe bao aren't noteworthy either, though. Everyone does a pork bao so I opted for the peking duck and the tofu-mushroom versions here. Visually, the tofu-mushroom is already unappealing, with a square sheet of tofu falling out of the bao and minimal stringy mushrooms. Taste wasn't bad, but I wouldn't rave about this to any of my vegetarian friends. And the duck meat on the other bao was dry, accompanying sauce was unremarkable. Everything was very one-note.\n\nService was polite. I'll add that if you sub a salad for your side of fries (with the burger), it's literally a handful of spring mix salad blend: no tomato, no cucumber, nothing else at all added. \n\nIf using a card, payment is processed through Square (or a similar product\/service), and you are presented with a tip percentage page- I'm kicking myself for selecting a $3 tip for absolutely zero service and mediocre food to boot. Never again.
