on May 21, 2016. I took my Porsche Boxster S to have my replacement key program, so it will work with the car. The service advisor was the only one on duty that day, after he wrote up my service paper, he used his leg to close my car's door. This is unacceptable!!! Unprofessional!!! He treated my toy, my baby like trash. I would never take my car to get service at this dealership ever again. I will rather drive down to Beverly Hills Porsche dealer, is way better there. I have 4 cars, and I have never seen a service advisor close the customer's car door with the leg, NEVER in my whole life...........The name of that service counselor was Douglass Dunley.
