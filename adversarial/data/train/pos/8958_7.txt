My husband and i love this Japanese\/French cafe and come here often. They are also known for their croissants but I personally like their danishes more. I'm partial to the pineapple and the berry ones. The pastry is so light and fluffy, the fruit in the middle so fresh. They also have tons of cute pastries, all so delicately prepared and very unique. They are bound to wow guests if you bring them to a dinner or house party. My favourite is the Hana - which comes as a small pasty or a larger cake. It's coconut & pineapple filled. Today I dropped by for some macarons, was a bit disappointed because they didn't get my order right and I didnt realize it until I got home - instead of 2 passionfruit macarons, they gave my 2 pear macarons, so altogether I had 4 macarons, which was too much for that flavour. Next time I'll be sure to double check my order.
