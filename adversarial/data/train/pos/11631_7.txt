Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,\nA tale of a fateful trip\nThat started from this tropic port\nAnd ended with me leaving...\n\nSo I went to the soft opening night. I expected it to be crowded. Even when the AC wasn't work I let that slide. What I couldn't let slide was that it took over an HOUR to get a drink. Mind you I was sitting on the rail at the bar. With out being \"That Guy\" I kept trying to make eye contact with ANYONE... Anyone who would just look up for one second and acknowledge that I am a person who came to drink. The Bartenders were swamped, I get that. But just say you will be with me as soon as you can. \n\nSo now 30 min in and nowhere closer to getting a drink I notice my elbows are sliding forward because of all the sweat that is running down my arms and pooling up.... Is this going to be the end? Was I going to die of dehydration inside a bar? What a twisted sense of humor the bar gods have. Still chalking it up to the flood of people in there I waited. I sat and waited. \n\nI had run out of things to talk about with my friend and all we could do was look at each other and shrug.. Resolved to the fact that maybe we just were not meant to get a drink that night, is when we made a pact... If a drink was sitting in front of us by 9:15pm we would unceremoniously vacate our bar stools for the quenching refreshment that we know would be waiting for us at the \"Other\" tiki bar.\n\nWe synchronized our swatches and let the game begin. With a few well placed sighs and gazing upon the tiki mugs that have yet to be filled it happened... My champion from behind the bar descended up us. As his lips parted and she spoke to me the phrase I had waited an hour to hear.\n\n\"Have you been helped yet?'\n\nA single tear glistened in my eye as I replied almost sheepishly..\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAnd with that we gave him our drink order and like some alchemist he constructed our drink and then bestowed then upon us at 9:14.... Literally one minute to spare. \n\nBeing as parched as we were we consumed the libations post haste! not wanting to wait another hour for a drink we departed. I have thought to myself i would be able to go to another bar across town and get a drink by the time I got another one here. \n\nMy second trip to the island was much shorter. This time entering through the front door I belly up to the bar where there is already a crowd. This was the Thursday night they were giving away the \"Locals Card\". Assuming that once the bar works out the kinks I could see myself going here a bit. So seeing how they Have their DOLE WHIP machine I figure stop in get one and pic up a card.... Little did I know my night would be fraught with disappointment.   \n\nI got to play yet another round of ignore the customer... this time it was only 20 min. When i finally got a bartender's attention I asked for him \n\n\"What drink has a dole whip in it.....I'll have one of those.\"\n\nHe scurries off the to give a couple of tugs on the dole whip machine. befuddled he comes back to inform me the machine is not working. Already contempt and bitter disappointment begin to grow deep inside of me. With my eyes quickly scanning the bar I see the outline of a familiar handle...\n\n\"I'll take a Magic hat then....\"\n\nOh if it could have only been so easy. With a nod he slinks away to pour my beer only to slink back with with a cup that even the biggest of optimists would never describe as half full. \n\n\"Co2 is out\" was the only explanation I was offered.\n\nWould it have mattered if gremlins had chewed through the hose? \n\n\"Anything Else?\" \n\nI thought to myself what could they mean....anything else. For me to get something ELSE I would have had to had something in the first place. The only thing I could have more of here is disappointment. I was defeated. I wanted to like this bar. I wanted to be a \"local\" at it. But this bar and didn't want me. So I did what any sailor would do. I cut bait and went toward a more welcoming harbor. 30 min in the bar. I didn't even get a Locals card while I was in there. You know, because to use it.... You have to be able to get a drink. \n\nWill I be back? I've been back to worse places. At least if I ever do find myself washed up on one of their bar stools I will be sure to bring my own provisions. You cant count resupplying your ship here.\n\nTL;DR -\nWent opening night was ignored for an hour before getting a drink, Second visit Nothing I wanted worked. 2 strikes.
