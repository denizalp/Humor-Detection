D & Y Chinese is not your average Chinese Take-out Restaurant but they also offer that too. How many places can you name in Glendale that offer JellyFish head with Sweet Peas..? D & Y Chinese offers a Canton Mandarin Menu and also offer a tank of live fish. Sunday isn't the best day to visit because they only had one fish left. This isn't a fancy place. It's a little unorganized and they use different parts of the dining room as a storage room.\n\nThe help are friendly and seem sincere. We made our order and waited 45 minutes for our meals to be prepared.\n\nI tried the just killed Tilapia. It was prepared to perfection just like fish you get at a fine restaurant. I guess fish just taste so much better when it's that fresh. It just melted in my mouth. They served the fish in a soy ginger broth that was slightly oily and topped the fish with a shredded vegetable that might have been celery. \n\nMy husband ordered the Beef with Black pepper. I tasted one piece. It was a bit dry and chewy.\n\nFish was the sweet spot here.\n\nFor that reason I would give a 3.5 star rating if I could.\n\nThe fish was so good that I bumped the rating to 4 stars.
