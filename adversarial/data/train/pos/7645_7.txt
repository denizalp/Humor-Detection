OK I live right around the corner to this take out joint, so I drop in every now and then. It's really clean inside and everything is fresh, including all of their baked goods. You know it's clean when the kitchen has windows...\n\nI'll be honest with you that I don't really understand how to order anything here and I really don't know what the heck I'm eating, I just know it's tasty.\n\nThe only menu item that I can pronounce is the lampri. This thing is only like 7 bucks and can last for 2-3 meals!\n\nBasically, they fill a massive banana leaf with the rice of your choice, then douse it with 5 or 6 of your choice of \"curries\". I have no idea what they are, so I just point and hope for the best! Then they add some fried fish and a boiled egg in the center, fold it up and then steam it! 7 bucks!!!\n\nMy only gripe is that the menu items should be labelled a little better and their pricing system a little clearer. Other than that, no complaints here!
