I have not ventured out to other urgent cares but i have been to this one about 3 or 4 times maybe.  Each time costs me at least $80 just to get in but prices have sky rocketed if you do not have insurance like myself.  Most of the times i have been to this location it was over my thought of having pink eye. BUT i have learned never to go to this location for this reason. Why you might ask? Because the last time i had gone the \"doctor\" working had told me i did have pink eye and to put drops in my eye for a week.  My eye was not completely closed shut the morning of it was just pinkish even if i put redness drops. So i went home after picking up my bottle from walgreens and hoped to god the pinkness would disappear. Guess what it didn't. So after a weeks worth of drops and some antihistamine drops to follow up my eye had become ridiculous to where i was just thinking WTH did the doctor do by prescribing this stuff?! it is not getting any better?! \n\n So thankfully at the time i had been working at sears(Don't ever work there because they will ruin your life and find any way to fire you and not give you unemployment) and had gone to see the optometrist(Who is awesome!) and said that my eye had been so dryed out from putting the antihistamine drops in my eye that i needed to just put moisturizing drops in from now on.  He had mentioned a ladys son had hit a pole or something hit his eye not hard enough to mess up his vision but scratch the surface and the ER really told him it was pink eye?! Seriously?! When it comes to things with your eyes i honest to god think that Hospitals and Urgent Care should have their own optometrist in the building before they start prescribing things to people and making the problem worse.
