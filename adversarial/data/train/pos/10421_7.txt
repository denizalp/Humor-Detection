South Point is a nice enough hotel\/casino without the craziness of being on the strip.\n\nThe rooms are standard for a hotel.  While I have never stayed here personally, my wife and son have and for the two of them the setting was just fine.  There are plenty of food options and the casino floor is clean, relatively speaking.  \n\nSouth Point is a little more family friendly than others.  There is a good sized pool area, bowling alley and a movie theater to keep everyone entertained.\n\nThe tables here at SP are less expensive than those that are on the strip so if you want to get away from the masses and find a decent table, it isn't a bad option.  The dealers seem to be a bit more friendly and outgoing and it's always more fun giving your money away when the person you're giving it to is friendly right?\n\nThe thing that knocks this down to 3 stars is South Point's ventilation system.  I have no problem with people smoking but what I do have a problem with is SP's HVAC system cannot keep up with the amount of smoke from the casino floor.  I might have well put a cigarette in my mouth as it was that thick.\n\nSouth Point is not a bad option by any means.....just please oh please, work on your ventilation system.
