Stay away!! On a recent day out I went here with some friends to grab a drink and appetizers. Right after we sat I went to the bathroom and I saw a mouse run into the kitchen, first red flag. The bathrooms weren't in good shape either, second red flag. There was paper all over the floor and the toilet door didn't even close all the way. Seemed like no one had cleaned them in quite a while. Since we were sitting in the main dining room on the far wall we could see the kitchen area. The bathrooms are located down a hall and you have to walk past the kitchen to get there from where we were seated. As I walked back to the table I looked around more closely and saw a layer of dust and grime on top of things and in corners, third red flag. I realize these are hard to reach places that don't get cleaned every day, but if this is how they're keeping the front of the restaurant, then no wonder there are mice in the kitchen. I decided it was best to not chance it and avoided any food. So I can't say that I know what anything tastes like here, but I'm probably all the better for it. Good luck to you and your bowels if you do decide to try it.
