After seeing several photos of Dolce's cotton candy topped desserts all over Instagram, I just had to come try this place out! The items are all very unique, so I have to give them credit for that. The service is pretty good as well - everyone behind the counter is really nice and knowledgable. \n\nI had the mix of green tea and vanilla soft serve ice cream with cotton candy affogato. The dessert was aesthetically pleasing, but I would not come back. I didn't really like the ice cream, and though the cotton candy add-on was cool, the items didn't mesh well together. I found the whole idea of having to eat a huge amount of cotton candy before being able to touch the ice cream slightly absurd, because by the time I finally reached the cup to scoop a bite, the ice cream had melted. Overall, everything was WAY too sweet for me and didn't taste that great. \n\nI would recommend coming if you're into super sweet desserts... But if you can't handle the sugar, this place is not really worth it in my opinion.
