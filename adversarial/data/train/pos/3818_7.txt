I expected much more being a brand new store. \n\nAll of the previous reviews were surprisingly good, but I doubt they shop at Asian store every week to know the small differences. It may not smell *yet*, because it just opened, but I saw a lot of fly in the store, and meats\/ vegetables did not look \"amazingly fresh\". (I noticed brown spots on meat)\n\nTheir price weren't impressive either. Everything I saw today was more expensive (compare to what I usually purchase from other stores). Also thought their aisles were unorganized. It just seemed like everything was scattered everywhere. \n\nWe'll see how they keep up.
