Over the course of my life, I have been a member of a few gyms, and this particular 24 hour fitness location is pretty much the best I have seen. Their facility is filled with relevant, working equipment that is always clean and in good shape. Their staff are very nice and personable. Their spa area is always clean and has been up 98% of the time I have gone. Also, the members here, seem to all be very nice and entertaining as well.\nPersonally, I spend 2-3 hours a day here. I run on the treadmill (of which there seems to be plenty available and open all the time), I do strength exercises (using their wide selection of weights and weight equipment), and I swim every day. They have a nice 25 yard outdoor pool that is heated, so even in the winter, I am out there in the warm water. The sauna is kept at a manageable temperature, which is more that I can say for the other 24 hours fitness locations in town.\nI am also there with Ryan my trainer three days a week. Ryan and I see eye to eye on pretty much everything. He keeps me motivated, yet we still have time to talk about the hot chicks or life in general, and even hang out outside of the gym. He has really become a good friend and someone I respect a lot.\nMost of the staff know me by name, and we stop and chat throughout my time there each day. They are all very into fitness and know that I am too from my high intensity workouts with Ryan. We share that in common, so there is plenty to talk about. Not to mention that some of the staff are hot chicks!! ;)\nAll in all, the staff is great, the facility is always in working condition (thanks Brian), the place is clean, your fellow subscribers are top not buttheads. This place is the best.
