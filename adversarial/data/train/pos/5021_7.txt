A great selection of food with a very friendly staff! I came here for lunch and enjoyed the meatball sub. It was very good! The only thing I would change about it would be adding more sauce. The flatbread pizzas looked really good. A co-worker and I came here for lunch when we were in town for work. They are conveniently located next to our office so we were able to just walk over. We both had subs and thought they were really good. They offer them in a 6 inch or foot long.\n\nThe food took about 10 minutes which wasn't too bad. I think it was because they had to toast the subs to melt the cheese which was well worth the wait! The lunch special was great because you could add a drink to your sub for 50 cents! A really great deal!
