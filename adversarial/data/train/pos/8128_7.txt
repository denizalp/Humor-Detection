Tonight, I witnessed a yoga studio hit an all time low. I have bounced around yoga studios since I moved to Charlotte three years ago and have been frequenting Y2 for the last two months or so. I love the upbeat house music, the staff, and the intensity of the classes so I ignored the factory like feel of the studio and a certain instructor. Whatever - I enjoyed the work out and I love the practice. \n\nIt was not until this past class where in the middle of the practice, the yoga instructor announced that he was going to read a passage. I was surprised that he would give some words of encouragement or read a quote on mindfulness, self worth, pain, anything really. Instead, he begins to read a yelp review of an innocent yogi who attended the studio. He read the entire passage, only stopping to laugh between paragraphs. The yelp writer had explained how the studio was too intense for her and that the rooms were too small (things that any type of yelp reviewer would write if they disliked a studio).\n\n After he read the review, he relentlessly began to poke fun at this person, mimic them in a whiny, high pitched voice. At one point, he made a remark along the lines of maybe they should go practice yoga with their grandma (Really - a  Grandma joke?!).  This criticizing went on for the remainder of the class. I could not believe my ears. This man was using his platform as a leader to make fun and criticize another human being for their opinion of his yoga studio. It was sickening to hear a leader of his establishment to act so pompously as if others cannot possibly have their own opinion on what yoga studio they frequent. Everything that yoga is about was thrown out of the window during the 60 minute class. This class was the most disheartening and upsetting acts of hypocrisy that I have witnessed in my years of practicing yoga. \n\nThe class then concluded with a house mix of \"Higher Love\" to top it off. Safe to say I will not be returning.
