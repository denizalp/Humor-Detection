Fast? What? \n\nI don't remember ever having to wait over an hour for 2 pizzas in any pizza place. This location needs to get their business together because this was the most ridiculous wait I didn't know I'd be stuck in. If you tell a customer 30 minutes, I don't expect an hour wait. What a waste of my time and money honestly. \n\nIt took one of their employees to notice how long I've been sitting there to ask for my name in order to hand me my already cold order. What a shame. At least he noticed.\n\nI don't recommend you to do any kind of carry out order at this location, or even delivery considering how long they took to prepare a small order for me. Inept and incompetent is not my kind of business to support.
