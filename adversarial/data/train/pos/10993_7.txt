I think I just found my new favorite Thai place in town. From what I can see this place is very busy at night. The yelp waitlist does work. I tried using it last night but got tired of waiting so I decided to come back today. They have a little takeout window outside that lets you order food from the bar. The menu is a little on the pricey side compared to other places. It's on the strip so I get it. We ordered the red curry. Can't tell you how it tastes because I don't eat Thai curry but the boyfriend says it's the best he's ever tasted. I ordered the short rib fried rice and chicken pad see eew. No spicy on either one. The fried rice is so delicious and flavorable. Has a little kick to it even though I asked for none. Delicious nontheless. The pad see eew is the best I've ever tasted. My new favorite spot whenever I'm in town. If the wait is too long, call in and place a order and pick it up 30 minutes later.
