These ob doctors have completely lost touch with the needs of their patients.  They forget that just because they deliver babies everyday, doesn't mean that this isn't a once in a lifetime event for the patient.  They treated me with annoyance and condescension when I tried to express a different opinion.  They are a c-section practice, and should really tell anyone that wants to have a vbac to go somewhere else.  They may \"let\" you \"try\", but they will give you the hell the entire time.\n\nNotable moments:\n2nd Pregnancy:\nThe doctor that delivered by 2nd child via c-section considered this his duty to ensure \"informed consent\" of a repeat csection:\nDr: \"So you're scheduling a c-section, right?\"\nMe: \"I thought I had to?\"\nDr: \"Let me put it this way, vaginal birth is safer for Mom, c-section is safest for baby.\"  What new\/young mother wouldn't do what's safer for her baby?  He wrote in my chart, \"Advised patient of risks\/benefits of c-section, patient 'declined' trial of labor.\"  I didn't even know I could have one!\n*Note: My son was taken at 39 weeks and was in the NICU for a week for being undercooked.  Not at all babies are ready at 39 or even 40 weeks.  Especially boys.\n\n3rd Pregnancy: Ectopic\nAfter weird blood test and no baby seen on ultrasound, it was deemed I wasn't pregnant anymore and told I would get my period.\nMe: \"What if I don't get my period?\"\nPA Donna: \"You will.\"\nI didn't.  They said they had to give me a shot used in abortions, which sucked.\nMe: \"What if the shot doesn't work?\"\nDonna: \"It always works.\"\nIt didn't.\nMe:  \"What if the 2nd shot doesn't work?  Do I have to get it again?\"\nDonna: \"Surgery can result in loss of fertility, and the 2nd shot always works.\"\nThe 2nd shot didn't work.  I needed surgery.  Her misinformation made a difficult time even more unsure and emotionally difficult.\n4th Pregnancy: (currently pregnant)\nW\/ PA Heather:  I assumed I had to have a c-section (see 2nd pregnancy), but was really concerned about the health and wellness of my child.  I didn't want a NICU thing again.  I asked her about going into labor instead of scheduling, she said I could \"rupture\" and that it's \"not a good idea\" because I couldn't have \"the doctor I wanted\".  Which may be true for some people, but when your priority is the health of your child, I don't really care which doctor in the practice cuts me open.  Next, I'd seen videos and articles on a \"natural c-section\" which promotes healthier babies.  It's nothing crazy, it just includes a slower transition out of the womb (estimated time extra: 2 minutes), delayed cord clamping, lowering the screen so the parents can see the baby born and letting the baby have skin to skin contact with the mom.  She had the most asinine responses to my requests.\nSlower transition: \"The baby can get sick or injured if the doctors don't get them out in a timely manner.\"\nLowering the screen: \"You'll lose the entire sterile environment.  We won't do that.\" That's wrong.  It's a thin piece of paper hanging in the air.  The primary reason for that screen is for people that don't want to see their belly's cut open.  And admitting there could be some compromise with letting the screen down, it's minimal considering it'll be down for about 30 seconds and put back up again.\nSkin to Skin Contact:  I read in several places this is possible, I saw pictures and videos.  You put the heart monitor on the back and the IV in the non-dom arm and the husband helps hold the baby on the chest for just a few moments.  She LAUGHED, and then gave a demonstration where she pushed her head against the wall with her hand and said, \"There isn't room!  The baby would be squished all over you!\" and laughed it off.  Is that ever okay to do with a patients sincere request?\nShe just had no answer for cord clamping which seemed super uninformed.\nMy 2nd appointment was with Dr. Harris.  At that point I'd decided that I didn't want a c-section and was going for a vbac.  I knew that that I was low risk as far as vbacs go.  My first c-section was because I was induced for pre-eclampsia, I didn't get it with my 2nd so that's not a huge risk.  My 2nd was just because I was uninformed.  Both incisions were double sutured and over 6 years ago so I'm plenty healed.  I was met with annoyance and immediate condescension.  Dr. Harris said, \"The risk of rupture with a vbac after 2 csections is 'way higher'.\"   I told her that I knew the numbers were 0.5% with a vbac and 1.5% with a vba2c and that the number as actually closer to a 0.7% with a vba2c if you didn't use any induction methods.  She gave me every reason I would \"have to\" have a c-section anyway: after 40 weeks, \"big baby\", complications, etc.  She closed with, \"I don't know what the big deal is with having a baby naturally anyway.\"\n\nThese doctors are happy to have baby's on their own schedule, so if that's what you're looking for you - you'll do great.
