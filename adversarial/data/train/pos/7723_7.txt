Never write reviews but have to say for this one, since when did bartenders start acting like they're above people and aren't they supposed to be social?\n\nI came here for dinner with my friends and the food was good. Hostess was welcoming. Table server was friendly. Recommend the appetizer tower and the HUGE Double Barrel Burger.  \nHowever, after dinner we decided to stop by the bar and there was a girl and guy bartender. The girl was nice, blond, smiled at everyone. Unfortunately, we sat on the blond guy's section, he only waited on girls that came by and joked around with his bartender coworker. When we asked for a drink it seemed like it was a drag for him to take our order. Who's hired at this place? If you think your muscles are above everyone, go work at a Gold's Gym buddy, you're nothing special. Not coming here again.\n\nSo I rated two stars because of the outstanding negative service.
