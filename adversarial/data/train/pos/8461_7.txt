I love this place, I had such a blast. Basically, color me mine is a shop where you pick out pieces of pottery (salt shakers, figurines, plates, mugs, cups, etc..) and they provide you with brushes and the paint to create your own uniquely you piece of artwork. I had never done it before, and I love creative things. So on a 2nd date with someone I went here about a month and a half ago. We both picked out coffee cups and went at it, it was probably one of the funnest dates i'd been on in a long time. The people that work there are there to guide you, but it's really your own creative expression. I used sponges, different types of brushes, and came up with my quasi homey-version of a Monet (think water colored floral) coffee cup. My dates was filed with dinosaurs and toasters and god knows what else lol. After you're done, they seal them and you pick them up about 5 days or a week later. I never got to see my finished product, because the guy I was dating turned into a ska-douche. So I can't really tell you what it looks like all sealed and pretty. I would definitely recommend  it if you want a date night that's a little different. Probably not good for a first or 2nd date because you have to wait a week to get back your items, and i'm the example on why it's a bad idea lol Gee, I can only wonder what it looks like. Haha. Love color me mine, and thank you guys for the experience.
