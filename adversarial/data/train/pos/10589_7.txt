Note to all complainers.... this a furniture store, not a spa!  You have to make the sale happen, and you must be familiar with \"deal making\", as with any large purchase (I.e., auto, appliance, home, etc), YOU are in charge.... forget pampering, if you want that, get your nails done!  This store has average quality furniture, which will last as long as you take care of it.  Most all furniture sold today in all the stores is imported (from Vietnam, etc.) and is not the \"heirloom\" quality your parents invested in years ago. We have purchased furniture from a variety of stores in the Charlotte and surrounding area, all delivery experiences are a bit frustrating, but a necessary inconvenience unless you transport the items yourself. So quit whining and enjoy your new furniture!
