Before going to see Britney, I suggest that one sets their expectations.  This is basically a Britney sound track where a woman who resembles Britney is performing on the stage.  She does not sing at this concert, but performs her traditional dance moves altered for a woman in her mid 30s.\n\nMy wife and myself did enjoy the show.  When you see it, you realize that she does have A LOT of hit songs that you will be familiar with.  The stage effects are cool, and the venue is a good size where even the cheap seats are \"good enough.\"\n\nThis mostly is a 4 star show, but I had to dock a star due to the fact that everything that came out of Britney's mouth was ear piercing.  At one point, she put on a horrible brittish accent saying that \"it was time to be naughty.\"  Then the accent went on and off for about 30 seconds.  Other than that, she said maybe 2 other things and had to us the \"F-word\" in each sentence.  I'm not sure why.\n\nAll in all, just go in with lower expectations and you will be good.  Hopefully you also don't get a seat behind a tall guy who is there by himself, knows every word to every song, and won't sit down for a moment (even when everybody else is).
