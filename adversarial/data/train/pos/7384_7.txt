Our home's central a\/c unit's fan went out at 1:30am when it was a mere 92F out. We immediately called George Brazil, because they claim to have 24\/7 service. The person we spoke to said there was no one available at 2am, but someone would be out at 7am the next morning. Suspicious, ex-New Yorker that I am, I immediately called at 7am to confirm the appointment, only to be told by the dispatcher that no one takes calls at 2am and nothing had been set up in the appointment books (well, why would you bother looking at the appointment book if there wouldn't have been anyone around, liar?). He then set up an appointment for someone to be there between 8 and 12 (I figured, if they're like COX, that means after 3pm). I immediately looked here to read other reviews and that convinced me to call someone else and schedule with them. When I called George Brazil to cancel, they didn't even ask why I was cancelling (something tells me, they aren't strangers to cancelled appointments).\n\nNext time you're thinking of calling George Brazil for work, call Brazil instead. No doubt, you'll be able to rely more on a technician arriving from Rio de Janeiro to fix your a\/c than someone from up the street in Phoenix!
