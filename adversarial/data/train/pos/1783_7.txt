Dr. H.L. GREENBERG IS A GREAT  DERMATOLOGIST! \n\nLocated in Summerlin.\n\nDr. H.L. Greenberg is a wonderful dermatologist that I TRUST to handle my dermatological needs as well as my family's.\n\n I just got back from yet another wonderful experience with Dr H.L. Greenberg for a skin check up. As always, the doctor is a well mannered man with a cheerful disposition. My husband and I find him easy to talk to and extremely thorough. \n\nThis most recent vist he performed a full skin checkup on myself, and my husband. The fact that the staff accommodates our schedules and allows us to be seen together in back to back appointments is so nice.\n\nHe took excellent care going over the different spots that concerned my husband. Sometimes it can be a effort to get my husband to see a doctor, so I'm truly thankful Dr. H.L. Greenberg makes the experience quick and somewhat educational.\n\n One of the spots of concern, wasn't even a mole. It was just Seborrheic Keratosis, which is nothing to be concerned about at all. I'm grateful that the doctor takes the time to explain the different things that do come up and why we should or shouldn't be concerned.\n\nFurthermore, I would like to add that most COSMETIC  dermatological needs are NOT always covered by my insurance.  Although, it would be nice to have my insurance flip the bill  for wrinkles or whatever,  I understand that just isn't practical for the insurance companies. That would be  like expecting insurance to cover plastic surgery! Fortunately, I'm in full understanding of this. :)\n\n I did request Retin-A (prescription skin cream) fully aware that my insurance will not cover this particular  expensive cream. Although he did  recommended a generic form of the cream, that probably would be covered by my insurance, I will budget accordingly to obtain Retin-A. I have found it to be more effective. ; )\n\nI have read reviews stating that he is out for the money, and it is simply untrue!!!\nHe is NOT an \" all about the money doctor!\"\n He is a Dermatologist who offers a wide range of skin care procedures!! That is what I would expect a  \"Good\" Dermatologist to do!! Simply put, \"I want my Dermatologist to further his or her education  to offer all kinds of skin care techniques to help myself and or their other patients acheive what they are looking for!!\" :)\n\nMy goal is to obtain smoother, softer, prettier skin. Dr Greenberg has helped me achieve this.\n\n I  found Dr. Greenberg  on Yelp. I'm so happy and thankful I did. He was my \"Go to doctor\" when having a skin tag removed. He made  sure it was virtually painless, he numbed me up and it was done before I knew it!! \n\nPlease see previous review below. :)\n\n What MY insurance covers or does not cover is MY responsibility. Most people know this for themselves. It's called being adult!  Why do people insist on blaming physicians for their insurance coverage or lack of?!?!  My point? He is a good doctor! He has been great with myself and my husband. My review is to help others find a doctor they can trust. \n\nIn closing, I hope I have shared with you most of my reasons for reviewing this doctor. His level of Care and Experience is greatly appreciated. :)\n\nI recommend Dr. H.L. Greenberg based on the EXCELLENT SERVICE  he has given to myself and my husband. He is a wonderful doctor that delivers QUALITY Care. Do Enjoy! :)
