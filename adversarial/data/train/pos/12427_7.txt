It sucks that this one is the closest to me. I really like Del Taco. But this location is probably one of the worst and slowest. Only about 5min away from the strip, could be why they are so dam slow.\n\nI've been in different times of the day and it's always the same. One night, I waited over 30min at the speaker without them saying anything. I couldn't leave because there were cars behind me and a car in front. I proceeded to ask if they were closed and they said \"one minute, I'll be right with you\" after ordering we waited another 20mins before our food was ready.\n\nThey didn't even bother apologizing, and of course they messed up my order, which I realized once I was home. I called a couple of times and they wouldn't pick up. At this point there was no need to complain unless we wanted to wait another hour for \"fast food\"
