I regret my steak choice.  They didn't do very well on my ribeye.  20oz of regret on a bone.  There are other issues such as not having shot glasses (saddest Irish car bomb ever) but they don't matter when a steak place doesn't master steak.\n\nWhy is my review so harsh?  Wifey got a 20oz off the bone cut (not on the menu but was hand cut that day) and her steak was so much better.  This shouldn't happen.\n\nMy steak was cooked on the border of send it back or just shut up and eat it.  The flavor was lacking - more butter or salt when you cook it.  The color was off, didn't have nice hash grill marks (all the other steaks at the table did).\n\nLonghorn Steakhouse has shown they can do this steak better than Texas Roadhouse.  I went to Texas Roadhouse to try it out before my Uncle visits, since his wife likes it the best of the steak chains.  Unfortunately my Aunt loves to ruin steak, she wants it so dry that it is dark brown in the center and almost completely black on the outside.  You know who else loves to ruin steak?  Texas Roadhouse.\n\nI spent over $100 on my meal there, had it just been my wife and I then I would have given them what for when I was there.  She would have been mortified and stabbed me with a steak knife if I did it in front of our friend.  I also don't want to get my food molested by angry staff because I don't trust them once I send something back.\n\nThis is the second time I have gone to a steakhouse in Charlotte and had an awful time.  Unlike last time I didn't sit there and take pictures of everything.  I apologize for my lack of empirical evidence to backup my review - you will have to take my word for it.
