I wish that I had something exciting to report about SmashBurger but all I can say is that out to go experience was good, the staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. To be honest it was nice not to have anything major to complain about. \n\nWe ordered two of the \"create your own\" chicken sandwiches, fries and drinks to go. The order took about 10 minutes to be brought out to us. \n\nThe chicken sandwiches ($6.99 just for one sandwich) were tasty, juicy and made almost perfectly. \nFries were thin and of appropriate quantity. \n\nGood food but a bit pricey. I think I have been jaded by the inexpensiveness of dollar menu lunches. \n\nOh, I found something to complain about. They now offer Nutter Butter shakes which is unfair to those of us that are at the beginning of bikini season.
