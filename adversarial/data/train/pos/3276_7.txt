Why don't local family bakeries exist anymore? It makes me sad, because if you've been to one, then you would know what a good donut and roll tastes like. \n\nIs a Krispy Kreme terrible? No, but if I'm going to eat something that weighs 2 ounces and has 20 grams of fat then it better be mind-numbingly good. A Krispy Kreme donut is not. \n\nOn the other hand, every once in awhile you need a donut, and I don't have an alternative place for you to go. Have you ever been to bar and there was one decent looking girl and every guy was hitting on her like she was Giselle Bundchen? That's Krispy Kreme.
