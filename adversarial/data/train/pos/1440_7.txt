Words could not describe my happiness when Pinkberry was brought to Vegas. I have been a die hard pinkberry fan for years (when I had lived in southern California) I usually get the pomegranate yogurt with mango blueberries and white chocolate crisps. But I did recently try the green tea and that was amazing as well! The employees are always happy and cheerful as well, and its always so clean! I even bought a pinkberry iPhone case :) I highly recommend this place if your on the strip. Its located right next to CVS at the bottom of the Mandarin Oriental.
