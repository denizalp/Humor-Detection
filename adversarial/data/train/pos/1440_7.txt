First time eating Ethiopian. Very nice building. Hostess was friendly and made sure you had what you needed. Love hand sanitizer at every table since there are no utensils to eat with. Food was ok. It would have been nice to have thicker, stronger napkins then the thin cocktail ones to clean your hands off with.
