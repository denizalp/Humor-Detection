I am unsure how I feel about this establishment, because it kind of reminds me how I feel about going to Town Square and all of the nightclubs in this town, which I avoid like the plague, so for now I am giving them just a middle of the road review.  \n\nEverything, including the employees looks way too pretty and the clientele seem to be extra douchey because of it.  It was obvious to me from looking around there for a few seconds that the Cosmopolitan overall values outward appearance over personal, inner character.  \n\nI will be coming here if I'm on the strip for the secret pizza, because it is some of  the best I have ever had, but the policy of only hiring eye candy in the casino itself doesn't sit well with me.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and nothing here is my idea of beautiful.  A great place hires people of all shapes and sizes, a strong work ethic, and a good heart.  I really did not see the heart in this casino, except in the pizza restaurant, where it is obvious a lot of love goes into those heavenly pies.\n\nWe'll see as time goes by and I visit here a few more times if I've changed my tune about my initial opinion.
