Came here for the other day for leisurely lunch and really enjoyed their food, service and everything about this place. Oh except parking. Couldn't find one close by right away and had to walk in heels...\n\nWe didn't have a reservation but since we came early for lunch, they had a patio table available right away. Other choice was communal tables. If you have intimate or private conversation, highly recommend making reservation.\n\nSalmon I had was cooked perfectly. Fish sometimes get too dry but their salmon was juicy and so tasty. I also tasted their steak too and oh my, I think I am going to order steak at my next visit!\n\nThey have a plenty of heaters outside to make it comfortable sitting outside.
