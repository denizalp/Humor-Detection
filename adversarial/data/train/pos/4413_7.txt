It's somehow impressive how incompetent this location is. I ordered 2 hard shell beef and cheese tacos, carne asada fries with no sour cream and beans, chips\/guac and a Mountain Dew. I went through the drive through and waited 10 minutes for my order...and somehow, someway they managed to screw up every single item I ordered. I received a Dr Pepper, Tacos with lettuce and fries with beans. The guacamole was technically correct but was a liquidy mess. I didn't have time to unwrap every single item so I only caught the drink being wrong, but needless to say I am never returning here again.
