I've had nothing but great experiences with Closet Candy Boutique. Their religious views aren't my concern and have never interfered with my shopping experience. I'm not religious. \n\nI've ordered about $300 worth of clothing from them in total. Shopping was quick and my orders were correct. I've never had to contact anyone about anything. Or had any discrepancies. \n\nClothing is of great quality! \n\nCloset candy boutique, 5 stars!
