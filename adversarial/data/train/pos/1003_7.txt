Ok. I've been here few times. It took over one of my favorite bakery's that used to be there but I'm glad that this place is here. I've actually used the Yelp app to order too since I knew what I liked. The O Nigris are delish. All the flavors are good. However, if you don't like spicy I would suggest you stay away since spicy can be pretty spicy. I do have to admit that I like the beef over the chicken as the chicken was pretty dry the first time I've tried it but overall it's been good. I've definitely been back to just get the o nigri because that's my favorite. They also make it when you order so be prepared to wait a 5-10 minutes depending on how busy they are. Customer service is good and I definitely recommend stopping by to check it out at least.
