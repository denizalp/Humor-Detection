Holy nuts. Didn't think I was going to enjoy the chocolate-covered Twinkie as much as I did. If you can think of it, they will probably cover it in chocolate. Bacon? Ho-Ho's? Weed? OK, they actually don't have chocolate-covered marijuana, but one can only hope Ohio gets its act together so at some point that can become a reality.
