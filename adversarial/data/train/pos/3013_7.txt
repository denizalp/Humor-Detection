3 ladies of 3 different generations walk into a BBQ place in search of ribs. 2 of the ladies: Aunt Paula, 60's, my Grandma Kane, 87. Both little ladies, under 5 feet tall but with big personalities, their New York accents peppered with Jewish phrases and then me, 36, with my fire orange hair, we were a sight for sure. We were suppose to go to another place that has been a staple in my Grandmother's visits for years but it had closed down. The staff was friendly and our server Nickola (I think) was gracious and accommodating in every way. My Aunt Paula, on a diet, wanted the smoked shrimp but without the shrimp being smoked, just grilled. Not a problem here. My Grandma wanted 2 different types of dressing for her salad, on the side of course and not to much sauce on the ribs darling, what she calls everyone. We both had the half rack of ribs and I have to say I was satisfied. The sauce was a great mixture of tanginess and smoke, the meat fall off the bone succulent. The ribs were smaller than other places and somewhat fatty, but not bad at all. The place was very much a diner so the salad dressing choices were limited and I would bet not home made. That is fine but I make my own dressings so I am a dressing snob of sorts. The mash potatoes and gravy reminded me of home, which was great since I was sharing the meal with family. The cornbread was super yummy and I loved the butter. One little touch that won my heart over though had nothing to do with food. On each table was a laminated booklet advertising local businesses but on each page was trivia questions! I love trivia and if it was just a regular dining night, not a special I haven't seen you in ages meal, I would have been all over that trivia. You can get a great meal and reasonable prices and learn something, my kind of place. It is in Glendale which is really far from my Tempe abode but my Aunt Paula said she is definitely going back and bringing her grandsons.
