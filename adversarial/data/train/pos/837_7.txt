Obviously what they are doing here is fantastic and I was impressed on so many levels from the food, service, atmosphere, etc.  \n\nMet a couple of friends for happy hour before going to a concert in the area.  Now I'm definitely a cheese snob.  Most finer restaurants serve cheese\/charcuterie plates I'm underwhelmed by.  Usually because I can buy and find most of the cheeses myself at a higher end grocery or specialty foods store.  This is one of better cheese plates\/carts I've seen anywhere.  They had one particular soft goat cheese from Sardinia I believe topped with truffles which was freaking gangster! \n\nThe soup was excellent.  I forgot to take a pic but it was a pureed eggplant\/tomato\/roasted red pepper.  The braised artichokes were fantastic.  House martini made with Tito's and a really good French sauv blanc (both $7) were the choices and prices on the happy hour menu.  \n\nI definitely will be back!  Wasn't very busy at 6 on a Tues at the bar which is what I may shoot for again!
