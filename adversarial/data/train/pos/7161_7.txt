I can get past it being sweltering enough to choke with no relief. I can get past it taking forever to figure out where TF it is (in an alley! duh!). I can even get past having nothing to drink but water (because it's way too freaking hot for booze in here).\n\nWhat I *can't* get over is shitty sound that every vocalist struggles with. No one likes being only able to hear drums and harsh vocals. I love and appreciate this as a cornerstone of the hardcore scene. They book good bands that are too heavy for like  90% of the people who will read this, so why can't they be prepared for the intensity that genre brings?\n\nOK, maybe I lied, and the other things get to me a little bit, but that's only because I'm no longer the 19-year-old who goes by \"xTaricx\"  with something to prove in a pit. And even if I were, pits aren't really a thing anymore, which kinda takes away the character of a spot like this, don't ya think? \n\nI do love this place overall because the spirit of 2000s reigns supreme. Back when you didn't need a fucking cocktail menu to thrive in the scene. I felt more alive here, and despite my criticisms that's just not something I can give below a '4' for.
