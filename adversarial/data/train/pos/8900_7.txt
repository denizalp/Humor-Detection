Yea, this is Vegas, there's a buttload of fine restaurants in town.  I'm certain that there's better options in town, but let me tell you, I had some BOMB-ASS lamb chops here.  \n\nPositives:\n+Some sweet ass choices when it comes to the meat.  I like that Kobe and Chateaubriand are on the menu.  \n+Nice that you've got options on how you take your steak beyond just the basic salt and pepper.  \n+Attentive service without feeling overly snooty.  \n+Truffle Mac N Cheese.  Nuff said. \n\nNegatives:\n-Dont waste your time with the seasoning options beyond salt and pepper.  The rosemary can get really overpowering.  \n-Boring mashed potatoes. \n-It's Vegas.  The guy next to you is probably in flip flops and a t-shirt.  \n\nBottom Line:  A good option if you're at this casino.  Not worth traveling from the south side of the strip for, but DAMN they make a good lamb chop.
