I had breakfast here with the bf because we stayed at the Palms Place.\n\nThe price is $7.99 + tax which is very reasonable. However, the food wasn't very pleasing. A majority of the food was really greasy and fat. They had an asian section which consisty of stir fry food. It's funny because the dish I liked the most was so simple to make. Cabbage with egg and sausage for breakfast anyone?\n\nAnyways, I give them kudos for the omlette station, but the dessert station was REALLY sad. There was 1 dish there that no one really touched and an ice cream machine. What happen to fresh fruits? Well the meal was free, but I don't think I would pay to eat there because I care more about quality over quantity.
