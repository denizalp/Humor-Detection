This Rating is for Theresa GM of the Gas Station\/Car Wash. Yes ! I passed my 30 days validity of my car wash. YES ! and Thank you to accept it anyway. NO ! You don't come to me with an aggressive attitude and raising your voice to tell me: \" You know this is expired for 3 days, I will accept it this time and this is the last time!\" NO ! I am not your little boy or your employee and you are not my mother to speak to me like that! \n\nSo just for Info, I spend around $5000\/year of gas and car wash at your Gas station for the past 4 years because you are next to my house and so far I always received a \" Fabulous Customer Service\". So please just learn the phrase :\" The customer is not always right, but he is a customer\".
