Always heard good things about this place. Today I passed it and it wasn't packed. Figured why not.\n\nService was so and so. I asked for my coke in a frosted glass and she put it in a to go cup....\n\nI asked to use my yelp check in reward and she said I couldn't use it for the iced tea during happy hour.....? I have NEVER been denied a reward before.\n\nI got the chicken pad Thai. The portion was a good size. Had a really good taste. Could use more peanuts. \n\nAtmosphere is very chill. Other service staff was friendly when I was leaving. Next time I go I wish to have a better server. I would still come here for lunch when it isn't busy.
