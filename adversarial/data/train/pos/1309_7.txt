Used to love it, had the best shrimp appetizer around, now apparently they have decided to cut costs and the shrimp they are using have been reduced in size by close to 50%, same price,half the food,  When we asked about it, I was told that they use less batter.... wrong.  If you want to keep customers, do not save a buck at their expense. Posted pics comparing what they used to have vs what they have now, would rather pay an extra buck as opposed to getting something I could order at Long John Silvers.  Unfortunate.
