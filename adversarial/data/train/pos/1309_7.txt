WE ACTUALLY GOT ASKED TO LEAVE BECAUSE WE STAYED TOO LONG!!!! Hahahahahahha. I never knew buffets had time limits.... Although it was a bit embarrassing, I guess we stayed so long because we enjoyed it so much. \n\nSo my friends and I decided to buffet it up after three nights of clubbing... so yes, we definitely needed to recover. Wait time was only 15 minutes, so we were seated in no time.\n\nI'll admit - this is my first Vegas buffet, but damn, everything I put into my mouth was amazing. Here's some of my favorites!!! - \n\nMini deep fryers containing fatty goodness - corn dogs, tatertots, onion rings...\nFresh juices in cute little bottles\nRoasted duck + plum sauce\nOysters, mussels, shrimpies \nOyster SHOOTERS!\nPrime rib\nRib eye\nTruffle soup - i still have dreams about this\nKorean short ribs\nSalmon\nCorn on the cob\nSliders - soooo goood. \nPotato gratin - must try!!! I ate 3x of these. \nLobster bisque\nGelato, gelato, gelato! Try pistachio and baklava! Or everything \nCalamari with this coconut rice(?)\nDIY Crepes!!\nCreme brulee\nBroccoli & Cheese\nMac & Cheese\nAll the sushi\n....\n\nI'm probably missing a lot... but as you can see, we enjoyed everything! Every time we took a bite of something, we would sigh in pleasure or encourage each other to try it.  My vegan friend even broke her veganism that fine afternoon because the food was THAT good (sorry I'm not ratting you out!). \n\nService was good as far as I remember. The man cutting the meat was extremely polite and patient, which I liked. The gelato lady was kind, friendly, and didn't mind giving me several samples. Our waitress seemed nice, except for the part when she said there was a two hour time limit. Well, I'm sorry!! What if we all just had really really big appetites?\n\nPrice is reasonable (~$35 for lunch)! That filled me up for the rest of the day, so I thought it was worthwhile. I would come back, but probably wont stay as long. \n\nSo if you're DTB (down to buffet), I highly recommend this place!\n\n4.5 stars!
