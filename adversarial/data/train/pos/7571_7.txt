Lame!! Had my water heater installed on Saturday. The 2 idiots installing it said that it worked. I thought they checked it because one of the guys turned on my water. One of the guys also asked to use my toilet in the first 15 minutes of the appointment. Of course I had to let him use my bathroom.  He kept the toilet seat up. I'm a female & DO NOT APPRECIATE THE TOILET SEAT UPRIGHT!! And why couldn't this guy use the bathroom before coming over?? Then at the end of the appointment they ask me to give them a rating. Yeah like I'm going to write down anything  service negative in front of them. \nWell, I tried to a shower the next day ( i had taken my shower before the install) & to my surprise NO HOT WATER! It was sunday & i got their answering service. She said she would label my message as an emergency. Of course no one called me until the next day @ 7am, when i was asleep. \nCalled them back when I was awake @ 9am. I was put on hold for 8 minutes then hung up. Called again & again. Finally someone in customer service amswered. But, she couldn't help me & told me that she would have someone in their water heater department call me back. A scheduler finally called ( about 1 hr later) & said that the earliest time available was 4pm that day. Of course i had no choice & scheduled it. One positive note is that she called me back & told me that she could have someone show up @ noon. \nThis company sucks!! Unfortunately for Home Depot water heater buyers they are the official HD installers. So it doesn't matter if they get negative yelp reviews because they have a guaranteed customer base.
