Meh.\n\nThe food was okay. Nothing bad, nothing great. \n\nSomeone sent me a Groupon for the place so I went. \n\nHowever, upon arrival I was seated next to a very obviously homeless man who kept staring at me. And I mean RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. The restaurant wasn't busy at all so I don't know why they sat my friend and I right next to him.\n\nHe stunk to high heavens and would NOT stop staring at my friend and I; to the point that the manager came over and told him if he didn't stop bothering my us, he would have to leave. Which was sort of nice but I didn't understand why he was in the restaurant in the first place. \n\nTurns out, he was absolutely homeless because after finishing his soup he ran out of the restaurant without paying. After that everything was in a shambles. The entire staff was worried about running after this man who had skipped out on paying (including my server) so I sat around waiting for the side of marinara I had requested 15 minutes prior. \n\nMy calamari was cold by the time I received my side of marinara sauce. \n\nPlus the restaurant is basically part of the Corvette store which I thought was weird. Why would an Italian restaurant be attached to an American car store? Or any car store for that matter?\n\nIt's safe to say I would not come here again.
