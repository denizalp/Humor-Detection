4.5\/5\n\nThis is (changing) hands down, the most intriguing Changing Hands I've been to. A bookstore with its own bar? Who wouldn't want to have a brew with a little Bukowski, some wine with your Whitman? The selection here of books here was both entertaining and alluring. I was also attracted to the funny and cute gifts available. I couldn't resist getting a set of SNES game coasters and an adorable pop up card featuring dogs in space with a dog bone satellite. Check out was fast and friendly. If you're in the area it's worth a look!
