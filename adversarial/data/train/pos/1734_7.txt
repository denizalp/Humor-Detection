We were in the area over the weekend around lunchtime and were feeling a bit hungry.  I checked Yelp to see what was around and gave the hubby a couple of choices.  Having been born in Philly, of course he chose Philly's Famous.  I'm so glad he did! It was delicious!! We decided to split a 12 inch Original Hoagie and our daughter went with the Buffalo Chicken.  Both were phenomenal.  And the family that runs the place were so nice and helpful.  I'd definitely like to return and try a cheesesteak.  Yum!!
