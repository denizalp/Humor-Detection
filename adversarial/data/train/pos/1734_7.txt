Sorry to break it to everyone, but this establishment uses box cake mixes; as do most of the \"bakeries\" in the Phoenix area. I got this information from a present employee. \nIf I'm going to pay that much money for a cake; I want a real cake. There is a big difference in taste when it comes to real and boxed cakes. If they want to use boxed, they should tell people and lower their prices
