Edison's was my favorite bar in the world. It is not anymore. I don't really have a favorite anymore. My favorite bartender is gone. At least Terry still is there sometimes. Well, she is my favorite too. The music is not the same. The crowd is not the same. A lot of the people that used to come here all the time no longer do so. One of my best friends is permanently banned. I am sure that Edison's is making pretty good profit now however. It just saddens me. I guess like Black Sabbath said, \"I am going through changes\". I will always look back on the many days and nights that I spent at Edison's with the fondest of memories. Like 2Pac said, \"That's just the way it is. Things will never be the same\". Tremont is going the way of the dodo. It has been turning into the trendy hotspot for many years now. I think the transformation is finally complete. I may have to take this off my list of \"Places to Drink Alone\" because I don't think that is even a good idea these days. It is only a matter of time before I am gone. \n\nShadows are falling and I'm running out of breath\nKeep me in your heart for awhile\n\nIf I leave you it doesn't mean I love you any less\nKeep me in your heart for awhile\n\nWhen you get up in the morning and you see that crazy sun\nKeep me in your heart for awhile\n\nThere's a train leaving nightly called when all is said and done\nKeep me in your heart for awhile\n\nSha-la-la-la-la-la-la-li-li-lo\nKeep me in your heart for awhile\n\nSha-la-la-la-la-la-la-li-li-lo\nKeep me in your heart for awhile\n\nSometimes when you're doing simple things\naround the house\nMaybe you'll think of me and smile\n\nYou know I'm tied to you like the buttons on\nyour blouse\nKeep me in your heart for awhile\n\nHold me in your thoughts, take me to your dreams\nTouch me as I fall into view\nWhen the winter comes keep the fires lit\nAnd I will be right next to you\n\nEngine driver's headed north to Pleasant Stream\nKeep me in your heart for awhile\n\nThese wheels keep turning but they're running out\nof steam\nKeep me in your heart for awhile\n\nSha-la-la-la-la-la-la-li-li-lo\nKeep me in your heart for awhile\n\nSha-la-la-la-la-la-la-li-li-lo\nKeep me in your heart for awhile\n\nKeep me in your heart for awhile\n\n-Warren Zevon
