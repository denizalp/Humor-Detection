If you ever wondered what poison tastes like, I think I may have found it at Gongcha. Throat burning, stomach pains, and hurling my guts out. The whole damn nine yards. \n\nI've heard many good things about Gongcha since they first opened, but hadn't had a chance to try out their drinks until now. After eating at Legend Pot nearby, what better time was there? \n\nWe had the Earl Grey w\/ 3J (pudding, tapioca, grass jelly) and the Taro red bean milk tea. \nThe taro was to my bf's liking; no complaints there. Except, it's definitely way too sweet unless you get it adjusted. \n\nThe Earl Grey, however... Midway through my indulgence, I noticed an ACIDIC substance in my drink. As if I was taking 3 shots of vodka straight - but it was definitely no vodka. \nI thought I was imagining it at first, and took another sip; INSTANT PANIC. \nMy throat was BURNING, chest burning, stomach queasy for an hour. Followed by throwing up my entire dinner. Oh so classy. \n\nHOLY CRAP. WHAT WAS IN MY DRINK?!
