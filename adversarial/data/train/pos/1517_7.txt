When my brother and our friend Ron asked if I wanted to join them for lunch today, I said yes before I realized where they were going... I was super hungry! Although I've been to Chipotle just a couple of times before, I have to say, I'm not as big a fan as everyone else seems to be.  Reason being - both their corn relish and chunky salsa have a ton of onions in them... yuck!\n\nBut, I was hungry and needed some quick fuel, so I decided to tag along with the boys. I will admit, that for fast food, Chipotle doesn't seem so bad.  I ordered the chicken salad and although I would've liked some corn or tomato salsa without onions, the rest of the options were tasty; especially the guac!\n\nI will agree with Zack that Steve, the new GM, and Sam, his apprentice, treated us like VIPs.  Never before have I been approached by the GM at a fast food restaurant like that.  (Then again, I rarely eat fast food).  Needless to say, it was impressive. If I need some quick food, I won't hesitate to return to Chipotle, it grew on me quite a bit today!
