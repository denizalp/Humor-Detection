Review #200! How appropriate that this was my very first 5K.  While this was all very new to me it still seemed very well set-up with exclusive parking at SLS right across the street.  Everything was organized and (mostly) clear on where to go.\n\nThe downer was that the 5K isn't actually on the Strip - it's through the MGM Festival Village and some backstreets with some *ahem* other strip-oriented businesses.  There were volunteers and cops along the entire route, but there was also still two lanes of traffic open.\n\nHalfway through they had water and encouragement - this is probably a staple at these things but considering I'm a slow poke it was nice.  There were also DJs along the way so the music was going the full 3.1 miles.\n\nMatt & Kim played Saturday night, which I dig.  The sound was good at the festival grounds - I didn't expect less from a venue that hosted Rock in Rio.\n\nI would attend this 5K again - and hopefully many more now in the future.
