I hate leaving negative reviews for  place when the folks are so nice.  Our server and the sushi chef were extremely friendly but I'm sad to say, the food was nothing special.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.  As a sushi connoisseur, freshness is the most important ingredient.  The fish didn't taste terribly fresh.  The rolls were mediocre at best and bland at worst.  Husband reported feeling a bit ill afterward.
