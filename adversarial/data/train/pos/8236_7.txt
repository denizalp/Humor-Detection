I've been getting my 'ole changed here for 'bout 14 years now.  Yes, I meant to say \"'ole\" and not \"oil\".\n\nIt costs about $35 for the 'ole change, but if you're a repeat customer, you will receive a $3.00 coupon, bringing the total, along with the tax that we owe our blessed governor to $33.\n\nIt may seem like a pricey 'ole change, but they don't just change your 'ole.  They also check and adjust your tire pressure, vacuum your floorboard, top off your windshield washer fluid, brake fluid and power steering fluid (if applicable), inspect your air filter, and lubricate your axles (if applicable).  I buy my own air filters at Wal-Mart for like $8.00.  They offer other services like automatic transmission fluid replacement with T-Tech.\n\nWhile you're waiting for you 'ole change, you get to listen to music, breathe some exhaust-filled air, and read Popular Mechanics.  What fun!  Two of the mechanics have been working here for quite some time and they are friendly and excellent at what they do.
