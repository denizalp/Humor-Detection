Wow. I have to say there is a new contender for best dim sum in town. The food is legit and the atmosphere is beautiful and clean. \n\nEverything I tried was delicious and the menu is so extensive I look forward to returning to try even more of their menu. My favorites from this visit were the rainbow dumplings, egg yolk bun, lobster dumplings and the awesome pork belly. He Portuguese egg tarts were no joke either.
