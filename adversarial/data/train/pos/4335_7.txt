Went in and got seated immediately. The guy that cut my hair, Matt, was really friendly and seemed to listen to what I want. The actual cut, however, is awful. For the layers along the top of my head, the left side is about 2 inches longer than on the right side of my head. Terrible cut. Won't be back. For a few dollars more I can get a better cut and get it styled elsewhere. There is also hair everywhere. I don't mind it on the floors, but this place needs a good deep cleaning.
