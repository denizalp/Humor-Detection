I really tried to like this place.\n\nThe sushi is not very well rolled...they aren't tight and will fall apart as soon as you try to pick them up with your chopsticks. The ingredients aren't terrible which makes it at least edible but I'd avoid the rolls if you can. \n\nSurprisingly they are usually pretty busy so there might be a wait for a table but the bar should always have a few spots open. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and offers a very fun atmosphere for dinner with some friends. \n\nI wouldn't be back for the food but for drinks ...possibly. \n\nYou won't leave feeling satisfied but if you're starving while shopping in Town Sq. I guess this will do.
