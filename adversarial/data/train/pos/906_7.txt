My son has been taking jujitsu classes here for 4 months I guess the classes are not that bad . What I didn't like was that I decided not to take my son any more but forgot to cancel before they charged my card so before they charged my card again I called to cancel and the receptionist told me that the manager said he would not refund my money and since I didn't give two weeks notice they are going to charge me for an additional month . Pretty much they have poor customer service. The girl that called me told me about policies that when you sign up no one tells you .
