They deleted my first review, so I'll just keep writing a review until it sticks. That's how shady this company is - they try to hide how shitty their customer service is. It. Is. Sh*tty. As. F*ck. The guy I spoke to on the phone was not professional whatsoever. Rude and impatient. Wtf. Could barely understand what he was saying and was talking to someone else in person while he was trying to talk to me on the phone.
