Pardon the language. \n\n\nGod dammit Phoenix, or Arizona for that matter, how the hell did you let THIS happen. \n\nLook at it for chirsts sake, it's disgusting.\n\nSo what happened here I'm not quite sure, but apparently to me it was sometime in the late 90's a couple of well off outsiders moved to town and bought up some land because it was so cheap. Problem is though, outsiders started bringing their friends and before you knew it home prices started SOARING out of control. \n\nI think it was best when I toured an open house that was selling for somewhere around 620.00 a square foot, then called the realtor out like this \"So, you're charging Newport Beach prices huh?\"\n\nHe didn't like that.\n\n\"Scottsdale seems to be humorless in just about every way, but especially about its citizens collective dream of being Beverly Hills or Newport Beach East. You wonder how all of these Arizonians got their money with such a mediocre strip mall job market, or, if they don't actually have money but are very intent on pretending they do, you wonder how long it will last. With the Arizona housing market dropping off faster than any other state in the US you can deduce that a lot of people lost a lot of money.\"  -The Economist \n\nBut human nature is to hope and believe that things will always be as good as they are right now, and operate accordingly, so another round of JAGABOMBS!\n\nThen the shopping came to town, which nobody could afford and if they did, just made them look like an idiot or, a clown dressed middle aged man....Affliction anyone??\n\nFurthermore there's no pride in Scottsdale, just watch, Arizona has plenty of good sports teams that it's residents can root for, but in Scottsdale it's root for the Yankees or the Lakers, apparently because the city \"is at the same level\" as NYC or LA. \n\nNew concepts come all the time, and they close all the time, it would be nice for these people to finally admit they can't afford all the fine things in life all the time and move on, instead of embarrassing themselves on the news with another store or concept closure. \n\nFigure it the fuck out Scottsdale, I'm tired of hearing about all your drama. \n\nAnd no, you can't have anymore California concepts, you lost that right after you couldn't figure out how to run an Oakville grocery, which is about as simple as feeding a dog bacon.
