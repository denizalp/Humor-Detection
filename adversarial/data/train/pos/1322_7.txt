Folks we have winner on our hand here. I am quite partial to good danish (pastry that is) and this one hits all the marks that appeal to moi. \nButtery goodness check\nflaky dough check \nnot too sweet check\nI just luved the crowns, The cinamon rolls were surprisingly good as well. \nWith them moving soon to my neighborhood (union station) this will wreak havoc on my dessert intake. \n4 solid stars\nI will be back!
