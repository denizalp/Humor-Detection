Yum, yum, yum! So glad I listened to my fellow yelper Jamie P's review and went here. Amazing food, great service and freshness make the Nevada Chicken Cafe the clear choice in bbq for this area of Vegas. \n\nMy husband and I shared the 1\/4 white meat chicken which is a wing and breast. We also got the 1\/4 of ribs and a side of Mac and cheese and baked beans. I love that they have their own bottles of bbq sauce and hot sauce. Also, for you ranch lovers out there they also have garlic ranch!! Score!! Our meal came with side salads that had their own vinaigrette that was very tangy, but tasty. The chicken was tender & moist and do flavorful. Wow! The ribs! Normally I can't do ribs, but these melted in my mouth and were not greasy at all!! I was very impressed with the Mac and cheese. It was super cheesy and not full of just american cheese. Definitely not from the box. The baked beans were also full of flavor and bbq goodness. Plus, not overly sweet like some places. \nThe staff was so friendly and patience with us while we were deciding on what to order. I love that you can watch them cook the ribs on the spit. It makes the place smell amazing. The scent can literally draw you in from off the street or if you are just driving by. \nI wish I lived closer because I'd be here every week! I can't wait to hit this place up again for more ribs and chicken.
