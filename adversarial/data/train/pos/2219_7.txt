I didn't stay here, I don't want to stay here ... but I had a theory that older casinos, catering to less affluent folks, may have frequent pay-outs.  (If you read my review about another tired casino, you'll see that I find it fun to win even a couple of cents when I pull the lever.  Clearly, I'm no gambler.)\n\nI was right!  I kept winning ten cents here, a dollar there!  I was pleased.  What made me particularly happy was Texas Station's frozen margaritas.  Pretty darned good!  (I don't think patrons at this casino regularly tip the barmaids.  The gal who helped us was overly effusive about our gratuity.)\n\nThe one downside of the casino floor: skeevy men kept hitting on my daughter, one even handing her a drink.  (Like she's going to take a drink from a stranger!)\n\nWhile I would never make this place my haunt, I'll probably come back to play the slots on my next trip.  My daughter probably will not.
