I had a blast at Wet n Wild! I was lucky enough to be part of a charity slideboarding event and I got to try their newest ride. If you haven't slideboarded before, youtube it. It is similar to a video game with emphasis on hand eye coordination as you're physically going down the water slide. You can choose the type of music you want for your ride and then you have to press the correct color buttons that correspond with the lights as you go down the slide. Scores are kept and you can play against one another (similar to bowling).\n\nThe park is clean and I like that there are lockers for your stuff. There is also an option to have your photos stored on a bracelet and it's very convenient.\n\nThanks Wet n Wild!
