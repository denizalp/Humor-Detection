Avoid the buffet madness at Caesar's Palace and have some noodles instead. Seriously, check out the long line (with security) at Bacchanal and, if you're anything like me, you'll run the other way! Luckily, Beijing Noodle is right around the corner, tucked away from the all-you-can-eat crowd.\n\nRather than fight for a bite of food, all you have to do here is wait to be seated and order from the menu. We were lucky and nabbed two chairs right in front of the cook's station, which provided the perfect vantage point for foodie voyeurism. We watched the chef and his crew make noodles and dumplings by hand. One might think that a menu this basic takes very little time to prepare, but it's all about the details and handiwork. \n\nTwo of us split a duo of dishes, the Tomato and Egg Sauce noodles alongside Saut√©ed Eggplant with Sichuan Garlic Sauce. We *almost* had the Green Onion Pancake, but didn't want to overdo it. This was lunch and we didn't want a gut-busting meal! Would never have though to put fresh tomatoes and a light tomato sauce with egg on fresh noodles, but somehow it worked! And normally I don't seek out vegetarian dishes at restaurants, but eggplant is one of those foods I have yet to master at home. It was cooked perfectly and had plenty of sauce on top. \n\nAs many have already indicated, the decor is quite interesting. Glad that we sat off to the side since the whole experience is a bit off kilter. This is coming from someone who gets nauseous at the though of a roller coaster or takeoff in an airplane, so take that note with a grain of salt.
