Casual dining and friendly down-to-earth service.  This is one of those friendly, neighborhood restaurants with good prices & good food. The food prices are very reasonable too. The faux Tuscan decor looked nice.\n\nWalk in, place your order at the counter and they bring the food to you. The homemade creamy Italian dressing was really good! I will probably get a pint to go next time. The anti-pasta salad ($5.50) was made with shredded iceberg lettuce, but was delicious!\n\nThe wood-burning pizza was really tasty for what is available in the far West Valley. Loved the crisp and chewy crust. The prices ranged: $10 for medium and $12-$14 for large...the portions were plentiful.\n\nWe will go back again for sure to try their other menu items.
