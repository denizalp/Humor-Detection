I would have to agree with the other ladies comments on the childcare. What should be convenient is now an inconvenience. Having to call and make an appointment at least 2 hours prior and upon arrival there's one kid there with 5 employees ? We pay the monthly fees so we should be able to bring our kids whenever without the hassle and not to mention they're only watching them one to two hours max. Other than that, loving the new gym and machines. :)
