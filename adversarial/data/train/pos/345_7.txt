This place reminds me of a push up bra. \n\nA lot of hype and build up only to find just boobs underneath. Or in this case, JUST Mexican food. I mean... The food is good. Like all Mexican food places. It's all cooked by Mexicans so how\nMuch better can one place be over another? \n\nTiny tables. Loud as hell. Dated decor. Decent value on the food unless you ask for a side of sour cream. HOLY BALLS!! $2.75 for a side of sour cream?! Really!!!? \n\nI don't give a rats ass if every president that's still burning oxygen has eaten there... It really is like...\"meh\" if you ask me.
