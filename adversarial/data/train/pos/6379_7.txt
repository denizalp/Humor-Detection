I'm beyond perplexed. I was placing an order for their regular American gyro and said \"I'll have it with lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, no onion\". To which the girl behind the counter said, ok that will be extra. I said what will be extra? She said, the lettuce. Ummm, what? Isn't lettuce a given? That's like going to Subway or Jimmy John's or Dave's Cosmic Subs and them charging you extra, for LETTUCE. So, for $7.00 you get pita and meat. I was so annoyed by what had just happened, I walked out, gyro-less. Not because of the $0.50 extra cents for the lettuce (probably another $.50 for the tomatoes and another $.50 for the tzatziki sauce... I couldn't get past the ridiculousness of the lettuce charge to find out...), and went to Subway. I can see extra for out-of-the-box add on's like cheese, olives, mushrooms....but LETTUCE?! Poorly run business. Oh and by the way, there wasn't another soul in the place... probably because they charge $0.50 for lettuce.
