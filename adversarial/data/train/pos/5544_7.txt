this place is delicious!! my boyfriend ordered the yellow curry with rice while i had the pad see ew. my dish was very flavorful, just the way i like it. i tried my bf's dish and i was crying because i bit into a green chili pepper which i thought was a bell pepper!! i downed a whole glass of thai tea to washed the spiciness out. yikes* eat with caution you thai-food lovers!! the rice was kind of hard and not soft\/chewy to my preference. the service was pretty slow for a place thats not so crowded, it was kind of pricey too.
