Who doesn't like a hot envelope filled with tasty victuals?  Call it by any name you like:  Dumpling, potsticker, pierogi.  You've had them, growing up.  Every grandma in the world has made you something like a pierogi.  If she were Polish?  Then it WAS a pierogi.\n\nNice little store-front shop, very near the geographical center of Richfield, with a vast armada of pierogi filled with all manner of meat, veggie, even candy.  Some are hot, ready to eat.  Most, frozen, ready to take home and whip up in the privacy of your own home.  (Where it is easier to make a messy fool of yourself scarfing down these delicious little food-pockets.  My daughter was in from California and grabbed four different kinds, slapped those babies on the stove and they quickly vanished into our awaiting mouths.)\n\nThey ship, too.  What a great idea.  Have to send a couple batches out to California!\n\n\"Fish, to taste right, must swim three times - in water, in butter, and in wine.\"\n\n -- Polish proverb
