Still the best view in Vegas. Situated at the south end of the Strip, you get a view of the entire boulevard from up close. Rooftop bars at the Rio and Palms have the view from a distance, the Mandarin Oriental is in the middle of the Strip, and the Stratosphere is... well, the Stratosphere. The space has been spiffed up a little for its new incarnation, with royal blue and yellow accents and a big bar as well as tables along the window and outside on a terrace. I like it for early evening, because it becomes a dance club later in the night and gets crowded and I'm too old for that sort of nonsense now.\n\nPlus, early evening is when you can order off their sunset menu, which has snacks ranging from $5 up through about $18, plus several specialty cocktails for $12. I tried three cocktails (oops) and they were all very good, if not huge (probably for the best). I found the bartenders to be very attentive and pleasant, which wasn't always necessarily the case when this was miX. And guys, you can still take a leak in the restroom while gazing down on the Mandalay Bay pool complex.
