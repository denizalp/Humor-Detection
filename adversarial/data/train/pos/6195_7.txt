So disappointing, staff dresses like they where going to paint theirs homes or garden. fine dining prices with snack bar service. \nThe food was nothing special for those prices there are much better places to dine in Toronto. The while the food looks good it lacks flavour and excitement, all but two dishes  we ordered where bland and tasteless. \nThe $37 pork shop was served with a chickpea curry I still cannot figure out where the flavor went?? It was supposed to taste like something for 37$ but it did notoriety than it tasted like a grilled piece of meat and something that resembled chickpeas with a minimal about of brown gravy that had no substance. \nThe food is all served for sharing but when the second wave of dishes where being served the staff could not  figure out how to put the dishes on the table! They struggled moving empty dirty dishes around while trying to place the next course on the table. \nOur server watched the others struggling to serve our second course staring like a dear in the headlights not even considering to remove the dirty dishes. It's simple solution, remove the dirty dishes before bringing the next course. \nThis hipster place with untrained servers and food that in most cases is very bland is a miss. Spend your money somewhere else if you do not you will be disappointed.
