Tl;dr:       They charged me $900 for services and X-rays, did not give any laxatives to clear intestinal blockage, wrongly diagnosed what was inside of her, told me there was nothing they could do, sent me to a second clinic, and forgot to send their paperwork to the second Vet so none of what they did mattered because the Vet who helped me did it without any of their test results\n\nGo look at the not recommended reviews. There's about 45 more 1 star reviews flagged. If they werent, this place would be 1 star as an emergency clinic. That's astounding and not in a good way\n\n I thought my ferret had eaten foam and had internal blockage. They told me X rays and blood work was necessary to determine how to help her. \n\n Their Vet confirmed my ferret had eaten foam. That was wrong however, she had eaten a very large seed and the Vet couldn't see this on multiple X-rays. They gave my ferret fluids to replace the blood they took. They told me there was nothing they could do beyond this. They gave me a list of recommended vets. I choose one in front of them and told them I will be going there as soon as they open (4 hours later). The second Vet ended up giving her Ferretlax and the seed passed about three hours later. This Veterinarian didn't give her any form of laxative when they knew she had something stuck in her intestines.\n\n The big problem is they forgot to send their own test results and X rays to the second clinic they recommended! I left their clinic at 5am on August 7th and went to the second clinic at 9am August 7th. They didn't send the paperwork until 1am August 8th, almost a day after she passed the blockage.\n\nThe second Vet rediagnosed her without any of this Vets paperwork and did it for 10% of the cost. I tried explaining this to the manager she told me the $880 worth of charges was so they could make sure they can administer the $20 worth of fluids
