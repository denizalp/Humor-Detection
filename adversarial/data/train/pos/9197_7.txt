They say \"money can't buy you happiness\". Well, money my dear, can certainly make my tummy happy. \n\n16 course meal, I can't even begin to list every item. 4 hour meals are best enjoyed with good company.  By the 10th course I was ready to unstitch my dress, take off my heels and call it a night. Of course being in vegas, bedtime is no time. My group of 8 girls really enjoyed their meal--with wine and lots of it. You'd think a bunch of skinny Asian girls wouldn't be able to hang. You're so WRONG! \n\nService was superb. Decor elegant.
