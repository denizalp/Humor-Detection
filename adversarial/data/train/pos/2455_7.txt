If I had my way, I'd never call any cab company that wasn't Kingsboro Taxi. If you see one of these rarities (usually concentrated in the west end, though you can always call one ahead of time anywhere in the city), flag it and hop in. With the downward spiral that has been TTC service lately, taking cabs in the city has become an unfortunate reality. \n\nJust like a Kingsboro Taxi sighting itself, you'll have the pleasure of enjoying the following rare \"luxuries\":\n* a cab that doesn't reek like gasoline, B.B.O. or spruce air freshener\n* a silent ride (these guys are never conducting obnoxious \"emergency\" phone calls, aka booty calls to long distance girlfriends\n* a cabbie who actually knows where he's going, doesn't drive recklessly and doesn't take you \"the long way.\"\n\nAlways a pleasure!
