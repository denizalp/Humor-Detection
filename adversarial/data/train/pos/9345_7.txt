It was the wife's birthday and someone suggested we go to Talavera. What a great idea! The martinis come with bleu cheese stuffed olives. Wifey doesn't drink much so I had some of the house- recommended cabernet. Ass puckering dry and great. We don't eat a lot, so we split the 20 oz ribeye - which was perfect. We also got some fois gras just to piss off the PETA assholes. \nThe whole experience was great and I give an unconditional recommendation to anyone. \nSpeaking of my wife's birthday- this is kind of creepy and I never thought of it 40 years ago - tonight, I am going to hop in bed with a 68 year old woman!\n\nOur server - Penny - was invisible until we needed her. The spectacular view adds a great touch.\n\nI know that old people split plates because they can't finish everything, but don't worry - we always overtip when we do.\n\nA great place to go for a special ocassion.
