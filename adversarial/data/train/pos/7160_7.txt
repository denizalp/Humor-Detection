Awesome resort!  \n\nThe best check-in welcome from any of my stays in LV.  \n\nThe room:\n- A bit smaller than I thought it would be; but otherwise comfortable and clean\n- Excellent bathroom; spacious\n\nThe pool:\n- The best!  Clean, clean, clean\n- On the shallow(er) side...about 4 feet deep throughout\n- No great for swimming; was a bit crowed\n- Too many kids cannonballing - a note on this: I thought the Wynn was a bit more adult oriented so seeing a lot of kids was a bit off putting; but, what can you do, it's Summer and families vacation
