I was a little disappointed with the service and overall quality of the food. Most of their employees failed to smile and make us feel comfortable. They were somewhat rude and did not want to answer some of our questions.\n\nWe ordered the shrimp rice and it lacked flavor. The sweet and sour chicken was also very disappointing. However, not everything was bad. The shrimp with walnuts were great as well as the beef roll. Although some items were good, the overall experience made me not want to come back. The food was not all that great on top of  bad service. China town has tons of other good Chinese places that offer good food and good service.
