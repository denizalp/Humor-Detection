For a free hotel stay, I'm still going to rank it as ok. It's not a bad hotel. But considering I stayed here for  a weekend, without much fresh outdoor air, no drinking (i know, who does that?), and I still come home sick because of lack of good, fresh HVAC. The hotel casino floor was pretty smokey, and some of it traveled up to the rooms. \n\nI do love that every room comes with a view of something. It was too cold for the pool, so I'll have to try again. The slots were ok, if you were patient enough (I was not). \n\nThe dinner buffet was pretty amazing. Only because they had dungeness crab, and king crab legs. Without that, I'd pass on the whole buffett. I wasn't even impressed when they had free mimosas.
