I had heard that this place was such a great deal. 99 cents for sushi from the a la carte sounds pretty cheap but they didn't mention that it was for 1pc so really its not that cheap. But the sushi itself was quite good. It was nice and fresh. However, they do have all you can eat for $9.99 which is a pretty good deal.
