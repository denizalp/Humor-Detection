At first I was slightly conflicted.  Do I write a review for HTC or Halo?  \n\nBeing that Glen and Kelsey have done all my piercings, albeit back in the day while still with HTC, I have only used Halo for new jewelry and stretching...but then it dawned on me...Glen and Kelsey were the reason I went to HTC in the first place.  They are also the reason why I go to Halo now for any further needs as well as recommend Halo to anyone I know who is interested in getting pierced.\n\nTherefore, Halo it is...\n\nI don't do things half-assed.  I research.  I inquire.  I am safety conscious.  I have no issues paying for higher quality products and customer service.  I also believe in loyalty when the situation deserves it.  I believe in supporting entrepreneurs.  I believe in Glen and Kelsey.\n\nThey have done all my piercings...in fact Kelsey was just an apprentice for my first.  She did an expert job then as she does now.  In fact, I think Glen has only done one for me but I know the two are essentially interchangeable.\n\nThey have the highest quality jewelry available.  They have interesting pieces as well as the old stand-by classics.  They believe safety and knowledge of the process is of paramount performance for the customer.\n\nThey have excellent recommendations as well go above and beyond for making sure the customer is happy.\n\nHonestly, if you are researching a place to go...place your trust with these two.  If I do anymore I'd come back to Phoenix just to have them do the work.\n\nYou can't go wrong here and Halo (Glen and Kelsey) set the gold standard on what\/how a piercing shop should be.
