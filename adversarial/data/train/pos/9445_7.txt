Love this place!\n\nCome here a few times, and I always regret it after. \n\nI eat too much.\n\nIt's just too good.\n\nI can't stop.\n\nI have a problem.\n\nI love it.\n\n\nAnyways, they are really clean. They change the grill frequently unlike some places.\n\nLove the booths.\n\nBut most of all,\n\nLOVE THE LATE NIGHT DINNER PRICE :)
