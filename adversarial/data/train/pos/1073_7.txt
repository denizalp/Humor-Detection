Been going here since it opened. Really limit what I buy because Costco has items that is much better.  Hate the way they treat their employees but all Walmart owned stores are like that. Talk Union and you're fired!  Biggest issue is the store needs a major update. When I can I'll go to the store on Rainbow and 215 just because it's cleaner and better layout
