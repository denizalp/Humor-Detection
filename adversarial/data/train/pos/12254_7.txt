Awful customer service. I felt completely ignored by the staff, I even tried to have a conversation with the staff, and was looked at like a leper.  If I was just getting into to vaping I would have been completely turned off to it. A very elitist attitude by all staff members.  The prices are way to high compared to other competitors in the valley. I'll definitely be taking my business elsewhere.
