It's plenty spicy, the pork is flavorful. \n\n2) Biscuits and Gravy \n\nMassive drop biscuits with Schriener's sausage in a cream gravy. We ordered this thinking it was a side; no way, this is a meal on it's own! Glad we got to try it. \n\n3) Margherita Pizza \n\nThis is obviously a very simple pizza, and the ingredients shine. Plenty of fresh basil and tomatoes without being overwhelming.\n\nThis is the thin crust version which I prefer; however, I've heard excellent things about the thicker crust Sicilian style. \n\nOrder at the counter service. \n\nResist the pastry case! \n\nOne of my favorite local spots. If you've been procrastinating paying Liberty Market a visit . . . Go, now!
