Best thing ever to come Vegas. Don't confuse this with other \"the griddle\" restaurants that have been around Vegas.  This is The Griddle that I would wait in a line outside on Melrose Ave in LA for 3 hours just to eat the delicious breakfast. This is open 24 hours!  I have been 3 times to this location already.  The busiest I've seen it is 10am.  There was a 30min wait. We easily snagged seats at the bar and avoided waiting.  \n\nMy first visit I requested my FAVORITE breakfast item using the \"secret password\".  The servers had no idea and I was absolutely bummed.  The owner I believe her name is Judy was an ABSOLUTE DOLL. She was so kind and accommodated my special request.  Cooked it for me herself!  So long as I promised to try the Mama's French Toast.  I can't get into detail about this secret password item. Not sure if I'm allowed to. (If you find out... It's amazing!) I tried the mamas French toast and I love it. Ordered it 2 more times after I think I am hooked.  Bread so thick.  The flavor is just perfect, addicting, and different from any French toast I've had.  I only use butter no syrup the way Judy suggested. WOW!  \n\nSide of bacon. 4 pieces very thick honey tasting yummy. Cooked even. Neither soft nor crunchy. \n\nExtensive menu so many things I would try.  Full bar!  Spiked shakes.  Everything!  Portions are huge. Appears entrees don't all come with sides. After ordering sides the tab really adds up. French toast, bacon, one egg, and milk $20. \n\nThe servers are pretty nice.  I did try one of the cocktails consisting of Hennessy and frangelico. Took one sip hated it. The server asked me what I thought however after I voiced my opinion did not offer to change it.  I ordered it so I don't mind paying for it. Was just reluctant to buy anything more so I stuck with water.
