I think Anne pretty much hit the nail on the head. The decor was nice, I could see potential for this spot to be a posh hang out, get drinks kind of place (if it weren't so expensive) but the food is really really disappointing. I came especially for the okonomiyaki, since it is a really hard to find item.....and we had to send it back to the kitchen. It was that bad. And they still charged us for it. The portions are ridiculously small and overly expensive. \n\nI think I'll spare myself and go elsewhere.
