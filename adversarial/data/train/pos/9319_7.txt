I love this little used book store. It's a mom and pop shop and how could you not like it? Support small business! I come here at least once a month and find that they have a decent selection of books. It all depends on what you read as you may or may not find what you are looking for. \n\nTheir prices are a little higher than Amazon for certain items, but I'm happy to pay knowing I'm supporting a locals business.
