This location sucks. Products everywhere, dirty store, lack of products for certain brands. Especially in the NYX cosmetics section. Packages were opened, fresh new lipsticks ruined because some idiot forcfully smashed the cap on it, and there were hardly any products left.\n\nI know Ulta is Sephora's ugly step sister but I much prefer to go to Sephora than this place. Most high end products (cosmetics, skincare, fragrances, body care, hair products) are sold at Sephora anyways. What's the point of Ulta? I know they have brands like Revlon, Covergirl, Maybelline etc...etc... but umm...that's what drugstores are for. \n\nOnly reason why I came here was for the brand Essence. I went to purchase a dupe lipgloss for NARS Turkish Delight.
