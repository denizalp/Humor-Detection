Best value for your money on the Strip! \n\nMy friends and I bought seats very last minute and sat at the very back of the theater... but they were still amazing seats! Boyz II Men puts on an entertaining show - displaying both their talent and humor (the crowd would crack up a lot). As other reviews have said, there is a ton of audience interaction, from roses, to selfies to dancing with the guys. Their voices have not degraded with time and aside from singing the hits, they cover other famous tracks. I'm not sure how often this happens, but a member of AZ Yet came out during the show we attended, so you might even catch a special guest performer. Drinks are expensive, but you get a souvenir cup with it. I just brought my own snacks :D\n\nThis is a show you can see multiple times with different groups of people and still walk away happy. I hope they can continue going on for years to come!
