Okay, this place is ghetto, but in a somewhat fabulous way.\n\nLobby is a bit outdated, but the reception staff were very helpful and check in was quick and easy.\n\nBartender was cute and helpful when we were having an issue with not having a corkscrew in our room and needed to open our bottle of wine.  He also was kind enough to provide us with wine glasses from the bar instead of making us drink our bold red Italian from plastic Days' Inn cups.\n\nSure, the place is run down and sure the carpet in the elevator was in desparate need of a good cleaning, but our room was clean as was the bathroom.  \n\nOf note, they provided us with extra towels without us having to request them.  When the reservation was made they were told that there would be 3 of us staying in the room and they made sure we had 3 sets of towels.  Awesome!\n\nThe location is perfect and within walking distance to the Old Port, rue Ste. Catherine, rue St. Denis, and Parc Mont Royal, which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars.\n\nThere were some rabblerousers on either side of us...we complained once on our way out to dinner and when we returned they had disappeared!  Yay for that!
