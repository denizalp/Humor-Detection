I'm having a difficult time with this review. While the food is good, the service was abysmal. The restaurant wasn't packed, and in all fairness- it seemed as if there was only one waiter. However, there were many people standing around. Every time we would look for our waiter, he was gone. Or he would run off mid sentence before we could say \"I would like to order...\".\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine we enjoy- and it was completely corked. The cork was destroyed upon opening and a sponge. So, we did the unthinkable. We sent it back. We asked our server to try it - to see if he agreed. The waiter was very moody about it.\n\nWhen we got our bill, they tried to charge us for the corked wine!\n\nChef Gross stopped in and greeted guests, which was nice- but the terrible service left our stomachs sour- which is dumbfounding for a James beard award winning restaurant.
