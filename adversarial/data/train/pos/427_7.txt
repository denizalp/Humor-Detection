Let's raise this up a star!!!\nMy last review I only contained 3 stars. This was only because I grabbed a shake to go and they didn't have any sweets other than eclairs left.\n\nThis time around it was a to go, but because they had every sweet still for sale and the cafe mocha was pretty delicious I'll raise it up.\n\nI grabbed every type of macaroon they had and all were pretty dam good!! And worth grabbing any time your here...
