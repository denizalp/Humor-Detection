I'm a huge quesadilla fan. I'm also a big fan of fresh food. In addition to that, as often as possible I like to be a patron of the small locally held businesses in the area where I live. I like spending my money there because they spend their money here and we all know that's good for the local economy. Okay so here we go.\n\nThis place has a pretty big blue sign on the front of the store. They have a half a dozen or so parking spaces of their own in front. It's nothing to look at but what goes on under the hood is pretty darn special. There is only about 5' x 12' of walking space in front of the counter. Directly in front of you when you walk in the door there are pork rinds, Cabeza, Cow Tongue and a few other traditional Mexican entr√©es nicely seasoned and cooked. In the back behind the counter you can see through an open door, a team of folks working hard and making tortillas. This is what I was here for. Now over to your right they have prepackaged in a few different denominations and sizes fresh tortillas made probably only earlier that day and packaged right there on the spot. I bought myself a dozen 12 inch flour tortillas for $1.98 . . . . I couldn't wait to rip open the package and try one right outside the store (I ended up eating three)  Yummy ! All I can say now is I don't know if I can go back to the ones I used to get at Fry's. If any of you have ever had fresh flower tortillas you already know what I'm talking about. Check it out for yourself!!
