As a former East Coaster, I was really excited to see this place. I ordered delivery for a co-worker and myself and the delivery was a little slower than I was expecting but I guess our suite number didn't print on the ticket so I can't fault them for that.\n\nI ordered the Mount Snow panini that has ham, blue cheese and sliced green apple on it. I had a side of macaroni salad and I had the french onion soup (don't judge, I was hungry) and my buddy got the  Vermonter (I think) with a side of coleslaw. Everything was great - my bread was crunchy and buttery and the blue cheese was great with the thin sliced ham and apple. My co worker wished his sandwich was toasted but loved it as it was too. The macaroni salad was a little sweet for me - it had a vinegar based dressing rather than a mayo dressing and I am a mayo freak so that is just personal preference - it was still really good.\n\nThe soup was nice and hit with a huge glob of cheese and big chunks of caramelized onions and a nice rich broth. It was nice that they added the bread (croutons) on the side so you didn't get mush.\n\n\nI will definitely be ordering from here again as there are many items on the menu that look delicious but it might be hard to compete with my sandwich.
