This place has such a fun, friendly, and inviting atmosphere! My friends and I decided that we wanted to get away from the Strip and when we saw this karaoke bar on Yelp we knew we had to come here. \n\nUpon arrival they set up the room super fast and at a reasonable price. $30\/hour for a medium room is not bad! The list of songs available is updated every month so they have a wide selection in all different languages. They also have snacks, alcohol, and drinks available to order at a reasonable price. The staff are very helpful and kind. When you're in room there is a button you can press to call for service as well. There were two monitors in the room and the navigation of how to play songs was fairly simple. The seats were comfortable and they also provide you with tambourines too, which I thought was a cute touch.   \n\nMy friends and I stayed for about 2 and 1\/2 hours and we had a blast! It was definitely a very memorable experience and I would highly recommend coming here if you're in the area!
