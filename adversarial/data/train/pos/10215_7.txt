After a lovely recent experience, I know I'll be back at Maxi's - if only because now I MUST order the amazing dishes others in my party got during our visit! \n\nTheir creamy tomato sauce is simply divine as I got to try a bit with my dad's spinach ravioli's (PERFECT) and my sister's penne pasta alla flavia (also delish!)  I was kind of jealous but I couldn't feel too bad with having ordered the veal piccata.  The veal was great and the piccata sauce was very fresh and light with the right lemony acidity and capers for some bite. This dish, as well as my mom's chicken marsala, came with a side of penne in their tomato basil sauce which was fantastic. This sauce lacks the creaminess of the formerly mentioned rock star of a sauce but had a very robust tomato presence without being overly chunky and, perhaps most importantly, very flavorful. The pairing of a meat dish that features sauce with a pasta in a different sauce (albeit in a separate dish), seems a bit weird to me but it was also like I got to try a couple different sauces which is always a bonus!\n\nService was very nice and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. The dining area is smaller\/more intimate and it appears most of the space is taken up by the bar - I bet this place enjoys a fun bit of nightlife!
