Picante. Everything here is Picante in some way or another. For me that's a good thing, for other people, maybe not so much. The pollo was picante, the beans were picante, the cold pasta salad was picante. The fresh salad, rice and tortillas were not. I stopped by on a Wednesday night and they had a buy one (either half off or free, don't remember I am old). I bought the deal along with a cold 2 liter coke, which is a great deal for the price I paid. You want to know how much? I don't remember...\n\nThe chicken was delicious and had great flavor. One of the chickens was a tad bit dry but we still enjoyed it. The beans, cold salad and salsa were also great. Their red rice was so bland, i let my kids eat all of it. \n\nThe place is small and clean. The girls working that afternoon were super nice and helpful.
