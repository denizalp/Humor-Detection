Good location in a new strip mall near to Cafe Zupa's and Pizza Rev.\nMenu is quite hard to follow if it's your first time. Read it from bottom right to left! Choose a size, base, and which proteins you want, then all the toppings you desire. \nThe price is right. A small will run you $7, and includes any two scoops of proteins. I love that they charge you by the scoop, and not specifically by which kind of fish you want. Even avocado is an included topping item. They'll just charge if if you ask for extra. Seems more affordable than many other poke places in town. \n\nSo why only three stars? A lack in customer service is understandable, but their customer service is just dreadful. Don't expect to be greeted with a smile or much help from the employees whatsoever. Inspect a hint of annoyance instead. I have felt uncomfortable for the way I've seen customers treated and spoken to. I contacted management through an email concerning this incident, and did receive a very professional response from the owner ensuring me they would improve upon their flaws. I appreciate that he took the time to apologize and look into the employees customer service.
