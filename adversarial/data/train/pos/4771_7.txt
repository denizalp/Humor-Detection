If I could put zero stars that for the dealership would be getting, I just moved to Pittsburgh from Austin Texas, and ive waiting for a phone call from them for almost three weeks now all they had to do was write me an estimate for glass repairs, I drive to a baby shop close by and got the estimate done in 5 minutes, it's just crazy. On one ovation I talked to 8 people and over two hours worth of being passed around to different people on the phone! When I finally had a day off and was able to go to the shop, standing no more than 5 feet from my car the manager couldn't look at my car with out an appointment, even with no one waiting for him......Very rude people and a HUGE waste of time, even my insurance claims adjuster told me they where the worst shop she had ever had to work with. They might work better for you if you buy a car from them, but put of state move ins they obviously didn't want to help!
