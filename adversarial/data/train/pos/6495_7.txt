Well it took a while, but I finally made time to stop by Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  I'm not that big a Flay fan, but I was really interested in trying his food based on the pics I've seen on yelp which look pretty damn creative.\n\nI stopped over for lunch and based on early recommendations from my friends and my own curiosity, I didn't waste any time with ordering.  I started with the Blue Corn Pancake for my appetizer and their Chile Relleno for my entree.\n\nBlue Corn Pancake with Barbecued Duck - with habanero chili and star anise sauce. \nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/Y2YRp1\nThis was pretty much like a duck taco.  The duck was very tasty and had a nice smokey flavor with a little kick to it.  It was really good and I'd order this again.  The only hiccup I had with this was the fact that I ended up chewing on a bone near the end.  That was a red flag and I told my waiter about it.  He was shocked!  The real sucky part about it was that I didn't get any compensation for it.\n\nCornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno -  with Roasted Eggplant,  Manchego Cheese \nSweet Red Pepper Sauce, and Balsamic Vinegar\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/VmHanC\nI've had my fair share of Chile Rellenos, but this has got to be the most fanciest Chile Relleno I've ever seen.  And it was good as expected!  The Chile crust had a nice crunch to it while the cheese was nicely melted down.  And to exhibit a little bit of food porn, check out the gooey cheese oozing out from inside.  (http:\/\/bit.ly\/WYhacm)  Ooooooh yes!!!  \n\nFor the most part, other than that hiccup with the bone in the duck pancake, service was still good.  My waiter was very courteous and always checked on me over the course of my meal.  It would've been nice to have a little compensation or bill removal for the bone which I probably should've requested, but I'm not that aggressive.\n\nI'd probably consider going back again to Mesa Grill to try their other menu items, but it probably won't be for a while.  The food is good, but I'd really have to be in mood for it to go back.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4!
