How far the mighty have fallen. If you read my previous review, written in 2008, I used to love the Wynn buffet. I haven't been to the Wynn buffet in a few years...pretty much since Wicked Spoon and the Bacchanal Buffet opened. My partner-in-crime Brian V. and I were in town over Thanksgiving and felt nostalgic so we decided to revisit the Wynn for Thanksgiving brunch. We arrived at about 10:30 am and the line was not too long. This buffet is truly frozen in time...nothing has changed as far as the types of food offered. It is really just standard buffet food circa 2000. I got some turkey breast, slab bacon, and an eggs benedict. The turkey breast was so dry I almost choked on it. The eggs benedict was completely overcooked to the point of rubber and was completely inedible. I was honestly shocked at the awfulness of this food. My dining partner went straight for the shrimp. As soon as he sat down I could smell a strong odor of ammonia...like seafood that had gone bad. When we looked at the shrimp it was pretty obvious that he should not eat them...some had even started turning green. When my champagne arrived it was in a dirty glass...and when I say dirty, I really mean filthy. Upon further inspection all of the glass wear on the table we equally as filthy. Very frightening!!! We were both completely nauseated and revolted...the manager gave us our money back and we left.\n\nNever again!
