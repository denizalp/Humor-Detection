It was almost impossible to rent a car here. I'm a Las Vegas resident who has rented cars from budget and sixt every time I leave town. I don't want to put too much miles on my nice car. But when I arrived, the workers were very rude and kept trying to find ways to prevent me from renting their car. I believe they were prejudice since I look very young and have no reason to drive an Audi. It didn't help since I arrived using an uber instead of coming in my Porsche. Since I had a NV drivers license, they made me show them two of my mortgage statements and other utility bills because they claim people who are FROM in town.......are known to steal cars. I've never heard such absurd claims before and I never ever had problems like this at budget or sixt. When I provided all the necessary information, the manager wanted to only rent me the 2014 car instead of an available 2016 car. While I was already on the road....they wanted me to take a picture of their license plate and text it to them. It was as if they wanted to track me or something. Be prepared to show them your tax returns too!\n\nI won't try to decipher their business practices but I can definitely say their service blows. The service people were rude, ghetto, and they were very judgmental. I'll never spend another dollar at silvercar and I wouldn't recommend anybody else do it either.
