Visited 4\/12\/13: Terrible service and even worse food!\n\nI went for a dinner for 2 on a Friday night. The decor was ok but that was it.  We decided to try the Thakali Thali which is listed as a \"set meal\".  The waitress didn't know anything about what the set meal was, what our specific meal consisted of, how much food there would be, or anything. She had to go to the back room THREE TIMES to get help, and even then she didn't have answers to our questions.\n\nShe didn't know how many drinks came with the meals, and if it was enough for two people.  The diet coke didn't come out until the meal did, and it was warm.  The food was bland, flavorless (bad for a place called Flavors of India).  The daal was BURNED. It smelled burned and tasted worse.  When we told the waitress, she didn't understand what we meant. The manager offered to get us another dish. It took 10-15 mins and it came back watered down and JUST AS BURNED. The goat was terrible. The chicken shahi korma was flavorless, like they just boiled chicken and plopped it in sauce.\n\nTo make matters worse, TWO other tables there at the same time either got bad food or were ignored. One guy and his kid waited over 30 mins to get served, and they were clearly on a time crunch.\n\nI am Indian and I know Indian food. This was horrible food.  I can handle poor service as long as the food is good. This food sucked. I left them a ZERO tip and wrote on the back of the bill how I felt. Hopefully they can fix this because they are giving Indian food a TERRIBLE name.  I will NEVER go to this place again, and I will actively tell my friends NOT to go here.
