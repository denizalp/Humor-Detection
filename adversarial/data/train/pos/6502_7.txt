Walking into this place we were greeting by 2 staff members saying \"Hi\" to us as everyone else after that who walked in the door.  As we left they thanked us for coming and said good bye.\n\nThis is nicely decorated with parrots and other tropical animals hanging from the ceiling.  The seats are comfortable and we had plenty of room for a big crowd.  \n\nYou order at the counter and they bring it to you at your table.  Self serve drinks at the fountain serving Pepsi products.  \n\nFood came to us fairly fast and was hot. Portions are large and yummy.   I did not care for the bean and cheese burrito we got for our son. The beans were a little starchy but my son didn't mind.  Food had a lot of flavor and had its own personality.  \n\nI will be returning for more.
