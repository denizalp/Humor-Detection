I've been here a few times and the service is always super slow. You can tell they are extremely understaffed but those who are working are literally running around the restaurant trying to deal with the patrons. \n\nTonight. My husband and I came for crawfish, a Valentine's tradition. Upon walking in, we were told it would be a half hour wait unless we sat at the bar. We decided to sit up there, thinking we would get faster service. 15 minutes later, someone came by to ask us about drinks. We deliberately asked \"you still have crawfish, right?\" And our waitress told us they did. We placed an order for five pounds and waited. And waited. And waited. 25 minutes later, she came back to us and explained they were out of crawfish. We had been there 40 minutes and had nothing but water. She said she was sorry but offered no consolation, no \"please come back for a pound on the house\", no nothing. That sucked. \n\nThe only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is because I have been here before for lunch and it was decent. Bottom line - call first to make sure they have what you want, then ask twice, then still come hella early.
