There was not a lot of green in this garden!! \n\nWe waited almost 15 minutes before our server got to us to ask us for a drink. She seemed to be nice but barely came by to check on us and got more lazy as our time there went on! \n\nWe ordered a duo appetizer...and we were very disappointed! The calamari seemed like it had never been in water, it was dry and cold! The fried mozzarella was good but we only got three. For $10.79 the plate was tiny and completely... NOT WORTH IT! We had ordered the unlimited pasta bowl and the pasta was great, but when I went to order a second plate our server said, \"really?\" It was uncomfortable and unappreciated. I'm not ashamed to say I love my food and want to get my money's worth \n\nOverall the atmosphere was okay. Seemed a little more dated than other Olive Gardens I have been to.
