You can't be 100%, 100% of the time. \n\nIt's something I tell friends, \nbusiness owners, \ninternal me \nall the time. \n\nBut you have to strive for consistency, you can't be so vastly different time to time because people won't know which way is up. They'll start to lose faith and worry about what next time will be like.\n\nNo worries here, there won't be a next time. \n\nI'm appalled, angered and actually contemplated removing my first review (5-stars) but I felt it was important to see just how abysmal my experience was today as compared to last time. \n\n3:50pm\n\nIt started with a woman at the front who asked me to fill out new patient paperwork even though as she was pulling out folders, shuffling papers and readying a clipboard I explained 3 times I had been there before. \n\nShe told me she'd find my paperwork and asked me to sit down. \n\nAnother woman called me up, the associate director of operations. She asked me for my insurance card and I again explained it should be on file... I had been there twice this year. \n\nShe told me they had a new system and asked me to pull it up if I could. I took my seat and did just that. \n\nI went back up to the desk with my ID card on my phone, she said she found a copy in my folder and told me I could take a seat. \n\nSame woman called me back up to the desk and said it would be $105 today. Huh? For what? I haven't seen anyone or been diagnosed with anything? I told her that I thought it was $10 for an office visit. She said last time we didn't charge you enough, so it'll be $105 today and asked me if I wanted to pay the whole thing up front or in installments. Really now, WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! \n\nI HAVEN'T SEEN A DOCTOR! What is $105? Seriously, where did you get that number? What am I paying for? \n\nShe told me they'd \"figure it out\" and told me to take a seat. \n\nTime passes. (A lot of time.)\n\n4:30\n\nI'm finally taken back. \nHeight. \nWeight. \nBlood pressure. \nThen the nurse leaves and the Doctor comes in.\nI explain my symptoms, she says she wants to run a throat culture. I'm guessing here she only listened to the fact that I have throat pain, a mild cough and post nasal drip, and neglected to hear the fact that I've had a low grade fever, chills and a lack of appetite. \n\nTimes passes.\n\nA medical assistant comes in with not one but TWO throat cultures. Offices can run a quick test for strep on the spot, they can also send one out to a lab. The Doctor decided she wanted both. In my foggy haze I'm trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together but I just can't quite get there, but I also know it doesn't add up. \n\nTime passes. \n\nDoctor comes back and says their test shows it's not strep. (I'm shocked. ) She says they aren't going to send the other test to the lab because the in office test is 95% accurate. THEN WHY DID YOU PERFORM BOTH? Why not the in office test first, followed by the other? Advanced apologies to my insurance which I sincerely hope denies Concentra's claim. \n\nTime passes.\n\nI finally have some scripts for what this Doctor deems is acute sinusitis. \n\n5:40\n\nThe place is dark. I'm talking lights off y'all, everybody went home. There isn't even anybody at the desk anymore who could take a payment. \n\nI'm walked to my car because I'm the last person there.  \n\nBut it doesn't end there. \n\nNow I'm at Walgreen's where I'm told one of the prescriptions has a $40 copay, and it's the equivalent of cough syrup and an antihistamine. The pharmacist points me towards OTC drugs that total $10 and achieve the same desired effect.\n\nConcentra, you've lost me.\n\nNot only in the confused WTF way, but as a patient too. \n\nYou are just too inconsistent for me to trust you with my well being.\n\nYour slogan is \"Treated Right.\" Put some power behind that because right now those are meaningless words.
