1 star is one too many. Delays after delays. The ground crew is unprofessional, rude, and short with you. I was afraid to fall out of the sky due to a lot of flights having technical difficulties. Just a mess. Don't do it. Pay the extra cash for southwest. Or dare I even say.. fly spirit airlines.\n\nUpdate: after so many delays, the app broke. I feel you, bro.
