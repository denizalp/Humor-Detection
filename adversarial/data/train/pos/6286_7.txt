DONT GO HERE!!!DONT GO HERE!!DONT GO HERE!!\n\nAs much as I love supporting small businesses  I do have my checks and balances in place, when they are not worth the praise- I like to express my concerns!!\n\nI went here on a Wednesday morning dropped my $150 boots for heel repair and asked the lady if I can have them today so at 12 she said to come at 2pm.So this very unprofessional young gentleman asks me to pay before the service-I paid $20 through my card and to my disbelief he started questioning as to how I sign my name.You got to be KIDDING me and I brushed him off by saying that's how I sign a $500 transaction as well(of course with rolling eye balls).\n\nOk I kill time in the mall, eat my meal and am back at 2 to pick them up.So this elderly man comes out saying they aren't ready and he doesn't know if they can fix it or not and now they have already drilled them so they are not wearable no longer.I ask him why he drilled them and now if they can't be fixed I can't even wear them he starts yelling and I literally  had to shut him up by saying calm down!!Its like I'm stuck in Hell!!I tell him to keep them try on them I can return tomorrow...Its Thursday and I am going to pick them up.God luck to me!!If they aren't fixed I will make sure u complain about them to the management.AND YES I DIDNT READ THEIR REVIEWS BEFORE GOING OR ELSE I WOULDNT HAVE GONE!!\n\nLesson to myself: ALWAYS READ YELP REVIEWS :\/
