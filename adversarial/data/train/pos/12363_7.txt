This place was recommended by friends of my fiances. We love trying new Mexican places.\n\nWe're almost not even friends any more after trying this place. \n\nYou either have not had authentic Mexican food before or your pallet is broken if you think this place is even remotely tasty. Absolutely no flavor whatsoever, completely, totally bland. \n\nI have never been so disappointed, Taco Bell is more impressive. \n\nNot to mention, my fiance was sick at both ends for 2 straight days after eating here. Luckily, we got different dishes and I didn't have that horrible experience.\n\nWe would never, ever go here again and would not recommend it to anyone.
