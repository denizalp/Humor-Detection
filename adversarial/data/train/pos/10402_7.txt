Both my parents and my in-laws have some magnetic draw to these particular buffets. The only reason we come to this location is because it's a mid point meeting place for family coming from opposite sides of town. This place used to be OK. But out of the three Buffet @ Asia I've been to, this one is the worst. The price is OK, service is hit or miss, but the food selection and cleanliness have took a turn for the worse.\n\nI'm pretty easy to please, but I was hard pressed to even fill my plate on my three trips. I'm not sure if they got rid of the Mongolian grill, but it wasn't up on our visit and that's always safe for me to go to when I'm in doubt. I grabbed a couple pieces of the sushi rolls and ate one and was done with those for the night. All of the raw food looked like it had been sitting out for a while, so I didn't go near the oysters either. The sweet and sour chicken, potstickers, cream cheese rangoon, and peel and eat shrimp were edible. And I actually liked the asparagus and of course, as always, the doughnuts. Overall, everything looked just cluttered in the restaurant and the food wasn't getting regular rotations at the buffet.\n\nOur server was consistently behind with removing plates and with refills. She also could be a world class poker player as she didn't change her expression or demeanor the whole time we were there.\n\nThe bill for our party of 7 was $120 which I prepaid before we ate and included auto gratuity of 12% for parties of 6 and greater. Some in the party were happy but I was unsatisfied. Our family will choose to go Buffet @ Asia again. But I'll just make sure we go to the Rainbow or Eastern location.
