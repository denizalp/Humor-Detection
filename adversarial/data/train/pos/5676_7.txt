It's pumpkin bread season! Well in our household, it's pumpkin bread no matter what season. It's great we can count on Great Harvest to have the yummy super moist, pumpkiny loaves ready every day.  \n\nBreads are baked daily and most are on the rack by 6am when they open. They feature several different breads. All of the ones I get are always super soft and tasty.  On Saturdays make sure you get here early! Since it's closed on Sunday, every mom is here stocking up. By late afternoon the racks are wiped out!  We know, because we have been SOL twice now!\n\nThe young staff working up front are always friendly and polite.  They always remind me to get my card punched. You can find Great Harvest booth at Farmers Market, Fridays at Henderson Pavilion. \n\nThe store itself is more on the country charm side. There are a couple tables so you can have your sandwich there. They carry jams and miscellaneous stuff perfect for last minute gifts. \n\n--Cost--\na little more than traditional grocery stores, but I am fine with that. Quality ingredients, made from scratch. You get a punch card and rewarded after so many visits. Anytime you come here, they feed and fatten you up offering a slice (more like a hunk) of bread and butter. \n\nIf you have the Yelp app, make sure you check in and get the large cookie! So free cookie, plus complimentary slice of bread.. with butter and yummy pumpkin bread, makes it a no brainer picking up breads here for us.
