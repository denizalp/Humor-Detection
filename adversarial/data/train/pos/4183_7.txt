Tuesday night is not the night to go to Gypsy Bar.\n\nFriday is better. Saturday better still.\n\nOn Tuesday nights you will likely be one of five people in the audience listening to an elderly, heavy-set woman belting out a Rihanna song accompanied by a Karaoke track. You won't see artists in the mini-stages set into the walls. Neither will you see go-go dancers. Those things are reserved for the weekends.\n\nIf you go on a Friday or Saturday you'll get City Scape's closest approximation of a \"scene\"--with drink prices to match. It's not really LA yet, but it's trying.
