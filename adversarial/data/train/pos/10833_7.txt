Not very impressed with this joint. This place reminds me of a club\/bar you would find in Uptown where being at the trendy place is more important than a well-made drink and good service. \n\nWe walked in on St. Patrick's day to find the place empty (it was during the day). We asked to see a cocktail list and were told there wasn't one. Funny because when I sat down at a table lo and behold there was a  cocktail menu sitting right there. Speaking of the table it was dirty ...along with the sticky menu and the messy floor. To be honest It felt like the closer from the night before never cleaned-up... the bar was unkempt, and downright dirty. Nothing about it made me feel like lounging that's for sure. \n\nWe ordered over-priced vodka sodas which I requested to be served with a twist-of lime. Our bartender told us they didn't have limes. The odd thing was I saw the same individual actually cutting limes less than 5 minutes later....was he that lazy or non-accommodating that he couldn't be bothered to grab a lime from the back and cut it up? Or did limes just magically happen to appear a mere five minutes after our drink was ordered?  He looked like he was completely jacked up on steroids (even had the lime green muscle-tee  to match) so maybe he was on the verge of roid-rage and cutting limes or grabbing a cocktail menu would have sent him over the edge. I suppose I should count myself lucky. \n\nOk, maybe that last part was uncalled for but I was really disappointed with Stashe House . I will say it was a beautiful day so I enjoyed the open seating.  We didn't stay to have another drink but I doubt the bartender cared very much as he didn't ask us how the drinks were or even bother to ask if we wanted another one...or do much of anything actually. I sincerely hope South End doesn't turn into the kind of place filled with bars like this...
