You thought Walmart lines were bad, this place takes the cake! I wish I ate before coming here now. The information desk people are so rude and short it makes you not want to stay! The amount of people waiting is worse than Black Friday and you don't even get anything in the end except for new plates! La da dee da! Just moved here so I couldn't do anything online, and had to come in person. At least next year I can renew online or through mail! Avoid this place on Mondays at all costs, wish I went tomorrow but wanted to get this visit over and done with already. At this rate I will be leaving here Thursday.
