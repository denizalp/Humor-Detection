Met new to Phoenix Yelper Lynn W for coffee today.  I suggested Acacia as a good halfway point between us, and was hoping it did not have the crowds of LGO.  It did not, at least not at 10:30 am.\n\nNot being a straight coffee drinker, I ordered a mocha.  Unfortunately, the espresso maker has been on the fritz for a week.  Hmmm now what.  Well it was a little windy, I'll call it blustery, this morning, so I did my best to convince myself winter is still with us and ordered a hot chocolate instead.  The staff had generously offered to steam the milk on the stovetop to accommodate me.  I also ordered a scone--a little more crumbly than I care for but still good.  I wish they had a few more pastry offerings, but they have the basics of danish, muffins, and scones.  \n\nAcacia has a great menu for breakfast and lunch.  Next time, I'll try a meal, and hopefully get that mocha I was looking forward to.
