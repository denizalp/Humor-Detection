Ah another yogurt place. Went here while visiting my mom and sister. Anyways, this is a really big shop with some really good flavors. The topping bar is huge. You can go on both sides of the toppings bar. The toppings are all the normal toppings that all the yogurts shops have. This place also has mochi and poppers for topping. Nice. \n\nThe place is very clean with about 7 tables inside and a few more outside. Two cashiers so no waiting in lines to pay. \n\nVery nice place to enjoy yogurt. See you again.
