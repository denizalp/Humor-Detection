Let Me start by saying I am a sushi virgin, and many will say I still am. This is the only place I have ever had sushi. I did have a seared Ahi tuna at Scoma's in San Fran does that count? Moving on...\nDoes it count if it's cooked?? I am told no. Anyway I loved 95% of what I ate here. Now we had a Philly roll, Spider roll, Tiger Eye roll, Texan (SPICY), and then eel and octopus. Everyone but me liked the eel and octopus. I couldn't get past the texture. But the other stuff was great with a little Wasabi yummy!\n\nThis is a little dive in a strip mall but it is clean and the staff is very friendly, funny and helpful. \n\nGuess it's good enough for a Sushi virgin. Hard core sushi lovers may want to smack me.
