PLEASE don't go to K2 Bistro! I've been to many AYCE sushi restaurants in Montreal, and K2 was my worst experience! Not only the food was bad, but the way I was treated by the restaurant was unethical and it is the reason why I decide to open a Yelp account and write my first review. Please continue reading my review to understand how ridiculous and unacceptable the situation was.\n\nMy husband and I went to try K2 sushi for supper. We were seated at a tiny table for 2 in the corner of the restaurant. We've placed our order and when most of the food arrived, the table started to lack of space. I kindly asked the waitress if it was possible to use the table beside us that was empty so we can have more spaces. You won't believe what answer I received. The waitress told us that if I want a table for 4, I will have to pay for 3 people! ... Sorry? Did I hear wrong?! There were two 4-ppl-tables taken by two couples, and the waitress said they were paying for 3 and if we don't believe we can go ask them! My husband was going to stand up and ask the other tables, but I didn't want to make things big and ruin our date night, so I stopped him. 1) if they really charged them for 3 ppl, this restaurant is illegal. 2) if they did not charge them for 3, this restaurant is lying. No matter what, this is so wrong! I kind of regret to not let them charge us for 3 people so i can file an official complaint to the Office de la protection du consommateur! \n\nAll this to say, don't go to K2 sushi because of their unethical way of doing business! If you really want sushi buffet, there are plenty of choices around that area: Sushi Crescent, Toro Sushi, Odaki, etc. Just stay away from K2!
