We used this office after a referral by my sister. They gave my sister a 250 dollar gift basket which was very nice. They were pretty good in taking the case. Then after we were going through treatment and finishing up we noticed a change but not bad. We had an offer we didn't agree with and was some what disappointed at that time. Then April came in and asked us what we were looking for and we discussed this matter and we were able to get reductions in medical department and we were very satisfied. April worked very hard and deserves a five star! Only reason not giving 5 star is my original case worker was let go and no communication was giving to us on loosing this person. I give many thanks to all involved!
