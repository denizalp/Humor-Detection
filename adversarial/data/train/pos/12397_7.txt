I've gotten a Louis Vuitton purse cake from Freed's. They do an amazing job customizing cakes but can be pricey. Looking back, I could have bought an actual purse instead of a cake.\n\nThey have lots of different cookies, pastries and cakes. Almond horns, chocolate chip cookies, rainbow cookies, raspberry walnut wafers, butter cookies, chocolate fudge thumbprints, chocolate chip log, linzer tarts, turnovers, cinnamon crisps, cupcakes, etc.\n\nTheir cookies are pretty good but not the rainbow cookies. I've had better at Bagel Cafe. The rainbow cookies here are flavorless and the chocolate is overpowering - they're not the traditional Italian flag colors either.\n\nThe cakes and cupcakes are delicious and aren't dry. So, definitely come here for cakes and not the rainbow cookies. Another good thing about Freed's is their involvement with the community. My most recent trip here was for a charity event for the fallen police officers' family. They were selling $1 cupcakes. It's not just a business.
