Interesting, it seems I can't turn the corner in Maple without having a Churrasqueira in my way.  The Churrasco population is definitely on the rise and it seems even some Downtown businesses want part of the Pie(or rather Quarter Chicken).  That's right, Costa Verde's second location is now in the middle of nowhere.  The same place where you'll find me hanging out, NOWHERE.\n\nThe Dining space deviates from the usual warm-traditional-portuguese-house setup into a high-end stylish Cafe which reminds me of Aroma Espresso Bar.  In comparison to various Churrasqueiras in the neighbourhood, there seems to be more choices available as Sides(Salads, Parisian Potatoes, Rices, and more) while some Mains(Meats) are sold by weight.\n\nI asked for my usual Lunch portion until I realized 1\/4 Chicken is not an option.  Minor setback will make me reconsider this as a Lunch-budget friendly destination.   Grilled Chicken or Rotisserie Chicken is the main attraction while the vast selection they offer as Sides help spice up the deal for more possible return trips.  Octopus Salad is the only side dish not optional for the Meal.  3.5'd\n\n1\/2 Grilled Chicken Meal($9.99)\n\nGrilled, chopped into 4 pieces, my Picante Chicken has the usual Portuguese sauce helps keep the Meat moist although it takes away from the crispness of the skin.  Surprising to find Beansprout in the Rice side along with shreds of Chicken and Bellpeppers\/Onions.\n\nAlthough we ate in-house, we were served in disposables.\nSimply means no tip required and more waste overflow in the tiny trashbin.
