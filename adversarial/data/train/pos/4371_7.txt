Okay I was driving along 12th street going speed limit and three cars passed me going 65 to 85 miles an hour and they went into the Hertz resale lot. I follow them in and after Manager why they were going so quick. I have daughters that go to Xavier right around the corner and I don't need a bunch of car lot people going 90 miles an hour down 12th street. I would never buy a car from these people just knowing how they treat their cars
