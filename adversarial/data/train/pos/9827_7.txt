Worst management company in Calgary.  They charged maintenance fee to condo owner without notice in advance.  Then they just sent you the bill and add to your account book as outstanding if you not agreed and then start charging you interest.  Common area is not managed well and very dirty.  Poor customer service.  Not recommend and stay away....
