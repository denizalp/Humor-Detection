I spent the better part of a day in Higher Ground and while I'm usually nervous to do this in coffee shops because I don't particularly like dirty looks from baristas I had a most enjoyable time here. Everyone was so friendly and no one minded that we stayed for coffee, then breakfast, then more coffee, then lunch, and ended our day with another coffee. In fact they even started a tab for us to do so!\n\nAs I mentioned I had both breakfast and lunch - a yogurt parfait and then a veggie wrap. Both were tasty as was the coffee so I can't imagine picking a better spot to get some studying or work done, or just to hang out and enjoy a cup of java.
