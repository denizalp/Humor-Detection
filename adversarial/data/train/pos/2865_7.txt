Hello ladies...hello gentlemen...hello lentlemen...\n\nI like to introduce you guys to the BEST VAPE STORE in VEGAS:\n\nYOSI VAPOR BOUTIQUE\n\n\nThis place is kick-ass! The staff...the vibe...the ambiance...all so spectacular. Trust me people... this place has the complete package. At my first visit, I was skeptical about the whole \"vape-fad,\" but since I had just LITERALLY saw the movie \"Yes Man,\" an inner YOLO-ness came upon me, so I gave it a go. In addition, I was recommended by many friends to come check out this specific establishment...& it just happened to be that I was in Vegas.\n\nUpon entering the store, I was greeted by the staff. I felt awkward cuz I had no knowledge about vaping. The guy who worked there (Howie) knew I was a first timer, so he dropped some knowledge on me about vaping. So heres the cool thing...he didnt make me feel embarrassed about it...to be honest...I felt comfortable while he informed me about vaping. This brings me to my most important point:\n\nCustomer service and staff is what makes a place stand out and what converts a customer to a LOYAL CUSTOMER. I will forever be with YOSI VAPOR BOUTIQUE.\n\nAnywho...If you're looking for a store that carries variety of choices, and top notch customer service then come to Yosi Vapor Boutique. \n\n& if your curious to what vaping is all about...come stop by and theyll be sure to tell you why this next big thing.\n\nP.S. They have a bar there where you can test their VAPE JUICE...gotta love the word \"free\"!\n\nVERY WELL RECOMMENDED!\n\nUNTIL THEN!! ^-^
