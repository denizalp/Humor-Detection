This should be one of the best steaks you will ever consume....it definitely was for me.  I've been here twice now, and each time, I had outstanding food.\n\nAtmosphere and setting is great...although the dress code is not enforced, it did not cheapen the night.   Service was excellent and above all, the food was amazing!  They also have a great wine and bottle selection, in all price ranges.\n\nThe comp bread selection :\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=2RVsI-brRnb7mLO2h5JFPA#Y31dBHh-ymp7NBmYSQbyDQ\n\nThe bread platter had a good variety! My favorite was probably the bacon bread...for good reason!\n\nThe dinner company wasn't craving red meat, so she went with the fish and chips.  It was unbelievably good....more like gourmet fish fillet with a slight breading and an  outstanding taste.  Yum\n\nI went with the ribeye...it was 24oz of 30 days dry aged beef.  :\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=2RVsI-brRnb7mLO2h5JFPA#2RVsI-brRnb7mLO2h5JFPA\n\nI could throw out a nice number of adjectives at you, and tell you cliche things, like how it melts in your mouth, but the truth tells itself :\n\nI ate the ENTIRE thing...AND almost every piece of fat that was on this thing.  The FAT was so tender on this ribeye, that it truly melted in your mouth, and gave the rest of the steak a super intense flavor when combined.  I seriously couldn't help myself...it was like a drug.  I was so stuffed, but I kept eating so that I could really savor each bite.  That \"close your eyes, that was the best piece of cow I have ever consumed\" feel.\n\nThe sides :\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=2RVsI-brRnb7mLO2h5JFPA#_JKeY5Vn87VtB_SOasPPCQ\n\nMac & Cheese : blue, cheddar, parmesan, and truffle. Fingerling Potatoes : parmesan and truffle. The mac and cheese here is great, but the fingerling potatoes blew my mind! There was so much truffle flavor hiding in between the potatoes....Probably the best way I've consumed potatoes and truffles to date LOL!\n\nFor dessert, I have no idea how I fit it in...but we went with the toffee pudding or whatever it was called...excellent.  Not sure why this was so good, but it was one of my favorite desserts I have had to date....it just works.\n\nI will be back!  Trying to space out eating entire days worth of calories and fat intake in one setting lol.
