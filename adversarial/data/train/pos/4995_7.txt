Hmmmm. 1 star for host, 5 stars for server, 3.5 for food. 4 for margaritas. I really don't enjoy giving less than 4 stars (rather not review) but this is in a casino and I expected more on the service side. \n\nHost\/hostess (actually the man might've been a manager?): we asked if it was open seating in the patio. \"Unfortunately not.\" Just super dry and very unwelcoming. The patio was halfway seated. I used to be a hostess, so they might've had resos coming in, which could've easily been explained. 45 min wait for the patio. No thanks, its moms' night out and we can't waste precious minutes!  Okay, let's try to find a seat at the bar (no luck). Fine, searing inside. The. Worst. Table. In. The. Entire. Place. And all just for us!!\n\nThe hostess led us there. I kind of looked at her like \"how the ?$&*#% am I supposed to get in that seat gracefully?\" She looked back at me smugly. It was a banquette, the end where it comes to an L. Well the table was all the way to the end, where there was no leg room to walk into the booth part. I literally had to crawl on my hands and knees on the booth seat to get in. I am not a big girl, folks. 5'5\" and a size 2. How embarrassing!  Luckily I was wearing a maxi dress and not a shorter skirt, so I didn't flash anyone. \n\nI was literally elbowing the table next to me. Plus, the ladies next to us were eavesdropping the whole time and even butted into our conversation a couple times (not terrible, it was to offer advice). Mind you, there were plenty of tables open inside the restaurant. She literally gave us the worst table possible. Of any restaurant I have ever been to, ever. \n\nThe server was great. Knowledgeable, courteous, efficient. I wish I could remember her name but I was busy steaming for a lot of the time about the hostess and seating situation. \n\nThe busser took away our side and it wasn't even halfway gone, and had been sitting on our table a total of 30 seconds. \n\nGuacamole was decent. Margaritas I loved (I got the regular one and added heat), taco was pretty good.  Flan, ehhhh but flan is never amazing unless I make it the filipino way, so I can't judge. \n\nI'm mad I didn't check yelp first because I'm in the industry and I could've gotten 50% off and it was Tuesday. My fault for not checking though I would've tipped 3x extra (already tipped over 25%) had the server mentioned it. \n\nAll in all, I might be back but would much rather enjoy Hearthstone next door for the 50th time!!
