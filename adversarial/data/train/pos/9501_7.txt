BOTTOM LINE: If it's the cost of menu (or the Visa Black Card that you'll need to whip out to pay for it - www.blackcard.com to see what I mean) that will impress your client \/ date, you've come to the right place; otherwise, the food will leave you wanting.\n\nI lunched here to celebrate my friend (finally) quitting his soul sucking corporate law job just minutes beforehand. His new-found freedom may have, quite possibly, been the freshest thing in the resto. :P\n\nWe started off with the duck confit poutine and their infamous shrimp tacos before moving on to their slow roasted beef brisket sandwich and the $35 burger. A couple of Guinnesses later, we were feeling pretty good! \n\nBroadly speaking, while nothing was poorly made, neither was it particularly memorable nor impressive. It lacked the \"wow\" factor that would tempt me to return. Sadly, I wouldn't consider their burger, while finely made, to be top 5 in the city.\n\nThe service was fair - I didn't get any of the snooty attitude that other Yelpers have noted, but I suppose it didn't hurt to be dining with a former corporate lawyer still in his 3-piece suit. If you ever find yourself becoming an ex-corporate lawyer, hit me up and lunch'll be on me, though I'll be taking you elsewhere.
