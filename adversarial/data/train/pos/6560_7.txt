After looking over several other reviews for this place, I am in agreeance  with what has been said before.  This is a beautiful piece of architecture, but direly underused.  It's got that vibe to pull you into it, but doesn't really have anything to keep you there.\n\nWhile staying at the Hyatt I had my fair chance to roam about the lower, non-hotel portion of this building.  As I did this on a daily basis I wondered if that might be a contributing factor as to why this bottom portion was so dead.  Is the fact that the upper portions contain hotel rooms the reason as to why there is a lack of businesses.  Do you think that noise could be a factor for the people staying upstairs?  Or is there something else to it?  \n\nFor this to be labelled a mall, it really is not.  There are very little storefronts in use in here, it is just weird.  The busiest place that I noted was the Post Office, so yeah.  \n\nIt is so odd, because this place has so much potential.  This seems to be a major thoroughfare for foot traffic.  Imagine if there were actual shops in here.  They would make a killing.
