True cocktail bar. We came after the Cirque du Soleil, walked to the corner and followed fellow Yelper instructions to look for the unmarked door across from the pizza place, and push the big doorbell button. Seconds later we were welcomed and brought down the storeroom stairs to the calm, dim, simple, quiet bar. The servers were so friendly and yet reserved and professional, and I loved what I ordered so much I can't wait to go back. I should have taken photos and written down the ingredients so I could remember it for life but I was on a wave of a day. Anyway, it's called the Bloody Manhattan. Go get it. It's perfect.
