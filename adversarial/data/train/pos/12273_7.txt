I'm that girl who's super, super uptight about following all the rules... \n\nI respect authority way more than I should, I don't speed, I'd rather be 30 minutes early than 2 minutes late, I don't text while driving and I don't ever try to bring cameras into a venue....UNLESS, the website says I can. \n\nNow ordinarily, even when the venue says I can, I typically don't, especially when I'm going to a venue in the city I live in, however, I flew out to Phoenix to see some friends and we were all going to the Black Keys concert, so I figured I'd check out the camera policy, because this was one of those times I really wanted to document the memory. The website said as long as there was not a removable lens, the camera would be permitted. Perfect! ...Or so I thought... \n\nWhen I got to the front of the security line, the lady told me no cameras. I explained the policy stated on the website. She said she couldn't make the call and I would have to hash it out with her supervisor. So I proceeded to plea with the big mean woman about what the website said and how my camera was within the limits they outlined. But she said no. Absolutely not. I argued a little with her, which is very unlike me, but ultimately I lost and I had to trek all the way back to the car, in a place I had never been to, to put the camera away. Fortunately my best friend joined me and we made it into a fun predicament. \n\nThe Black Keys were of course amazing and the venue played a big part in that. The open multilevel grass seating was a brilliant touch and I definitely loved that I could see one of my favorite bands under my favorite starry night sky, which is why I'm giving the place 3 stars. \n\nAs for the rest of it? I could do without.
