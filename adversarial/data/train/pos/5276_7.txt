I walked in here one quiet afternoon and walked out 15 minutes later without any goods. My fianc√© probably thinks I went to heroic measures to resist from buying anything, but in reality it was just because the service was bad and it was a little overwhelming.\n\nI'm the kind of person who adores good service and am willing to pay a bit more if the store's employees provide a great experience. \n\nI was searching for some facial oils and had never been to Ulta before. I looked around and found a few versions of what I thought I was looking for. I didn't know what I was doing though, so I wandered around hoping to catch somebody's attention. This was my \"M'aidez!\" call. It didn't work, and I left. \n\nThe store itself has a wide range of products, and if you actually don't need any help looking for a new product to use, you can probably find it here. The store is brightly lit and organized. Cheaper products on the left as you enter, and designer goods on the right.
