We went here for late dinner. So, this place was pretty empty. Other than our server not giving us personal space, the service was good. \n\nWe tried a few of our favorites. For the most part, we enjoyed dinner.\n\nMango Lassi:\nThe color was a bit off-putting. It was very orange. It didn't quite taste like what I've had at other Indian restaurants. This tasted artificial. 2\/5\n\nPapadum:\nPerfect cracker. But what makes this exceptionally good were the sauces: tamarind and mint. Their sauces are better than anyone else's. 5\/5\n\nGarlic Naan:\nThis is my favorite. I can eat this stuff by itself. Warm, soft, buttery and garlicky goodness. I'm making myself want garlic naan by what I just said. 5\/5\n\nPrawn Korma:\nThe sauce was a bit garlicky and creamy. It has some spicy kick to it. I wish this dish had more prawns since it is in fact PRAWN korma. 4\/5
