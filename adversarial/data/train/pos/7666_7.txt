Welcome to your Neighborhood Bulk Warehouse Store, where you can buy almost anything from business supplies, to grocery items, clothing, and household equipment. Not to mention a Pharmacy, Photo Shop, and a Auto Service Center as well. \n\nThe layout of this Sam's is\/are all the same. They all carry the same merchandise, some more than others. The only drawback to this one compared to the others? The lack of available cashiers. It seems like each time I go here, there are only 3 or for Cashiers working the registers, any time of day.\n\nThe workers at the food court need a crash course in Guest Interaction. She was not very friendly, and gave a lot of people before me attitude. I'm sorry if you were having a bad day Miss, but no one deserves that kind of Customer Service!\n\nOverall, I would have to say that when you shop here, The Service could be a Hit or Miss!
