If you've been to Edgewater Park and have never tried Honey Hut ice cream, then you best get yoself some! It's the perfect summer treat! My favorite flavors are the orange blossom and honey pecan. Orange blossom is lightly sweet and extremely refreshing, while honey pecan is really sweet but perfect in combination with the chunks of pecan!\n\nTwo scoops for $3? GET OUT OF TOWN! It's probably the cheapest and yummiest ice cream everrr! Honey Hut is also extremely generous. I kid you not, two scoops is equivalent to a pint of Jeni's Ice Cream (and for a fraction of the price, who can say no?) Seriously, make your taste buds' day and get some Honey Hut ice cream :) \n\nBtdubs, cash only for orders under $5, so put away them plastics and bring some dollah bills :)
