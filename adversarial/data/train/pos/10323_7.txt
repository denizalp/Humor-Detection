Never underestimate the power of social media because that's exactly what lured me here. And it's the amazing food that's going to keep me coming back!\n\nI love love love fried chicken. Seeing their take on chicken & waffles - buttermilk chicken strips and mashed potatoes stuffed in a waffle cone, I knew it was a must have!\n\nTheir na-cho-tots? Tater tots smothered in creamy queso, spicy sour cream, guac and jalape√±os? Sooooooo good!\n\nAnd you cannot go wrong with their mac & cheese. Bacon? Yes. Dorito crust? Did they make mac & cheese even BETTER by crumbling cheesy nacho chips on top? YOU KNOW IT!\n\nI seriously want to continue coming back till I've tried everything on their menu - it's that good!
