I was referred here by a friend and was so happy with all my visits and my Surgery.  Dr. Justo is so amazing. he takes the time to see you on every visit. \nI had my eye surgery done in the office, which has the full operation set up.  All the Nurses and staff were so nice. They told me after surgery I would only have pain for an hour. then nothing more.\nWell for as bad as my eyes looked , I could not believe I had no pain at all. The first hour, I put eye Ice pads on around my eyes, and then nothing else hurt after that.\nI went back several times for follow up visits, Everything went perfect and I healed very well.\nI have referred a few friends here and they all loved it! They too had really great results.   I would go back any time if I needed more eye surgery done.\nIt is a very long drive for me, but well worth it.\nThe office is clean and modern. Now if only I could find a dentist as awesome as\n Dr. Justo!
