I don't think I've ever experienced any record store employees more ambivalent about their jobs, ever.  I don't know if it's all the Joy Division the kids like or what, but man, I remember walking in here & talking to the employee and just feeling like nobody gave a fuss about anything, including records they allegedly liked.  It had this sad vibe like being in a high-school girls bedroom after they got dumped right before prom.\n\nAs far as selection, here's a rating system that's applicable: If I was left alone in this store?  Free of accountability?  I wouldn't steal a goddamn thing.  There wasn't one record in this store that I either didn't already have forever or was an absolute stale piece of mediocrity.
