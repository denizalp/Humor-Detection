I will say, 10\/10 for scenery, location, and a beautiful logo. You cannot beat the view of A-mountain right across from ASU Stadium. \nBut I am absolutely AMAZED by how they can take something so mouthwatering and appetizing as a \"Mac and cheese bacon burger\" and make it absolutely flavorless. The menu promised signature Mac n cheese and \"bacon and more bacon.\" The actual burger had one sad slice of bacon cut in half, a slice of cheddar cheese, two small scoops of Mac n cheese and the only thing I tasted with every bite was the two 1\/4 pound patties of poor quality un-seasoned beef that was reminiscent of little league snack bar burgers cooked by a disgruntled father pissed that his son didn't get enough playing time. \nA burger so terrible that I looked at every new guest with pity and eyes willing them to turn around and just endure the wait to eat somewhere else. A burger so awful it must be the advent of a business major who thought he could skirt around the low margins of the restaurant business by buying frozen fries and Safeway's buy one get one free ground beef deals. \nI can say without a doubt this is easily this worst burger I have ever had in my 27-years. I do not normally right yelp reviews but please for the love of well spent calories save yourself $9 and go to in n out. \nChuckbox is still the unrivaled king of delicious campus burgers. \nGood cold beer though!
