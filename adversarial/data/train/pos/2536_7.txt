A little batch of heaven right here on Willy Street\n\nOver the years, I've never really had a go to bakery in Madison.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the doughnuts from Greenbush, the morning buns from Manna (and before that from Oven of Brittany) and cupcakes from Bloom.  But I never had a place to go to get a wide variety of consistently delicious sweet and savory baked goods until Batch Bakehouse swept me off my feet.\n\nThings I love:\n * the vanilla swirl croissant a.k.a. the pastry orgasm.  One bite into the flaky exterior and your eyes will roll back into your head and the satisfied moans of contentment commence.\n * the salted caramel brownie (see vanilla swirl description)\n * the passion of the staff members:  I'm always warmly greeted when I walk into the store.  At the old location, they always gave my daughter a free pasty if we showed up around closing time.  Several of my favorite baking classes at Orange Tree Imports were taught by Batch employees.  (If you want to seriously improve your game as a bread baker, sign up for these classes ASAP, don't delay!)  These folks love what they do and it shines through with every item you see in the display.\n * the freakishly incredible variety of pastries.  Check out the website for a list of what they sell.  Just have a napkin ready to sop up the inevitable drooling that will commence once you start reading that list.\n\nThings I don't:\n * \n\n\nOK, the only thing I can come up with is that I would become more ginormous than Jabba the Hutt if I ate everything that looked good every time I shopped at Batch.  I probably do work out a little harder on days I go to Batch just so I can add an extra item to my shopping list.\n\nGiving Batch Bakehouse a five star rating was an absolute no brainer.
