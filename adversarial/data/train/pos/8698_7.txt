this place is exactly like Akita in Scottsdale, same menu same choices. Would recommend going for lunch at $13.50 per person. If you're a sashimi savage like me, dinner would be most worth it since they use better quality fish for their sashimi vs nigiri(lunch). The appetizers like shrimp tempura, crab wontons, gyoza are good since they're made to order, correction - fried to order. Their rolls are decent too, menu had plenty of basic and custom house rolls. Big plus was the included desserts of course. You're better off eating here than the revolving sushi places since you'll get fresh plates every time :) long story short, good lunch spot!
