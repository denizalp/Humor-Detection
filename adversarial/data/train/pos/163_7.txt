Came in late nite & we were pleased with the selection of bottled sodas. We shared an ice cream sandwich ($4.95.) I chose strawberry ice cream and red velvet cookies. I should have asked for two different cookies because red velvet had very little flavor. Texture of the cookies were crunchy rather than chewy. Probably wouldn't order that again, although I would come back to try deserts on their sit-down menu, as well as those goblets smokin' with dry ice.\n\nBefore our flight, I stopped in for some candy (a girl can't resist) & ended up with my usual: white chocolate covered gummy bears. An employee kept pushing a tiny mental container on me for $15, saying I'd be paying more by using a bag. The candy is roughly $16\/pound. Bitch, do I look stupid? A pound of candy ain't fittin' in that tiny container you're trying to hawk. I ended up spending $8 for my candy & I know even that smallish portion wouldn't have fit in that $15 container. Buyer beware.
