Good times with friends here on Friday night. I enjoyed the live music, and the dark pub-like atmosphere. The patio was large but broiling hot (get some misters guys). The bar itself is really nice and they have a huge selection of booze. Skilled bartenders and friendly service made for a terrible hangover.
