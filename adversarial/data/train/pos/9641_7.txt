I've been seeing Dr. Tafreshi for about 6 years now, literally choosing him because Fresh was in the middle of his name. (Yes, I'm that ridiculous!) \n\nDr. Tafreshi's office isn't the prettiest or the newest or the nicest, but it has this warm feel to it. His entire staff from Jennifer to Maria to Suehey have always been kind, compassionate, friendly, and funny. \n\nSince Dr. Fresh is an internal medicine doctor, I can get my labs, ultrasound, x-ray, and some other services done all in one place and under one co-pay! \n\nIf you're looking for an amazing doctor and professional staff that truly cares, you're in good hands at Meadows Medical with Dr. Tafreshi!
