I am a newer agent, I joined the program about six months after being licensed and about two months into going full time. I hadn't made a dime and was so lost on what to do and how to do it. Like real estate, T&J's methods are all about getting out what you put in. More than the resources on their site and the daily calls and podcasts, joining their program you become part of a familial network of like minded (and not so like minded - in a good way) agents who are there to support each other, not tear each other down.\n\nThese are accountability partners, not a quick fix solution. They are in it with you for the long game, helping you look not just into the moment, but the long term macro scope of real estate and wealth management. \n\nLess than four months into the program, I have easily earned the cost of my program and I know I'm on my way to bigger and better things. While I belong to a great, supportive brokerage with many resources, Tim & Julie Harris Real Estate Coaching has still been the best thing I've done for my career.
