I can't remember if I've been inside or not... I pretty much just order delivery. The food at this place is soooo fucking good. I think if I actually went there, it might spoil the magic a little bit. I prefer to imagine it as some really clean and yet authentic italian bistro. \n\nPizza is excellent, hot subs are amazing, pasta dishes are to die for, and salads are perfect. The prices are great too. If they will deliver to you, you might as well call Jerry Springer and schedule a time a few years from now when he can film you being forklifted from your house.\n\nEdit 4\/21\/08 - I finally visited the location... it's in that gungy strip mall on 40th and Indian School. I had imagined it being a gorgeous italian cafe in the middle of a lush green field with butterflies floating around and a bunch of stereotype chubby italian chefs with large moustaches bustling around tossing pizza dough in the air. \n\nThe truth is, it's just a tiny spot in an old strip alongside a crappy gym and a grocery store. They have nice little cafe tables and chairs outside on the sidewalk and a few tables inside, so it would be great for lunch - however, I wouldn't suggest it for a romantic dinner. I'm sticking with delivery or pickup. \n\nStill 5 stars, still love it.\n\nHere's a tip: If you wrap the leftover pizza in foil and fridge it, when you want to eat it again - it's great cold, but if you start up the oven to pre-heat at about 350, you can stick the pizza on the foil in the oven and it'll be ready by the time it's done pre-heating... that should be in just a few minutes. It'll taste like they just delivered it.
