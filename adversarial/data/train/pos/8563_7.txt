If I am being honest, how does one leave an unbiased review about a place that is more than willing taking the money you throw at it and give me a small fraction of it back? Do you leave a good review only if you win big? Is it about the ambiance or the staff? Is it all of the above? I think I will go ahead and say it is something cumulative and leave my review based on that.\n\nFleeced I tell ya. Fleeced. I feel like a friggin sheep! I have been to this casino many times over the past few years, and I have yet to win anything sizeable. I have been to the other JACK location and have won nice sums....but this place steals my money like a Russian whore. Why do I keep coming back you may ask? Good question. Yet, I do not have the answer. Hopeful? Stupid? Yes.\n\nThe casino itself is very pretty and set in an iconic building in Tower City. Lots of tables and a good amount of slots. The staff here is MEH....nothing to write home to mom about. Not that I would want to tell mom I was gambling my inheritance away anyways. Parking here is horrible. HORRIBLE! Nothing is free and you have to spend the equivalent of $150 to get free parking. I SAY NAY NAY!\n\nI probably will still idiotically come back here every once in a while. But, that is the story of my life!
