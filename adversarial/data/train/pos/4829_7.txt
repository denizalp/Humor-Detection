Ugh. There are some places that you really want to love. Winery. yes. In Pittsburgh? Alright, lets give it a go! \n\nSo lets start on the positive. The estate is beautiful with a landscaped outdoor seating as well as an amphitheater. The idea is awesome ( we will talk about the execution later). Ooo and ummm...the wine is cheap. \n\nAlright so we tried and purchased a couple \"dry-ish\" wines while we were waiting for our table. We found a nice picnic table and posted up with wine in tow.  We were told that we were one a 30 min wait but an hour later (another 3 bottle of wines) finally we were seated. No worries. We were all hungry but the booze was holding us over. \n\nOnce we get to our table it is obvious the place is extremely understaffed. We order more wine and some apps then don't see our servers for another 30 min. The menu isn't anything incredible but if it was executed well it would hit the spot.  We finally placed our entrees orders while still waiting for the apps. Then another 20 min later the server says they are out of the lasagna which 3 people order. Now its laughable how bad this is. We were all pretty buzzed at this point and not assholes so we were just rolling with the punches. \n\nMore wine. More Wine. Entrees comes and they are lackluster to say the least. My friends chicken is undercooked. Everything is just bland. More wine. More wine. \n\nManager comes out to apologize and take half off our apps....ehh alright. \n\n\nI think the kitchen is new at this place so I am going to credit it to that because I really want to like this place!! \n\n\nPros: Scenic setting, cheap wine, wine tasting, I think they have live music on the stage\n\nCons: Slow service, bland food, undercooked food, pricey food for what you get, wine was still sweet for my taste buds ( I mean I still drank a couple bottles of it) \n\nOverall: Maybe come back after dinner for some music and wine.
