Service  - 10\nFood - 10\nValue - 10\nAtmosphere - 10\nMusic  - 10\n\nThis is a must try restaurant!!! I tried the chef's choice menu and it was incredible!!! It's worth getting the add on for the oysters...\n\nEVERYTHING that came out was Magical... I can't say that one thing was better than the next. When the bread and butter came out, I thought I'll give it a try... when I smeared the butter on the bread and took my first bite, I actually thought I saw God smiling at me. The music was more meaningful and life made sense while enjoying this simple sample. \n\nI'm from Dallas, Texas and we know Fried Chicken... well... I thought we did, until I went to Montreal, Canada... who knew that the best fried chicken is in Canada that's populated by the French and is in Le Bremner... I feel that I was robbed... Kudos to to the chef, but Kudos to God for putting the chef in this world and that our paths crossed. When I took my first bite, I thought I was being \"Punk'ed\" by the French, because they knew I was from the south. If I could merry the fried chicken, I would... my wife knows this to be true and would help me filing the paperwork. \n\nThe steak cooked with Rosemary was life changing... again, I'm from Texas and who knew that the BEST steak was in Canada... Vegas wouldn't take those odds. I took my first bite of steak and I knew I would have to give up my US passport and smuggle my fat butt here to eat more steak. I honestly saw Angels and Rainbows when I took a new bite. I would fight someone if they took my steak away....\n\nFor the finally aka dessert, the chef made the Worlds BEST pancakes I've ever had with Amazing Maple syrup... if the pancakes with syrup were paired with the fried chicken it would be a \"10\"... that's when the heavens open up and all the unicorns and all the rainbows have crazy Love to make babies of chicken and pancakes!!! Boom, drop the Mic... That just happened!!!\n\nDear Diary... \"Jackpot\"...
