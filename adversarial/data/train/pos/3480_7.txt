No. My friend had a free room here, so we booked it just to have somewhere to shower after leaving a day club and before heading home. The elevators were really sketchy. The parking garage was dark, dirty and sketchy. Our room smelled like rotten eggs. I think the source was our clogged sink which filled up with black water. I didn't even want to shower for fear that it was the water, not the sink that was producing the black mystery substance. Everything in the room is just outdated. Carpets in the hallway are dirty. You can't tell how long anything has been there or how clean it is. Looking at the photos people have posted here freaks me out even more. Everything just sort of gave me the heebie jeebies. Maybe it is a fine place to gamble, but I wouldn't pay to book a room here. They should just tear it down and start over.
