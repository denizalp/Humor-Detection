FINALLY!!!!!!! I have found the best Mexican in town people!!! So amazing! First of all it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas which is pretty cool but it's so pretty inside!! Love the decor .. the margaritas OMG so fresh and good ingredients you can taste the quality ! The chips and salsa is so good couldn't stop eating! We also got the cheese dip and the guacamole and the bacon wrapped jalape√±os!! All tasty! For dinner we got the big meat platter and chicken enchiladas! So much food!!!!!! The corn and the beans and the taco sauces were to die for and they make fresh handmade tortillas ... heaven!! We also got the flan and the banana bread pudding !! EVERYTHING was delicious... will be returning again and again!
