Finally, I catch this place while it's still open! Admit it, fellow Yelpers, you, too have arrived here too late at some point.\n\nIt was definitely worth going out of my way. The place was even tinier than it looked from the outside. I had my choice between cramped seating in a tiny room, and the patio with a sun that is way too hot for November.\n\nAt the risk of encountering the usual CenPho crackheads wandering the area (and I did, mind you), I waited outside for my glorious kickass burger. Hatch chilies, chiptole may, jalapenos, guacamole, and bacon. Tasty! I thought hatch chilies were supposed to be hot, but they were a welcome addition regardless of heat. The bacon is questionable. I don't know if crushing the bacon into what is almost a paste is preferable to just frying the strips. \n\nAlso, the bun was pretty damned soggy. Not upset about it, as most buns can't hold the amount of awesomeness in this sandwich. Maybe...toast them? Get something better? Maybe I'm being picky.\n\nSome people complain about it being cash only, but you don't walk into a psychedelic-themed establishment without carrying some form of green. n00bs. \n\nRegardless of minor flaws, I am amazed by the price. $5-$7 for a burger combo of higher quality than any fast food place? Let's replace every McDonald's with one of these.
