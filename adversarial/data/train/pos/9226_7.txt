What can I say? This was your average Las Vegas hotel!\n\nNothing remarkable stood out, and nothing negative!\n\nThe pros would be the automatic check in at the kiosk, we did get our room earlier (arrived at 9am) and it was a $30 charge! Not bad!\n\nWent to the pool and BOY is is small- the cool thing was it wasn't super crowded, so it wasn't your crazy out of control loud atmosphere. It was easy to grab seats because by then it was around 10:30am, and the lady around the pool was always checking on us for service! \n\nThe room IS small, and there really isn't a dresser. No scratch that, there WASNT a dresser. There is a small closet with hangers and shelves, a mini fridge (it stopped working wtf), and a reasonably sized bathroom. There is ONE tiny window which was kind of testing my small VERY SMALL case of claustrophobia. \n\nWould I return? Maybe! The rates can be SO CHEAP so I've seen online, like $70 a night rates, but when you add their resort fee, it adds up. I went on a weekend so it was one of the cheaper rates from the strip. I think there are better options, but if you end up here, I think you'll still be happy. \n\nThere are TONS of restaurants and coffee\/dessert places right out your door. The casino wasn't packed which I appreciated. \n\nOverall, WHY NOT! It's Vegas, and if you're the type that just wants a bed to sleep on, you won't be disappointed here!
