sit down and eat AND try everything! - that's the best advice i can give you.\nsit down and eat because, if you take your food home (such as the birria), the juices will leak in the bag and you won't be able to sop all of it up with the tortillas they give you. try everything because you can and you will be a better person having done so. i tried the buche, not knowing it was cow esophagus. it was DELICIOUS and i have bought some since. my young daughters LOVE the ribs and the ceviche is the best. sometimes, i ask the tortilla makers to bag me up a bunch right off of the line, squeeze some lime on them and eat them right out of the bag. that \"chocolate\" drink (i forgot the name) that is sold by all the other fresh drinks is soooooooooo good and HOT, so don't drink it straight away. chandler is really looking up these days - i can get true birria here, get a jamaican meat patty from down the street, cuban moros and christianos across THAT street, and a really, really great hot dog with chili and asiago from the hugest pittsburgh fan in an antique shop a walk away from there. YAY!
