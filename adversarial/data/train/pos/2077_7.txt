A pleasant atmosphere and large food portions, but I can't help but wonder if they've ever even been to Ireland.\nTheir \"Kerryman's Shepherd's Pie\" is made with ground beef, not lamb which is a typical of Canadian pubs. The real crime is their \"Traditional Irish Stew\" is also made with beef; my Irish relatives would have a heart attack over that one!\n If you're going to claim to be traditional, at least make an effort.
