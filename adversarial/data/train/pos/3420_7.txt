I like to come here for drinks every so often. It is never really too busy, and I see what people say about the slow service. Most tables don't see well taken care of that I have observed; I also choose to sit at the bar, so have not experienced the table service myself. The food is not something that brings me in. I have tried different things, and I would only recommend the chicken enchilada soup. Grilled cheese, egg sandwich, reuben, tots...no good. I have had 3 bloody marys there (made by different people) so far and only liked one. They are $4 on Sundays, aren't \"loaded\" at all though
