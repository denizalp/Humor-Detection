Okay, this place was so condescending and rude. They offer no help or time to order. Like you have to know what you're getting when you walk in. Second, their drinks were okay..... it was kinda bland and just bad.... \n\nIn addition my poor friend who was dying of bladder problems has a scarred bladder now cause they got no bathroom????! Like come on.... what a funky coffee shop... If I wanted kidney stones, this is the coffee shop to go too.
