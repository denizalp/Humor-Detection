Went for a business lunch here last week. Very cool location kind of tucked away from downtown.\n\nNot greasy at all, no heavy feeling after eating here. I like that. Too often in Toronto, our Asian and Asian-inspired cuisine is just oily and gross. This is one of those rare diamonds in the rough where you can experience accessible but authentic cuisine without breaking the bank.\n\nOur table of three ordered the following (with descriptions from the menu):\n\n1. Sasi's #54 Red Chicken Curry with Lychee - artfully served in a fresh carved pineapple - The best curry dish! A highly seductive blend of spice & flavours with fresh pineapple, imbued w\/kaffir lime leaf. The result is so harmonious, perfect in everyway. Chef Sasi received worldwide attribution from bon vivants & food writers ever since she created this dish in 1997... Find out why every referred customer asks for \"the #54 dish\".\n\n2. House Pad Thai - Sweet red saucy version Pad Thai that half of Toronto's foodies love (the chicken version).\n\n3. ME! I ordered V1 - Vegetarian Delight - Asian field greens, soy, garlic, onion, tofu.\n\nThe dishes were $18.50, $11 and $11, respectively. Amazing prices for the portions AND the quality!\n\nAll three presentations were gorgeous. Service was amazingly fast and attentive - you can tell they are used to the tight business lunch timeline. It was easy to talk shop across the table - didn't have to strain our voices at all. It seemed like most of the other diners were there with similar company.\n\nChef Sasi won Harbourfront Centre's Iron Chef competition this past summer. I work there, so I saw her passion first-hand. It was awe-inspiring.
