I have been back to Postino several times since my last review and I am so pleased with their improvements in service!!! Each time I have been back since my last review, I have had excellent service. My water has been refilled before emptying. My server has made certain we had everything we needed often throughout our dining experience. Every server who walks by is attentive to our needs. I am very impressed with the leadership of their manager in addressing and improving my prior concern with dining here. \n\nThis is one of my favorite spots for happy hour and I'm always bringing friends from out of town here. Hands down best bruschetta in town. So happy to show off such a fun environment with delicious food and great service!!
