Wish I could review the food here, but when we arrived we were told that there would be an extra charge for the holiday (Father's Day). I totally understand that for the staff it can be incredibly crummy to have to work the holidays, and I would absolutely understand and have no problem if the restaurant was closed for the day, but if you are going to stay open then I think it's  unreasonable to charge extra --- to the tune of almost half of the price of the entire meal itself.\n\nTheir prices are listed on their website but this \"holiday pricing\" wasn't mentioned anywhere, and if it had been we wouldn't have bothered. Honestly it's only a couple of bucks, but it really just rubs me the wrong way.
