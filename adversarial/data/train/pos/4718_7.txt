3.5 stars. Guest list, but still had to wait about 30-40 minutes before getting in.\n\nAtmosphere: HUGE, but also crowded AF. My favorite area would have to be the rooftop bar because there are super nice views of the strip and you can breath a little out there. The inside is AMAZING though. Huge, lots of screen\/light displays, trapeze artists, and a wtf chandelier that looks like it's about to eat everyone on the dance floor.\n\nMy only gripe is that the club is almost strictly EDM. I am a sucker for Hip Hop & R&B music\/clubs, and this was not delivered here as much as I would have liked.\n\nProbably one of the most popular clubs in Vegas as of late. I would go again because it's so pretty. Also, ladies, buy emergency flats outside of the club, they're nearly $20 here (I know I know, I'm old, can't hang, don't judge me).
