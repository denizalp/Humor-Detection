Very disappointed in my food. Fake Chinese food if you ask me. I ordered the house special chicken with mushrooms. Hardly had any sauce. Tastes just like fried chicken. The best part? The mushrooms was canned and just dumped on the chicken. I expected fresh mushrooms. Kung pao chicken had no spice. Bland and no flavor. The veggies was good and that's about it. I won't be back. I'm sure I can find better tasting Chinese food.
