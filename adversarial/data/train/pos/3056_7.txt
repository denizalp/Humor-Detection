Delicious!  I was a little sad that it wasn't busier -- usually an empty restaurant is not good -- but we had a great experience!  Jonah, our bartender, was wonderful. He was personable (and cute!) and gave us great suggestions.  The miso glazed black cod was out of this world -- possibly the best piece of fish I've ever had!  Definitely worth it!
