Big Al's is probably one of the best places to buy your aquarium fish in all of calgary.\n Their prices are reasonable, and all the fish are healthy. Their reptiles are also very well cared for and are being fed the proper food (unlike some of the other pet stores I've been to that clearly don't do their research).\n The only issue with this store is that the last 2 times I've been into the store, I've stood around at the counter waiting for the one girl to stop flirting with one of the guys and assist me in catching my fish.\n I stood there for 20 minutes watching her flirt with a young man that was dealing with the reptiles, and then the next time she was hiding out in the back room and there was no one to be seen...\n Unfortunately that doesn't really make me feel like going back, just because I seriously don't have the time to stand around and wait.
