Would have given this plastic fabricator five stars because they do great work however, the owner's egregious bedside manner is enough for me to look for services elsewhere!  In this hard economy customer service is paramont and to plop down 400. for a plastic box only to be made to feel completely unappreciated for your patronage is bad business.  The owner actually sighed when he was made to look for my order, I watched him belittle one of his employees for not stating their questions in a clear word for word manner and then he proceeded to do the same to me!  He is difficult for the sake of being difficult and God bless his wife who is always trying to balance his abbrasiveness with her patient and humble demeanor.  Yes, this is not the first time I have encountered Mr. Stone!  Do your comapany a favor and stay in the back of the house.
