I used to like this place... \nWent in for a quick lunch around 1:00pm. We sat in the bar (I like to avoid screaming children). \nOur server was friendly and he is the only reason this place is getting two stars. \nThe bread arrived screaming hot and lovely. \nI ordered the warm spinach salad which was supposed to be spinach, roasted garlic, prosciutto, lemon, olive oil and topped with toasted goat cheese. (sounds good right?) \nMy friend ordered the half sandwich and salad combo. \nIt took OVER 35 minutes for our salads to arrive! Really?? \nWhen I saw mine I actually laughed. It was a pile of spinach with a cold, greasy half breaded medallion of goat cheese with one clove of garlic and a small mushy ball of prosciutto. It tasted like dishwater. \nThe server never checked on us and I had to go find him. He took the salad and offered me something else. \nI got the Mozzarella Alla Caprese. Cant screw that up right... \nThe tomatoes were so hard and pink they were borderline inedible. They were topped with one basil leaf and half of a mini mozzarella ball. It sucked. \nI'm done with this place. If you go, have the bread and leave!
