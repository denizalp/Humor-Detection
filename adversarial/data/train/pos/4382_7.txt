We came here because I have an AMC gift card leftover from Christmas in NY. We will never venture here again for a movie! It smelled like urine and mold. The only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because the staff was very helpful and sweet. \nThey need to do some serious remodeling. And invest in febreze. Gross.
