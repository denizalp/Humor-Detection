The worst place i have ever gone. Zero service. Always with an empty drink. Apathetic and complacent servers who stare at you down their prissy little hipster noses. What a bunch of hacks. You make tips by serving. Not by having your customers hunt you down for drinks. I even hunted them down for the bill! I could have walked out unnoticed!!!! Must be nice to be so fuckin' bored and annoyed all the time. Zero tip for you hipster
