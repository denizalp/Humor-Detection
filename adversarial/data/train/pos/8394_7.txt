Found this joint through Yelp! it was less than a mile away from our old house unbeknownst to us, so we had been traveling further for inferior pies, and stopped that after one visit here. Now, that we are in a different hood, we travel to them! \n\nThe Tuesday $5.99 Cheese Pie special is one of our favorite deals; truly a delicious steal! We also very much enjoy the aptly named Big Ass slice, and Big Ass calzone, one of each shared is more than enough to sate both of us, with leftovers to savor a couple of times over. The House and Greek salads are both good, inexpensive, and big enough to share. \n\nThe staff couldn't be friendlier or more accommodating, I like that you can watch your pies being made and fired through the window overlooking the ovens. Once we witnessed a customer a little late picking up her pizza, and the cook asked if she wouldn't mind waiting for another to be fired because it was no longer up to THEIR standards after sitting too long. Color me impressed! \n\nWe puffy heart you, Pizza on 87! \n\n* the $5.99 cheese pie on Tuesday is the Bees Knees; Scott routinely smashes two slices in the car carrying it home *\n\n** clean, cute space, small patio, made to order food in \"pizza window\" **\n\n*** the Big Ass Pie is a monstrous 28\" if you have a small army to feed ***\n\n**** they serve beer, deliver, and have specials daily ****
