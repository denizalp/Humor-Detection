Family-owned, operated, crafted. Just the kind of place I like to learn about. Though I'm not much of a chocoholic, I love the art of chocolate and checking out small shops like SC. The aroma alone that you're pummeled with upon entering is enough to make your sweet tooth swoon. \n\nAfter months of dillydallying and unfortunately only being in the area on Mondays (when they are closed) we finally got a chance to check out the assortment of chocolates and other products. Had a great time chatting with the owners and hearing a little about their story. \n\nWe ended up grabbing 6 different truffles -- White Chocolate Pumpkin, Serrano Pepper and Chocolate, Cardamom, Milk Chocolate, and I can't remember the other 2. All were absolutely fantastic. True to their respective flavors without being overpowering, understated, or boring. The most interesting by and large was the cardamom. \n\nThe kicker? Drinking chocolate. Think hot chocolate, but 10x as rich, and not with an overly present dairy flavor. It was so decadent and pleasing to sip on. It was in a tiny cup, but man a little bit goes a long way. I'd highly recommend to anyone, especially if you've never tried anything like it before. \n\nThey also sell a bunch of other bar chocolates, cakes, and....cakes in jars. I'd never heard of anything like this before, but I'm so intrigued. Can't wait to check one out for the sheer fact that it's a freaking cake in a jar!\n\nThank, Secret Chocolatier, for being so amazing! Will be back very, very soon.
