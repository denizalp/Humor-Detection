\"WHAT THE HECK IS A CONTAINER PARK?\"\n\nThat was my first question when my friend asked me if I wanted to go check out the Container Park while having dinner at Pizza Rock. So off we went along with my wifey and kids.\n\nWow. This place was a whole park made out of ACTUAL containers. I mean, who does that? Anyways, before we even stepped foot in it, you see a giant preying mantis out front with flames shooting out of its antennae. Again, I ask. Who does that? I gotta say, just that alone is a pretty good first impression. The other thing I liked was that you have a couple of security guys watching over the entrance, which is the only way in, and the only way out.\n\nAs you come in, you will see various stores\/restaurants from a beef jerky place, to a barbeque place. There is even a decent sized stage towards the end of the park. What I think the main attraction of this place is the big treehouse that is smack dab in the middle of the whole place which features a 33 foot tall slide.\n\nBottom line is that my kids loved hanging out here and this place is a refreshing sight to see compared to all the casinos going up all over the place and the Fremont Street Experience is no different.\n\nSome random info: There is free wifi and the bandwidth is very good I might add. 21 and over only after 9 pm.\n\nRetail Open       \n Sunday-Thursday\n 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n Friday-Saturday\n 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nFood & Beverage Open\n Sunday-Thursday\n 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.\n Friday-Saturday\n 11 a.m. to 1 a.m.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #22
