Decided to try this place after the good reviews and was not disappointed!\n\nFirst of all the service was excellent! I went with my friend around noon and we were greeted and seated the moment we walked in. The servers were friendly and the food came super fast! Halfway through our meal, a server came up to us and asked us if we would want some water, very attentive! We wanted to share our food and were about to ask for an extra set of utensils but the server beat us to it! \n\nThe food was pretty good quality wise. We ordered the famous milk tea creamy frappe (C1) and it was actually so good!!! It was unique and had a really nice flavor, a must try!!\n\nWe also ordered the grass jelly with q balls, tapioca, and sweet potatoes (G4), a nice refreshing treat for a hot day! \n\nThe popcorn chicken was delicious! Very crispy with a well seasoned flavour. The Taiwanese sausages were probably the least tasty out of the bunch. It didn't taste bad but it wasn't anything special. I noticed that it was a bit dry probably because they didn't use much oil to cook it. \n\nOverall, I really love the whole atmosphere in the restaurant, clean and modern. Service wise compared to Cha Me Cha next door, is like heaven and hell. Cha Me Cha has servers that just aren't as friendly and nice compared to ZenQ. I also love how I can sit down and chat with my friends for hours without feeling rushed to leave!\n\nSo when you're debating on eating at Cha Me Cha or ZenQ, choose ZenQ!
