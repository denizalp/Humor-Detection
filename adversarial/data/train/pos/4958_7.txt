I've seen a few shows here - ballet, opera and a musical.  It's conveniently located and very easy to find.  Although the exterior of the building is not very interesting in shape or design, the glass is beautiful and allows you to see the interior clearly.  On the inside, the design of the staircases is quite unique.  The wood, the glass, the light shining in.  It's quite an impressive space.   \n\nThe service is fantastic.  From the doormen, the coat check staff, the concessions staff, the ushers and even the staff at the gift store.  Washrooms are clean, but get very busy during intermission.\n\nI have been lucky enough to only get seats in the orchestra.  While it appears the ring sections provide a great view of the stage, I can't say I've ever sat in those seats.  And ring 5 seems waaaaay up there.\n\nI've been up to the top level hoping to get a good view of the city. But it's truly not that high and there isn't much to see in that location.  I did appreciate that they have set up concession stands on each level.\n\nTips: \n-If you know anyone under the age of 30 there are special promotions (use code: IAMUNDER30).  It's even better if you can get the 'under 30' tickets when they let  you choose any seat in the house (i.e. orchestra seats!)  \n-They offer rush tickets to most of their shows.  \n-If you're around during the day, they occasionally have free shows in the lobby\/staircase area.  A great lunchtime activity if you enjoy the arts.
