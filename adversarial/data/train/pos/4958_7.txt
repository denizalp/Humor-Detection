The Better Half and I enjoy coming to Savers once a week to drop off our donation bag and check out the goods.  We find some good stuff on occasion.  I'd rate this place 4 Stars, but my Wife's purse has been stolen here and they were unable to help catch the thief even though they supposedly have cameras.\n\nReturn Factor - 40%
