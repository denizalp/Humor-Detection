Are you looking for a hotel with mildew all over your shower? \n\nHow about the overpowering stench of air freshener used to cover up stale cigarette smoke (in what was supposed to be a non-smoking room)? \n\nDo you love torn bed sheets and dirty glasses? \n\nWell then my friends, the Planet Hollywood Hotel is for YOU! \n\n\nIf the above sound appealing to you, you will likely also enjoy the following:\n-Lamps that don't work\n-Dingy, dark rooms\n-Torn towels at the pool (some might consider the towels shredded) \n-Questionable smudges all over the mirrors\n-Bed linens that should be white but can only be considered off-white\n-Missing pillows\n-Bathmats that are taken and not replaced\n-Leaky faucets with water stains all over the counter\n-Hair that definitely isn't yours left in the shower\n\nThis hotel was disgusting with a capital D. I ended up here because the conference hotel I was supposed to stay at (nearby) ran out of the conference room rate. Big mistake. HUGE. And to add insult to injury, I managed to get the stomach flu and got stuck in the dump for 2 days straight. There is no excuse for a hotel that charges these rates to be this dingy. NO EXCUSE. I don't expect 5-star service or crazy amenities when I travel. I just expect cleanliness. \n\nIf I could give this place zero stars, I would. \n\nDo yourself a favor and find a room elsewhere.
