The GF and I arrived at the Terminal 3 and after dealing the TSA gauntlet decided we would grab a bite to eat before hopping a jet plane to the Emerald City.  After eyeing the VP&G which is always a safe bet around town (11 locations), near our terminal we hopped in for a beer and some chow.\n\nThe gentleman at the bar was friendly and on point.  The menu as viewed through the eyes of a Vegas local, was familiar.  I ordered up a \"Yorky.\"  A solid burger with bacon served on a ciabatta roll.  The steak fries are awesome.  It totally complimented the Ellis Island Amber I had ordered.\n\nIf ever in this neck of woods of McCarran and in need of sustenance, this is an easy pick.
