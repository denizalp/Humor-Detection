Happy Dog v. 2.0. Happy Dog II. HDx2.\n\nI just like HD part 1 better, I'm sorry. \n\nI sometimes went to the Euclid Tavern as a wee youngster. It's totally different now and the ambiance just...sucks. It's simply not a comfortable place to hang. It's not easy on the eyes like HD v 1.0, ya know?\n\nBut...food is the same. So, there's that.
