Loved this place, from the off-the-beaten path location to the old-school diner atmosphere to the awesome gluten free options to the friendly service and good prices. I had a reuben made gluten-free and was in heaven. SO delicious, with the equally awesome bean salad. Menu is huge - from sandwiches to comfort entrees like meatloaf (vegan too!) to salads and breakfast.
