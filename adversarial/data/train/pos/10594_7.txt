So, I am more of a Macy's and Marshall's guy, on account of the fact that I live paycheck to paycheck and have never allowed myself to spend big on fancy pants stuff. Well, after the playing at the hottest craps table I've ever played at, finding the willpower to walk away with money in my hands, I decided it was time to shop Vegas like Rihanna. Well, maybe like Rihanna when Music of the Sun was hot and she got her first check.\n\nI had my eyes on a pair of Coach sneakers as we walked through the Forum Shops and now that I was ready to spend, I walked in to see how it was gonna go. Mind you, I am still me. Sporting my typical gray T shirt and frumpy \"skinny\" Lucky Brand jeans. (The Lucky jeans are a new addition) \n\nI had expectations of being passed over as I walked through the store, but that didn't happen at all. A wonderful young gal named Emmy (Like the award) walked up to me as I was eyeing the sneaks and with a very friendly and bubbly demeanor, asked if I wanted to try em on. I was impressed with her friendliness, primarily because of my own apprehensions and as she called to the back for my size, we made small talk and she made me feel comfortable being in a new environment. \n\nI am pleased to say that I bought the sneaks, felt great about the experience from the moment I walked through the doors to the moment I handed over the cash. Emmy deserves a promotion and a bonus simply for making a new customer feel comfortable and at ease. She's definitely going places in the retail world and if you wanna feel like Rihanna after her first album check, go see Emmy and you will be more than happy you took my suggestions.
