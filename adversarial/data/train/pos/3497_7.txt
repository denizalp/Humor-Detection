This is the second time that we came here to get some good beer and food and all I can say is I wish they were closer to home for us.\n\n   We were hungry and on our way home back from a night at Wheeling so we knew we had to stop by.  The last time we were here we didn't order off of their main menu.  It was around Lent and we got their special that was a grilled Salmon.  It was great.  This time we studied the menu on our way here and had some ideas on what we were going to order.  \n\n     When we got here they went over their specials for the day and they were really intriguing.  I ended up ordering their brisket tacos off of their specials for the day menu. Oh my they were mouthwatering.  I could have eaten 4 of those and axed the chips.  I ordered a good wheat beer here and my wife got a IPA.  The beer is very good and it just keeps getting better.  Matt and Brad know what they are doing here and I know they will be setting the bar even higher the next time we visit.  Too bad they aren't closer for us or we would be here weekly.  If you haven't tried out Insurrection yet or if you haven't been there in a while make sure to stop by soon.  Great beer and great food!
