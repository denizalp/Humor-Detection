Murica, Jesus, Service, Food.  Seems that is the order of importance in this establishment.  I love this country, but don't care for politics or religion with dinner.  Felt like I walked into the Faux News Cafe...\n\nOur server was pleasant which was the only part of the experience that was.  \n\nWe started with Fried Pickles and they were just Vlasic spears...barely fried, and served with Thousand Island dressing.  Blah...  I ordered the French Dip.  It reminded me of a hot pocket with its canned mushrooms and burnt onions.  The fries were also undercooked.  My wife ordered the buffalo chicken salad.  I kid you not it was a side salad with a chicken tender cut up on top.  1 tender!  It looked like a salad from the kids menu.  I have felt like crap since I left there too.  \n\nWith so many great options around here I do not think this place will last!  We will not be back....
