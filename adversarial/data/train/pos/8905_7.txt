I've seen a few of these places around, looked pretty good so I decided to give it a try. Fresh pasta, pizza and some decent sounding desserts.\n\nTo say I was disappointed would be a massive understatement. \n\nWe got the Ragu pasta, Carbonara, a pizza and the 'Warm Brown Butter Coconut Semolina Cake'. I'd usually use this part of the review to write about the flavours but there weren't any to speak of (unless you count a metallic aftertaste).  \n\nThe pizza was reminiscent of Pizza Hut except last time I checked Pizza Hut has the brilliant idea of actually cooking their dough. I am pleased to formally induct them as a proud member of the Undercooked Pizza Clubâ„¢\n\nDid I say Dessert earlier because I meant Desert, the Warm Brown Butter Coconut Semolina Cake was.... hold on I need a glass of water just thinking about it. The experience of eating this was like having a large handful of sawdust repeatedly thrown in your face. Already dry as a bone the coconut and pistachios shavings on top were the icing on the cake - from hell.
