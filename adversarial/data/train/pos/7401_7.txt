On the coldest evening of the year, I dropped in at Toritos for some tapas with some old colleagues.   This is a warm and casual kind of place where you definitely need the benefit of a few friends company to share different things.   Like a Spanish dimsum, we ordered a good selection of yummy plates to go with a few pitchers of sangria and shots of Petron.   \nHaving been warned off ordering the beef tongue, we had a good selection of befire us.  Each dish was very tasty.  I'd give Toritos a slightly higher rating based on the food,  the service and the cozy and jovial environs were it not for the high prices $10 - $12 for a small plate of admittedly well prepared food is a bit much.   What Toritos lacks in creativity, it does not falter in it's quality.
