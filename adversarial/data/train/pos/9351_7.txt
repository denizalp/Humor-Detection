We were in the mood for some burgers and fries for our Friday evening out but decided to try something different from our usual burger joints.\n\nLocation & Aesthetics - located on East Indian School Road in Phoenix.  The restaurant cannot be missed with its bright blue colored exterior, and large sign 'The Stand' (no relation to Stephen King's novel).\nThere is a drive through option.  \n\nParking was available on the side and rear of the restaurant but in my opinion not adequate for large crowds.\n\nIf dining in, the restaurant had minimal seating inside; there is some seating available under their covered patio which offered lots of privacy from the peering eyes of motorists from East Indian School Road. \n\nFor the minimal parking and dine-in seating (-1).\n\nThe outside seating was comfortable with music playing and a large dehumidifier to keep patrons cool (no misters).  I'm guessing it might be a bit difficult to eat out on the patio during the middle of the summer months.\n\nMenus - clearly displayed over the cashier, simple, and easy to read.  They offer one burger with and without cheese; stand-ins which I didn't try; tacos and sides, and drinks.\nThe offer a variety of drinks including horchata and a drink called a \"Jamaica\" which tastes like sorrel (a drink known in the Caribbean) but upon further research I discovered it's Hibiscus Iced Tea (hope I'm not wrong on that).\nStaff offered us samples of both to try. \n\nService - Staff was extremely friendly and greeted us immediately as we entered and asked if we were dining in and took our names.  They answered any questions we had about the menu and drinks.\n\nFood - For me I ordered the Standard burger (2 House-Ground All Beef Patty, Crisp Leafed Lettuce, Fresh Tomato, Sliced Onion, Dill Pickle, and Stand Sauce) without the cheese, a chicken taco and a side of fries with the \"Jamaica\" drink.\nDespite the burger not oozing with juices and had a dry look to it, it was supremely tasty!  The burger itself was well seasoned and fresh along with the ingredients like the lettuce, tomato, onions (not overpowering), and the dill pickle.  I couldn't really tell whether the Stand sauce was in there or not but, if it was, it didn't deter from the taste of the burger.  The burger wasn't greasy, messy, or full of oils.  \nThe fries was fresh cut, well seasoned with the right amount of salt and again wasn't oily or greasy.\nThe chicken taco (Warm Corn Tortillas, Tender Roast Chicken, Pickled Red Onion, Cotija Queso Fresco, Fresh Cilantro) was also extremely tasty and my only regret was not ordering more, and even if I did, the wifesky would've put the kibosh on that one!  All of its ingredients were fresh, well seasoned, and served hot.  Even the tender roasted chicken tasted as if it was just made.\nThe entire meal wen down easy and most importantly I didn't have that, \"I feel overly stuffed,\" feeling post-prandial.\n\nDespite it being a little out of the way from where I live, I'd still very much love to visit here again as I thoroughly enjoyed the burgers, tacos, and the exotic 'Jamaica' drink!
