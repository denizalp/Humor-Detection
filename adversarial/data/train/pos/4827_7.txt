I came here with alot of expectations after reading all of these reviews and watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi just a few days before but unfortunately I left hungry.   I think I left about 10% full.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  The quality of the sushi is the best I've had in Vegas.   It's probably second to sushi I ate in New York.\n\nI especially enjoyed the Ma Aji, Jack Mackeral, Akami (Blue Fin Tuna), and the Chu Toro (medium fatty tuna)   The tamago was so damm good.  It's a masterpiece and I wish I could eat more.\n\nWe got the 10 piece nigiri dinner and ordered the wakaremi triangle which melt in your mouth.\n\nAfter eating, we had a full meal at Big Wong afterwards.  They really benefit from the foot traffic from all the other Japanese eateries.\n\nCome here for the experience - sip some sake, and take it all in and you'll have a good time.  I'm just a little piggy - I think i could eat 3 of the nigiri dinners and still be hungry.
