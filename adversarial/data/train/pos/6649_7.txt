I know what you're thinking. Why a review on Safeway? Why, Lindsey!? Well, I'll tell you why. In fact, I will only talk about the reason I'm writing this review. This Safeway has a nut bar. I'm serious...a NUT BAR. I'm talking about a whole round island with rows of nuts -- almonds, walnuts, pecans, I think I saw some candied ones...all fresh nuts that you can purchase by the pound. That's just nuts right? This Safeway is definitely one step above any other Safeway in the area and between things like the nut bar and extensive deli, bakery and meat department...it's a Safeway I choose over all others if I'm in the area.
