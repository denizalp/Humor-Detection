I have no clue how this place got almost 5 star reviews. But if I had to guess they are asking their local customers to give them this rating. The location is hard to find tucked away behind other buildings surrounded by a junkyard\/tow facility. The condition of this place is I guess I would say worn out.  \nBut being honest most people only care about the food. Nothing special that's all I could say very limited menu for breakfast I'm guessing waffles and pancakes are the specialty as they seem to have gotten the most coverage in the menu.  \nGiving this place a 5 star rating is like giving McDonald's 10 stars. Sorry to all those folks that think this place is so great but I guess you've never actually been to a five star restaurant\nBecause this place isn't even close\nSave your time and money and go elsewhere
