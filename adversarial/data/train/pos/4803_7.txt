This is my new favorite place to go to after school! I just wish it closed later than 5. The prices are great, especially compared to the mediocre food at school. I wasn't familiar with Korean food & the owner helped me out. I've gotten the bibimbap, the hot version of that, today I tried the dumpling soup. The bibimbap is definitely my favorite!
