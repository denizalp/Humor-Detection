Our family gets take out from this restaurant all the time, they know my dad on a first name basis. And 99.9% of the time our order is always the same, butter chicken extra spicy and garlic naan. However today when my dad called to place the order and picked it up without checking because we order the same thing every time. When he came home and we were about to eat, noticed they gave us plain naan instead of garlic naan which is what we ordered. When my dad called to notify the restaurant, they turned it around and made it his fault stating he never said garlic. Seriously, what kind of establishment blames their customer? And even if it was an oversight, why not offer to fix the problem instead of arguing with the customer. Clearly our business is not important to you, don't worry we will find another restaurant to order from, one that isn't rude and disrespectful. Typical FOB mentality.
