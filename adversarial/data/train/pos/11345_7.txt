Stopped here after a huge dinner on Saturday night. None of us were hungry at all, but we all wanted to try the famous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, so we just decided to split one. There were 5 of us, so we ordered a large, for $14!!\n\nWe ordered from the window in the back, so we didn't even see what the inside looked like, and there was no line at 9:30 PM. The large drink was ready in about 5 minutes...wow! It was freakin huge and it had about 4 inches of whipped cream on the top!\n\nAll 5 of us had a sip, and agreed that it was awesome, nice rich chocolate, thick and creamy, definitely a chocolate lover's dream come true. Unfortunately, since it was so thick, it was quite filling, and we ended up throwing over half of it away. We should have gotten a small.\n\nWhen in Vegas, I will come here again and split a small with somebody, it's cheaper and we will actually finish it!
