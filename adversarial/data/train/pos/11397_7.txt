I was very skeptical coming here but finally took the plunge.  First if these neon lights were on spring mtn It would be a cover for a massage parlor and not a legit one.   Second every time I drive by there's hardly any cars there so with dim sum where it's usually high volume, how is it possible to serve fresh dim sum? They must be serving week old dim sum?\n\nWell took the chance and as I walked in on a Sunday morning at 11:15 which would be prime time in spring mtn, I walked in to an empty restaurant.   We decided to give it a shot and ordered 6 items including steam beef tripe, ha gow, siu mai, pork steam noodle roll, congee, and steamed beef spareribs.\n\nOther than the ha gow which was literally whole baby shrimp compressed together, everything else was pretty good.  My favorites were the steamed beef spares and the beef tripe.  Total was under 20 bucks and I left satisfied.  Maybe I went in with the absolute lowest expectations - that's prob it.  But if I'm in the area and want a quick dim sum fix and lazy to make the 10-12 min drive I'll come here.  When we left they did get 3 more tables and had 2 to-go orders so this place is managing to survive.   Give this place a shot if you've had the same skepticism.  It's decent.
