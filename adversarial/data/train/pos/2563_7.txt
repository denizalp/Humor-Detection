Lets see I've been to Buldogis Cafe 3 times in the last 9 days and twice in the last 3 days. Am I a fan!? Haha am I a fan. Hell yeah I'm a huge fan. \n\nAngry Dog is my #1 favorite item here. It's a good hotdog and bun on its own with some Spicy Pork Bulgogi, Asian Slaw, Diced Jalapeno, and Fiery Mayo piled on top. Ok so if I'm ever gonna rave about any item I've Yelped about this is it. I would eat this every day if I could and I'd probably wouldnt get sick of it. When you do Buldogis, either at the original location, cafe, or truck, you do it right and order the Angry Dog. It's filling, it's spicy, it's delicious, and it's reasonably priced. \n\nBanh Mi Dog is my #2 favorite item. It's the same hotdog and bun but with Pork Belly, Banh Mi Slaw, Herb Blend, and Sriracha Mayo piled on top. It's less spicy than the Angry Dog but delicious also. I've had it twice at this location.\n\nThe menu really has expanded. They offer their usual dogs and fries and added Southern comfort food with a Buldogis twist which I haven't tried yet. Fried chicken wings with various sauces, chicken and waffles\/pancake, cheesy gritts. And they've also added some rice bowls and soups.\n\nThis location seems like it could fit a large number of people and has a nice interior. Customer service is fast and friendly. Its a little closer to the strip than its original location, being in the Chinatown area. Definitely will be back.
