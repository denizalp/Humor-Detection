Out of all the buffets I've tried in Vegas so far, Wicked Spoon is my #1. When my family and I arrived around 5:30pm, there was only 2 parties ahead of us in line. We waited off to the side for a couple minutes before we were seated. Love the simple table setting decor. \n\nI walked the entire buffet and ended with a decently full plate. I enjoyed the crab legs, kimchi fried rice, carnitas nacho, and the dessert bar! One of the BEST pecan maple bread pudding I have ever tried -- with a side of vanilla bean gelato.. YES.\n\n$49 a person for dinner.
