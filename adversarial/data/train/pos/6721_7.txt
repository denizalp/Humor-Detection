You ever hear a song on the radio that you really like and you know it's going to be a hit and tell all your friends about it and after like 2 years it's on the radio all the time and you freaking hate it cause it's all you hear, but you still tolerate it because you know it's real catchy and well composed? yeah... that's melt. 1.5 hours waits on a monday at 2 in the afternoon, realizing you've spent over $1250 in food and beer (not including tips) because you're on your 5th $20 gift certificate for being in the big cheese club. knowing what special is coming up because you already own all the posters. \n\ni hate melt, but i cant stop loving it...it's a true guilty pleasure; and it's probably going to kill me
