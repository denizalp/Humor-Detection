This is more of a price complaint more than anything.  Took my son here to get a haircut and fade.  Next closest place that did fades was further up Yonge Street in Oak Ridges but unfortunately they were booked.  Decided to give this place a shot.  \n\nSatisfied with the job they did but when it came time to pay I asked how much since it was our first time there.  First he said it's $20 on weekdays and more on weekends.  Okay fair enough so it's $25 then?  Yes the older gentleman replied.  So I gave him a $50 and said alright just give me back $25.  I end up getting back a $10 instead.  Didn't have time to argue bc my car was running outside.  So in the end my son's haircut and fade cost me $40.\n\nIf I wasn't in a big rush I would've gone back and got my extra $10 back.  Oh well I hope this review will help others decide whether or not to patronize this place.
