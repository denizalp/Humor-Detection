Last minute shopping for Mexican themed holiday dinner. Found everything I was looking for but really nothing on sale as you might expect. Was able to put all items in the small fold out compartment near the grocery cart handle cost $40! Pork shoulder was $3.19 lb. \/ $2.99 lb. for bone in. Check out was fast and parking wasn't bad either. Just get $50 worth of $.99 tacos from Taco Bell or Jack in the Box and save yourself the trouble. Enjoy ha ha
