This place is not what I expected! They have a sign advertising \"No ticket free food\" well my wife pointed out the sign as we where eating and I realized I never recieved a Ticket  (receipt). I approached the cashier and explained that he had not given me a Ticket. He then looked around and found the ticket and handed it to me. I pointed out the sign to him. He just told me don't matter I just gave you your receipt. Wow! Guess we should of known better. Why advertise if you are not going to honor and follow thru! I will definately pass this on to friends and family.....False Advertising! !
