If I could give this place zero stars I would! I asked for twist in an A-line bob (short in the back, longer in the front). First, the hair they used looks like yarn. Secondly, my hair is so many different lengths all over & one side is shorter than the other. It looks nothing like I asked, then on top of that I was quoted $200 then told it was $220. I paid $200, only to find out that they charged my account an additional $20 the next day using that square machine. BEWARE!!! I will never return, so disappointing.
