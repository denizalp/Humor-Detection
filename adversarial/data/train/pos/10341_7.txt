I've hit every Brazilian \"churrascaria\" in town, even every one in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil...and Pampas, BY FAR...ranks bottom of the barrel in food quality...the 3 other ones in Vegas are far superior.\n\nIf you come here and pay full price you are silly...as they have 2 for 1 offerings all over town and on the internet if you search long enough...and THAT is reason enough to try it out and think, well, $20-$25 per person is somewhat reasonable as their competition in town seldom offers deals and you end up paying over $120 for two (tax +tip) but for far better quality and excellent salad bar.\n\nService:\nThe last time I was here, we sat for over 7 minutes to start out our meal before we had a \"gaucho\" come over ready to carve out some meat...and they aren't that personable like in some other places, kind of robotic.\n\nThe salad bar doesn't have much...throw a couple hearts of palm on my plate and I'm done...not going to fill up on fettuccini alfredo.\n\nThe best cut of meat for me was the leg of lamb and the balsamic vinegar mix they use to sauce it over, but of course that came around once over the course of an hour and we were sitting in the middle of the room.\n\nThe filet mignon is bacon wrapped and too salty and extremely tough for what is supposed to be the most tender cut of meat...and I hope you like it medium-well because that's all they had.\n\nIf you can find a coupon, I'd say give it a shot, but if you want quality and really good food try Fogo De Chao, Texas De Brazil and Via Brasil here in Vegas. \n\nThe quality of meat at Pampas vs. it's local competition is like night and day.
