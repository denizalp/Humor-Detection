Came here twice in two days. Don't judge. \n\nWhile visiting Charlotte for a friend's wedding, my husband stumbled upon Dandelion Market. Went for brunch on Saturday and Sunday, and over that time period had a make-your-own Bloody Mary (mmmm...Tabasco), cinnamon roll (as an appetizer, what else?), biscuits and gravy (so, so, so good... one of my favorite dishes, and one of the best versions of my favorite dishes that I've ever had), and the Monte Cristo (good, no complaints... perfect for a day when I wanted both salty and sweet). \n\nSunday they can't serve booze until noon, which kind of stunk, since I was going directly to the airport afterward and therefore normal drinking times don't apply. \n\nCute little hole-in-the-wall feel, and the staff were very friendly and helped us with our luggage the second day... and our large, growing group of rowdy friends on Saturday.
