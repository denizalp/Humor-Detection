I went to the Indian School location, the blacked out windows should've told me not to go in. When I went in, the lobby was about 6 x 12 area with a couple cheap chairs, and an Asian guy sitting there with a note pad, and a lap top. He said your husband called and cancelled you appointment, I said \"that's interesting, because I don't have a husband, so you have me confused with someone else\". He just argued with me, so I walked out. The little area I saw was filthy, the floors and walls were disgusting, I can't imagine what was on the other side of the door, but I'm glad I didn't find out. I really have to question if this place is legit. It was downright disgusting. I'll stick with Blu Sol, and Hand and Stone, no happy endings there!!! Since writing this review, they have changed their rebuttal numerous times, there are numerous complaints on here, not sure why they are so focused on mine. I did not judge their race, as they have claimed in every rebuttal, I respect everyone that respects me. I don't understand why he keeps complaining about my language, I've never used inappropriate language towards them, or anyone else. I'm reading reviews here where people are saying they were tickled, not massaged; which massage schools teach students to tickle and giggle while attempting to give a deep tissue massage? I was thanking God as I walked out the door that my appt was canceled. If some girl started tickling me inappropriately during a massage, there would me more than a yelp complaint.
