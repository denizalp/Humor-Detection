The staff at this bowling alley is really helpful. The place is clean, including the bathrooms. I'm not a bowling aficionado, so I can't say if it's up to pro standards, but it was perfect for our work party on a Saturday afternoon. They have Kiltlifter and Hop Shock IPA on tap! They also served pizza, salad, wings and some other munchies. I didn't try the food but it looked pretty good and seemed to be enjoyed by my coworkers. Another big plus is that the rental shoes and balls were not all skanky looking! You know what I mean :).
