Memorial Union is a cool spot within UW Madison campus that sits right along Lake Mendota. Inside of building appears to be relatively new \/ renovated and several food establishments are setup both inside of the building and outside on the terrace. All in all it seems to be the spot to chill, people watch, share a pitcher of beer, and soak in the summer rays along the lake.\n\nEven though this one sits on campus, the crowd is pretty mixed. Everyone from college students, to older alumni, locals, and plenty of kids as well. If you're not feeling the outside seating area and stage, there's plenty of indoor seating as well. \n\nIf you find yourself exploring UW Madison campus, I would definitely make a pit stop at the Memorial Union. That's all I got on this one.\n\n'Til next time, cheers! \n\n186\/365
