I am the Accounting \/ HR Manager at City Lites Electric Sign Co and have worked with the team at Capstone for a couple of years now.  \n\nI highly recommend them!!.  They are extremely helpful and when I started here, they made my transition a lot easier.  They are always available for all questions, big or small.  \n\nI have worked with a lot of people at Capstone, but most closely with Rob and Stephanie.  I would be lost without them.  Whenever an employee has any kind of issues they have always been very helpful to me or the employee themselves.
