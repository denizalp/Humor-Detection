Excellent service Steven & Tyler.  (Easy enough to remember.. Steven Tyler lol)  Everyone was friendly & worked together like family.  Everything was clean & you can see into the kitchen clearly.\n\nFriends last minute b-day Pho request.  Ordered the Tofu, Pork & the Shrimp Spring Rolls since we have Vegan friends too & Jenni Pho was very accommodating.  All of the veggies & shrimp were fresh & a nice lite way to start before our filling Pho.  The pork tasted & looked more like a Spam Spring Roll to me, & recommend the delicious Tofu Spring Roll over it!\n\nOne Vegan Pho w\/ Tomato broth, different & very tasty!  The Beef Pho & Chicken Pho were surprisingly delish to me because I have become a 'Pho snob.'  Lol!  I usually eat at two Pho spots regularly that no other compare to.  My white meat chicken was tender, but needed a couple more pieces even though it's a large portion of Pho.  The side veggies of basil, sprouts, jalape√±o, lime, etc were fresh & abundant.  All sauces & chopsticks already on the table, not the soup spoons.  \n\nNot big on Boba drinks since they are also filling before Pho & I don't eat the tapioca balls, but I like the authenticity having them here if I do want one, usually on a hot day.  \n\nThey do not serve alcoholic beverages or sparkling water.
