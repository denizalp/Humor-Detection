I attended this club on April 8,2017 when T.i was performing T.I. Show was great but the club itself was wayyyy over packed definitely a safety violation it was more people in that club  then approved. On top of that there security was UNBELIEVABLY rude to the ones collecting $50 payments outside the club to the ones inside the club. I don't drink and wasn't drinking at the time because I'm pregnant and was there only because of my sisters bachelorette party. They pushed me purposely 3 times telling me to move when the club was so packed there was nowhere to move to. When I told the last one not to push me I'm pregnant he stated \" you shouldn't have your pregnant ass in the club then\"  so rude I will NEVER return they need to be shut down! I plan to report them to the fire department they need to be shut down.
