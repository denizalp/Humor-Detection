Lauren M. and Tony F. wrote much better reviews on our dining experience at this place so I'm going to suggest your check their reviews out.\n\nMy two cents on Xin Jiang Restaurant is what a great job they did with a group of 14 of us. We squeezed nicely around the big round table and the Lazy Susan in the middle made it easy to share everything. Also for $15 a person we had a lot of left over food. \n\nOh and the box of diapers from the 90's sitting in their kitchen was awesome.
