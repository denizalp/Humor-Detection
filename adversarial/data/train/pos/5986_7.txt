I came with low expectations and only came because they gave us 2 free buffet vouchers.  Weekday dinner was about $25, so split amongst 3 people and 2 free vouchers, it was only about $9\/pp which is a STEAL for food let alone buffet in Vegas!  At a certain point, food is food.\n\nIt's definitely not the best buffet in Vegas as I've tried several, but for what it was, I think it's worth coming for if you're a frugal newly 21 year old or even someone that doesn't care much about food and literally eat to eat AND have one of those 2 for 1 or complimentary vouchers.  Otherwise, don't bother at all if no voucher, not really worth the $25.\n\nTowards the left, there was a tiny \"seafood\" section where they had about 3 different sushi rolls, and some cold mixed salads.  Moving over, there's an assortment of \"asian food\" (fried rice, chow mein, broccoli beef, orange chicken), a soup bar (pho, dumpling soup), bbq (+ your standard mac and cheese, mash potatoes kinda sides).  Down the line, there's also pizza and a salad bar, and pastas along with a baked potato bar (grilled chicken, mushrooms, cheese, chili, etc) at the very end.  There's also a dessert table of some cakes and pastries along with chocolate covered strawberries at corner right.  If you've been to a Hometown Buffet in California, it's pretty much like that.\n\nI only really semi-approve of the pasta and soup bar, and some of the asian foods.  But that alone is not worth the $25, so again, only go here if you have a voucher.
