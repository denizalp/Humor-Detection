My mom has been taking my daughter here for some time.  It is not really my thing, so I never took her there myself.  I went to meet the two of them one day and my daughter was having a blast.  \n\nThe Power Card is such a cool idea, letting kids save up their tickets toward a larger prize.  Of course, with a four year old the idea is still a hard pill to swallow.  Still, she was able to redeem her tickets for a couple really decent prizes (much better selection than Peter Piper, for sure).\n\nI brought her back the other day since she was cooped up inside when the a\/c guys were replacing our a\/c.  \n\nWith a Buy $10, get $10 coupon, I would have received 100 tokens.  They had an add on that gave me an additional 25 tokens for $3.  So for $13 I got 125 tokens.  Normally you get 50 tokens for $10.\n\nThe games are not cheap.  Each game she wanted to play was somewhere between 3.7 tokens and 7.9 tokens.  There were also some games that cost more than 10 tokens each.  And not all of the games guaranteed a minimum number of tickets (important when you are saving up for the SECOND unicorn with a blue mane that costs 925 tickets).  \n\nAfter she'd earned enough tickets for the unicorn (thanks to help from me), she just wanted to get out of there.  That was 45 minutes after we'd arrived.  Fine by me!  \n\nShe told my mom later that she was bored there with me and she only wanted to go with my mom.  \n\nThis just goes to show you I may be a fun gal, but I am not \"the fun mom.\"  That's okay.  I make up for it in love.  ;)
