If there's one thing I truly love...it's a good sandwich. Arizona Bread Company does sandwiches so right. Gotta give credit to my boyfriend for bringing me here. \n\nFirst of all, I would highly recommend getting one of their combos where you can get a half sandwich with either a soup or a salad. It's SO much food for the price you pay and it's just wonderful. I love their chicken salad sandwiches. I'm one of those mayo people and they use a really yummy one to make their chicken salad. It's definitely mayo-ey and seasoned so well! And to be honest, it's the only sandwich I've had there so far because I love it so much. I get it on the Honey Wheat bread and it's just perfection. The side salad is big and could be a meal on it's own. You can choose between a garden salad and a caesar. The caesar has the giant homemade croutons on it. The garden has a lot of veggies in it like tomato, red onion, snap peas, cucumber, mushroom, carrots..etc. Lastly, the meal comes complete with either a side or chips, pretzels, or chips and salsa. It's a well rounded meal to say the least. \n\nNow my boyfriend is seriously in love with their Italian with Rosemary bread. He said it just makes his sandwich and it's his favorite bread in the whole world. He usually gets it with turkey and toppings. He usually goes for the soup and today he got to try Shepherd's Pie soup which he loved. \n\nToday when I went in there, I tried one of their sugar cookies on my way out. The staff was so friendly and complimented me on my choice. It was just as a sugar cookie should be, soft, buttery, and a little chewy. \n\nThere's still so much I have to try on their menu but this might hold a top spot on one of my favorite sandwich places in the valley.
