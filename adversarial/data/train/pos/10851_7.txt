Since my canine friend Harley can't write reviews, I'll share my experiences with PetSmart instead. This is my neighborhood location and I feel very lucky that it is! The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive to Harley and me. Although PetSmart is a chain, I don't feel like it is when I visit this location. The staff knows Harley and welcomes him every time we visit. \n\nHarley spends several nights in the doggie hotel and I'm never worried about how he'll be treated. The staff is so sweet to Harley and when I pick him up with a wagging tail and doggie smile on his face, I know he was in good hands. Just recently, I had to leave him for an extended period of time but they offered play time, day care and extra treatment that ensured me Harley was not be forgotten in a cage. \n\nThe grooming department staff at PetSmart are my heroes in life. Harley grows his curly locks frequently but whenever I bring him in to be groomed, he looses his chewbacca look and it's done in an incredibly efficient manner. \n\nI have yet to do the actual training classes at PetSmart, but while I was out of town one time, I purchased training sessions for Harley while he stayed at the hotel. I came back to a much more well-behaved dog and they left me extensive notes and offered to walk me through the training in person as well. \n\nI've already written and raved in a previous review about the fabulous in-house vet, Bandfield (see Banfield review), And of course, PetSmart has all my doggie needs like food, toys and treats. They have great sales as well so keep an eye on the sale rack. \n\nThanks PetSmart for keeping Harley happy, healthy and handsome!
