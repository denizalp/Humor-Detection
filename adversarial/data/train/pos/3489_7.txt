After an unsatisfactory experience with the Berry Company which does the advertising for the Hawaiian Tel com Yellow Pages in our city, our account went to McCarthy Burgess & Wolff which is a collection agency. This happened without warning and without our knowledge. We started to receive calls from this agency regarding an amount of money seemingly owed to The Berry Company. My advice: when you truly feel you are right do not give in to a collection agency. At the same time you cannot ignore them as this usually does not work. Take my advice and hire a lawyer! They will explain your rights and negotiate a settlement that is in your interest. Again, do not waste any time talking to any collection agency as their are expert negotiators. By getting legal counsel, we saved time and money and now the case is closed. BTW this review corresponds in part why I gave the berry company 1 star...but there were other reasons for the 1 star too.
