I feel super ambiguous about this place and wish I could give it a higher score.\n\nWe walked out of the airport shuttle and saw a dusk storm with blasting construction noises near the front gate. 2.5\/5\n\nWe walked into the reception, which was the temporary office made from one of the bedroom, and the customer service was okay but they seemed very impatient and just want to kick us out. They were probably super busy or they were suffocated in that tiny room with tons of people. 2.25\/5\n\nThen they said they have upgraded us for free to the luxury suite! YEAHHHHH 4\/5!\n\nWe walked to the building located way inside the club and opened the door to our unit and OMG! it was so pretty! I wish my house is like that! They had a HUGE tub as well! There were 2 flat screen TV, 1 in the living room and 1 in the bedroom. The bathroom smelled so nice that you don't have to care about what to do with the stinky poop smell. \nThey also offer free shuttle to the strip\/downtown and we got a golf cart ride on our way out to take the shuttle (the stop was just located right in the front entrance, we were just lazy!) 4.5\/5\n\nBut...things are never perfect.\nTheir internet service was very unstable.\nHot water was just warm for one night. We called the front desk and they sounded like she was pmsing. Someone came to fix the problem fairly quickly though. \nTowards our last night of stay, we ran out of hot water at 2am and they said people are off work already, and we would either have to wait until 6am or do a room change. We were not allowed to just go to another room to shower, but we were asked to move EVERYTHING at 2am in the morning. \n\nNO THANKS! So we waited until the morning to shower.\n\nEW. 3\/5
