No need to go into full details but let's say I had the mutha f&$&in best FOOD COMA lol.  The service is incredible and the food again... Just keep in mind FOOD..... COMA.  \n\nOh yeah a very very good recommendation is to get RESERVATIONS before you go.  You feel like VIP when everyone just waits outside hoping to get a seat.\n\n\nThank you BOBBY Q's
