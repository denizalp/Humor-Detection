Don't let the name fool you- in addition to wax hair removal, they also do facials, brow\/lash tinting, and even tooth whitening! So far, I've only been in for a facial, but my experience with Karla was comparable and even better than some places that specialize in facials.\n\nThe Acne Facial included so many layers of products that I lost track, but the deep exfoliant that was used was great- tingly without being painful. There was also a salicylic acid product followed by a cooling clay mask. Extractions were included and not terribly painful.Throughout, the esthetician was friendly and polite without being overly chatty, making it a relaxing experience overall. I especially like the arm\/shoulder massage component, which was longer and more skillfully done than elsewhere, where it feels perfunctory. Following the service, Karla had specific product recommendations to suggest, which was helpful. \n\nTwo days after my facial, my skin is still super smooth and much brighter, with noticeably improved texture. Looking forward to coming back for another service soon- they have seasonal specials and discounts, so find them on IG to keep up!
