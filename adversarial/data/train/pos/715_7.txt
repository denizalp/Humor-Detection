Opens at 4:30am. Continental breakfast spread includes bagels, granola, yogurt and Maker's Mark if you are so inclined. Private shower\/bath rooms are nice.\n\nHopefully someday we will get the same level of Club that United provides in Germany (sleeping areas, more interesting food options) - until then, I'm happy with what we've got ;)
