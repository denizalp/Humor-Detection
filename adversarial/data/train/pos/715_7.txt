Had a fantastic time at a work related social event at Stryke this evening. After food and drink they split our large group into two, and each group took turns learning how to throw knives, wield a bow and arrow, and swing a hatchet. \n\nThe knife throwing was hard. I didn't land a single one on target, either during practice or during our friendly competition, and unsurprisingly came in dead last. The others were kind and I got a few sympathetic pats on the back as we made our way to the archery area. \n\nOur instructor did a nice job explaining things and I managed to get my practice arrows on the target board. When the competition began, I relaxed and just focused on my process, getting better each time, and was shocked to find I tied for 1st! Whew!!\n\nThen it was onto axe throwing. I did really well during practice but lost my rhythm a bit during the competition, coming in middle of the pack. This was the most fun of the three! \n\nOverall a fun evening, and great team building. You should definitely try it!
