Cafe Monarch is romantic, quaint, charming, and quirky...a nice change of place and pace in Scottsdale. The chef, Chris, cooks with love and artistry from the moment he greets you to the moment he serves you. My salmon dish was prepared perfectly (I told him I wanted something healthy) with a blend of mixed vegetables. It just wasn't the meal itself that was good, but the presentation and portion of my meal. Too bad I didn't have my camera with me, but it was beautiful. He then surprised me with a small slice of bread pudding for dessert soaked in (vanilla?) cream sauce. Is he a mind reader, too? Bread pudding is one of my favorite desserts.\n\nThe one thing that makes this place so unique is that there's only one chef and maybe another server to help him out. Remember, patience is a virtue. Don't expect a large menu, though, because there isn't one. Simply displayed on a chalkboard are a few items you can choose from for lunch. I will definitely be back to enjoy his brunch.\n\nOh! And for those of you not in the know. I love (addicted) to coffee and I kid you not...my coffee mug was never empty. Chris kept that baby and my caffeine levels loaded. Maybe I should marry this guy?
