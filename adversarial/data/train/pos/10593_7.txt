The third time was the charm for Mimosa Grill, a venerable Uptown eatery that had disappointed me on two prior occasions. But on a recent visit with business colleagues from out of town, I was pleasantly surprised by both the service and the meal. From the extensive wine selection to the delicious appetizers (the Lobster Mac & Cheese and Carolina Crab Cakes were both outstanding), the entire experience surpassed my expectations. \n\nThe Scottish Salmon I ordered for my entree was also superb, served with a wonderfully spicy salsa dressing and on a bed of risotto. And my colleagues aved about their dishes, as well, which ranged from Mountain Trout to Fried Chicken. After sharing bowls of sorbet and a warm chocolate cake for dessert, they were thoroughly impressed by the Queen City's restaurant scene, and I was thrilled I gave Mimosa Grill another chance.
