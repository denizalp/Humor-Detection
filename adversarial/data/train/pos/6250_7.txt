It's hard to find a rewarding donut in this city , and by rewarding I mean , that taste that brings back all the memories I associate with donuts. \nAs a child growing up in Orange County, Ca., we had not only Winchells donuts but Mom and  Pop joints that  were usually ran by a sweet Asian family who knew how to make a great donut. You'd find them on almost every corner. From my earliest donut memories of stopping for donuts on the way to church or mom buying donuts for birthday party  , or later when donuts provided me comfort during my parents divorce to the fun of buying a dozen donuts on the way home from a wild college night , donuts have  been there for me , like my own sacred rite of passage thru my life. \nOkay that might be stretching it a bit.. but donuts are chocked with memories for me .  So the anticipation was high as I decided on my sick day to stop for a comforting donut or two at Lamars. When I walked in I hoped that somehow a little ole lady would come out from behind the counter but no instead I ordered from the local chain  . \nThe first donut was an old fashioned , it tasted like it was right off of  memory lane , sweet but not sickening, great dough , lightly iced. I was taken back to every yummy donut I ever adored... Great!  I made my second  donut an old favorite , pink iced cake donut ..here is where it all went horribly wrong .. the donut tasted dry ,over cooked,with a gaggy sweet non distinguishable icing...the horror...  Well if you love donuts go to La mars maybe it was an off day for the frosted pink donut..and make sure to have a old fashioned donut for me..
