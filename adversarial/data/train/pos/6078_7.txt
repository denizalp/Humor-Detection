I recently went to Ovens and I changed seats to the back row, because I had to sneak out before the ending to go get my boy from the airport, the back is awesome, it made me realize that there really aren't any bad seats.  I think I might quit buying the most expensive tickets.  You really can see the stage better sitting towards the back. Go figure.
