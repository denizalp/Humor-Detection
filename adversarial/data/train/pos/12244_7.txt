I'm eating a turkey sandwich as I type this. \n\nIs it really 4-star quality? Probably not, but I have had a total of eight hours of sleep and three meals in four days (no exaggeration) while researching every poker room in Vegas (almost) for a book. So, it tastes pretty damn good to me. Plus, the service was very friendly, so that's a star boost. \n\nIf I had to describe this sandwich in one word, it would be \"simple.\" I have been going to Vegas the past three summers for poker, and I always get this sandwich on the way home. It always tastes \"simple.\" \n\nThis is good because it's really challenging to find a good sandwich in an airport, kind of like trying to find Waldo while wearing a blindfold. \n\nNow let's talk about Mrs. Fields. When I first met her, I was in love with her, but we went our separate ways for a while due to a geographical location change on my end. When we got together again years later, I thought it would be amazing, but something was off. I ghosted her for years after that, but now she has found me again at Port of Subs at the Las Vegas airport. I know what you're thinking, but I had to give her another try because of the way she was looking at me on the other side of the glass. If I had to describe her in one word, it would be \"scrumptious.\"
