I visited this place when it first opened. We came in the afternoon and the place was fairly spacious and for the most part, empty. This was actually a welcome change from waiting in crammed spaces for hours. The booths looked clean and the decor modern. The service was very much on point and they were extremely attentive.\nI guess my main gripe was the quality and lack of flavor in the meats. We sampled practically all of the offerings including the marinated and non marinated options. Everything lacked flavor completely. I actually found their banchan more enjoyable than the meats themselves. I don't think this will become a regular place for our Korean BBQ fix unfortunatley.
