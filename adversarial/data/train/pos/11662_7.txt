The Pool at the MGM is fun!  I've been to a few other pools in Las Vegas... and each one is different.  I like the Pool at the MGM because of the Lazy River.  It's a nice way to walk around the area and check out all the people that are there.\n\nIt also gives you something to do, besides just standing there.  Or swimming.  Instead of that, you get to walk around in a huge circle around the entire pool... all while in the water.  If you're a high roller, you can even rent one of those cool donut shaped floaters to float with.    \n\nWhen you're doing your rounds on the lazy river you will encounter all kind of people.  There even were kids here!  Also, there are a few cool areas where the water trickles down on you... like a sprinkler.\n\nIt was free to get in if you're a guest at the hotel,  so I don't how much it would be if you weren't... Or if it's free.
