Love it. The place is ugly but the food is good. It's easily bus and streetcar accessible (I could walk if I really wanted to actually) which makes me happy because my other favorite place for a veg thali is all the way in northern Etobicoke. It's like $8 for a giant plate of food. You get naan, rice, salad, and three dishes on the thali. I loooved the malai kofta. Very tender with super creamy gravy. The muttar paneer and saag were both at the good side of average. The naan was pillowy and fresh. I'm probably going to go back immediately after writing this. Craving now. The only thing I didn't like was the selection of sweets. I stopped at BJ on the way home for my fix. Oh well, nobody's perfect.
