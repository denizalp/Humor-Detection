Perfect pizza.\n\nGiant custom wood bar along the restaurant  left where you can watch them make the pizza's in the wood fire oven. There are a few tables inside . \n\nFresh toppings and well worth the price of a fresh handmade pizza.\n\nAcross from the movie theatre in St-Adele. There's a patio with umbrellas when it's nice outside.\n\nThe all dressed is yummy and the meat lovers was great too !  By far the best pizza in the Laurentian's and probably Montreal too! Really authentic crust, sauce , cheese and quality toppings.
