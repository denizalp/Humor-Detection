There are three free tram systems that operate on the west side of the strip. They're a great alternative to the $5 a ride monorail that runs on the east side. Working north, you can get from Mandalay to Excalibur. Get off at Excalibur and cut through New York New York. Enter the Monte Carlo and jump the Monte Carlo to Bellagio tram. I think this one is the more impressive of the trams. While you're waiting for the Monte Carlo tram you can ogle people lounging around Monte Carlo's pool. \n\nBeat that Toronto Transit!\n\nAfter getting off at the Bellagio, you can cut through Caesar's Palace and get to the Mirage. At the Mirage you can board the third tram north to the pretty damn ghetto Treasure Island. And from Treasure Island you can then cross the road to the Fashion Show mall.
