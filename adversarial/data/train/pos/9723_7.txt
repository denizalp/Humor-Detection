So glad we ended up here last night!\n\nWe started off at Texas De Brazil but the wait was over and hour and a half! Then we tried Tommy Bahamas and they were closed for a private event!\n\nFinally we happened upon Brio and their wait was over an hour!\n\nWe slipped into the bar and as fate would have it a table was getting up to leave right as we walked in!! So we swooped the table like the stealthy women we are and all was right with the world.\n\nWe had an amazing server! We had a few drinks and I have to say their Raspberry Mojito is a must try!\n\nWe started with the Carpaccio appetizer and it was absolutely heavenly. Like I'm crazing it right now at 8:00AM just writing about it good.\n\nFor our main course we had the Steak salad and the Salmon salad. Both were ginormous portions and incredibly tasty. Neither of us were able to finish them and we left incredibly satisfied!\n\nThis will definitely be a go to for girls night!
