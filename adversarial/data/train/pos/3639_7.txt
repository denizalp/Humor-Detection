Okay. \nSo, maybe this review has to do with how I'm not typicaly into country. Dont get me wrong, I'll listen to it, I'll sing along to it, and I'll drink whiskey from the bottle like a country girl......... but the crowd at this place. omg. \nI wanted to murder whoever invented plaid. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?! If it wasnt some white boy wearing plaid and boots (some of them attractive, yes) It was some strange girl in a mini skirt, and a sparkle tube top... what? Also, I had never seen a rhinestone belt, before this outing. I am thoroughly confused. Its got a very hick-LA feel if you ask me. lol \nAnyways, this place was PACKED on a friday, and I loved the live band. I didnt love the drunk girls trying to two-step ontop of my feet, but was so entertained by the chaos that is WR I didnt complain too much. The service here can be a little slow, because it is so busy, but I guess you cant fault the bar for that. \nI wouldnt come here for a mellow drink with a friend, but if you want to get blacked out drunk and wake up in a strangers bed the next morning... I think that this is the place for you.
