Yum! I used to think I hated Ramen but I think that's just because my first and last ramen experience was at Ajisen. Don't go to Ajisen...come here instead.\n\nThe broth reminded me a lot of pork pone soup broth. It tastes just like pork bones, thick and marrow-ey. I think that's why it's so oily on top of the fatty chasu juices, but I don't mind it. I love me some grease!  \n\nI got the chasu lovers. It was loooaded with mean for $13 bucks. If you want to add other stuff like kimchi (how Japanese of you...), egg (get the egg. trust meeee), sprouts, extra meat or noodles you do that once you order the basic ramen bowl.\n\nThere are 4 choices for bowls. Regular, black garlic oil, spicy, and regular with crazy amount of meat. In this order they increase in price. The egg was either $1.50 or $2 bucks but I definitely got two. They need a special machine\/temperature or something to cook it according to my friend Eve W. so I wanted to take full advantage. I also got it spicy, which means it came with a spoon full of red pepper paste. On second thought, I should have probably brought my own from home to sneak it into the bowl...cuz it's a dollar extra.\nThe egg was amazing. The center is sooooooo gooey and soft and just ugh. I want to eat those eggs errydayyy fo lyfe. \n\nI also had the karaage (fried chicken). It was really soft and yummy, but small portion. It comes with a plop of mayo and a tiny plop of hot sauce, which I suspect is just red pepper paste. \n\nI would definitely come here again!! I may have gained 10lbs from that broth though, just fyi.
