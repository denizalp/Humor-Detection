I feel a need to write a review to counteract some of the things being said in other reviews. First, there is no way nurses and\/or the pharmacy would fail to track the distribution of narcotics, and there are numerous safeguards in place to ensure this.  Second, wait times are a function of the government, not the civil service employed at the hospital. Finally, drugs would not be administered prior to meeting a nurse or doctor, so that is not a failure of this hospital specifically.\n\nIn my recent experience, Foothills has helpful nurses and doctors willing to take the time to explain things. Notwithstanding my injured family member, I had a great experience with the staff at Foothills.
