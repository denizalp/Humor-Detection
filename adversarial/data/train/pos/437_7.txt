I have driven by Culinary Dropout (aka The Yard) multiple times and it has always piqued my interest. Finally, after many random drive-bys, I stopped by for a drink and a bite to eat. \n\nCompletely blown away by the interior set up and design. The actual entrance is connected to a small boutique called Madison's--super expensive clothing with simple athleisuere style. (While the clothes are cute, I don't think I can pay $58 for a tank). Anyway, follow the hallway to find a corridor that leads you to an open, transparent kitchen and a cool, upscale restaurant. Completely open concept, industrial, and artsy. \n\nPatrons were young business professionals, older important people in suits, families brunching together, and then me...day drinking on my day off with messy hair. This is definitely not the bar or restaurant you go to for cheap drinks to find life's answers at the bottom of the bottle. It definitely has a classy feel. \n\nStage in the restaurant has live music with the upcoming acts listed on the giant blackboard. The Yard is connected and is the gaming area. 21 and over only in that section.\n\nService was good. Food was good, drink menu was awesome! Prices were decent, but on the higher side overall. Definitely recommend this place to impress a date or a fun girls night out when you're in the mood to get dolled up.
