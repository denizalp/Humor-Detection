VooDoo Beach is now open daily at 10am.\n\nThe pools here feel more like a decorative piece for a tanning salon than anything else.  Everyone was getting their tan on but not their dip on.  TG4SB, at least the small kiddies took advantage of the waters.  Hey, maybe everyone was just digging on the DJ's jamz...maybe.  You can hear the music all the way up from any poolside\/strip view rooms.  My ears are still pulsating...\n\nThank goodness for the adults only pool.  Too many kiddies around for Spring Break...
