Because it's a chain, the only way to differentiate this Chick-fil-a from another location is the service.  I've been here three times & each time have been treated as if the transaction was being filmed on \"The Undercover Boss.\"  The last time I was there, they didn't have my sandwich ready, so they brought me out a brand new sandwich & gave me a free order or fries - hand delivered to my car in the parking lot.  This is how it's supposed to be a fast-food restaurant - I highly recommend it.
