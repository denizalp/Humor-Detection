September 7th, 2017: It's the first game of the football season.  The Patriots are playing (and losing to) the Kansas City Chiefs, I've been eating rich seafood for the past couple of days, and all I want is to toss back a Moscow Mule and eat a slice of pie (with more seafood on it lol).  We got some wings and the North Beach pizza.\n\nThose wings are ridiculously good.  I didn't even think I wanted wings at first but I'm glad they were ordered.  Perfectly fried, enough vinegar for a decent pucker, and the sauce had a nice steady heat. \n\nThe North Beach Pizza [Clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, and oregano - \"An Italian immigrant neighborhood, the home of Marilyn and Joe Dimaggio, the cradle of the beatnik movement, and a delectable pizza inspired by the heritage of the north bay.\"]: This pie was also delicious.  Served hot from the oven with a delicious grey char on the crust.  I was hoping for a white sauce but it worked well with the sweet tomato sauce.  The sweetness from the tomatoes complimented the sweetness of the clams.  I would still rather have clam pizza with white sauce though.  The pizza was foldable without dropping any toppings and easy to chow down.  We ended up boxing the leftovers to eat cold the next morning.\n\nFive50 is located right next to the Sportsbook inside Aria.  So if you wanna watch the game or a fight, this is the place to be if you still want to eat, drink, and be comfortable while watching TV.  Plus you'll be away from the cigarette and cigar smoke!  It's a 3.5 stars place and a $30 pizza but since I'm vacationing, I'll round up.  It's not the best pie on The Strip but it still made this gal happy.
