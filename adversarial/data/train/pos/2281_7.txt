Sorry, came in on a Wed night for 1\/2 off ramen. We were pulled in for that. Appreciated the interesting Japanese beer selection and enjoyed them.\n\nBut after enjoying our beer, we still waited for our ramen. Took way too long. Even the table behind us waited for their meals. Bewildered as it looked like 3 chefs\/cooks, 2 servers and 7 tables of 2-4 patron persons if that.\n\nIf you have time and want to just talk with your company, this would be good.\n\nOur server was super friendly.
