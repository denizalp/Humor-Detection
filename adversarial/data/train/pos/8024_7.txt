A group of us stopped here for our final stop of a long day of hiking, volunteering, eating, and Handel's was the finish line.\n\nI went with the four flavor sampler which I was assured was a good way of tasting different varieties at a value price of $4.25.  I got the chocolate raspberry truffle, salted caramel truffle, spouse like a house, and buckeye.  My least favorite was the chocolate raspberry truffle and I liked the salted caramel truffle the most.\n\nIt's difficult picking flavors when you have no idea what they are based on some made up fun names.  It would be like ordering sushi rolls based on the names those places give if there was no listing after to explain the ingredients.  That would have been my problem had I gone by myself and didn't have friends who had already been there to ask questions and get their advice.\n\nThe ice cream is OK and it is creamy but I don't think there's anything special to it.  While this is fairly close to home, I could think of a couple of places I'd go for more exotic and creative flavors.  Since this is close to home, I'[m sure I'll be stopping here again but it won't be my go to place.
