I'm seriously thankful ( hey, it's the day enforce thanksgiving !) for yelp! If it wasn't for yelp I wouldn't have found out about fabulous eyebrow threading. \n\nI was in Vegas for the holiday weekend, and was in serious need of eyebrow therapy. I quickly checked the website when I arrived in town and found this place with excellent reviews. I seriously thought it was a fluke, but I was wrong... It was great!\n\nUnfortunately I didn't get the name of the woman who improved my brows, but she was just a nice as she could be. She was 7 months pregnant, and we just chatted about how she's coming along with her pregnancy. It took my mind off of the fact I hate threading.\n\nShe chatted with me about my brows and how she was going to shape them. I know I have temperamental brows, but I was so happy she explained the process. It always takes me quite a bit since I have curly brows and they aren't uniform, but she definitely took her time to make them look great. She said I was her first masterpiece of the day, and they were.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you!
