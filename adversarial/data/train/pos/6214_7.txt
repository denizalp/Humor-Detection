I love love love my House Seats account! I have to give a shout out to Edwin P. because he turned me on to them.. but it's the best $89 I've spent in Vegas. \n\nIf you're not familiar with House Seats, it's a company that gives it's subscribers access to FREE tickets, I repeat, FREE tickets to local shows and events. With different membership packages available, I purchased the basic 1 year membership which allows you up to 2 free tickets to local shows and events. The only catch is if you reserve tickets you HAVE to pick them up or you'll be charged. They have everything from Hypnotist Shows to Magic Shows to Comedy Shows to local Tee Times and Salon Services, and more! The shows available change daily, and are offered on a first come first serve basis. The hottest shows go fast, but if you're looking for something to do last minute there's always 15+ options available.\n\nI've only been a member for 2 weeks but I've already paid for my tickets through the money I've saved. Due to the member confidentiality agreement I'm unable to mention the names of the cool places I've received tickets to. But I've already been to 1 show, one event and have a service booked for next week. I missed tickets to a show I really wanted to see last week, but only because I was out of town.\n\nNow that I have my subscription, I can't imagine how much money I'll save this year on shows I'd have gone to anyway, let alone all the great events and shows I'll now try that before I wouldn't have bothered with. This is a MUST for Las Vegas locals!
