I had a really, really, really good time here! The staff is fantastic! Since Centurion is such a small place, you're probably going to wind up talking to the people around you...staff and fellow patron alike. I love that kind of atmosphere. Everyone was in a great mood, and it wasn't that \"I'm in public, better put on a smile\" kind of great mood either, it was genuine.\n\nBe prepared for flavors that will make your mouth feel alive! I'm talking about goat cheese, blueberry balsamic reduction, crab meat, truffle oil, lemon zest, manchego and chorizo! If you enjoy bland flavors, looks elsewhere.\n\nMy date and I had a sampler of sorts. We got the strudel, a pizza and an order of risotto to share. The strudel was loaded with goat cheese, spinach and mushrooms. It was served on a bed of cabbage, corn and crab meat. We're not finished there though because they added a blueberry balsamic reduction on top of it all and seriously took a great dish and made it even better! While getting giddy after each bite of that, we also got to eat some of the risotto -- cheesy manchego risotto topped with a generous scoop of chorizo. Mmm! We finished it rather quickly... And then, there was pizza! We had the salami and artichoke pizza. What they don't tell you on the menu is that the artichokes are marinaded in truffle oil and lemon zest. Whenever I got a bite with every ingredient on it...bliss ensued. It wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, but it was damn good.\n\nI don't really need to wrap this up any other way. I can't wait to go back!
