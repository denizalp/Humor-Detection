I had a much better experience than the previous reviewer.  Everybody there was incredibly nice.  I don't look wealthy (and I'm not) but I was never treated poorly in any way.  The workers also seemed to handle the dogs just fine, there was never any indication that any of their animals were abused or unhappy.\n\nThis is by far my favorite pet store I've ever been to.  They have several puppies of many different breeds and they let you take them into a little both to play with and get to know.  We looked at a maltipoo and a border collie and they were sooooooo dang cute.  My wife and I wanted to take them both home (especially the maltipoo) afterward.  The play booths are such a great idea.  Just looking at a dog through a glass wall does not let you experience the dog's behavior at all.  The maltipoo looked so bored and quiet but once we got him into the play booth his dogality really came out :-).  \n\nOverall everything was great.  The staff was so nice, the store was clean and didn't reek of putrescence, and the puppies were so accessible.
