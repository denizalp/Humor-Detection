The store has a pretty good sale right now and lots of sizes still available, so if you are interested in getting something you should go soon. Their apparel and accessories are generally pretty high quality.\n\nI walked into the store with no intention of getting anything, but I couldn't keep my eyes off of their scarves selection. The sales associate was just hanging the scarves up and she told me that the scarves are right now $19.99 and buy 1 get one free- definitely a steal! The material is very thick and soft, so I would recommend all you scarf lovers out there to check it out.
