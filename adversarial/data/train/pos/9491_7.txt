Want to top off that delectable honey-spiced Fried Chicken at Brooklyn Bowl, a plate of Irish Nachos studded with jalapenos and just oozing cheese at Tilted Kilt, some seared Ahi at Yard House, or a Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger at Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar?  If so, just show some restraint, don't order dessert, pay your check, and then saunter over less than a block to Ghirardelli for a real super treat, like a traditional Hot Fudge Sundae, or something even more sweet and elaborate.\n\nThat's the way I do it when I'm at The Linq and desire the finest finish to an already fine meal.  You might even be lucky enough to save a dollar on a Yelp check in!\n\nThe Hot Fudge Sundae will come with two large scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream, oodles of easily scoopable sweet and viscous hot fudge, real Whipped Cream, a cherry on top, and a few diced almonds showered from above.  I just wish there were more almonds.\n\nBut if you are looking for real hot fudge, or some other chocolaty confection this is the place.  Mmmmm!
