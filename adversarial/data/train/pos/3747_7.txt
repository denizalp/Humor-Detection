So glad SCCF was open on NYE! Had the pleasure of dropping in at this gym before heading off to Vegas for the weekend debacle. Absolutely loved the workout that day...the gym is spacious and even though it was packed full of people, there was enough space and equipment for everyone. I loved that the gym had the heater running since it was so cold that day. Us So. Californians are not used to that kinda cold, ok! ;) \n\nI believe it was Bobbie that coached the class that day. She was totally awesome and kept the class running smoothly. She made sure to go around the entire class during the wod and was very encouraging throughout. For the drop-in rate, I just had to buy a shirt and I love the one I got!\n\nThe box also shares space with an MMA gym, there's an octagon and punching bags on the other side of the gym. Pretty sweet.\n\nWill drop in again next time I'm in town!
