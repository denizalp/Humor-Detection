Crossover! \n\nNot a great place to find any woman clothing, but you'll find everything for the guys. Quite disappointed in their shoe collection. They have everything you can find at every other shoe store. \n\nWhenever my friends and I pop in here for a visit, the workers are either hitting on me or on my friends. Very professional. Workers are too busy on their iPhones texting or changing the music playing in the store.
