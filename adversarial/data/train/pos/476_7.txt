Wow! You guys sure are idiots! Seems your $30,000 typical Scottsdale millionaire clientele are going to cater you right out of business and your doormen are doing a great job of being douches!\n\nSome well known clothing, music and restaurant industry people came out, and wanted to just do bottle service and stay away from the crowd and lay low, and are known immediately in the Cali area, but were not recognized by your idiots at the door. \n\nNo worries! Were known right away across the street and were comped and treated the way we were supposed to be treated. \nNot that anyone needs to be comped, but it's just how business goes and the tip is always a beautiful site right? \nTrust me, we take very good care of our servers. \n\nWell, anyway, Good job! Just like I remember Scottsdale, full of trash and wannabes. \nAt least Cali isn't as racist lol. \nThat's ok, sheriff Joe was pardoned by your orange leader. LOL!\nGood luck! You lost some good references this go around! You'll need the luck!\n\nThe added amount of misogyny and racism to the whole experience was so interesting and incredible that I honestly don't know that I still can fully grasp it. \n\nDid this place hire the doormen as a joke? Is this for real? I'm sick and feel like this must be a reality show. \nIs this an experiment? A social experience? A prank? Real life?! Come on?! Seriously?!\n\nIf I still lived here I would bomb this place with pussy hats and an equal opportunity march. \n\nWhat a joke!!!! And you want to present yourself as Cuban?! Get outta here! You're a lily white, frat baby boy!!!! \nI'm a girl and I can kick your ass! At anything!!!\nSmdh\n\n\nThis is the kind of clientele they welcome at Riot House. \n\"Brad\". \nPlease read what he wrote to me. \nI responded to him and he didn't even remember sending it. \nI guess this professional racist has a drinking problem. \nSeems to enjoy his Mexican food though
