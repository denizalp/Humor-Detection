Reasons why this place is crap: \n1. The hibachi steak, is not really a steak. It is actually pieces of over cooked steak, that they dumped soy sauce on after it was cooked. The bean sprouts are probably from LaChoy, and the mushrooms.....I'm not sure what was going on there. \n2. The water is served in plastic glasses. \n3. Beer selection sucks. \n4. There are light up vaginas on the ends of all the outer booths. \n5. The service sucks. \n6. The food is overpriced for the quality. *quantity does not equal quality \n7. Ads inside a menu are in very poor taste. \n8. The music is really loud for a restaurant. \nHowever, the Key Lime Cheesecake is amazing.
