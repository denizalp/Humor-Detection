You know....twice...very unfriendly female bartender whose skewed time clock is inconveniently 10 minutes ahead  every time for last call...no apologies...very smug,...yet somehow at the same time unsure of herself ...needs major improvement...shouldn't make the customers feel bad about requesting drinks before last call. Without her and this bar would be amazing! \n\nSincerely- would be loyal customer
