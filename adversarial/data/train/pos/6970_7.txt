I love Anthropologie so much. I stared at the Yelp stars for a long time before beginning to pen this, and though five stars for a chain isn't normally my style, I just can't help myself. Like many a girl who once pined for Urban Outfitters goodies, I have grown into a lady who drops serious chunks of change at Anthro. \n\nThis location is my favourite Anthropologie in the world, and I've dipped my toe in many. Rockefeller Centre, Beverly Hills, Yorkville, they've got nothing on this wonderful Queen W location. Housed in an old church, with every corner filled of nearly their entire online catalogue (minus the Petites, bring on the Petites!), if you like Anthro you'll love this location.
