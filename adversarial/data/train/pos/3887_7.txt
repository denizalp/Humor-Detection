I booked a round trip on spring break. A week before our trip was scheduled to take off, I called the company to change my return date. I was assured that my return date was confirmed, both by telephone and on the day of drop off by the driver who dropped me off at my resort.\nFast forward to the day I was supposed to be picked up.... no one showed up. I called the company about thirty times on both of their phone numbers. I left about 6 voice mails. No one bothered to get back to me. They didn't even get back to me after the fact. I was required to be to work on the day after my scheduled pick up, and was FIRED because they refused to communicate with me. \nThanks a lot.
