Passing through the Biltmore area, we were in the mood for some good quality burgers, and thought, we'd give Delux a try!  Was it worth it?\n\nLocation & Aesthetics - located off East Camelback Road, on the corner of N 32nd. Street and E Camelback, in the Biltmore area\/section of Phoenix, and in the same compound with Safeway grocery.  Lots of available parking that's separate from Safeway's parking area.  This particular area does have a couple other restaurants so you may have to drive around (within the parking lot) to find a parking spot which isn't totally inconvenient in my opinion.\nThe interior decor is nice though, I thought, a bit on the small side.  There is outdoor seating, and I believe there was a heating lamp outside for those chilly evenings.  At the time we went, it was around 3:00 PM and the place wasn't too busy on one side. I say \"one side\" as apparently there's two sides to the restaurant -- side with the bar and, if I'm not mistaken, the side that served the burgers; and the other side, I believe, was for the sushi though I could be wrong on this assessment. We were seated on the side for the burgers (for the purpose of this review) as that's why we were there.  There was seating with high chairs that seemed appropriate for couples or just two folks grabbing a bite to eat; and seating with tables, chairs, and booth-styled (though not entirely) seating against the wall.  As I was in a party of three, our greeter was kind enough to join a table together for us.  As I mentioned before, the interior did seem on the small side (-1).  If a medium-to-large sized group came in, I'm not sure how they'll finagle the seating to accommodate.  Lighting was ample with enough light from outside streaming in through the front windows.  There were TV's on the walls but appeared muted.  Noise level wasn't bad.  Dress is casual.\n\nMenus - were quickly brought to our tables, and we were quickly acknowledged by waitstaff!  The drinks menu was quick extensive as well as the dining menu, which were both comprehensible to read and understand.  Waitstaff was happy to answer any questions we had on either menus.        \n\nService - very prompt!  Drinks were brought to our tables, followed by a small wait, then our food.  Waitress visited our table frequently to see if we had any issues, concerns, or complaints, and always appeared with a warm pleasant smile.  \nEven as we entered, the greeter gave a warm welcome and was prompt to acknowledge us we walked in, asking whether we wished to dine outside or inside, and provided us with options of tables as there were three of us.  Wait time for the food wasn't bad considering one in the party ordered the Delux burger cooked well, and I wanted mine cooked medium-to-well.  \n\nFood - I had their signature Delux burger -- premium beef with the Niman Ranch signature seal, their signature infusion of caramelized onions, bits of applewood smoked bacon, blend of gruyere and maytag bleu cheeses, and topped with baby arugula.  All of this is served on a handcrafted demi-baguette!  \nIf you don't know much about beef or products from Niman ranch, I highly encourage you to research it on the web to discover more about their mission.\nThe burger, once presented to you, doesn't look round like your usual burger, but instead, looks similar to grinder sandwich.\nOne phrase to sum up the experience of eating this burger -- it is to die for, and out of this world (okay two phrases).  The burger tasted great -- really fresh; cooked to perfection and as I had asked -- well done; juicy; and really well seasoned.  It certainly didn't taste like your ordinary ground chuck you pick up from the supermarket.  The buns were freshly baked, warm, and soft.  The smoked bacon added that extra bit of smokiness to it; the caramelized onions a bit of sweetness; the cheeses gave it a slight bit of acidity; plus the arugula seasoning, though unusual and never thought could be used on a burger, was a great surprise that provided a slight peppery flavor to the whole burger.\nFor my drink I ordered their Haagen-Dazs vanilla shake which comes with whipped cream and a cherry on top.  Let me tell you, this shake isn't your regular shake and probably that's because it's made with Haagen-Dazs ice-cream -- it made it very authentic tasting....the real deal!  It was super creamy, rich, and thick, and was served with two straws in case you wished to share (yeah, right). \nWhat I particularly liked is that, even though it's served in a traditional milkshake glass, they will bring a metal cup and spoon with the remainder of the shake for you.  In other words, the remaining portion of the shake isn't wasted!     \nDespite the time we arrived was still 3 PM, they were still serving the lunch menu which entitled you fries with your burger.  I ended up choosing my usual favorite -- sweet potato fries.  The portion size was adequate, and were fresh, warm\/hot, and not soggy or limp, but actually very crispy.\n\nA definite must return!
