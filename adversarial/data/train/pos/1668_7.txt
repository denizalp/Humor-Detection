\"They\" say everything in life provides a learning opportunity. Here's what I learned at the Vesper Bar last week: a White Lady cocktail is a Sidecar made with Gin.\n\nI wished I had my Yelp friend Alexandra S. with me to enjoy a White Lady as made at Vesper because she is the person who first clued me in about Sidecars several months ago. Sidecars have since become one of my favorite winter - spring cocktails. The White Lady version seems a perfect cocktail for summer months. (Move over, maybe, Perfect Margarita?) So here's a virtual toast to Alexandra S. who, by extension, introduced me to the White Lady. Everything is connected to everything else. ;-) \n\nHere's what I also learned from sipping a cocktail at the Vesper Bar: \n\n1) The crystal beading that envelops the Chandelier Bar IS lovely but one cannot drink the beads and the mixologists there, at least those on the second floor of the three story bar, don't quite have expert mixology nailed down. The Vesper mixologists do. \n\n2) Vesper is the best bar for relaxed people watching at the Cosmopolitan because it is adjacent to the registration desk and one of the concierge offices. . For the price of an excellent cocktail, you can easily gain an hour's worth of entertainment watching people come and go. Not quite free entertainment, but close enough by Las Vegas standards. \n\n3) Each of the bars at The Cosmopolitan (including each of the three floors of Chandelier Bar) has their own specialty cocktail menu.  The one  at Vesper was the most interesting of them all for my husband and me, \n\n4) The multi page menu at Vesper offers cocktails from standards to house specialties that run approximately $12 - $14, and use top quality ingredients so overall, by Las Vegas standards we thought they were a good value.
