Horrible company to deal with. They scam you on fees and their technicians are not very knowledgable. Would not recommend to anyone. Gave one star only because yelp makes me.\n\nI find it funny that they comment saying that it is not typical service yet EVERYONE I have talked to about our experience with them has advised me that they have heard nothing but bad things about this company. We should have asked around before we called them, our mistake. Yes we received a PARTIAL refund after many many days, emails, calls and complaints to finally get them to cooperate and they still did not provide us with an itemized receipt like we asked for showing the parts prices. We still feel we were never reimbursed for the full amount that we should have been under our home warranty. A neighbor I have spoken to that used them as well had nothing good to say either. I think I need to also add now that their technician that came to our house had to call someone to ask what he should be doing and then broke our AC completely (it was working but making a loud noise) which was in the middle of the summer and he told us he would have to come back the next day to fix it (he couldn't get the part that night, maybe because he showed up much later than our appointment block) and left us with no AC. Our home got up to 98 degrees that evening and we had to move us and our dogs out of the home until it was fixed the next afternoon.\n\nI would not be so direct with my review if the company would have tried to make this right but from the late and seemingly inexperienced technician, leaving us with no AC and having to move out for the night and then the hassle with getting reimbursed under our warranty, it has rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of just saying that this is not typical service maybe they should have tried to make a bad experience good and I would have updated my review.
