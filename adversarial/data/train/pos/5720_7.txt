Beware of Estrada Car Rentals: Story of a victim of a car collision \n\nAfter reading a review from yellow pages, we can totally relate to the person who wrote it. After being in a car accident, this company insisted on delivering their rental car the night of after we said we did not need a rental car till the morning. They delivered the car anyways and automatically assumed we would rent the car for 20 days. After driving the car for a day, we decided to return it due to safety reasons. It was unsafe as the tires lost a lot of the traction from others driving it. It also wasn't safe as it was winter and we did not want to have another accident especially on the rental car. \n\nWe called the company and they deliberately ignored our calls and later said you cannot return on the weekend. What kind of car rental company does not allow you to return it on the weekend. \n\nInstead of billing insurance like they said they would, they billed my credit card $750 for 48 hours of rental. In the $750 there was $250 for delivery which we were not told about. Never have we dealt with such an unprofessional company. We are still disputing the charges. \n\nPass the message along to ensure this does not happen to others. Do not take car rentals recommended by the tow truck company or sign any contract with Estrada Car Rentals
