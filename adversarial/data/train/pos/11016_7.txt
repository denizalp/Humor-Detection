Don't think I've ever been to a Claim Jumper before, but I gotta say that recently my sales rep ordered 40 take out chicken pot pies due to a customer request.  They were really delicious!  Take out size is about a 4\" circumference but I hear if you dine in, it's the size or a 12\" dining plate.  They also offered a unique salad with shredded lettuce, vegetables and coconut that I wouldn't have expected from this place.  At any rate, a nice surprise from Claim Jumper, where I now feel the urge to perhaps try this place and dine in sometime.
