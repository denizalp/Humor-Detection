This park would be greatly improved if it were not sandwiched between (and exposed to) a road and a parking lot. And filled with geese. Aren't geese migratory? Why are they always here? You should be in Florida, goose!\n\nCars and geese aside, the park is nice enough. You wouldn't spend the day here, but it is tolerable in small doses. The water feature, especially, is quite unlike anything else in Charlotte. There's a bridge-ish thing and fountain-ish thing. That's charming.
