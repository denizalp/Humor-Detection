So I'm trying to be a douche and park at George & Dragon, because I hate all things valet (it's complimentary, you just have to pay for it!) The valet sees me and is all, \"Hey, are you going to Clever Koi? You can't park there.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, you just assumed I'm going to Clever Koi?* Where do you get off, buddy?\"** But yeah, those sneaky buggers will totally corner you into valeting, tail betwixt legs.\n\n*I said literally none of this.\n**I silently complied. \n\nMoving on, it's happy hour. I order only full-priced drinks because I don't understand money. Fill Collins and Slippin' Jimmy are both exceptional, and I would've drank more if I didn't have to go to another thing to drink more after. The server, noticing our enthusiasm (and dashing good looks) recommended we sit at the bar and get creative with the bartender, which is 100% on for next time.\n\nEdible portion: \n- Highlight was also not an HH offering - chicken and waffles, featuring taco'd waffle filled with saucy chicken.  \n- Blood orange chicken wangs: sounds more creative than it is. Saltier than expected and served with ranch, you get three full bird arms in an artsy little stack. A great option for your friend who wishes you were at Pei Wei and a sports bar.\n- Yams o'brien: cubes of Japanese sweet potato with sriracha aoli, also much more normal than I had in mind. It's a fun and easy activity to mindlessly eat the whole bowl, but not essential. \n- Seasonal vegetable plate with steak: maybe I hate Spring, or vegetables, but the asparagus, beets, and kimchi didn't really do it for me. I liked the yams, but I'd already eaten like, 14 cups of yam by this point. I would pass on this in favor of several more chicken waffles next time. \n- Honorable mention: server candy! Man buns, septum piercings, gauges, and tattoos galore. The waiters were 104% more fun to look at than the guests.\n\n5 stars cocktailery & server candy, 3.5 star food. Come for happy hour, stay for the other stuff.
