The main concern this company has is who will be paying at the end. If its a management company they cant even provide an estimate because the tenant will not be paying. But the tenant can give your estimate to the manager so the job can be done maybe faster than waiting for their phone call...just an opinion but obviously Fred did not agree on this one...i would not recommend this company to anyone Business 101 is to have great customer service
