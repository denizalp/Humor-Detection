I recently got engaged (doing Homer Simpson's whoop!  whoop! dance while spinning on the floor) and have been researching different ceremony and reception places in town.  Being engaged also gives me an entirely new category to Yelp!  =)\n\nEmerald at Queensridge is in the Summerlin area right next to Sun Coast and Boca Park.  It's beautiful without being pretentious and overpriced like some Strip ballrooms.  They offer wedding packages that consist of practically everything from the DJ, to the photographer, to the food and at reasonable prices.  \n\nSo far, this is my first choice to have my wedding but I must consider other options before making a final decision.  Oh!  Forgot to mention my favorite part of this place.  Their bridal suite is gorgeous.  It has several vanity stations for the bridesmaids, a private closet, a private balcony and a huge full length mirror.
