Located just north of the stratosphere,  this place is super inviting with the aroma of smoked meat luring you in from the lot.  \n\nWe ordered two arepas each so we could try some different flavors.  They are like tiny sandwiches but made with cornmeal. And by tiny I mean actually medium-size. We each could have done with only one I ended up leaving half of each sandwich that I picked because I was so full. We also got the passion fruit juice and that was superb, perfectly complimented the arepas. The creamy green sauce was the bomb! It's like a mix of creamy avocado and salsa verde. I kind of want to put that sauce on everything in my life.
