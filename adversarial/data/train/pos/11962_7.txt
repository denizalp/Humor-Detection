Superb!! We enjoyed our dinner from beginning to end. Arawan is definitely in my top three of Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. \nLike most Yelp reviews these are the musts haves for your first visit (though what ever you explore on the menu will be well worth your venture)\nbut for the first visit.....\nARAWAN PAD THAI..... Immaculate presentation, and the taste is not far behind! Delicious!\nCRAB FRIED RICE..... so light fluffy... flavorful.... yum!\nCRISPY LEMONGRASS CATFISH ..Whole catfish crispy-fried and topped with lemongrass, fresh mint, red onion, garlic, cashews, crispy basils and a homemade semi-spicy dressing.......Yes!!! again..... Yes!!!! \nFor some odd reason I did not get this on my first visit to Arawan, but I will highly recommend you try the catfish! Even if you are like me and not a big catfish fan.... this one is different... it is Amazing!!!! I beg you... try the catfish!\nOur dessert was the Banana Puff. It is Caramel banana ice creme, crispy puff pastry, banana, strawberry, chantilly creme, caramel sauce, walnut, walnut chocolate sauce. Oooooo yeah!\nGotta add this to your bookmarks!
