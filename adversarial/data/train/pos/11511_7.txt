Heallow. I a go to goldens pizza for a Greek food. Rice and potatas was a no good. Very no cook enough. Calamari very nice. No busy but the a waitress forget my saganaki. No good service. she a forget to bring one of our dinners. So it comes late. It's a very very cold. No turn on heat. We eat with hats and coats. All of the Greek salads only have ONE kalamata olive. One olive malaka!
