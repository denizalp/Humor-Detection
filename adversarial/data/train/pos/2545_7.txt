Awww, an old friend. Wahoos can be found all over California, my old stomping grounds. The food is simple, unpretentious and delicious. When I first walked through the door I felt like I was back in Ventura or Orange County again. The beach, tacos and music...all the important stuff. For a second I forgot I was in Vegas. The fish tacos are amazing! And the star of the show is Mr. lees. You must get the Mr. Lees! The food is just a vessel for Mr. Lee! It's this garlicky, spicy, hoisin saucy I dunno delicious concoction of a sauce that you can put on everything.
