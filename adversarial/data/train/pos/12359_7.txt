If you are looking for a nice dining experience at a resort and casino, but don't want to hassle with the silliness that is the Las Vegas Strip, this place is for you.\n\nThey are not cheap, but their prices are reasonable. Their steaks are fantastic. However, when we come here we enjoy their seafood selections. Last time we were here we had the fresh seafood platter which included lobster, crab legs, oysters, and shrimp. It was delicious! \n\nAs for their staff, they are all fantastic. Our waitress the last few times has been Sue (or it could have been Jan? Now I think I'm forgetting.) Anyways, when we come back I'll get the name right and will update this review accordingly. But to whatever her name is, BIG SHOUT OUT for great customer service! She was talkative but not too talkative, attentive but not overly attentive, and when I ordered my martini the bar tender was unavailable, so she made it herself. When she told me that I was a little hesitant because I am rather picky about my drinks, but it was honestly one of the best martinis I have ever had. (Stoli martini, extremely dirty, three olives.) Service from her was all around perfect.\n\nWould I come back? Yes.\nWould I recommend this place to others? Absolutely.
