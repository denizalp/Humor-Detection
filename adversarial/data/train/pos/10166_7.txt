This club is overrated. If you want to pay top dollar for a VIP table and pretend you're a boss, this is the place for you. Tiny dance floor and most of the main floor is filled up with VIP tables. \n\nWe went here on a Saturday night and got in gratis since we had a great hookup. You ride in an elevator up to the club. Inside the main room is amazing with cool elements that rise and fall from the ceiling, and a huge LED Screen behind the DJ. Being inside this club is confusing because there are hallways that lead to nowhere, stairs all over the place and dark corridors. For whatever reason the people dancing all faced DJ Lema instead of each other, we've never experienced that in any other club. \n\nWe took a look outside and the poolside bartender didn't know how to make a Wet Panty and acted like I was the crazy one. What's with the attitude?  Dude, you're all of 22, get over yourself!\n\nWe love going to clubs wherever we travel and we've been to other LV clubs when they first opened up, like Pure and Tryst. We've also been to Pure's sister club, Aura.  in the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas and danced til 5am. Marquee just didn't do it for us. The main room was playing EDM which we love, but the music just wasn't inspiring. We checked out the library, which is pretty much the only place to sit down if you don't have a VIP table. The best room was the Hip Hop room, which was totally packed and the music was great. If we had started out in here we probably would have stayed and dropped some cash on drinks, but after the lackluster experience in the main room we were done.\n\nTo exit the club we had to walk down 4 flights of stairs. Good luck to the girls wearing high heels, thankfully I was wearing flats and made it downstairs without incident.
