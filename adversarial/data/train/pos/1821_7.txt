Small sandwich shop in downtown Cleveland across from Heinen's. A few small tables, but this place is mainly for takeout. \n\nI ordered the westside sandwich. This sandwich is much higher quality than something you would get at Jimmy John's or Subway albeit a little pricier at $10. The toasted sesame bread, zesty tomato mayo, luxurious quantities of meat and the way the sandwich held together as I devoured bite after bite was fantastic. After I finished the sandwich, I wanted more. A sandwich is usually just a sandwich, but the Cleveland Pickle does it well in a way that distinguishes itself as something more, transcending the flavors of your everyday ho hum sandwich.
