It's not often an individual would drive four and a half hours for a bowl of something fabby but this is the case folks. The pan roast is redonkulous. If I were condemned to death this would be my last supper. My poor husband is getting burned out as I make him share one with me but feels that it is overkill to have it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Picky, picky.\n\nI hesitate to review this as it might result in a horde of avid Yelpers converging on the Oyster Bar and thereby making me have to wait for this precious bounty. But, review I must as it is so deserving of the high praise it so deserves. Yes, I be the wizard of words, anointing my beloved pan roast with the title, \"nectar of the gods\". So come and enjoy I promise you will not be disappointed as it is replete with lobster, shrimp and bathed in a spicy broth of tomatoey marvelousness. \n\nPan roast I salute you as you make this world a better place.
