If you want the BEST buffet in Las Vegas, do yourself a favor, hop in the car and drive 9 miles to come here.  They have the best Alaska King Crab and best Prime Rib of all buffets I've had.  And trust me I've had many.  \n\nThe unique thing about this Feast Buffet is that they will stir fry your king crab with butter, onion, garlic, tomato, and cilantro.  You can also request it spicy like I did.  It smells wonderfully and tastes even more heavenly.  I am not kidding.  None of that ice cold crab leg crap!  The crab legs here are fresh, big, sweet.  One word - PERFECT!!!  I come here and chow down 2 huge plates of king crabs.  My hands get all greasy and I had to use 20 paper napkins, but I don't care!  \n\nThe carve station serves the most tender prime rib I've ever had.  They also serve turkey, rotisserie chicken.  Oh, the fried chicken is also great.  Like all buffets, they have Chinese (best egg rolls and fried pot stickers), Mongolia Beef station, Mexican, Italian, dessert, soft serve and ice creams.  This by far is my favorite buffet in Vegas.  OK, it's in Henderson.  \n\nThe price is very reasonable, around $20 for dinner.  I haven't had to pay since I get coupon from them (which was why I first tried it).  But I'd drive here and pay to eat even if I don't have the coupon.
