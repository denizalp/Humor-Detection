Jon came into my business this morning and asked for John (the manager) and I advised him he would be right with him as he was on the phone. Jon from Quality Epoxy then said he needed to measure the shop and we directed him to go ahead and measure everything. Upon entering our bays, he slammed his equipment down on top of a tool box belonging to one of the techs. Jason (a tech) politely asked him to remove his stuff from the tool box and instead place it on the counter as his equipment was bowing the lid of the box. (This employee saved for two years to purchase his tool box, I'm sure he would not be pleased to find it damaged because of a vendor slamming his equipment on it.) The instant this request was made of him, he began yelling and cussing at the tech. This all occurred in an open and working shop with customers present. No employee of our business ever yelled back or cussed at this man. He continued to scream at everyone and yelled  then at the manager saying he didn't need our employees telling him what to do. Upon being asked to leave our business he turned and called the tech a \"f'n retard\". \nJon then called and left a message with our operatiotens manager stating he was verbally accosted by the technician. I was there to witness everything that occurred, and the technician never raised his voice, cussed or yelled in any manner. We were prepared to contract this company for two businesses and two very large home garages which would have been a big job. \nOn attempt to complain to his higher ups, we could only find his personal contact information.
