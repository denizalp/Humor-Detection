Beautiful decor and cool atmosphere can't make up for the less than stellar service and bland food. I was actually really excited about going here because I'd heard great things, but it seems it was just more hype since it was Santana's restaurant.\n\nThe tortillas were really dry and food wasn't really that distinctive. I loved their chunky salsa though, which tasted very fresh. I was bummed that it took them nearly 10 minutes for them to refill my ice tea and it wasn't even that busy for a lunch hour. I really want to like you Maria Maria, but our first date was kind of a bust.
