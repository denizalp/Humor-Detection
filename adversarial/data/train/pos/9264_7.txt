Can I give this place like 27 gazillion stars? I am in LOVE. Legit.\n\nReally I was sold when I walked through the door and was greeted immediately by the gorgeous d√©cor - piiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnkkkk, black, wood floors, a sparkly sign that says BE FABULOUS, sweet looking jazzy ceiling lamp, super snazzy chocolates, shelves of wine and craft beer!!! Looks like how I want to decorate any house I'll ever live in. Seriously. The place is gorgeous. I probably looked like a fool but I started snapping pictures like the paparazzi. Whatev, they were cool about it.\n\nUpon asking my twenty million questions, as per usual, I found out that they do wine\/beer and chocolate tasting events (on weekends maybe? could be all week, I'm not sure - sorry, I wasn't paying enough attention bc I was drooling over chocolates and freaking out over all the PINK). And they also offer individual like anytime treats (I think they had a lambic float while we were there), but they're limited on how much they can serve you due to their liquor license. \n\nAn important thing to remember is that Lilly staff will provide you with wonderful suggestions for wine\/beer and chocolate pairings so you can take home a little slice of Lilly heaven. You can also check out some of their suggested pairings under the \"Meet the Chocolates\" section of their website.\n\nThe place is so great because (well aside from the facts that the chocolate is divine, the owners are great, and the place is straight snazzy) well, it had things that attract both males and females. Just to get one of my friend's husbands to enter the store was like pulling teeth but when he saw the shelves of IPA's, Porters, and Lambics he was sooooold!\n\nYes, the chocolates are pricey - but they're fancy looking and well worth the cost. A box of 12 assorted will run you around $23 bucks.\n\nMy faves (they're a must try) are the Schweetie Pie | vanilla bean butter caramel, roasted almonds, white chocolate and the Frou Frou | Sicilian blood orange, freeze dried passion fruit, white chocolate.\n\nThis place just has such great energy and it has CHOCOLATE - quick, go NOW!
