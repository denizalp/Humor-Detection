Ok!  If you are in Terminal C and you need a stiff drink-Phillips Seafood is where you want to be!  Remember this is an airport-so don't have regular expectations of more than casual dining.  \n\nThe food is not the best-plus you are paying for the Phillip Seafood name--so expect higher prices than average!  I would recommend that you just sit back- enjoy a cocktail or two before your flight!  They pour heavy on the cocktails-so be prepared to feel good and groovy on your flight!
