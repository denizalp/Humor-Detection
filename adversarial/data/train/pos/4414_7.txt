I am VERY picky when it comes to my dog groomers.. & i've finally found a place where i'm 100% happy with their work & customer service! I brought my yorkie (Theodore) in for his first haircut... & I was super nervous, because I wanted a full teddy bear haircut, and growing up with family dogs I know how bad groomers can be! Brenda made sure to go over EXACTLY what I wanted and went over how each area would be cut to my liking which was comforting. Coming back 4 hours later I was in love! I couldn't believe how cute he was! BRENDA did an amazing job and I will be moving all 4 of our family dogs over! The employees are very patient and helpful! Thank you for making my experience great!
