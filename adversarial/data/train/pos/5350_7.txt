I've had an organic latex bed from sleep extra for about 2 years. We chose to take a chance on this bed after 15 years of picking horrible mattresses. While I was nervous ordering online, I figured I couldn't do worse than I had from a box store. \n\nMy husband loved his side immediately. We were both recommended firm-Med- soft. His was perfect. I'm pickier due to back problems. I have scoliosis and fibromyalgia. After trying different orders of the layers, I called to see about returning it. After lots of discussion about what I had tried and what hurt, they made a recommendation and extended the 100 days.  I'm still sleeping on the order they recommended (f-s-m)!  I love my mattress. I used to like to go to certain hotels- now they're uncomfortable compared to mine. If I were to do it over, I'd probably switch it out my soft for a medium as I prefer a slightly firmer bed, but the way it is is fine. They would have switched it in the warrant period if I had called.   For reference, I'm 5'4\" 110lbs and my husband is 5'9\" 190lbs. \n\nAs for fumes\/smells, they were very faint coming out of the shrink wrap. Hubby couldn't smell it but I smell everything. Once the cover was on, there was no smell!  Our former hybrid from a box store was so strong I wouldn't sleep on it for a couple of weeks!\n\nNow on a more personal note, it is our opinion that his side w the soft on top is too soft for sex (not enough resistance). You sort of sink in. The middle is the firmest part of the bed (you can't feel the seam, it's just former than either side).  Both the middle and the side w the medium on top are fine for sex.  I know, tmi but you know you were wondering!\n\nGood job, sleep extra on a wonderful bed!  I'll never go back to a traditional mattress!
