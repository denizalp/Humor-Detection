Awful Experience and Disrespectful Owner:\n\nA friend and I stopped in this bar while visiting Cleveland that happened to be having a birthday party for Bill Bellamy. Someone invited me to join the VIP section after seeing me take a picture from my phone. As soon as I got there a man (white) told me that he \"wanted to impregnate me\" in a joking way. I ignored the comment. And found my friend who was also in the section. Not much later that, same man was popping a champaign bottle, and the cork hit my friend in her leg and me on my foot. She said something to him and his response \"I was trying to hit you in the pu**y\". She didn't hear this comment. He then started asking his girlfriend, while pointing at us \"which black girl should I pick?\" She apologized for his comment and told us not to listen to him. I then asked him if he always talks to women like that? He got mad and said, \"It was a joke. Next time I make a joke, you need to laugh!\" He repeated this several times. And I said \"Next time you make a joke you need to make it funny. I didn't laugh because it wasn't funny.\" He then told me he was the owner and that me and my friend could leave. I turned to try and tell my friend about how racist and ignorant this man was, as security came and made us leave. \n\nThere was soooo much I wanted to say in that moment but something told me not to cause a scene. I've never been spoken to like that before. But I honestly don't know what could have happened to us if I had. Glad we didn't spend a dollar in that place, and I am posting this as a Facebook\/Yelp and whatever other kind of review possible.
