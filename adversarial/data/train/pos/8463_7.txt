If you work in customer service, there are some basics you must understand.  THE CUSTOMER COMES FIRST! THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT! THE CUSTOMER IS KING!  If you don't understand that, you shouldn't be in customer service.  I am convinced that United trains their employees to be mean and nasty, because I've never met a nice one (this does not apply to legacy Continental employees, they get it right).  I fly 60k miles per year and pay full business fare for my flights.  I expect a pleasant ticket agent.  Especially as I am a pleasant person even in the midst of cancelled flights, delays, etc.  I do not expect to hear an answer like \"I don't know, I just walked in, dear\" as an answer to one of my questions. That's unacceptable, I don't care that you just walked in.  If you don't know an answer kindly say \"I don''t know Ms CLR, let me check for you.\"  They scowl at me and they are mean at this counter and I can't handle it.  Shame on you United for not training your customer service agents better.  (Reader: if you see my scores, I rate most businesses 4s or 5s. I am an easy-to-please person.   It takes a lot to disgruntle me.  United disgruntles me)
