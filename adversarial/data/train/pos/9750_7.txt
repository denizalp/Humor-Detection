Szechuan Garden (SG) has ruined Chinese take-out for me.  You wouldn't give SG a second chance when seeing it from the outside.  It is in a location that looks like it would feature a laundromat rather than a hidden, Asian treasure.\n\nThe menu is extensive and features many fantastic vegan options.  This is a very eaters friendly place.  The portions are huge and presented beautifully (if you're eating in).  They also offer take-out.  I can't say enough about how much better this food is than most Chinese food I have eaten in restaurants before.  Their prices are just a hair more expensive than I would hope, but the portions and quality are definitely worth it.\n\nTake a look at their website.  They have a menu that you can flip the pages of!  Way fun.  Yes, I am easily amused...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.szechwan-garden.com\/
