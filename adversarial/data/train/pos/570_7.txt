One of the benefit of having a brick and mortar version of a favored online store is that you can return the items you don't want right away instead of sending it back, or exchange it for the item you want. \n\nToday I was \"helped\" by Brett. \n\nI was trying to return a hoodie that didn't fit. Everything was pretty procedural at first. Then the hiccup came where the was an issue with the return because he had thought we heavily used the hoodie, which we didn't. The only thing we did was put it on inside the house and set it down on the carpet afterwards. \n\nHe was lecturing me on the fact that he cannot accept the return due to this cosmetic flaw. I informed him this, to which he replied that he can't resell something that's been worn in the store. \n\nI told him that we had been long patrons of the band and how we owned dozens of Oakley sunglasses and never had an issue with returning a product that we tried on and did not like. \n\nHe finally gave in by saying that I had interrupted him as he was not able to compete his lecture that he be making an exception in this case. \n\nAt the end I feel that he was over compensating for his lack of knowledge and general awareness of customer service by saving face and acting as if he was planning to let me return the merchandise after all. \n\nNext time, I'll stick to shipping my returns back instead of being hassled by a self-righteous, myopic store clerk.
