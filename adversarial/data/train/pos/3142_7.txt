BEWARE THERE ARE MANY OTHER RESTAURANTS WORTH HITTING IN VEGAS \n\nToo bad you can't give zero stars. Called this place to get the cost of the cover for the Mcgregor fight and they said $32.00 and when we arrive they said $50.00\n\nThe owner is not very bright considering there was about 200 ppl standing outside watching the fight. How many drinks could he have sold? Not my business, I watched the fight for free with the crowd and the owner lost money and allowed me to have a tv on his paycheck with the match I was dying to see. At any rate the dishonesty over the phone was enough to have whoever reads this to BEWARE OF THIS BUSINESS
