A generous 1.5 stars unfortunately.  The service was good.  The atmosphere was very basic but I don't mind that.\n\nThe food was just ok and the place had an odd smell that really impacted everything.  If I may depart from plainspoken English for a moment;  \nolfaction is such an integral part of a gustatory experience that any meal can be significantly negatively impacted by the presence of unpleasant aromas in the environment.\n\nAs I was eating my eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast and being negatively impacted by the smells around me it occured to me that they are next to an animal hospital and I ate at another restaurant once that was similarly situated and I encountered a similar problem.\n\nHence, note to self:  in the future, take a pass on any restaurant in proximity to an animal hospital.
