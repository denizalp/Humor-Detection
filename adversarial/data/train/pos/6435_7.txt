I wanted  #400 to be something special, unfortunately it is not local, but it is still special.\n\nThis place has a little something for everyone.  The artifacts are most interesting, the exhibits entertaining, and the inductees film on the third floor is TOTALLY worth the price of admission.  The interactive listening exhibits are great, both the Experience the Music:  Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll and One Hit Wonders on the second level and Hall of Fame Jukebox on the 4th level.\n\nThere are a total of 7 levels to cover and because of the shape and all the glass, certain levels and sections are a bit on the toasty side.\n\nAfter your visit I am sure you can find someone who will discuss why isn't he\/she\/they in the Hall of Fame?\n\nWhat's that?  you say  .   .   .  ROCK AND ROLL IS HERE TO STAY :)
