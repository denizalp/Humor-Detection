Two things would have made it perfect:  1) Boulevard Beer on Tap (or even at all!!) 2) BAKED BEANS.  Seriously, what kind of BBQ joint doesn't serve baked beans??  Other than that, I'm totally a fan.  Prices were not crazy considering the portions.  Loved that they had kids meals which were reasonably priced. We are HUGE BBQ SNOBS from Kansas City.  We used to frequent a place Anthony Bourdain raved about on his show. Needless to say we are hard to please. My humble advice: skip Lucilles and come here. I will be back - likely during happy hour.
