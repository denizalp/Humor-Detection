Tacos El Gordo is about as authentic as you can get. I have to admit I was a bit confused on what to order, where to go and how to order because everything is in Spanish and all the employees speak mostly Spanish. But they had a greeter on the floor to help you order if you needed. \nOrdered a beef taco and carne asada fries. Both were delicious. The beef was tender and both dishes were full of flavor. The taco was a bit small. \nWould eat here lots if I lived local.
