Great Sri Lankan food. Got the fish lamprais and the string hoppers (with mutton curry). \n\nFish lamprais was great. Good combination of ingredients including the fish curry, mini fish (no idea what the correct name is), eggplant, some kind of pickle, potato, etc. Only complaint is I don't think that there was any seeni sambol (common ingredient of lamprais). Also the rice: meat ratio was higher than what I like (lots of comments mention the big size, but really a lot of it consists of rice). \n\nString hoppers were also good. In addition to the mutton curry, comes with sambol and potato. I wasn't the biggest fan of the mutton curry (quite a few pieces of fat), so I probably won't get this dish again. \n\nI will definitely return for the lamprais though. \n\nAccepts credit card\nLots of free parking
