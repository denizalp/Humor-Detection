Decent. Believe it or not they actually serve burgers, and if you are way too fragile  to handle a large helping of charred flesh ( as I was ) they do a mean chilli and some decent soups.\n\nThe service was good, but one thing I must report - they serve absolutely without question the worst bloody mary in the history of the world. Bland. Weak. Almost tastless. A shot of vodka and a splash of ketchup would be more invigorating than the pathetic excuse for a pick-me-up this otherwise fine establishment offers its hung-over patrons.
