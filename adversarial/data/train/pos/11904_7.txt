House of Tricks has a nice setting.  It also has a cute name.  I would like to know where it came from.   It is located close to ASU.  The parking is all street parking.   It is best if you make a reservation.  I did not, but was able to be seated on later side at 8:30.  It was a little frantic near the bar with servers rushing around.  I waited for my table at the bar enjoying  couple of cocktails.  Unfortunately, me and my chair were bumped into frequently by a few of the wait staff carrying the stand for their trays.   There is a lot of outdoor seating which we took advantage of on a pleasant night.  The menu at House of Tricks was pretty interesting.  My entree entree was good, a B+.  I had the beef tenderloin.  My dessert was even better.  I had the salted caramel bread pudding.  I would give that an A grade.  Our waitress was professional and very efficient.  She was one of the highlights.  I forget her name, but she was originally from Knoxville.  I would be happy to go back. However, its unlikely as I am not is Phoenix often.  Thumbs up.
