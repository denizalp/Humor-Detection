I stumbled onto King's before attending an event at CraftHaus Brewery. It was amazing because I love pierogis so I knew it would be a stop on the way out. The gal running the front of the truck was super friendly and gave me a menu to take. My order was already planned. Potato and Cheese. And the Meat pierogi. \n\nWhen we made our way back to the truck after some small beer samplings, I was saddened to learn they were out of the potato. Devastated actually. I'm still crying. The beef pierogis were incredible. Soft and tender. Served with some sour cream and caramelized onions. I enjoyed them once I got home, so even luke warm, I was in heaven. \n\nI plan on stalking this truck all around town. I will get my hands on those Potato and Cheese pierogis, if it's the last thing I do. I'll of course order the meat again too. I'm crazy like that.
