I had high hopes for this place, as I have a few friends who really love GHT...however, things didn't turn out that way.  We did the tasting menu, which is actually a good deal when you look at the pricing of the individual courses.  The highlight of the meal was the first course, with a simple grilled bread and fromage blanc.  And unfortunately, it went downhill from there.\n\nBottom line, they don't know how to cook a steak, and the food was just mediocre.  When you order a steak medium, then send if back because it is beyond rare, then it is brought back to you barely medium-rare...unacceptable.  You have to know how to cook a steak, and you have to fix it if you get it wrong.\n\nWith so many other good places in town, next time I will go somewhere that can cook a steak correctly.
