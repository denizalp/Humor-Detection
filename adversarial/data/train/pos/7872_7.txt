Horrible attitude of manager. We had a business breakfast meeting on Saturday, June 7, 2014 at 10a where we spend a good amount of money of coffee and entrees. The manager was constantly yelling to his staff to clean tables across the restaurant embarrassing the staff and other patrons as well. The icing was when the manager barked to us telling us to go somewhere else because \"this was not an office\". This was after an hour while we were still having our coffee! He had 2 waiters on our heads asking us to \" wrap up\" and leave. We collected our shred of decency and promptly left --- never to return back -- and ensuring nobody we know also does the same. The food? Meh. I can have scrambled eggs and toast in a gazillion different places. Nothing exciting here.
