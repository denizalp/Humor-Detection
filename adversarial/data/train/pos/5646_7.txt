This was our last night in Vegas and we decided to give Tryst a try... We had all been here before and agreed that the music would at least be good. We were right! The tunes were great and the DJ was on fire. We danced the night away and the club was not too packed I suppose they were all at XS crammed like a can of sardines. IT was crowded at Tryst too but I could walk to and from the dance floor to our table with ease which was a plus for me. I don't know why anyone would rather go to XS than here.\n\nOur host was super nice and we didn't wait in line at all, we were seated immediately and our host kept the unwanted guys away from our table, eventually he put a security guard at our table to keep the wolves at bay. Thank god we still have some stand up guys around.
