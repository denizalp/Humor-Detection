I'd give a zero if yelp would let me....but HOW THE HELL DO YOU TELL PEOPLE WE DONT HAVE ANY ICE?!?!?! YOU HAVE MULTIPLE ICE MACHINES AND NO ICE???? CLEVELAND WE HAVE A PROBLEM! And they slow as hell...labor is quicker than this location. Sat in drive thru for 10+ minutes with 2 cars in front of me. Once I'm able to pay, I'm told you need to wait and they fucked up my order....and took forever to give me $0.98!
