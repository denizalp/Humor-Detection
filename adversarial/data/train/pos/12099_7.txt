Took a vehicle in about month ago I found communication between staff lacking which increased my cost close to another 400 dollars. Engine light came on again they basically wanted to change parts until  the right part would keep engine light off. Independent did negotiate with me on a few things to satisfy me. I would go back for general work. But anything real technical maybe not, they might be lacking sophisticated  diagnostic  equipment  to get right the first time. So three stars it is.
