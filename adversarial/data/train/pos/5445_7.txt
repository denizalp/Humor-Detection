I will never go here again. The management is absolutely horrible. I frequently eat Indian food at various restaurants. I had never been here before so I used Alu Gobi as my \"measuring stick\". The food arrived and the dish was all wrong. I asked the waitress if why it was so different. She sent the manager out and he told me that Indian food is not Chinese food. He said \"We don't have your brown sauce.\"\n\nNever going back after that.
