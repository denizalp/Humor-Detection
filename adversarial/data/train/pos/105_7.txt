From what I've heard, Club Wanda's is considered an establishment in Montreal.\n\nMy friends and I were planning a bachelor party and were impressed by Wanda's packages and the fact that they had a nice restaurant inside their facility.  We filled out the online form months earlier, did not hear back, and followed up with two phone calls to solidify the V.I.P. Bachelor Party package (including a call less than a week before to tell them that our numbers had dropped by 1).\n\nWhen we arrived, we were taken to the main floor (rather than the V.I.P. room); as the group's leader, I informed the manager that we had booked a party and explained the details.  He took us upstairs to the V.I.P. room and said that there was a $3 cover per person (which is not atypical in most clubs).\n\nSince the package included free admission, along with a food\/drink credit, I was able to work things out between the manager and our waitress, who were very accommodating.  As it turns out, we changed our $125\/per person package (which included the free admission, along with a $125 food and drink credit per person) for a package instead that gave us a total of $1000 to spend on food and drinks for our entire party, at a special rate of $850.  This meant that we were spending a minimum of $850 and anything over would be at a discount.\n\nWe ordered a few rounds of drinks and sat down outside in the Terrance restaurant.  We ordered our entrees and split several as appetizers.  The quality of the food was excellent; I thoroughly enjoyed my salad, filet mignon, and octopus.  They gave us all chocolate mousse as a complimentary dessert and we certainly savored having an open air ambiance for our meal.\n\nAfter dinner, we went back to our V.I.P. room, but found out that we could not receive individual dances at the $10\/dance price.  Instead, we could have a dancer in the room for 30 minutes for $100 or $200\/hour.  They worked out that we could still order drinks on our ongoing tab in the V.I.P. room, but go downstairs for individual dances -- which we did.\n\nWe did some exploring in the basement and saw some pretty weird things going on, so some of the guys went for dances on a raised seating area in the main floor.  The dances were pretty lackluster and it is a no contact establishment.\n\nFollowing this, we had our final drinks and settled our bill, doing much better than if we had stayed with our original package.\n\nOverall observations:\n\n- It's strange that our reservation details were not in their system, however, they could not have been more reasonable and accommodating, something I would never expect in New York City or Las Vegas where rules cannot be amended.  This was very helpful.\n\n- Our waitress (I believe her name was Malvina) could not have been sweeter; she worked so hard and we rewarded her for taking such good care of us, bringing us drinks quickly and constantly giving me updates on how we were doing with our open tab\n\n- We were able to pay on five separate credit cards, which was very helpful given the large amount of the bill\n\n- I was disappointed with the quality of the dancers and their performances.  Wanda's is absolutely a classy joint, but I don't believe that it provided the full Montreal experience, which should not be expected in a no contact club.\n\nThis was a wonderful place to eat and drink, with prompt and impressive service; I would not go back, and don't recommend it for a bachelor party, given the other options in Montreal.
