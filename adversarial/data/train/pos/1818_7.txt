The husband is a big fan of Cole Haan.It is the quintessential wardrobe of the professional man classic and elegant.He swears by their shoes (dress shoes, oxfords, monks), belts and other leather goods.\n\nIt's the perfect combination of style and comfort.Quality is unmatched for the price point and their shoes last forever.\nThe store is neatly stacked and has some good offers.They always offer some discount even on their latest arrivals.\n\nThe only thing I would say is there was nobody at the store to offer assistance\/help.\nAlso, options are quite limited at this outlet.\n\nCheers!
