I just love their Sicilian Plate and Fattoush Salad.  I have no idea why anyone would go next door to The Pita Pit when authentic Middle Eastern food is here.  The prices are very budget friendly, service is quick and friendly.  I've never been disappointed, and it's nice to know I can rely on Dolce Wraps for  a quick, affordable, healthy and delicious meal.
