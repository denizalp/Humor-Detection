I have had Made Art Boutique on my to check out list for way too long. When doing a day of Phoenix to celebrate locally owned business for our holiday shopping, Mr. Mustachio and here were excited to check out this business.\n\nHoused in a beautiful older building, I was surprised by how little this store was-I kept peeking my head around corners thinking I had missed another room somehow.  Cool books, super condensed selection of magazines to spread out casually on your vintage coffee table when watching the latests Criterion release on your Apple, and some nice ceramic ware left me thinking....okay. \n\nWhat else?\n\nI just didn't find anything for anyone on my list (or for myself-I am a selfish holiday shopper). We must have looked around this shop four times, hoping something new would catch our eye, some art piece would scream a name, some t-shirt would deserve our 20 bucks. Nothing was over-priced, but I just didn't feel I was browsing from the creme of the crop and the jewelry didn't jump at me.\n\nI would still recommend it for gifts for a variety of ages and to support local artists, but I didn't find anything and I was looking really hard to support this store.\n\nMeh Art Boutique.
