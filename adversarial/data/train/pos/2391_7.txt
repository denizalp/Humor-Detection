Hey, do you like to eat charred tofu while listening to the Donnie Darko soundtrack? Well then I have the place for you! Quiet Storm sends out food that most chefs would lose their jobs over. I'm from a big city (New York, NBD) so I have standards and Quiet Storm managed to cross all the borders of decency. The service was good, but I guess it has to be when they have the audacity to charge $9 for a sandwich that cuts your mouth open. I think the owners hate having a business and are attempting to run it into the ground because they are not accommodating to vegans. Substituting real cheese for faux cheese is just too taxing for these world class chefs. I would recommend this for people who enjoy not finishing their meals.
