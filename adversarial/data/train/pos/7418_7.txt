I was so impressed with Dressler's.  I have been there several times and the food and atmosphere is always great.  But on the last two visits I watched as the owner John Dressler introduced himself to all the tables... shaken hands and kissin babies as I like to say.  He made his way to our table and sat for a moment. I am always so impressed when an owner is so closely involved in their business.  He made us feel very welcome.  A few days later we visited his other location in the city in the Metropolitan.  He was there on that occasion as well and again sat for a spell.  I tell you he certainly set the bar pretty high in my opinion.  Restaurant owners take note this is how you gain repeat business.  Make everyone feel like family.  Who are we kidding, there are a million great restaurants in this city so you need to go over and above in my opinion and I think they certainly do. We will be back.  I fully recommend both locations, however, I live in the Birk so you'll probably find me there.
