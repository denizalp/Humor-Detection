I have been to nearly every key buffet in Vegas, and Bacchanal rises above them all.  Bacchanal takes the Vegas buffet experience (e.g., a huge variety and selection of exotic (and familiar) cuisines) and elevates it into an amazing experience-- good ambiance, excellent decor, great service, and exceptional quality and quantity of food.  Here are some tips from my past visit to Bacchanal:\n\nNON-ALCOHOLIC DRINKS (5\/5)\n*FRESH* pomegranate, cucumber, carrot and orange juice!  WUT?!  Usually buffets give you juice syrups out of a fountain or machine.  But Bacchanal gives you *FRESH-SQUEEZED* juice that is not from concentrate!  Holla!  It's those little things that make this buffet quite exceptional.  You also have your choice in a wide variety of teas and sodas.\n\nBUFFET- VARIETY (10\/5)\nThe beginning of the buffet starts off with a kick-- SEAFOOD.  Then you'll hit a huge selection of cuisines (over 500 food items!) ranging from exotic foods (liver, braised beef tongue) to familiar foods like made-to-order burritos, pastas and \"fast food.\" They serve all types of cuisine-- Mexican, Asian, Italian, American, etc.  Right when you think you've come to the end of the buffet stations, you turn a corner and you're greeted with MORE!  M.O.R.E!! :)  Talk about splurging and taking the buffet experience to an extreme.  After you turn the corner, you'll hit the Italian and French foods, bread station and Asian foods. My jaw dropped when I saw how big Bacchanal really was, and I am very impressed with the selection of items at Bacchanal.  Well done, Caesar's Palace!  If you can keep this up (past your grand opening, honeymoon months), then you will set the bar for all other buffets to match.\n\nCRAB LEGS (5\/5)\nMost of the crab legs served at other buffets are either dinky or salty.  At Bacchanal, the crab legs are served either cold or hot, which makes all the difference.  If you ask them to make it hot, they'll put it in hot water, which gives the crab legs a tender, juicy, succulent flavor (rather than just eating cold and icy crab legs) and it doesn't taste chilled or salted at all.  What does that mean for you, my friend?  You can eat MORE crab legs!  :)  And that, my friend, makes paying $40+ worth it.\n\nDESSERTS (5\/5)\nHot chocolate, pistachio and vanilla bean souffles right out of the oven; piles of colorful French macarons; fresh creme brulee; gelato of every flavor; and choices upon choices of delicate desserts, baked goods and sweets-- this is pure heaven for any sweet tooth. \n\nCHINESE SECTION\nUsually buffets throw on some chow mein, Kung Pao chicken and xifan and call it their Chinese selection.  Here, you have legit Chinese food cooked by Chinese chefs.  You can get ginsing chicken soup (with the organic black tou ji), which takes several hours to cook and brew and is quite expensive.  You can get dim sum, baos, zong zi, noodles and a delicious array of comforting Chinese foods that definitely satisfies your Chinese food cravings.  Good job, Bacchanal!\n\nWORD OF THE DAY:  BACCHANAL\nWho said you can't learn a thing or two while reading Yelp?  Bacchanal means a drunken or riotous celebration or revelry.  In the context of Caesar's Palace and its theme, Bacchanal also refers to Bacchus, the wine god.\n\nTHE PRESS\nhttp:\/\/www.lasvegassun.com\/news\/2012\/sep\/11\/new-buffet-brings-500-menu-items-caesars-palace\/
