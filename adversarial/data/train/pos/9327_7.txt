Outback's tagline should be: because sometimes you don't want to drop $100 on yourself for a steak dinner.\n\nIt's an Outback, you know the drill. They'll bring you warm bread to start your meal. I'll eat too much of it and then be full before my meal comes. I pretty much get the same thing here every time: blue cheese wedge,  medium rare ribeye, and a loaded baked potato. It always ends up being two meals for me. Again, the bread. Carbs, I love you. \n\nFor a chain, I think they do a good job with their product, especially considering the price point. I've always had great service at this location. \n\nDon't feel like eating in public? You can order online and pickup curbside. They also do have a delivery option, check on their website to see if you're in their radius. You can also get special deals and offers by signing up for their rewards program.
