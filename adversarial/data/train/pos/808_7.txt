The restaurant is very spacious and the decor is beautiful. Every dish we had was cooked to perfection. Our server was very welcoming and attentive. Bottles of wine were half off which was nice. They also bring warm bread and olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the table. There is also a brunch menu if you are not looking to eat pasta or pizza. Def. Need to come back to try the ink pasta!!
