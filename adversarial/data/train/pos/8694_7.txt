I'm thinking...four stars. See my other Arby's review. \n\nArby's with their wide selection and superior offerings makes them the kings of the lowest end of the culinary scene. Everything they have on their wide menu shoots anything from Burger King or McDonald's or Wendy's with a buttful of buckshot in a \"git off mah propertay\" manner. \n\nReplace the ten gallon hat with a crown. \n\nYeah, I know fast food is supposed to be the devil, but someone has to review these places. lol. Arby's truly ain't bad if you're short on coin, and lots of us are these days, except in the alternate dimension of Yelp, where everyone but me seems to make $50K a year minimum.  Trapped in a world I never made?\n\nI kid the yuppies. \n\nBut I won't kid Arby's They're pretty swell for what they do. No lies.
