Sooooo... this place is so fucking lit that one Wednesday afternoon I walked in with 8 rolls of quarters and a bag of nickels. They thought I was the Prince of Dubai. \nThe amount of lap dances I got me an all expense pass to the local clinic with a full run on antibiotics to clean me out.\nNow my dry cleaner was real upset because he tried 6 times to get a stain out of my crushed velvet pants. No can do keemosaabee. \nI'll still go back. Maybe next time I'll bring some wet wipes and a break away track suit.
