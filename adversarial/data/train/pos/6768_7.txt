I saw all the reviews on this place and thought I would go here for lunch. The only bad thing I can think of is that it is too close to my work.  \nFirst thing I noticed was this place had Kim-chee, seaweed salad. and fried fish skin!!! They basically had me at hello. \nThe seafood delight is the best I have tasted from a buffet. Very well flavored and not drowning in sauce and brocolli. The stuffed crab was great and they had vegie tempura that was good too. The short ribs were well seasoned. Everything I tasted was good considering it was a buffet. The dishes were always being refilled and I never had to wait for anything. \n\nNot having too much of a sweet tooth I decided to just walk by the dessert section. Big mistake! They had nilla waffers covered with banana pudding. Can you say comfort food? So I grabbed a little and on my way back to my seat I picked up a malisada (donut) and fried banana. All was good!
