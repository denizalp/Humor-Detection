Vietnamese street food?  Yes please.  Love the Banh Mi here.  Best I've had outside of Vietnam.  I've never been to Vietnam, but strictly speaking that's still a true statement.  They're good.  Lots of great choices and a couple that I encourage you to push your comfort zone with (I'm talking about you, head cheese).  \n\nHad never had bubble tea (ti?) before this, and really enjoyed the Acia berry, black tea with tapioca pearl \"toppings\".  (I put it in quotes because...they aren't on the top.  They drop to the bottom, and every time the girl (the same energetic, friendly young lady always seems to take my order) asks me if I want toppings I freeze like a deer in the headlights until I remember she's talking about the \"bubbles\" in bubble tea (ti?).\n\nAnyway...great casual dining inside or out on the patio on Butler street.  People watching galore.
