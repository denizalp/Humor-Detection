They had a severely limited menu for fight night. Burritos were served with zero accompaniments (salsa, hot sauce, sour cream, guacamole, etc). We ordered shots and were told they didn't have basics like cranberry juice. They served us completely different shots than what we asked for and charged us the same or more for shots than we paid for full sized drinks. We stood at the bar to check on shots we had ordered 25 min previously and waited another 20 min just to get them. It's a nice looking bar in a good downtown location but I won't be visiting this place again because the service is seriously lacking.  You can get way better service, food, prices and atmosphere at other nearby bars and restaurants downtown. Very disappointed, Paz.
