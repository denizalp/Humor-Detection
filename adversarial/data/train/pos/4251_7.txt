I would love to rate this place better but my husband and I waited for any kind of service or at least an be with you in a second we never even got to sit down. Now I am a patient person since I work in the industry but when you only have one table and 3 employees helping that one table at least an acknowledgment would of been nice. Needless to say we did not stay, sad cause I really wanted to try the place.
