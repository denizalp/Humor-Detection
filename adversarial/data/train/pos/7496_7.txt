I've purchased 2 brand new cars from this dealer in recent years. Went back for the 3rd time to buy a 2015 Sonata. \"Carlos\", apparently the sales manager is a M.F, puto maricon. The WORST kind of associate a  company can have. A scumbag, rude, cocky, without manners, smartass and a racist (a fucking mexican). After deciding to leave the dealership for considering their offer wasn't my best option, Carlos approached me and \"thanked\" me for wasting my salesman's hours of his \"valuable\" time, who has kids to feed and he could not believe I'd leave the store without buying a car. I mean, WTF? \nCarlos, I hope you're reading this: You can't sell a fucking car to every person that walks in to your dealership, sabes punal?\nHe needs to go see an anger management specialist. Yelpers, if you can, stay away from this dealership, there are plenty of other Hyundai's stores in the Valley!!!
