Came in for Sunday breakfast because I enjoy watching Guy on Food Network. \n\nMinus 1 Star. They have Green Tea,  as well as several other teas, on the menu but our server told us they only have the English Breakfast Tea. As we were seated outside on a chilly Sunday morning, I was really looking forward to that green tea. I can't stand the bitter taste of English Breakfast Tea, so I got stuck with water, which I had asked with lemon and didnt receive. My husband did however get it. And when the bus boy brought out our drinks he brought a mug of hot water. No tea. WTF did you think we ordered? \n\nMinus 1 Star. Service was Slooooooow. The server was nice but took forever for him to even get our drink orders in, and bring us our check. We sat here for nearly an hour. Good thing there's a Pok√©stop nearby!\n\nMinus 1 Star. I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy. While tasty, the biscuit fell a apart whenever.l I tried to spear it with my fork. Overall it was a very messy dish. My husband ordered the shortbread pancake. Was dry (no syrup) and the berries it was stuffed with were sour. They definitely need to use rippebed produce.
