There are a few coffee places around the Arts District (and Downtown) that just don't cut the mustard. \n\nVesta does. If I refer to this place as \"Vespa\" when you are around me, I apologize, but thats what I call it :D\n\nThe shining star here for me is an unsweetened macadamia nut mylk latte. It's amazing.\n\nSecond place award goes to unsweetened matcha latte sub out the milk with the macadamia nut mylk and call it a day. \n\nTheir pour overs and coffee and nitro is simply amazing. The Donut Bar even carries their coffee!\n\nSupport a local roaster and buy local.\n\nThe service is outstanding and the owner is always in to greet you. Toast and sando menu is small and I think they should keep it that way.\n\nClean and open the place is usually packed. Not sure why people think this is hipster and overpriced. This is not a chain and fresh, quality, local ingredients represent.\n\nIf you are coming here to look for $2 coffee, skip everyone the waste of time with your \"its overpriced\" reviews. Move along because there is nothing to see here :D\n\nMacadamia Nut Latte, Matcha Latte and two bomb ass The Basic avocado toasts will run you about $30 before tip. There is your warning :D \n\nQuality vs quantity...it wins every time!
