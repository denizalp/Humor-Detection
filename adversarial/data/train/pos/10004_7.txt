Long waits to meet with the nurse (no doctors here).  Then she walks in and looks like a Colombian Hooker in a hooker outfit that some one threw a white coat on - stilleto heels, mini skirt, coke finger-nail and all.  Not Professional!\n\nShe kept telling us about the \"conservative\" in the injections.  I finally asked if she meant \"PREservative\" and she said \"oh yeah, that stuff.\"  Seriously...  RN license from a box of Cap'N Crunch?  I think so!
