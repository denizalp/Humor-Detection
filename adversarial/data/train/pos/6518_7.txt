Their ramen is a fucking joke.\n\nI won't dispense with the formalities and the usual format. Even if you have the words \"spicy ramen\" right below your \"Ramen Kobo\" name, when you have three heat options that are stronger than your so-called mild, you can't load it up so much with chili oil that it ends up being a 5 out of 10 (Thai scale) Yes, you warned each of us about the heat, but you shouldn't have to do so for something labeled as mild. You can hardly taste anything else in the broth when you turn up the heat, so why would you make such a strange spicy scale?\n\nThat is, unless you're desperately trying to cover up for other flaws. When I returned to try the same Stamina Tonkotsu ($8.95) as \"Original\" (non-spicy), I was not very pleased. Sure, the broth was creamy, but it was lacking in depth. And then they immediately failed the usual criteria when the noodles came out tasting unbelievably bland. Did they forget to salt the boiling liquid or something?\n\nThe standard ramen toppings are fine, I guess, but they don't stand out. It's not like even foie gras, caviar, and saffron would save the ramen at this point, so why should I bother describing them?\n\nFrankly, the izakaya items have some nice options and I would probably have not been so harsh with this review had their name not been Ramen Kobo. I enjoyed all of the following:\n\nTakoyaki ($6.95, 7 pieces). This is one of the better options in town, with perhaps lack of mayo actually being the only downfall if you go by my friend's experience with eating this dish.\n\nTakowasa ($4.50). Restrained wasabi flavor coating fresh, raw octopus pieces. Almost something you'd expect at Hachi or another dedicated izakaya.\n\nKaraage ($4.95). Juicy and crispy. I liked it despite it being rather greasy and a touch too salty.\n\nKonbu Umami Tofu ($3.95). Soft tofu. The sauce spoke to me, although it started to screech when I took a sip and got way too much salt. If I hadn't had a bite with less sauce, I would be completely turned off from reordering it.\n\nI was not impressed with the other izakaya though. They had varying degrees of flaws:\n\nChashu Pork Buns ($5, 2 pc). The ramen-sliced pork were too thin. The buns were a little overdone. It tasted fine, but nothing with those components or the sauce made this a flavor standout.\n\nFrench Fries ($3.50). Small portion, but I would've still approved had they been fluffy rather than mushy inside.\n\nShrimp Shumai ($4.95, 3 pc). Too mushy and accompanied by a dense-in-flavor mustard sauce. Take too large a portion and you'll be out for the rest of the meal.\n\nIkayaki ($6.50). The worst offender of all. The squid was almost completely devoid of flavor aside from for the grill marks. Had they added any sort of salt - seriously, this issue again? - the portion and the texture would've likely made it one of the best apps here.\n\nService and kitchen speed were both good, but what's the point of getting your food quickly if half of it isn't worth eating?\n\nThey should know better if this is really the second Ramen Kobo and the same ownership as Monta, but this is the worst ramen restaurant in Las Vegas other than Ichiddo, and I've tried most of them. I should also note that Las Vegas is a worse ramen scene than SoCal and I don't even have any bowls under my belt from Japan, so take this as a scathing critique of the worst of the worst and don't come here unless you really want to try some octopus.
