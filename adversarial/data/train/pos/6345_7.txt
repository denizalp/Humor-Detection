Came here while on a trip to Vegas...worst decision for my night..The decor could have been good, it's a fun concept but is destroyed by employees\/owners. All that were working were 2 waitresses at the bar in makup, a sound guy in makeup and the owner... I met the owner and it was unfortunate, a cocky, non greatful man in a wife beater, yah its hot out but it's also a restaurant put some clothes on..\n\n The drinks were horrible, main complaint. I ask for Jager drinks and they try to sneak harlem by me telling me it is jager.. No need to lie if you dont carry it or if it is too expensive for your location..\n\nThe macaroni salad was small and had horrible dressing, like the cheap stuff bought at a grocery store..\n\nMusic: The bands were old and the crowd was their old wifes...
