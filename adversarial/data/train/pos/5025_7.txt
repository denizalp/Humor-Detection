It was the night before Thanksgiving and my pantry was bare...\nAnd I wasn't quite ready to get in my family's hair...\nSo I drove into Middleton to see what sounded yummy....\nI stopped at Quaker Steak & Lube for something for my tummy.\n\nI knew poultry would be eaten the very next day,\nSo I ordered a steak without much delay.\nMy server was nice, maybe over aware...\nBut the steak was cooked nice, Medium Rare.\n\nI had a baked potato and salad, as my two sides.\nI ordered their onion rings, they were a mighty big size.\nThe cold brew that I ordered was a pleasant treat\nTo help me wash down that nice piece of meat.\n\nThe downfall was that I wanted a table, but also TVs.\nI was surrounded by tables full of families.\nI would have been better served in the bar.\nI will remember that the next time this spot is on my radar.
