Affordable, traditional eats with great value make Cuff an accessible spot that's woefully overlooked.\n\nThe eats are predominately American, with accessible sandwiches like burgers (which are good) and eggplant parmesan (which was really good), but with a southwestern (Tequila-lime fish tacos, posole) and Louisianan (Cajun fries, Po' Boys, Grits) flair. \n\nThe happy hour is absolutely solid! You can grab some lunches on the cheap. I'm talking 8-10 bucks for a sandwich and fries, which aren't mind-blowing but still felt like a steal for the quality you're getting. The happy hour alone makes Cuff worth it.\n\nOne can also spy a modest cocktail menu to wash these down with. I'd enjoyed one featuring gin and thyme. While refreshing and well-presented, it lacked the complexity to make it a true premium beverage. You can't just throw sprigs of stuff in there...you kinda have to muddle it or something, ya know? Take it to the next level. \n\nI do like this place, but I think my four stars is going to be more of a reflection on value than quality. Still not a place to overlook if you're in downtown Glendale.
