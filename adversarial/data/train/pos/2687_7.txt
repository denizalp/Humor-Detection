Bueno Burger is doing some great advertising lately, taking full advantage of ValPack, etc to get the word out about their neat concept of mesquite grilled burgers and dogs,but if you live anywhere nearby, the scent of the burning wood alone has already piqued your attention.\n\nSometimes it's possible to create expectations that are tough to live up to.  \nThe air smelled great, but the burger itself just didn't seem to hang onto all of the flavor generated by the smoke while grilling.  It wasn't anything that was bad about it, but it just wasn't as exciting as i wanted it to be.\nI enjoyed it enough that i know i'll take advantage of a coupon and give it another go.
