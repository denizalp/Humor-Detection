I like Mac's especially their South Blvd location.  What I don't like is the hightop wood stools--grossly uncomfortable.  Even though we arrived at 11:40 a.m. our request for table seating was denied since it was just two of us.     Arghhh.\n\nOur wings were good as was the green bean casserole (that recipe is worth stealing); however, the mac-n-cheese and onion rings were duds lacking depth of flavor and love.  Skimpy and wimpy.\n\nI'm going to nit-pik, but I hate the aluminum serving trays and containers.  It reminds me of  feeding our dogs when I was kid--everytime.  I just cannot escape the look and feel.  As soon as my food is plopped down I want to whistle and say, \"Barney and Dutchess, time to eat.\"\n\n3 stars for decent smoky wings, but the hard-ass stools, mediocre sides, and the dog trays whisper just loudly enough \"keep searching.\"
