I have got to say my family, and i come here a lot. which we were just here last weekend, and i must say you can still order off the menu, and no its not a child size portion. my mother got the chicken cordon blu which it isn't on the menu, but they still gave it to her, and its adult size. the food here is great i love when we come here. i would like to try their fish, but always last minute i change my mind, and get my usual. i saw some negative reviews about this place, but i am certain nothing has changed since they got their new menus. the service is great we can't complain about that, and the food is very good. our server that we usually have is always on top of her game. its reasonable too its not over priced like some of these places that people go to. its very clean, and food is always good, if you're looking for a place to take your family, and not worry about food quality i suggest going here.
