I am not of Indian descent (can you tell?). I can't speak to its authenticity or proper level of spiciness. But in my non-professional opinion, 259 Host is the Host with the most...average tasting food. I've been to the Host in Markham (same owner) for dinner, and I still find some of the dishes memorably delicious. Lunch at 259 Host will probably be forgotten. \n\nWe were off to a good start with the Samosas from the regular menu, which were crispy, slightly sweet, and very tasty. Then, most of us progressed to ordering off the set menu, which was made up of different \"Thali\" ($15-$17) - lunch sets with various dishes. I had the Chicken Thali, which included: \n\n1) Tandoori Chicken - deliciously cooked and was a good size. \n2) Curry Chicken or Chicken Tikka Masala - Chicken Tikka Masala was kind of watery and not very flavourful. \n3) Chana Masala - cooked chickpeas in some sort of thick sauce. Wasn't a fan.\n4) Naan and a thin crispy flatbread - delicious without being too salty (which was my experience with the crispy flatbread in other restaurants). \n5) Salad and rice - Salad had no sauce, just a pile of greens. Rice was ordinary Jasmine rice. \n6) Gulab Jamun - really really sweet dough soaked in syrup. It wasn't a big piece so it ended up being an enjoyable end to a hearty meal. \n\nIt could be a lunch vs. dinner thing and it could be a set menu vs. regular menu thing, but nothing really stood out to me. Some of the items were great, others were meh. However, eating average food in a beautiful space definitely elevated the experience. I guess the $$$ they charge is being spent on superior decor, which I can't blame them for. I didn't feel the heat of the high prices as much as some other reviewers, but I also agree that this is definitely a Westernized and fancy...fied (to be made fancy?) version of a cuisine that is otherwise very casual. \n\nDisclaimer, my coworker who is of the proper descent says this place isn't very good in the flavour department. If a spice-averse person like me thinks some of the food wasn't that flavourful, then it's really not a surprise. Just FYI.\n\n(85\/100) - 2016
