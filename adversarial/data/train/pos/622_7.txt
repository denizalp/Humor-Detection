This is such a cool little place, just about hidden in a little building in a crappy part of downtown Phoenix. It is one of those tiny little diners, with GREAT food. I am so happy one of my co-workers convinced me to try it out. Expect a wait if you go during peak hours. The simplicity of the menu, and the great food it worth the wait though.\n\nNot sure why some of you had such a bad experience... Maybe it's because you went in the summer, I would venture to say that any place that small and that busy would suck in the heat.
