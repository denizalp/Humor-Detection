Was meeting up with some friends for dinner and Manuel's was the place picked so off to dinner we went!\n\nAfter checking out the menu, I went with the Pollo Especial. It was a deep-fried burrito with shredded chicken and green chili inside topped with a green chili sauce, cheese and jalapeno cream cheese sauce and came with a side of beans & rice.\n\nThe burrito was good, chicken was tender and moist, not dried out, I really could have done with out the beans and rice. The only complaint I have, and its not really one but for me it is , the burrito is cut into 3 pieces, instead of leaving it whole. I don't know why that is done but they are all served that way. I just don't like it haha \n\nService was friendly and fast and our server was great, she kept on top of the refills and on whatever needs anyone had.\n\nHad a good dining experience, I am sure I will be back.
