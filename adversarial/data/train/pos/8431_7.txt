No. Absolutely not and never again.\n\nTo get from their car-park to your hotel room, it takes you 15 minutes + walking at a swift pace. But the worst?!\n\nI cannot seriously believe this... Bouchon (their restaurant, inside their hotel) charges you $20 for charging dinner to your room in the Venetian as a \"Rm Chg Grat\". They also explicitly say \"GRATUITY NOT INCLUDED\" causing you to tip again.\n\nSo I paid $40 in tips on a $95.50 bill, for a very average steak, a very bad Old Fashioned, and bad to terrible service. Never again!\n\nI also waited for 10+ minutes to have them finalize the bill upon checkout, after which the lady said sheÂ´d email it to me... which of course never happened (likely because of the above).\n\n$330 per night for a suite with this level of service is beneath unacceptable!
