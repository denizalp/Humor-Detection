Nearly every BJJ and submission grappling tournament held in this entire state takes place in the good 'ole 'Sports Center of Las Vegas'. Why not somewhere nicer? Don't ask. \n\nGood:\n*Parking is free. \nAnd that sums it up.\n\n\nBad: \n*Lines of sight are absolute shit.\n\n*Very few power outlets for charging electronics that will be in need of being charged when being at a day-long tournament.\n\n*Not enough restrooms. Not nearly enough. I do not want to get gross so I will leave it at that. \nPRO TIP: Bring babywipes. Hover.\n\n*Their recent (Spring 2013) policy obsession with enforcing\/trying to enforce no outside food\/drink. Look man, people are competing. You think they do not require special food or drinks? Your shitty food stand with inedible pizza and hotdogs and cornchips is not going to cut it. Get real. \nPRO TIP: Bring in outside food and drink in a large closed bag, say like a gigantic zippered-shut sports bag or military assault pack. They do not possess the time, manpower, or patience to go through any bags so they just turn you away if you have something in hand or in a shopping bag. \n\nI will say that their property manager or whoever it was that was there on that day laying down the law did reasonably help me out during the Las Vegas Open. Extra star for that.  - E
