The Palazzo is a beautiful hotel on the northern side of the Vegas Strip with a gorgeous interior and wonderful rooms. It's the perfect place for those who want to splurge a little bit more on something fabulous for their stay.\n\nTo start off with, the basic rooms are suites and everything is just so luxurious. We booked the standard room which came with two queen beds plus an additional sofa area with remote controlled window shade. Yeah, that was pretty awesome to wake up to. Just push a button from your bed and watch the drapes slowly part letting in the bright Vegas sun. I also loved the giant bathroom with jacuzzi tub and separate glass shower plus the flat screen in there. \n\nFor the gamblers on here, their casino floor was also great too. I ended up winning over $300 at the craps $15 table within an hour and the dealers were so nice. Hell they were rooting for me, haha. And unlike some casinos it's not as much of a maze where you can constantly get lost... always a plus.\n\nOn our Friday evening there, plans for a catered dinner fell through so we resorted to ordering room service from Palazzo. I must say it was the best room service food I have ever had. We ordered the bruschetta, Caesar salad, two pastas plus a chicken dish. The meal was served within 45 minutes and tasted so home made. Fresh butter, basil, Marzano tomatoes, al dente pasta, pork ragu- the works!!! This has definitely forever raised my standards for room service food! I couldn't get enough of the pasta and actually ate more of it when we came back that evening at 2 something in the morning. Yes it was still good and no I'm not worried about food poisoning. I also loved the bruschetta. Ok my mouth just filled up with saliva so I'm going to stop writing about it now.\n\nOverall a fabulous choice for my friend's bachelorette weekend. It was a real treat.\n\nOh and thank you to the mysterious stranger who picked up the rest of our room charge. It was VERY much appreciated by all of us! :)
