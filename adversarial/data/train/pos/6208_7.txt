Heard about this place thru my fianc√©. As a person who love sweets, I wanted to give a try. Ordered the butter pecan frosting on a cinnamon roll with bananas and thought it was ok. Didn't think the frosting tasted like butter pecan or did the cinnamon roll taste like a cinnamon roll. The frosting actually had a overpowering flavor that taste of chemicals. Didn't watch  the shark tank episode when this company appeared on, so I didn't know it was all vegan til I looked it up. I'm not vegan so I'll stick with the eggs and milk they put in at Cinnabon
