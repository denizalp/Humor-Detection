Yay! I'm a fan. I am just going to have to regulate myself :D\n\nGreeted with a friendly hello :D hubby and I were then dizzy with all of the sugar beauties in the case.\n\nLooking a little clueless a young lady asked if we had ever tried their tres leches...\nNope but we want to...\n*heads still spinning dizzy with excitement*\n\nShe actually pulled out a small cup and stuck a fork in it and handed to us!!!! Now that is customer service! After oooooing and ahhhhhhing over said tres leches we were ready to order :D\n\nHubby and I are chocoholics and we spotted the brownies right away.\n\nI ordered a mini cannoli (I HAD to try one) and three brownies...a regular, a cream cheese and a peanut butter. (see pic)\n\nI came home and popped them into the fridge (see I was hiding them from myself already :) and a few hours later I remember those sugar babies in the fridge :)\n\nThe mini cannoli was perfect and I like how there were mini chocolate chips on each end instead of it being dipped. Perfect.\n\nThe cream cheese brownie was yummy. The cheesecake like flavor of the cream cheese near the top area of the brownie was perfect.\n\nAnd now for my favorite......THE PEANUT BUTTER BROWNIE!!!!! Call me crazy but this is the best thing since sliced bread. No Skippy yucky on this baby! Soo yummy and just the perfect combination! \n\nHubby stole the regular brownie (it was MIA) so I did not get to taste it but I'm assuming the batter is the same as the other two I took a nibble of. :D\n\nThese brownies are NOT \"cake like\" they are fudgy. When I say that I mean they are more like fudge. More yummy chocolate than sugar too. \n\nI have to seriously blank this place out of my head because it's close to our house and I'm scared...very scared :D\n\n*jumps on my elliptical*
