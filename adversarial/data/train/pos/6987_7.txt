one time while walking by I heard\n\n\"he didn't tip you? you should go back there and beat the shit out of him\"\n\nthat pretty much sums up the personality of this place, very easy going and very \"if you don't like it, leave\". \n\nI ate here a few times, Big kahuna burger every time. Don't expect any manners with your meal (I'm not complaining, that's how they are) but it should be a tasty massive greasy burger, that's what dangerous dans does and they don't try to hide anything, you have to respect that.\n\nThey aren't really my thing but wow, they make some crazy shit here.
