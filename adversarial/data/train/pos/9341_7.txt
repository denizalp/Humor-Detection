After a choppy flight, losing my luggage, I spent the first night sleeping in my travel clothes...yuck.  American Airlines brings my bags to the hotel, and a Sudan-Charlotte (that's what he told me at least) bellhop delivers the luggage to my room.\n\nBellhop: Whoa.\n\nMe: Sup?\n\nBellhop: Oh my god...where are you from?\n\nMe: San Francisco.\n\nBellhop: No, no, no.  Before that!\n\nMe:  Oh ok...LA.  That's in California.\n\nBellhop:  No I mean...I've never seen someone so dark with your kind of eyes.  \n\nMe:  Oh, this is how we all look in California.  \n\nBellhop:  Ahhhh...interesting.  \n\nI had to give him a bigger tip for that one.  \n\nMy room had a jacuzzi in the bedroom.  If i only had a posse and a party to go with it, it would be pretty hot.  Large rooms, clean, nice layout.  \n\nThe shuttle drivers are cool.  People are really nice in Charlotte.
