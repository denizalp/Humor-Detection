I wouldn't have found this spot if my friend hadn't flaked on me.  We were supposed to eat oysters at the Orleans, but exhusband had to ruin our plans.  The good thing about this is that I was able to eat here at Sushi 21.  My favorite sushi chef was here and didn't realize it till I walked in.  They don't have the ALL YOU CAN EAT, thank God!  I think that defeats the purpose of appreciating the taste of sushi.\n\nI had started out with the Edemame and Soft Shell Crab.  An awesome choice as the crab was cooked just perfectly.  The sauce they combine it with is perfect.  The Edemame is good for two people.  One person couldn't eat all that unless they were eating for two.  I only had one roll of sushi called Route 21.  I forgot what was inside it, but I would order it again when I come back.  It didn't even need any wasabi or soy sauce or ginger for that matter.  \n\nService was great especially from the Sushi Chefs.  The ladies are very prompt with the drinks and what ever it is you need.  The food is prepared perfectly.  I am definitely gonna go back here again.
