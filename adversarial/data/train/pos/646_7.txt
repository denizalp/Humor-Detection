New store, with horrible service! \n\nStaff is not trained making for long waits for food. Sometimes  drive thru is 10-15 waiting cars, and some drivers park and walk inside to see why the delay. We have gone there a few times because it is close by, hoping it would get better - not so far. Long waits, staff always asking manager how to do things like gift cards or coupons or even how to make a certain food item. \n\nLast visit there we had some Del Taco gift cards to use, they would scan them and say they were empty of value. So we unwrapped a NEW unused gift card and same thing. When manager finally bothered to come help, she said computer not accepting gift cards, voided our order, and basically said 'too bad, so sad, go away'. A fine way to treat senior citizen customers.\n\nBy the way, calls to Del Taco headquarters at 800-852-7204 have not been responded too - this store is a DISASTER.
