came here for the annual Lee's Liquor Wine event!\n\nthey made a really good choice in choosing this venue to host the event this year\nfirst of all, the parking was easy, plenty of spots, not too far, and of course FREE\nwalking up to the entrance, it was organized well, didn't have to wait in line, just got wrist band and in we went!\n\nthe layout of this year's event was nicely planned\ntasting stations all along the concourse walkway, which allowed for good traffic flow and avoided unnecessary crowding for the most part\n\nthe wines were mainly around this walkway, with a few other types of liquor mixed in here and there, and booklets were provided to write down notes on the tastings, which was a good idea, until you got a bit hammered, then it became pointless :-)\n\nthere was a nice breakout section where they hosted most of the non-wine liquors!\nwe probably spent a bit too much time here, guzzling.....I mean sampling vodkas, gins, bourbons, scotches, rums and everything in between!\n\nplenty of water was provided to rinse your glass between pours, and there were various noshing stations....nothing spectacular, but reasonably priced, and just something to soak up the alcohol!\n\nyear after year i keep telling myself to pace....but like a kid in a candy store, that goes right out the window once you are in!\n\nI give kudos to Lee's for the planning of the event this year, great choice, I hope they continue to host the event here in the future!
