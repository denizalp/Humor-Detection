The majority of the reviews on this place are accurate.  Its overrpiced and stuffy.  \nThe atmosphere is nice if they didnt over crowd.  If you are a attractive male who looks like he has money they you will get alot of attention by the bottle service borderline \"escort\" like server girls.... who will basically ignore you if you are female.  \nHonestly.. dont bother.. there are far better places to go with friendly staff and not as stuffy!
