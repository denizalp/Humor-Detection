I am in awe of this lounge! It's just so beautiful. \nAll the white and gold makes me feel so fancy! I came in on a Monday and there was only one other party at the bar. I'm not complaining, it made for some very personalized service and amazing drinks! \nThe bartenders were really cool, cracked some good jokes and made some killer drinks! The is totally my kind of place. I didn't get a chance to try the apps but when I come back it's at the top of my list! \nThe Yelp check-in deal makes having drinks here all the more sweeter. BOGO!! \nThe Mexican vacation had me feeling like I was on the  beach in Cancun! It was fruity but light and was  too pretty to drink! I did anyway and fell in love! \nFizz is worth checking out! Those drinks will have me coming back every time I'm in town!
