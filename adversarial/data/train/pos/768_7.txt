I really hate walking out of a place knowing that I can't give them anything more than a 1-star but when you experience such poor customer service, I simply can't justify giving them anything higher.\n\nAs a customer, I tend to not appreciate being told what I like and what I don't like... I think I know better than anyone... so when I'm told by the \"hired help\" that, the reason why they don't sell feather pillows is because nobody likes them, it's not quite factual. I happen to love feather pillows. In fact, the last set of pillows I had were my first down filled pillows and it made me wonder why I had deprived myself all my life.\n\nWell, it was time to go buy a new set so off to Sleep Country I went, figuring that they would have a wonderful selection.\n\nNot a feather pillow to be found... because apparently, it's not what I really want. \n\nRight.\n\nI have to say, with the attitudes I experienced from the two men in this store, I wasn't surprised at all that the place was empty.\n\nI ended up going to Home Outfitters, where they carry all the same brands for a lot less money.... but, they also have a large selection of beautiful down filled fluffy pillows! Sure, I still ended up paying nearly $100 (on sale from $189) per pillow but I am extremely happy with my purchase and I received great customer service.\n\nSorry Christine Magee, but this is a perfect example of why I'd buy my mattress (and pillows) anywhere else.
