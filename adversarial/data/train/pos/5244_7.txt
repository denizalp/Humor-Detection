Chuck E Cheese....not for the faint of heart.  It's a mad house at these places and this one is right in line with that line of thinking.  Thank God they serve beer (even though you can only have 2 small ones and only 1 within an hour).  But the real reason you come here obviously is for the kids and kids love tokens and they love those little tickets.  Oh, and forget about the food, ugh, nasty.  If you are lucky enough to drop $50 and get 100 tickets you too can have a pencil sharpner, 4 stickers and a mini slinky. :)
