I get it. No one is really a fan of the days you take your car in for service, but we all know it's a necessary annoyance. That being said I feel as though I am showing up at an entirely different service department than fellow reviewers. \nI showed up today without an appointment and with the hopes that I could get an oil change after coming home from a road trip. I was greeted almost immediately by an advisor. I was willing to schedule an appointment for a later date if necessary but Mark Guilfoile got me in and out in under an hour.  All my previous dealings here have been just as painless and Mark was friendly and funny. \nNow on my second Toyota I will continue to come here and I will make it a point to deal with Mark.
