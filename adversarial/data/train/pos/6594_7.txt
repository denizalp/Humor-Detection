While i was checking out the container park the aroma of barbecue immediately caught my attention.  The restaurant has a banner in the front stating ,\"2014 Best BBQ in Las Vegas\" but that must've been self-proclaimed.\n\nThe menu is a bit confusing and the choices seem really limited which work for some places but definitely not here.\n\nFood:  I got the ribs because lets face it, bbq = ribs.  Plus if you're going to endorse your restaurant as the best bbq in las vegas you better have some great sauce and tender juicy meat to go along with it.... NOPE!  The meat was dried throughout the rib and I was chewing on it like a piece of beef jerky.  The potato salad tasted like the ones you buy from Albertsons but spoiled.  The pork and beans weren't too bad but really that's not going to bring me back here.\n\nOverall: This place has the dryest, most flavorless ribs i've ever had... I love barbecue and have had my share of barbecue all around and this is the absolute worst.  Don't let the aroma fool you, do not eat here!
