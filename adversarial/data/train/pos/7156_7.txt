Being faux Mexican, I clearly asked three workers if they had tripas tacos and all three said yes.  I tried to speak with my best accent possible to say tripas and what I got was a fried carnitas taco for $4.  It was okay but never had my tacos deep fried before and disappointed it was not tripas.  I came in because they bragged on their sign \"real Mexican food made by real Mexicans\".  Figured real Mexicans would know what tripas were but these must have been Mexicans from North Las Vegas instead.
