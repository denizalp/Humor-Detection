[LOCATION] - 4\/5\nThis place is located on Rodick Rd. and Hwy 7 inside the food court at First Markham Place. Parking spots near the entrance are limited during peak hours \n\n[SERVICE] - 4\/5\nStaff were friendly and the cashier informed us our order would be ready within 5 minutes. \n\n[DÉCOR] - 3\/5 \nPlenty of seating in food court, during non-peak hours. Average tables and chairs.\n\n[QUALITY] - 4\/5\nPretty good quality for a Chinese-style crêpe from a food court at the price. \n\n[ORDER] - 4\/5\n- Strawberry Crêpe with Ice Cream and Whipped Cream - $4.99: crêpe was warm and had more of an egg flavour than traditional French crêpes. Ice cream was average (there were no ice crystals or anything funky), and strawberries were fresh. \n\n- Taro Milk Bubble Tea - $2.50: Taro milk had the perfect amount of sweetness, and was quite refreshing. They had an extensive selection of bubble tea flavours, and includes tapioca, all for $2.50 each! It definitely satisfied my craving for bubble tea. \n\n[OVERALL] - 4\/5\nThe crêpe was a nice treat, but the bubble tea is the selling-point for this place. Overall, Tasty House is my go-to spot for bubble tea at a super low price.
