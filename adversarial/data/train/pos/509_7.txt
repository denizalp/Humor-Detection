Horrible!!! Never riding this coaster again! Start of our fantastic relaxing Vegas vacation......do some shopping, relaxing and not thinking about work, of course gambling, get fatter with all the delicious restaurants, getting tipsy at the fancy bars, beautiful people watching, did I mentions gambling?....and tthhheenn thought to do something different and fun.....ROLLER COASTER!!! WORST-DECISION-EVER!!! \n\nSo it begins, I go purchase the \"fun book\" or something like that which included the coaster tickets. Headed straight to the line. Didn't have to wait too long, SCORE. Now I think about it, maybe I know why now. Anyways, got in our seats. Double check the harness....and hhhheeerrreee we gooooo! Started off nice and smooth. Wind in my hair. Fun! Then that first turn....WTF?!? Okay, that was a first. Was like my head and shoulders were being pushed down my spine. Can handle.....just weird. Next turn, same thing....wwwhhhaaattt?!? Okay, hoping it gets better. NOPE! Just got worse to unbearable! With each turn and then the loop it was a torture chair.  Worse then going through Eli Roth's Goretorium (just kidding, that's another review....but maybe not because it's closed now). My head was like a pinball getting extra points with each smash from side to side. Felt like my brain was being shaken up in my skull! First roller coaster ever, to make me want the ride to end! My partner in crime even had to go to a chiropractor when we got back home because he was in so much pain! Found it he had whiplash from riding this coaster of pain! Just hearing the coaster from our hotel room made us shrivel in pain! HEED MY WARNING......JUST-DON'T-DO-IT!!!
