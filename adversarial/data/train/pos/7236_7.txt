Not a lot of people know about this place because it's so small, but it's really a hidden gem!\n\nI always come here for lunch but I usually get takeout because once again this place is tiny. \nThey serve pretty good food but I only ever get their bento or ramen so I'm not sure about their sushi :$\n\nThe bentos are a super good price for only $7 (comes with soup and salad as well)! My favourite is the Japanese fish bento because it's just amazing! YOU MUST TRY IT. They make their own secret sauce for the fish bento and burger and it's basically heaven on earth. \nI've tried their ramen and curry before too and they were all delicious! Soup base for ramen was a little too salty though so I prefer their curry udon more. \n\nThe location is very convinient for me and they also do delivery, but only for close distances. Otherwise, I think they charge you $10 (?)\n\nIf you do decide to dine-in, you get free unlimited iced tea! Service is decent, but don't expect too much. The owner, Tim, is really friendly too so it's nice chatting with him sometimes (even though he doesn't remember me lol).\n\nOverall, you get really delicious food for a super good price! You also get a discount if you order takeout and pay in cash, so make sure you give this place a try! REMEMBER, YOU MUST TRY THE FISH BENTO. YOU MUST.
