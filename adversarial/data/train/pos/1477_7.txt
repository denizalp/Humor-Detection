The hotel is connected to the Mandalay bay. Just don't confuse the check in because they have separate check in and valet parking. Everything else is connected. \n\nThe rooms here are different than the rooms at Mandalay bay. I recommend both. The benefit of the hotel is that it is pet friendly. \n\nThis is my go to casino and hotel in Vegas. I love the fact that they don't just have a pool...they have an entire beach. My family loves to spend our summer here enjoying the wave pool and the lazy river. \n\nFor the wave pool you need to meet a certain hight requirement. I believe it is around 48 inches but don't quote me on that. I know my kindergarten son does not meet it yet, but my ten year old has for a few years. \n\nThe lazy river is great because you can bring your own tube. Don't try to bring a huge lounge float. That just isn't going to pass. If you buy a tube they are about 20 dollars. \n\nThe hotel is amazing. It is so clean and everything smells like vanilla and coconut. I love it. The suites are what I stay in because I like having a separate sleeping area. Having a bedroom door makes me feel at home. I enjoy two rooms. \n\nI never see the old scummy people gambling here. It's higher class of people.
