I've been in vegas a few years now renting and i'm ready to buy.  I've never had a harder time getting in to see units available than I did at Sky.  I'm generally pretty good at ignoring the people showing me the units\/houses, whatever but this time was different.  Whoever is in charge of the sales\/leasing team here should clean house and start over.\n\nI dropped by and picked up a card from the gate while on lunch one day.  Tried to call the number and it never worked.  Finally had to look up a different number on the website and finally got hold of someone who told me their phone system was being changed or something and that was the issue.  She was really nice.  \n\nI wish it was her showing the units instead of the Housewive's of Orange county chick that showed up 45 minutes late to our appointment.  The front desk had to call her to tell her I was there.  Not only that but she lied and said she called me on the phone to tell me she had an emergency dentist appointment (I never received any call from her and told her that - to which she said nothing LOL).  Completely unprofessional.\n\nThis aside, the point of this review is the units and the amenities.  I looked at approximately 6 units.  I found them to be really uninspiring.  Some of the views were nice but anything facing north and east had views of the unfinished Fountainebleau building which is a complete eyesore.\n\nThe amenities I thought were lacking too.  The gym is tiny for a building this size, calling it a \"full sized gym\" in my opinion is inaccurate...one star for the pool which is nice but nothing really to write home about.\n\nI also noticed while we were going up and down in the elevator that other tenants were having trouble getting their pass keys to work in the elevator.  The agent seemed surprised when I asked to see the parking area...yes if someone is going to spend $500k+ they may want to see where they're parking before they move in...\n\nThere was one unit for that the agent told me may be coming available within a few days with a floorplan I may have been interested in.  She told me she would let me know either way if it was going to come available.  It is now 6 weeks later and I never heard from her.\n\nIt's OK, I wasn't really interested anyway =(
