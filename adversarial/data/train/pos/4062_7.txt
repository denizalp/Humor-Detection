New York - New York has a really fun and energetic casino, I had a blast even though I didn't do very well at the tables, though I did win some cash playing the Dark Knight slot machine.  \n\nThe beaty music and city ambiance gives the place a youthful vibe that is palpable and contagious, plus it doesn't smell like piss.  It's also one of the better casinos to still have $5 blackjack, and did I mention there's a Dark Knight slot machine? It's not the slot machine you deserve, it's the slot machine you need.
