Chef on Call is Da Real MVP.\nAwesome food, Best : Chicken tenders, Oh So Crispy, Buffalo wrap. Definitely would Recommend the Big Willy From Philly as well. Be sure to add a Oreo or Reese's Pieces Milkshake and a Cookie. But if you're really feeling dirty, try the Deep Fried Mars Bar. \nI should explain the 4\/5 instead of the 5\/5.\nRemoved 1 star because 1 time out of 5 their delivery is below par.\nTo sum things up. If you're drunk, Chef on Call, If you're hungry, Chef On Call, If you have exams and need comfort food, You guessed it. Chef On Call.
