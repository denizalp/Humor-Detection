He was HORRIBLE. He was hired for a small wedding reception in a suite at a vegas hotel. He spent 1\/2 the time chatting in the corner with a bridesmaid, and when he actually attempted- and I use the term loosely- to do some tricks, he did the SAME 3 tricks OVER AND OVER... We had expected more \"group\" interactions- engaging in the small crowd, but he just did table side tricks like what you would see at Red Robin on kids night. He was asked to announce the bride and groom in an interesting way, and did NOTHING special. Paid WAY TOO MUCH for this guy. Definitely should have spent more to have the Elvis impersonator longer and just delete this guy all together. Super disappointing.
