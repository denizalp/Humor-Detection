High pressure salespeople. Very awkward, ended up buying a suit I felt terrible wearing, that didn't fit well. Tried to return the next day. They don't do returns. After pleading with them they offered me credit. I don't really want anything from there, so now I have a few hundred dollars to this dinosaur of a store.
