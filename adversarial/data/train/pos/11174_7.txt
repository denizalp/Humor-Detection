Great service. Waitress, Kimberly, seated us and took our drink order right away. She let us choose where to sit and was friendly the entire time. Also, very efficient and checked in at the right times. Menu is expansive with great choices. The mozzarella sticks were tasty and came with meat sauce so make sure to say no meat in the marinara if you can't have it. I personally like meat sauce. We also ordered fries for $1.99 extra with the appetizer (mozzarella sticks) and they gave us a lot of fries! Fries were tasty, too. We also ordered the gyro sandwich with onion rings. Onion rings are delicious! Top 3 I've tasted. The gyro meat was really good with crispy edges and the pita bread was also tasty and butter toasted. We will definitely come back. Service from Kimberly=5 and food from cooks=5.
