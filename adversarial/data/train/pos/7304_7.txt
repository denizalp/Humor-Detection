Maybe it's me but my experience here didn't leave me longing to come back anytime soon. What it did leave me with is a sense of wondering how it stays open. We were there on a hot evening right after dinner time. Isn't that prime time for these kind of places? Yeah, that's what I thought. We were the only ones there. Ok, that means no wait. \n\nBut to be honest, none of the flavors on tap appealed to me. And when I did make a choice it wasn't very rich in flavor. Neither was my wife's. I'm used to more intense flavors that don't leave you wondering what you're eating. I don't embrace loading up your frozen yogurt with chocolate chunks or Reese's pieces or whatever else it is they have sitting there to doctor it up. I want my frozen treat to stand on its own. This didn't. And at a price of nearly $10 a pound it just doesn't seem worth it. Not that I wish them ill will but they shouldn't plan on counting me as a repeat customer. But I encourage you to go. Take the family.
