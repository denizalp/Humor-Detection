THE ANGELS SANG AND JESUS WEPT! Or if you prefer BUDDHA ASKED FOR SECONDS! This place is crazy good, it actually made me sign up for yelp to write this review (way easier than screaming from the mountain top). I had the Asian chopped vegetable salad and crushed it before I got the chance to snap a pick. It gave my tongue a titty twister, best pile o' vegetables I've had in recent memory. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE seek this place out, it will not disappoint.
