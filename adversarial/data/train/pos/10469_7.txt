Looking at the map, this park is the big green spot to the North West of the Yelp Pin. There's parking near the Yelp Pin, but also along the west side cul de sacs that you can see encroaching on the green. \n\nThe fences are only cable at the bottom so if your dog is right fresh to the off-leash things and won't come when you call, this won't be the best park for you. (Check out the one in bowness for a fully gated experience) But for any other dog this place is wonderful. The cable fences go out to a peaceful back alley. Not a busy road in sight!\n\nI've gone a few times this winter and have been really impressed how well people clean up after their dogs. It's pretty easy to tell in the white of winter! This combined with being on a hill, make it a great place to take the kids tobogganing and letting the pooch run free while they play.\n\nExcellent panoramic view from the downtown skyline all the way to the mountains from the top of the hill.
