It was Memorial Day and I felt like shooting guns, so when I told my wife, she said sure. Honor thy country, right? I knew I didn't want to waste a boatload of money for just a few minutes of fun, so I decided to only waste a little bit of money for a few minutes of fun. \n\nThe girl in the front was friendly and helpful in explaining the different types of packages and guns. When we said we just wanted to shoot 20 rounds each, I could tell she wanted to \"extract\" a lot more money out of us. We weren't wide-eyed tourists willing to go all out and blow through dough, that's for sure. \n\nSo I go with the beretta and the wife has her 9mm. It's pretty cool how you can pick your own target poster, but for $2 a piece? Yikes. You have your poorly photochopped Obama head, slobbering aliens, and what is this? Some wannabe gangsta-looking Asian dude. Oddly, his face sort of reminds of someone I knew in middle school. \n\nBefore we know it, we're firing away at the target. Hot empty shells are flying everywhere. As my wife was shooting, a shell flew right smack dab at my eyes. Whew, good thing for those googles. She did okay, the most impressive were two lined-up shots right at the chin and jaw area. For me, I was disappointed I didn't hit the big X in the middle torso, just a lot of shots surrounding the area. I did get in a crotch shot, however.\n\nOverall, a nice way to blow some cash to release some energy in Vegas (legally). The staff was organized and efficient. Then again, when we went it wasn't busy at all. I wouldn't want to come when there's a long line full of hungover douchebags and therefore feel uneasy or rushed. Depending on how I do in gambling next time, we just might come back for the big guns.
