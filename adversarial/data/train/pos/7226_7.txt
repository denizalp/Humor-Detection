We had a really good experience at Ladera for a group of seven. Every single of of the staff (Hostess, Waitress (Haily), Waiting-staff, and General Manager were very friendly and helpful. The drinks were tasty with a twist - nicely done! Food is definitely an A+. Everyone of us were satisfied with our order. Let's talk about ambiance. We were really impressed with it's spacious setting and structural appealing, inside and outside. In particular, the patios has a play-area (like a kids-zone), then a \"formal\" dining area with a lovely fireplace. We are especially glad to have Ladera in our neighborhood...bringing up the trendiness and new-concept of dining. \nWe highly recommend this place, and we will come back very soon. Kudos & Happy Dining !
