Ambience:5 Food:5 Service:5 Value:5 Return:5\n\nAn exquisite, entertaining, and, delicious teppan-grilled dinner designed by Michelin-decorated Chef Masa Takayama I had here Saturday evening.  Beautiful was the service from start to finish!\n\nIntimate is the setting. Comfortable are the design of tables and seating.  A personable personal chef to each party. Thrilled in watching him carefully selecting the freshest of seafood, vegetables, and meats.  Then masterfully chopping and mixing right before my eyes into fabulous and aromatic dishes!\n\nI adored all of the dishes ordered: 1) Grilled Octopus: soft and lemony in opening up the palate; 2) Langoustine with Salsa Roja, Gun Powder: fabulously juicy with heated bites; 3) Rib-Eye Steak: tender and flavorful with yummy grilled whole garlic; and, 4) Chili Shrimp Cilantro Fried Rice: not to be missed,by far the best fried rice I've ever had!\n\nLoved it all!\n\nCHEERS!
