Good Lord, where to start with this place.\n\nI used to live in East Chinatown about three years ago, and Prohibition was a great place to visit; excellent tap selection, friendly, prompt service, etc. \n\nHow times have changed...\n\nI don't know if these guys have gone through an ownership change or what, but the last four times I've been here, the staff seem to be new every time, and seriously abysmal in every way.\n\nIt's now a regular occurrence for me to get a different beer than what I asked for, while being utterly neglected in every way. These new servers don't seem to have any knowledge about the product they're selling, let alone have a vested interest in their guests. Seems odd, given the fact that beyond their \"Hooch Hour\", this place is insanely expensive for the location (ten bucks for a side of fries? okay...). You'd think the quality of staff would at least reflect their prices.\n\nI would recommend avoiding this place, unless again, you're visiting during Hooch hour (7-10pm and 10-11pm everyday), in which case you can get an imported draught beer for five bucks. Beyond that, have fun paying a high price for God awful service, while Chumbawamba plays looped on the various TV screens around you, and idiot bros sit at the bar trying to impress their dates over $2.50 jagermeisters. \n\nSeems telling that there's no contact feature on their website...
