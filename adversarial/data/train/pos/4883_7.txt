LOL  I liked this place very much, but I do think the waitress was trying a little too hard.\n\n\"Yes, I would like the Mt. Fuji roll.\" \n\"That is my absolute favorite roll!!\"\n\nI also ordered a different one and she also let me know that it was her second favorite roll and on top when I ordered a beer with it, surprise surprise!! It was her favorite beer as well!!\n\nI mean, I am all about customer service and all, but I got a little weirded out, but then, could she have been hitting on me??\n\nHmm, I will have to go back and find out for sure...
