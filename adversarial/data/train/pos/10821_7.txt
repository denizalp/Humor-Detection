I was completely disappointed in this place. I had multiple locals recommend this restaurant, and I read how famous it was! Unfortunately, it had very limited options for vegetarians.\n \nWhile waiting for our table, we were directed towards the cabin next door that also had a bar. Very cute, rustic feel. Indoor and outdoor seating available.\n\nDrinks: Hot Mexican Chocolate and Warm Cider \nThe hot chocolate wasn't too sweet or chocolaty, in fact it was a little bitter. The cider was refreshing with a subtle hint of orange and ginger.\n \nI was with an individual that had a nut allergy, and one of their pizza's was topped with crushed pistachios. We asked if they could make it without pistachios and we were told no. Ultimately, resorting us to two options on the menu.\n\nPizza: Margherita and Biancoverde\nNothing special about the traditional pizza. The biancoverde was better than what I was expecting. It's a no sauce, and had a delightful blend of cheeses.\n \nOverall, this place was definitely busy for a Saturday night, but I don't think they are as vegetarian friendly as they could be.
