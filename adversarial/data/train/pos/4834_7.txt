I am seriously amazed by the 5 stars this place has received. I've been to this SB more than a handful of times and service is ALWAYS SLOW! especially at the drive thru! I visited this location this past Friday and me and my friend walk up to the counter to get my drink and we wait...and wait...observe the workers chatting it up with people at the other end where the pick up counter is...and wait...and wait... See workers walk past the register and ignore us..and wait and wait. then FINALLY our invisibility cloak must've slipped off because someone finally notices us and asked if we need help. Ugh no. We need to order. What.the.hey! So he tells me back my drink and says \"Elijah\" right?! Me and my friend look at each other and say no, dropped the cash and just walked away. \n\nLike I said I've stopped by this location many a times and go to the drive through. I Dont know why. Honestly every time I utilize it, it takes longer than 15-20 mins. Even when its slow. I Dont understand why but it does. \n\nNot to mention all the crazies that go in there. Yuck. Hmm, maybe that's why I keep going through the drive thru now that I think about it.
