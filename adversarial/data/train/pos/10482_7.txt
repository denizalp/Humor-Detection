I am so excited that Original ChopShop has opened their doors! I love a good sandwich and I love healthy food. Luckily the Original ChopShop has both! This eatery is both coffee shop and cafe. It offers a delicious and efficient selection of food that you can either eat there or take with you. My two favorites (so far) are the turkey sandwich and kale cesar with chicken. Both are fresh, relatively nutritious and certainly fill me up. \n\nThe atmosphere here is that of a earthy coffee shop and has both an outdoor and indoor seating area. You order the food at the counter and then take your seat. It still has a little feel of the old cheesesteak place, but much more trendy and healthy! \n\nThis has quickly become my go-to spot for a quick and healthy lunch option and I will soon come back to try their breakfast, coffee and dinner!
