Everyone knows hooters. I love their wings. I really do. They might be the most delicious wings in the world for me.  The pretty sights don't hurt either. \n\nHowever, this location is really bad. Their draft beer is always flat, always, so just get a bottle and save your self the pain. \n\nIt always smells like a bathroom. I think their ventilation system is very bad. Most of the time I choose to be seated outside or as far away for the restroom just because of how much I love the food. Sometimes I just turn away.\n\nHowever, the other day, this location hit a new low when I ordered a bottle of beer, and when I got served the beer, the person serving me was holding a mop in one hand and beer on the hand and served me, asking if need anything else. Upon me saying no, went on mopping the floor. Disgusting.\n\nI can't go to this place anymore. period. I will find a new location.
