Was looking for an authentic Italian restaurant with all the components of a good eatery, and via all my research I chose Nico's to meet a girlfriend that I hadn't seen in years, for light bites. \n\nNico is trendy and very creative with decor detail, our server was sweet and hospitable as they should be as we were the only guest. \n\nThe light bites were outstanding & definitely makes me think about how good of a return would be to indulge in their main dishes with my Don Dolce in the future as AZ is our home away from home.\n\nTwo things wrong you don't serve 5 hrs old coffee and assume the Queen won't know......dahling I'm not an amateur, when it comes to perfection, silly.  Last the owner himself was there, dahling you look charming & you make lovely succulent cuisine but it wouldn't have hurt for him to come & introduce himself or even ask if we enjoyed it, you are a Chef but in Gilbert AZ.\n\nCiao
