Fuzzy's Taco! Really? And I thought Pink Tacos was provocative! Hahaha ... I guess NOT!\nWell, I was very pleasantly surprised about Fuzzy's Taco. Prices are very affordable! They play rock and roll! And they serve alcohol!\n\nI personally don't eat spicy food, so I asked the cashier before ordering what items would be recommended. \nI like chicken, so I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas (fajita chicken) with double orders of cilantro rice.\nChicken was still spicy for me, and the cilantro rice was little bit undercooked or dry. Otherwise the meal was tasty.\nAlso ordered the Grilled Shrimp taco ($2.49), soft flour taco. I really liked this taco! I think this was the best grilled shrimp taco I ever had! \nBF ordered the 3 Tacos platter, and he was very pleased with it, too.\n\nFuzzy's Taco Shop is going to be my favorite Grilled Shrimp Taco place to be from now on!
