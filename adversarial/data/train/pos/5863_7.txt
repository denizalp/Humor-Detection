Ah yes. Reminiscent of my childhood days the orange Julius kiosk in the malls. \n\nI was feeling disappointed when the orange Julius recipe just isn't the same slushy treat but instead watery. \n\nThe employees here recommended putting in some ice cream to bring back the slushy feel. They nailed it and really hit the spot. \n\nThose who were disappointed in their orange Julius experience try above and you won't be disappointed again I promise
