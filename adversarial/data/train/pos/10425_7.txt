All I have to say is wow. \n\nI'm not the club hopping, silk shirt wearing type of guy, but give me a view and a stiff cocktail and I'll be just fine. The Foundation Room has this interesting hidden jungle temple look on the inside and the outside it's more of a smoky lounge style vibe. Multiple couches, a bar and a view to kill for.  \n\nLike I said the view is ridiculous, you can see all the way down the strip and even watch planes land at McCarran airport. I came here during the day for a private event, but I can only imagine what the Strip lights look like at night. Or I can just look at the photos on their Yelp profile...naw, I'll just come back. \n\nIf you want to impress on a first date or show off to your out-of-town friends, this might be a good place to start. I'll definitely be coming back.
