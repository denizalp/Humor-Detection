Sometimes you get a craving for something...for me it was lox and bagels on an everything bagel with capers. And nothing else will do. Yeah, I could have went to Einstein Bagels...and had some teenager slap something together for me. I didn't want that, I wanted a good bagel place, locally owned, and that knows how to make great bagels. I found what I was looking for at Harrie's Bagelmania. \n\nYes, it's in a \"sketchy\" part of town for some people. So what. Walk in, have a seat, and let them bring you a menu. Service was spot on...I had questions, I got answers without attitude. My food arrived fast. My check didn't arrive until I was just about finished. I like service like that which I consider just right. \n\nBut all that means nothing, what about the food? I had another one of those OMG did I order more than I can eat moments? That bagel was stacked! And it was kinda messy too (which is good and that's NOT a complaint!). And while I thought $1 extra for the capers was a bit pricey....they loaded my bagel up!\n\nDecor wise the place could use a slight facelift, but to be honest I was too busy chowing down to give a dang about decor. They are a bit pricey for my typical lunch and way over the top on calorie counts but if you gotta have lox and bagels, Harrie's Bagelmania has what you need. I will be back! \n\n(Bookmarked for months....boy am I glad I finally got over there to check it out. Oh and they take credit \/ debit cards...no ancient ATM in sight as mentioned by earlier reviewers, but I brought cash just in case.)\n\n(Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #2)
