MY GOD!! \n\nIf it's one thing you want to bet on while you're in town this weekend this is it!   And by betting i meant making a sure bet of $14.  The only risk involved is missing the opportunity to order this as it is served during lunch fri-sun 12pm-5pm.\n\nDUCK CONFIT CINNAMON ROLL w\/ Smoke Bacon Frosting and Raspberry Compote:\nThe frosting is made with bacon dripping, and they put on a fair amount without overwhelming the dish entirely (not that i would mind..).  Underneath the icing were bits of shredded duck meat that could have been easily overlooked, but those few, salty specs added another dimension to this rich, bakery good.  Topped off with a Raspberry Compote and you got yourself a wild card in your face.  Fancy!  \n\nThe two thick slab of Grilled Pork Belly paired on the opposite end of the plate will have your mouth gambling for a compromise.  In the end the climax would solidify because there is no reasoning!  Each mismatch bite just seems to get better and better.  \n\nI can't even recall the last time i had Cinnamon Roll or why I'd stop eating them.  With sentimentally I've regret the absence of these sweet rolls, but thanks to Comme Ca i can once again tally this into my current streak!
