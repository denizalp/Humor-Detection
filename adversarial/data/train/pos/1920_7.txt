After going to the gym, my parents and I were (of course) hungry. And to ruin our hard workout, we thought we would pig out at Spring Rolls. My parents have never been to any Spring Roll locations and I always told them it was fusion food that, in my opinion, was not really Japanese or Chinese. However, we wanted to go for some appetizers and drinks and thought this location at Fairview Mall would be the closest.\n\nIntro. Fairview Mall is my second, least favourite mall in Toronto, however, I have to say this Spring Rolls is my favourite of the chains. There is a lovely patio which in hot times and on Friday\/Saturday nights must be packed. However, on a Sunday, lazy afternoon, it was quiet.\nMy parents and I sat inside because it was raining, and it is BIG. For those of you who know me, booth seating is my fave and there are plenty of those here. \n\nFood. The menu is a mecca-mix of Chinese\/Japanese\/Thai\/Korean\/Western food which means it should be able to whet anyone's appetite or for those who want to try something new. Sometimes a menu that offers so much can be difficult because you just don't know what to get, but somehow, the variety of options works at Spring Rolls.\n\nFor starters, my dad ordered the Hot and Sour Soup which was a disappointment. For those of you who have tasted the real deal, this can be passed. Then, we ordered the Sexy Summer Rolls which was fresh. I had the sushi platter while my mom had the Korean BBQ with rice and my dad had the lamb chops with rice. All in all, we all enjoyed our meal. It's nothing wow our outstanding, but the food is good! \n\nAmbiance. I briefly read some of the reviews for this location concerning noise level...we came here on a relatively quiet Sunday afternoon, so no complaints here. This maybe why my review is so positive, because I too know how ridiculous noise levels can ruin a meal.\n\nService. Great waiter...he even personally walked us out the door, opened it, and bid us farewell. Don't remember his name but, boy that made my day.\n\nAll in all, I think this is a great Spring Rolls location. I like the d√©cor inside and because it is in Fairview Mall, you can't beat the shop and dine experience. Working so close to the Yonge and Sheppard location, I would much rather eat at here. It has a great vibe, GREAT PATIO, and tasty food.
