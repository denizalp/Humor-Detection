First time ordering carryout, tony was nice and welcoming. The Pizza quality has tanked. Sauce leaves more to be desired, if this is what NY style pizza is all about, then I'm glad I am from Chicago. \n\nCrust\/dough was very bland. It is foldable like new yorkers like to do. My wife said it was worst pizza she has had. The toppings had no cooked flavor to them and they appeared raw. They were warmed with the pizza but no where close to having any type of slight burnt\/cooked flavor to them.\n\nGarlic knots were not great but had more flavor than the pizza. \n\nThe pizza reminded me of the pizzas i made when i was a kid w\/tomato paste from the can. \n\nTony was nice and all, but try the entrees or thick pizza. STAY AWAY FROM THE THIN NEOPOLITAN PIZZA!
