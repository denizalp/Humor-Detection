Oh lordy lord, I didn't think I'd be coming back so soon. LOL.  Tonight we came on a whim and boy am I glad I did!\n\nThis time, I decided to get the Carne Asada Fries which came out to about $8 with tax.  I gotta say, it was delicioso!!  Start with crispy french fries, topped with chunks of seasoned beef, sour cream, guacamole and two types of cheeses.  The great part about it was that I couldn't finish it so I took the rest home and I'm happy that I'll have another meal later!  Such a fulfilling meal and caution to the wise: don't try to be a hero and eat this with your hands.  It'll conquer you!   This must be consumed with a fork!\n\nOn another note, when we arrived, there was a line to the door.  Low and behold, there was a lady in front, trying to decide what to get.  I don't think she read my first review for this place.  LOL\n\nOn a last note, the front guy that takes your order and your money is really funny.  He doesn't talk much English, but can understand a lot and interacted with us during our visit.  He made us chuckle a couple of times.  While we were eating though, he kept taking pictures and the camera kept facing towards us.  Maybe he was taking a picture of the full restaurant behind us...hmmm....I'm going to say he was being a little creepy! LOL!!!
