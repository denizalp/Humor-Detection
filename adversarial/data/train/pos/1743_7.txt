DO NOT GO TO HONDAWEST. \n\nI bought my 2006 Scion xB used from this location in May or June of 2010. When I purchased the car, I was led to believe that the car went through a Honda certified multi-point inspection that assured me a maintained, working car with well-functioning parts. This was not the case! Barely 1 month after purchase, I had lights coming on: Trac Off, Check Engine. Turns out the spark plugs in the car were in the car twice as long as recommended. \"Conveniently,\" HondaWest could not be held responsible in any way. They charged me to diagnose the car. Then told me they can't do any work on my car because its a TOYOTA. They sent me to Toyota down the street to wait HOURS for repairs all over again.\n\nNow I go to Hondoctors in North Las Vegas. They're Honda \/ Acura specialists but they do awesome work on other cars as well. I had them do the 60k on my car.... MORE BAD NEWS. The tranny fluid hasn't been changed for the life of the car (should've been changed at 30k) and somehow I was missing a cabin filter. Just reason after reason why my biggest piece of advice is to stay FAR FAR AWAY FROM HONDAWEST. Hondoctors are honest people who do quality work in good time. If anything goes wrong with my Scion I take it to Hondoctors. Hands down, I recommend them! I live in the SW side of Las Vegas but I'll make the drive all the way to North Las Vegas. I can trust them.\n\nI can't trust Hondawest. They've done me wrong on so many different occasions. My best piece of advice: Do not do business with them. Never got around to posting a review until now.... Hope this prevents someone the headache of dealing with this awful place.
