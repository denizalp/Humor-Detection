The newly opened Church and Wellesley location replaced the old Acme Burger. The interior is spacious, with ample number of booths with lots of sunlight shining in. I loved seeing the sack of potatoes at the front of the restaurant which are used for the fresh cut fries.\n\nFor a simple good quality burger, Fresh Burger provides a tasty bite at very reasonable prices. A customer can get a combo for less than $10. Many restaurants charge $10 + dollars just for a burger. \n\nI ordered the 4 oz fresh burger, topped with cheese, tomato and freshburger sauce and added caramelized onions and sauteed jalapenos, and shared a poutine with my friend.\n\nThe burgers were as juicy as the first time I had it in Richmond Hill and consistently stayed true to itself. The focus is on the taste of the freshly ground 100% lean Canadian AAA Sirloin that is grounded fresh daily.
