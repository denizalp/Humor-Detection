Four stars for the shops, the eateries and the parking. It's nice now that they also offer valet (south center area). Is there a good bookstore in here? No, I don't think so. If you search \"Books\" in \"Biltmore Fashion Park\" directory, you'll get \"Cornelia Park\" (which is a great shop and the largest retailer of \"MacKenzie-Childs\" products - love- , but no, not a \"bookstore.\") So yes, I liked it even more back in the day when Barnes and Noble was an anchor here or I'd love to see a great little book shop. There is a Papyrus at least. \"Apple\" is here too, so why am I being so picky? I can just get a MacBook!? Books aside, I prefer the Pottery Barn here to others in the Valley (friendliness and knowledge.)\n\nI like what they did with the UNION shops - sort of gives that \"hidden\" feel like I felt the upstairs used to do. I also love that they have the Humane Society shop \"Petique\" here. (Note, if you search \"pets\" in the directory it doesn't come up. And now I'm wondering if there isn't a book store and if I just haven't seen it since the search is kind of weak.) Anyway, it's nice to see pups out on a walk and hopefully in the process of being adopted. \n\nI'm not much of a Saks or Macy's-goer, but word is that I can pick up Frango Mints here so that's alright. Coming from mostly closed malls growing up in Chicago - an open air space that is shoppable year-round is always appreciated. The open-air choices in Chicagoland were Old Orchard and Oak Brook (loved going there and still do) as well as Golf Mill (which has pretty much gone down the tubes and is closed in now anyway) but those were a beast in cold weather. \n\nIt's nice to see the Biltmore is growing and thriving and as I'm writing this, I'm mentally scanning the grounds and I just remembered one of our favorite restos where we haven't been in awhile: Christopher's and Crush Lounge! Used to frequent that place - where I first had balsamic glaze on peach ice cream. (Covered parking is closest to access this restaurant!) Oh, I forgot to mention - yes, covered parking here too (north side.) Stay cool....summer's a-comin'!\n\nPS - my review was prompted by \"Movies in the Park\" (review I've just written) which runs annually in the Spring. Three stars on that. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/biltmore-fashion-park-phoenix-2
