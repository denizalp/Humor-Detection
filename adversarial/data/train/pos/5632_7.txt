I am a huge fan of \"shaBANG for the buck\" buffets and good lord is Jerusalem one of them! I had a coupon too, so it made the experience even better. \n\nThe finer details:\n\nAmbience: Spacious, clean, not un-welcomingly foreign; the servers were friendly and the music was pleasant.\n\nCrowd: Mixed Mississauga crowd; mostly families. I like the fact that it is neither as crowded or as loud as Paramount. \n\nVariety: TONS to choose from. If you're like me, experimental about cuisine, make sure you try a little of everything. I love the fact that you can walk around and try the buffet but the servers also bring you little-somethings (apart from the buffet) to try. We got pita breads, shawarma meats, the oh-so-yummy garlic dip and kebabs served this way. And then we obviously had a ton more items to choose from from the buffet. \n\nVerdict? Jerusalem is a meat-lovers paradise, hence mine. I am going back again for sure. \n\nPS: Our server was really pretty
