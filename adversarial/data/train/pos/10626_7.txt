Dear HRC Security:\n\nWhen escorting patrons from the premises for \"dancing roughly,\" please do not use them as a battering ram though the crowd of people trying to watch the show. It is not fun having to dodge a person being shoved in your face by a security guard. In fact, while you're at it, get over yourself and let people enjoy a show and dance a little without flipping out that they might bump into someone. This is the \"Hard Rock Cafe,\" not the \"Slow Jazz Cafe.\" \n\nThanks!\nJennifer B.\n\nP.S. Just want to add, the sound quality here is amazing, so it's such a bummer that it's hard to enjoy the show because of outside staff. The actual HRC staff that took our tickets and screened our bags were so incredibly nice.
