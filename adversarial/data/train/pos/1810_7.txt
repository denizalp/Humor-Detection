Big rooms for sure. Lots of pools, if you are into that. Not very expensive. BUT...\n\nPlace kind of feels like death. I don't really know why, it just seems so disconnected from all the awesomeness happening on the strip. You think its close to the strip, but it really isn't that close...its a good 20 minute walk. The Hard Rock is across the way though...\n\nA\/C in the rooms was clearly an add on after the places were built. They are pretty much the window units you had in college. Note that these make controlling the temperature damn near impossible. Not to mention the remote you use to control these things makes no sense. It flashes crazy numbers at you, then beeps mockingly at you. I'm a computer nerd and yelled \"PC LOAD LETTER!!!\" at it. No instructions were included...probably because if you need instructions on how to operate a thermostat, your thermostat is far too complicated. Good luck on getting Grandma to figure it out.\n\nShower head is positioned about 3 feet up the shower wall, thus making it useful for dwarfs, midgets, and puppies only. The fireplace in my room didn't work, the TV in the bedroom didn't work. The TV in the living room had the crappiest speakers on the face of the planet. I couldn't understand anything people were saying on TV since the sound coming out of them was so garbled. Although I didn't try, I hypothesized that I would be able to make the dialog from \"Without a Trace\" sound a lot better using only my ass cheeks.\n\nI was here for a conference, so they provided box lunches. The stuff they serve you is very reminiscent of your middle school cafeteria...yikes.\n\nStay on the strip. You're in Vegas for godsakes. If you want cheap check out the Casino Royale.
