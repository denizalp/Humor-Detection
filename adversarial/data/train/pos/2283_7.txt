It's 12\/23\/2014 - almost 5 months to the date since I posted my Yelp review of Phoenix Music Lessons -(and months passed since I had attempted to solicit feedback from the owner of Phoenix Music Lessons).  TODAY - I am contacted with an explanation that \"I honestly thought you were probably a good person but I felt a dislike towards me right away. That energy was truly difficult for me to deal with.\"  \n\nHis \"concerned\" response concluded with this: \"PS. I once had a doctor do surgery on my knee.  I really disliked him (really this guy was a jerk) but I knew he was an expert..... My knee works great again. :)\"\n\nSince 12\/23\/2014 (again five months after my initial review) - the Owner has contacted me several times via personal email 3-4 and 1x telephone (actually left a message) - surreptitiously attempting to convince me to edit\/delete or otherwise alter my review.  I find the Owner's contact inappropriate and borderline harassing.  I rejected his offers of a refund as that is not the intent of my review - rather to advise others of my experience.  The Owner provided a service- and was compensated for his service.    My opinion is this Owner does not take kindly to those with opposing\/differing views.  \n\nUnprofessional and inappropriate boundaries.
