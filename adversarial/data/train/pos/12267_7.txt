Since I had to be in Ohio, I figured I'd try to find a nice restaurant to make me forget where I was. This place did the trick from the minute I walked in. Warm and cozy atmosphere, people laughing at the bar, partaking in a wine tasting and having a good time.\n\nThe cute bartender\/ waitress suggested the peppercorn steak dish they had. She also suggested that I order it with \"light peppercorns,\" since the chef usually overdid it. I can only imagine how much pepper would be on the thing had I not ordered it \"light.\"\n\nWhile I was eating, one of the people at the bar turned around and asked me how I liked my steak. I sarcastically told him that it was a little peppery. He came right over to our table and started telling us how much he, too, loved pepper. I'm not quite sure he picked up on my tone. I mean, I literally had a mouthful of peppercorns with my first bite. I then made a big pile of peppercorns on my plate- far, far away from my steak, which was slightly overcooked, but acceptable.\n\nSo, it turns out that he is the owner of the place. Nice guy, and he even offered us a great glass of wine on the house. He stuck around for about ten minutes, and he discussed with us his hopes for Cleveland, and he told us about another restaurant he owned. He also introduced us to his bartender, who is his daughter. Very friendly people.\n\nAll in all, the atmosphere was great and the owner is a great guy. But my steak was way too peppery- yes, even for peppercorn steak. The prices were slightly high, but not outrageous.\n\nI'll definitely eat here again, and maybe even see the rest of Cleveland.
