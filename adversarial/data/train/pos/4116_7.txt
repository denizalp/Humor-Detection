My buddies from Vegas came out for some Spring Training action.  We hit up 2 games here on a Thursday and Friday.  The stadium is super easy to get to (Right off Bell and 83rd) and the prices for tickets seemed pretty fair.  We got lawn seats each day ($5.00 in advance, $7.00 day of game) and had a fun time walking around the stadium.  We posted up on the blue picnic benches out behind right field.  Gave us a chance to sit down and relax for a bit .  Prices for concessions are average...aka...pricey!  Parking is normally $5.00, but both times we went, there was no attendant there so we parked for free.  We also did show up after the game had officially started too...maybe an insider tip? lol.  Anyways....overall it was an older but nice stadium.  Workers were friendly and the price of tickets was definitely reasonable.  I know I will be back sometime soon!  Still have to show some love to my old home town of San Diego.  Go Padres (Only when they aren't playing my Cardinals)!
