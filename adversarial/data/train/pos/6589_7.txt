If I could've put ZERO stars, I would have.\nI just passed the mirror in the living room and caught a glimpse of myself,  and more importantly, my hair.  it's HORRIBLE.  All I asked her to do was just follow the same line of the cut that I had, and just clean up the sides and take out the weight around the crown.   \nThe sides of my head look like they were cut with a dull steak knife!  At one point she handed me my glasses and said, \"See this part?  It'll  probably calm down in a few days.\"  W T F??????  Then towards the end, she goes, \"oooh!!!  it got all puffy from me running my hands through it!  Let me wet it down.\"  She did, then she handed me my glasses and said, \"Okay!  What do you want to do now?\".   \n\"Um, aren't YOU supposed to tell me that?\" \n\"Well, there isn't a guy that I know who doesn't have a specific \"thing\" that they do to their hair.  Um...  do you want some product?\" \nStarting to seethe....  through gritted teeth, \"Yeah.  That would be nice...  and do you think you could maybe dry it seeing as how it's 13 degrees outside?\" \nWhat really pisses me off is that I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR A SENIOR STYLIST.  When I was told that they didn't work on weekends, I was assured that I would have someone who was \"mid range\".  This b*&%# was TWENTY years old and had been cutting hair for a year.  THAT's \"Mid Range\"???    Jeebus.  \nI can't even look at myself in the mirror.  \nMy recommendation to anyone is:  \nDO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.\nMy recommendation to Ananda is:  \nDon't lie to customers.  I would've been fine if you had said that there were only beginner stylists available.  I would've simply scheduled for a day when a more experienced stylist could cut my hair.  also, get a comfortable place for customers to sit while they're waiting, and get a curtain for the window.  NOBODY likes to be seen with soaking wet hair by anyone walking past the shop.  \nOh...  the stylists name is Violet.
