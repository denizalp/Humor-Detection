This show was so much fun!\n\nThis was my first Cirque show, so I can't really compare it to any other shows. I have seen Le Reve though (kind of Cirque-y?), and I have to say that Zumanity has a completely different vibe. I can see why some people wouldn't like this show, but I thought it was hillaaaarious and amazing.\n\nUnlike some of the other reviewers, I thought that Zumanity had a good amount of acrobatic performances! The bowl act in the beginning was spectacular. I was a little surprised because I didn't expect the acrobats to be topless, but it was so beautifully done that I didn't even mind! Little did I know, there would be a lot more topless acrobats haaaaahaha. Coming from Berkeley, where I see naked people every semester in the naked run, I didn't mind at all. I thought it was totally fine! Some acts were tastefully done, some acts were not. But I don't think Zumanity is trying to be a \"tasteful\" type of show - it's meant to shock and entertain you! The acts were so funny and I had a blast during the entire show.\n\nI bought a ticket through a half price ticket booth, so I paid about $87 for a pretty great seat. Would I pay full price for this show? Probably not, because I'm pretty cheap. I actually don't think this show is worth full price - I would recommend Le Reve or a different Cirque show if you're paying full price.\n\nThis is not a highbrow kind of show - definitely not for the fainthearted. Zumanity is definitely for people who like silly, dirty jokes and don't mind seeing a bunch of naked people. I laughed SO much during this show, and I'm glad I saw it.
