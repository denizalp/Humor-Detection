A few of my classmates and I came here after our exam on a Wednesday. We arrived at about 2:45pm. There was no wait and we made it on time for the lunch pricing. \n\nThe hostess seated us and said it was busy so can sit in a booth. 15 minutes goes by and our server still hasn't greeted us yet.\n\nWe had to get another servers attention to find out who our server was. She was nice enough to get our order started since we had to wait. She pointed out our server to us. Not saying any names since this is a new restaurant.'\n\nFinally, we see our server walk by had to get his attention for him to even come by. \"he needs to work on his server skills\" \n\nEvery time we asked for something he just dropped it off and left. Couldn't even get a word in.\n\nTwo manager came by and asked how our food was. So that's a plus and then the nice server took over for the one that was incompetent.\n\nThe food was good, obviously is self serve all you can eat Korean BBQ. It was only $15.99 for lunch. It has almost has the same amount of items for dinner which is $25.99.\n\nCool atmosphere, blue lights everything and white booths.
