\"Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see, sometimes your words just hypnotize me\nand I just love your flashy ways, guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid\"\n\nIf I was a restaurant, I would be Joe's Midnight Run all the way! Once I stepped foot, it just brought me back to my childhood days. Born in the 80's, growing up in the 90's with Back to the Future, Tony Toni Tone, Bobby Brown and the list goes on, I just couldn't help my excitement and me busting my sitting-down dance moves when I saw Back to the Future on a television playing on the corner and the 90's music bumpin like we in a house party. \n\nWe order the shishito peppers and the Notorious B.I.G. burger (how can you NOT order this?!) and both were the illest, what you talkin about Willis? Translation: It was so good, so order it! I loved the chicharones included in the burger - I grew up eating bags of chicharones like pringles!!!\n\nAnd once we got our check, they gave it to us in a Garbage Pail Kids bill holder! It made me laugh!!! I used to collect those card stickers when I was a kid! Service wasn't bad and prices are reasonable - yea, Joe's Midnight Run is THE spot to go to for a fun, trendy, lively restaurant with quality food at reasonable prices!!\n\nThanks Joe for bringing me back in time...
