I came here a few days ago with my team from work. Since it was considered a work sponsored lunch we did not partake in the main attaction - home brewed beer - but we did enjoy Four Peaks fabulous menu! I had the French Dip and their beer battered fries. The meat was a little tough but the au jus added GREAT flavor and the bread had the best texture. Hmmm...for dessert we all split the ice cream cake. WOW was that cake good, and BIG! Definitely worth the $5 it cost.
