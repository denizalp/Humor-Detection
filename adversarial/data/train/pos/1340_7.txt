Nice enough employees, and Saturday appointments go smoothly, however they have failed to address an brake noise issue after installing several new pads and rotors. On the last appointment (I had setup 2 weeks in advance,) they wasted my time and told me the mechanic was too busy. After 5 trips in for the same issue, my time is valuable too.\n\nDisappointing. Will not be back.
