Typically, you all know me as a positive pal of all businesses, but when a place deserves a verbal spanking, I take emotion out of it and focus on the facts. \n\nMy recent stay here with some friends was abhorrent from beginning to end, rather then rant and rave about how upset and disturbed I was by my experience, I'll outline the particulars and let you be the judge.\n\n1) Booked on Hotwire.com, (which can be the russian roulette of hotel booking), we had been looking for close to airport and this was no where close. It was listed as a 3 star on the same level as the airport Hilton - hardly.\n\n2) After \"scoring\" this place I called to make the change from one bed style to the next (typically I never have an issue with this anywhere else). But apparently moving from a King to 2 doubles or vice versa comes at a $60 charge!!!! Completely negating the hotwire savings. I pointed out to the customer service rep on the phone that I'd never heard of these kind of charges and she was blunt, unapologetic and rude in her tart response.\n\n3) Checking in. Not ONE smile. Not one... i looked under everywhere for one, even shined my most plastic smile on and flirted a little - nothing. Check-in process took forever, even though there was no line up at all. \n\nGotta agree with Dave A's review - they treat their customers terribly here,\n\n4) Parking. I parked in the front lot and when I was given my parking pass at front desk I was told \"You're not allowed to park there, you need to move your car to the back lot.\" Said in a blunt, emotionless tone, without even a please. Fine, I'll move no worries.... however.......\nLater that evening we went out for a bite to eat and when we returned the back lot was full, I went to front desk to inquire and was then told,  \"you can park in the front lot if you want\".... but wait a second, wasn't I not allowed t.... \"Just park in the front SIR\". OK ma'am sorry for clarifying.\n\n5) Room. Old. Like REAL old. paper thin comforter, dated television, and had an old smell to it. I can't figure out what it was but I think this might have been an old smoking floor as i woke up in the morning with a sore throat and post nasal drip - which has only happened in past stays at smoking friendly hotels.\n\n6) Housekeeping staff. a little too aggressive in the morning. I mean it was 8am, why are you knocking on my door. Are you kidding me?\n\n7) WiFi. What WiFi? Sure it's free but my phone was getting better reception.\n\nBy my count this place has lost 7 stars as opposed to 5 so I would have to give this place a -2 overall. If I ever hotwire again in the Toronto Airport East area and I get this hotel, I'll just let the money go, I'll never stay here again... not even if there is a zombie apocalypse and this is the only safe zone. That bad. Avoid at all costs
