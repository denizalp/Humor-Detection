On the road for my wife's graduation led me to spin the wheel on Yelp to find the perfect celebratory setting. Thanks to local reviews and photos I made the decision to rsvp at the Henry as this place fit the bill for everything I knew she would enjoy:\n\nGreat cocktails, homemade desserts, and unique\/seasonal entrees all being served from a spot that looks like it came out of a Restoration Hardware catalog!\n\nAs we were a bit early for our rsvp, we were open to enjoying some cocktails in the front until our table was ready. This was the only downfall of our experience as I needed to flag down a waitress before we could get any service. Once our orders had finally been taken and arrived, we started to realize that this place was going to meet the expectations we desired. The fig and gin mules are on point as were the brandied cherries in my wife's drink.\n\nOn to the entrees! The perks of going out to dine with a family that loves to eat is that we get to sample everyone's dishes. Our selections included: the Mediterranean branzino, wood grilled pork chop with cauliflower polenta, Thai blackened cod, beef short rib, buttered lobster salad, Korean skirt steak, and orders of bread pudding and chocolate,peanut butter, banana cake! \n\nOH and only the best cheesy popovers you could ever put in your mouth w homemade ham butter. Yes..HAM butter.\n\nWe obviously spent a grip but if you're going to do it big then you might as well do it right, and I got some major cred for the night's dinner selection. :)\n\nFor a party of 6, this place was impressive the moment you stepped foot in the door. From the open kitchen delivering mouthwatering dishes to the small patisserie on the side, the Henry has something to appeal to a variety of individual tastes.
