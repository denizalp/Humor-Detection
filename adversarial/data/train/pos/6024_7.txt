Today was my third visit to Papi Queso, it's everything I love, a simple menu with limited items, fresh\/real products, great service and Papi makes each sandwich as if it were for himself.  You can tell each sandwich is prepared with care.\n\nI do not think I can drive by Papi Queso without stopping.  Warning Papi, I'm coming to get you!
