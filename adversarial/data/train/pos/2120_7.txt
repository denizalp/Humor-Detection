Sorry to say this just isn't the best place to go despite outstanding facilities. \n\nLarge pro shop, many lanes, semi easy location to get to but the value for dollar and people you need to deal with are not there. \n\nThe range \"masters\" are toe a line between black water reject and call of duty fan boy. In every way they speak or interact with you (and your weapons) you will feel like you are treated like an inept child who has only seen guns in movies. Want to preach range safety? Sure. Wanna inspect my rifles to make sure the action is clear? Yeah I guess. Won't let me holster my weapon on the wrong side of the yellow line? Your house your rules. \n\nBut several things bothered me when those charged with range safety were actor out. One guy was so bored that he took his \"tacti-cool\" knife out of his billet proof vest  and started flicking the blade in and out of closure while not looking down range. Why in he hell are you carrying a side arm in a quick release and have a vest on? See a lot of combat in Tempe? \n\nA second one had a pistol (not holstered\" stuffed in the waist band of his jeans, where one small movement could get your ding dong shot off. While clowns like this usually show up at gun ranges looking like they desperately hope to fight zombies in Afghanistan, that type of ridiculous behavior is usually reserved for shooters and not employees. Bad form on a range that employs the very people that safety courses warm you about. \n\n\nPro shop is also over priced to the tune of double digit percentage points. Wanted to look at a sig for my lady and it turned out to be 400 dollars over what any other store had them listed at. Also went in looking for several accessories and parts only to learn \"oh we are out\" or \"we can order them\". \n\nIs this a place to rent a gun on a weekend or to go for a bachelorette party? Yes. It is not the place to go if you wish to be respect as a competent adult around the call of duty crowd, nor a place that is very affordable. After 4 trips, each more negative than the last, i don't think I need to go back again.
