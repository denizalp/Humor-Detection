Never again! I travel a lot. I eat out a lot. I don't Yelp as much as I should... but when I left my dinner here, I knew I had to Yelp this!\n\nWe were at BlogWord Expo and had dinner planned with friends and colleagues with a group of 15. We asked if seperate checks were doable (as anyone would with a large group) and she said yes. \n\nWe sat down at the table and within minutes the waitress dropped glasses (not one but a few) of water over a friend and the glass shattered all over the floor. My friend was wet. Accidents happen... we get that. But how this was handled was bad. A simple sorry, to be followed by waiting in wet broken glass for 15 minutes until they took care of the situation. \n\nWe brushed that off and ordered our drinks. 20 minutes later we received our drinks and no interest in taking our food order. We had to ask the manager to have our order taken. 10 more minutes later, they began to take our order. Each time we wanted another drink, we had to flag down the waitress. She never proactively checked in on us at all. We waited... waited... for another 45 minutes until food arrived. \n\nThe food was ok. The margaritas were great! So great we asked for a larger glass for each serving. Each serving was in a 16 ounce-ish glass and the larger glass was more like 21 ounce. Not a double portion right? Remember this...\n\nWe decided after 3 hours of this service, we decided its time to go. Asked for the check and they brought it out on one. We asked them prior if separate checks were ok. We asked for the manager... apparently their cash registers can not handle separate checks past 12 people. This took rocket science apparently so the waitress gathered several people and begun doing backroom calculus to divide the check. It had to be that complex, because we waited for another HOUR for the check. That had to have been hard math!\n\nThe bills came finally... and those $12 margaritas asked to be in just a little larger glass came out to be $24 each! She didn't tell us she would charge double and not double the size for these drinks!\n\nThe worst experience I have ever had! $150 for two people and this bad of service! We didn't even get a \"I am sorry for the wait and service.\"\n\nNot once. \n\nFor epic... I will Yelp. Epic being good and bad. In this case... epic fail.
