The hotel I was staying at recommended Doolittles so off I go to Doolittles.There were wonderful smells when I entered the front door and my taste buds started going crazy in anticipation of what might be coming soon. I ordered the chicken Wild Rice soup for appetizer and the spit-roasted chicken for the main course. The soup was good, but only had a few pieces of chicken and not sure where the rice was hiding. The roasted chicken was fantastic, maybe the best roasted chicken that I have ever tried. The chicken has was moist and had a very smoky flavor...just perfect! Finally, my server Tripp was very good. Overall, a very good experience.\n\nMy ticket was $26.26 before tip.
