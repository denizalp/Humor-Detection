WARNING!! HEALTH HAZARD!! Wow! Filthy dirty rude staff and filthy dirty place all together! I really can't believe what just happened. Ok, so, I walk in to get a bagel (which btw are subpar at best). I ask for a bagel with cream cheese! That's it! 20 min wait lol! \n\nThe staff was so rude and unwelcoming, especially there useless goateed, pony tailed guy with his hairy blubber belly sticking out of his filthy dirty shirt, he actually, right in front of me dropped a lid off a cream cheese container, it fell on he floor cheese side down and he bent over to pick it up and put it back on the container! It just fell on the floor! Omg! I was flawed! Not only could I not believe he did that but I also couldn't believe that this waste of a person bent over and showed the crack of his filthy A**! \n\nAs I walked out I told them I will never be back and they responded! Good we don't want you back! No joke Brooklyn Bagels is a disaster and sickly place, it's only a matter of time they go out of business! I will be calling the healthy department on them for a full investigation! Boy did they mess with the wrong guy. Don't believe any of the good review and please don't waste your time at this pig pit of a place they have the nerve to attach the word Brooklyn to! It should be called, the Brooklyn Dump. \n\nHonestly I was sick to my stomach watching the dirt bag crew of filth walking around. They can't clean themselves why would they keep the place clean. Rude and disgusting!
