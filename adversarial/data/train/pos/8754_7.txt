Man, it's been like a decade since I've been to this movie theater, and boy did they do a great job of upgrading it. \n\nThe movie lineups have been extremely week for the past half year, but my wife and I recently saw a preview of \"Arrival,\" and we were convinced to check it out. We watched it here last night (an excellent performance by Amy Adams btw), and we were impressed with the movie theater (the cleanliness, reserved seating and the spaciousness of the seating, and the leather reclining chairs). I'm not sure if they have them in each of the theater rooms, but at least for this recently released movie they did. \n\nIt was also very empty for a Saturday night so I think this theater would be a good place to go to avoid long lines.
