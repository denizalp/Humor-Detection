12\/10\/09\nFinally had the chance to take Mom in to enjoy breakfast at MBB!  I tried taking her here once, but the line out the door was ridiculous; Even today there was a bit of a wait, and it wouldn't have been so taxing if it weren't so cold!  (We arrived at 10:15a, sat down at 10:45a, and had our meals delivered at around 11:10a.  Again, the wait times wouldn't have been so bad if my Mom wasn't due to be at the airline gate at 11:40a!)\nMom ordered the 3-egg salami omelette and hash browns w\/ cranberry-walnut toast http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=-gdeqfSkpFBnCfkRo3Lcng#-gdeqfSkpFBnCfkRo3Lcng, while I had the ham steak, hash browns, eggs (over-medium, please!), and whole-grain toast.http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=OCEqJ846dKKtI2TLJ3mg5Q#OCEqJ846dKKtI2TLJ3mg5Q  (Let me just say that we both LOVED the cranberry-walnut toast!  Is it MJ bread or from Simply Bread??  I've got to get a hold of some to have at home!)  I enjoyed the ham steak and the hash browns were wonderful, as always.  Eggs are always delicious here- aren't they from local Hickman Farms?  Mom didn't enjoy her omelette so much- too much salami!  I don't like salami, but I tried a bite anyway.  Yep, I STILL don't like salami...  However, she did enjoy the eggs, after picking off most of the meat, and the bread w\/ the plum jam.\nI'm always happy when my Mom enjoys herself at a restaurant that I take her to, so thank you MBB for helping her start her vacation right!
