Semi Annual Savings!!!!\n\nBath & Body Works \"Fashion Show\" had a great deal of aroma therapy products in stock for their current sale which is amazing for a super touristy location! I scored about twenty-eight aromatherapy body care products and some additional junk I allowed my niece to throw in the bag for $160.00 (saving nearly $250 bucks)!!!!! \n\nStaff is polite, store is super organized and product is plentiful for a small store. I'll definitely be back in December with my coupons!
