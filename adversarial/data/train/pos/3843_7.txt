With Las Palmas Carniceria's takeover of IGA has come nothing but vibrant things. This IGA now sells all manner of Latin groceries including, meats, spices, confections, and odd fruits one doesn't often see in area supermarkets. It appears that most of the employees have been retained along with a bunch of new, happy faces. \n\nThat taco cart still broils and attracts the hungry outside near the parking lot while another stand in front of the automatic door peddles soups, tamales, coffee, and some other things I'm not familiar with (see Becca R's review). \n\nRegardless, this new development has been a very positive one. \n\nAnd they continue to stock all the same old stuff, including my Isaly's chipped ham. \n\nShame on them for no longer carrying Schneider's, though. Instead, they are now selling a brand I can do without and forget the name of, BUT, they have Jarritos soda, which is becoming my new compulsion, particularly the tamarind flavor. Great Scott! It tastes just like Schneider's with fizz!
