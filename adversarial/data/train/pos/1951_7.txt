After a major disappointment at the go to AYCE in downtown I swore off going to an AYCE places at least  in downtown core. \nAh well one has to give in to peer pressure once in a while. My buddy and I decided to try this place out after catching a movie. The place is right opposite the movie theater so that made it easy. The location is prime IMO and is right on the main hub of activity. \nThe setup is high tech if that makes sense to you (read a lot of neon and modern interior)\nWe were seated promptly and got the most ridiculously over sized table that could seat 6 easy for the 2 of us. Oh goodie more places to put the dishes I guess.\nOrdering is high tech going with the theme here as one gets an iPad with a custom app and one gets to order from it (though a server needs to validate the order for submission) \nHigh marks for putting tech to good use.\nNow for the main attraction IMO the food there is your regular AYCE Japanese items and they even have Thai food that's not so Thai IMO (more on that later)\nWe ordered a medley of AYCE favs like some Tempura, Sushi Rolls, Salad, Teriyaki, Teppanyaki, Sushi and Sashimi in the first round. The food started to arrive promptly nothing really stood out as it was just the filler stuff. Some of the meat items were actually sub par. \nWe ordered some Thai items such as Satay stuff as well and they were not Thai IMO. Just some hot sauce that had no hint peanut.\nOn to the dessert my ordered his ice cream medley and I went for tiramisu. Ice cream was OK according to my friend tiramisu was just average.\nFor food I would say 2-2.5 stars as it is a place to fill up. Service was very efficient so half star bump for that.
