Another year, another friend's birthday and another dreaded Hibachi dinner. Many Hibachi places all fail with epic proportions. For the price you pay, they fail with the food, the service, the chefs and last but not least, the portions. They all appear to operate in the same manner with the same bland seasonings and strict itinerary. My experiences have all been similar to the Coop; get in, get your food and get the F out! \n\nSogo is no different; no surprise here. They serve the standard iceberg lettuce salad with some type of shrimp sauce variation as dressing. A very strange miso soup with chicken (if you can call it that) and lastly a chop shop trained hibachi chef. Now our chef was actually good and pretty entertaining, but the poor saps at the table next to us didn't even get the \"egg roll\" joke. I didn't hear one peep from their chef; he was strictly business, like the repo man. \n\nSogo did have good service though and I applaud them for that. The filet was good, all else just average. The restaurant is somewhat small and you might be rubbing elbows with the table across the room if it's a full house. With the dining space being less then expansive, small tables come with the territory. So small in fact that our chef knocked over my Kirin Ichiban (oh hell no).\n\nOn the bright side though, sub par food can sometimes be compensated with large portions. In that respect, Sogo is a winner. Additionally if you tack on the restaurant.com coupon, we actually have a worthwhile dinner.
