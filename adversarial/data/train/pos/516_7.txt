Came here for HH on Friday and had a pretty good time. No drink specials for HH, but they have a pretty decent appetizer menu with about 6 different things for $2.95. We ordered 3 appetizers, a glass of wine and a beer and paid only $20 before the tip. \n\nWe had the spicy shrimp and eggplant (my favorite), the sliced steak bruschetta, and the sausage pepperoni and ricotta flat bread (minus the sausage). The flat bread was really thin more like a small thin crust pizza. These three appetizers alone would have cost us $35 at dinner. \n\nThe service this time was great. We got our food in no time. The bartenders are super friendly and were always checking up on us and joking around. We'll definitely be back for happy hour.
