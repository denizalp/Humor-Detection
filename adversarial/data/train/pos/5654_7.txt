Well there is no food, beer, music, or anything else for that matter here.  Its the health office.  This is where you come to pay $50 to watch an hour long movie about washing your hands where they give you a quiz, but after the movie the instructor gives you all the answers allowing any average joe to come get their health card.  Get here at least an hour early before the scheduled movie time.  The waiting is ridiculous, but hey thats how government works.  Inefficient as possible.
