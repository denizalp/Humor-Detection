This is an awesome new addition to the entire area!\n \nThe decor is modern and slick.  The owners are really nice as they are two childhood friends that opened up the place a few weeks ago.  One is a French trained pastry chef and the other a trained barista.\n\nThe display is gorgeous with a variety of crossiants, danishes, macaroons, pastries, etc..  It really is hard to decide what to try!\n\nI ended up trying what others recommended and it was the Mont Blanc pastry.  The super rich filling is made with imported chestnuts from France filled over  a cookie like dough.  It might not look big but it's extremely filling to be honest!  \n\nI topped it off with a beautifully presented Latte that was made a great leaf design on top.  \n\nThis is a true gem in the area as there is nothing comparable that I know of in the GTA  north.  I can't wait to come back to try all the other stuff and as they get busier for all the other items that they will be making as there business grows!
