Hell to the YEAH on this resort!!! Not only is it tranquil, quiet, beautiful, but has live music every night, VERY delicious food at their restaurants, and amazing pools--especially the one with sand flown in from Florida on the beach entry end! Our room was comfortable, spacious, with a beautiful view of the \"lake\" behind the hotel. Immaculately kept grounds make for a sight for sore eyes. On top of all that, guests have access to the Gainey Ranch golf club, which is only for members. We golfed there one morning and let me tell you, it's GORGEOUS! How do you keep all your grass so freakin green Arizona??? Friendly staff too! What a treat to stay here--will definitely be coming back!
