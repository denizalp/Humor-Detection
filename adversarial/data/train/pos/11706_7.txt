Long overdue review! This review is for my 2\/14\/16 visit here. Will never come back. Not sure what the deal was with the service today?? We all suspected that perhaps the waiter Eugene\nwas new. He was friendly enough but that's about where the positive ends. \n- The server brought bread out to the tables after we were done eating our entrees\n- Food (everything!) was SO SALTY. I'm talking beyond what is normal for restaurants adding excess salt. My friend ordered steak and she was embarrassed that she had to send hers back because of how salty it was. They brought her another and it was just as bad.  \n- Prices a bit on the high side\n- SALTY!!!!! I know I said that already. I still can't get over it. Holy salt!!!! \n- Lot of mistakes with entrees and sides. I ordered a side of steamed rice and got some weird cheese potatoes. Eugene took it back to the kitchen and brought me the correct rice right away, not sure if perhaps the mix-up was the kitchen's fault? Other people at my table also got wrong sides, or their entree orders were completely wrong.  \n- Servers made us pass steaming hot plates to the back of table instead of individually serving dishes to us. Huh? Who does that? Is this pure laziness, lack of training, or bad management?\n\nIt was my friend's birthday celebration so we tried not to moan and groan about the service too much...but sheesh!!! and one of our friends asked the waiter if he could bring out a special birthday dessert which  she offered to pay for, and they didn't even have a candle. I know this is a petty little thing.. but thought it was a little odd for a franchise restaurant like this to not have birthday candles? \n\nOverall very unimpressed and disappointed with the food and service.
