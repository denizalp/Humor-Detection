We had a $40 Groupon for the restaurant and went last Saturday evening.  Our reservation was for 5:15 and we were right on time.  The place was almost empty at the time and we were shown to our table.\n\nThere is a Yelp check in offer for free bruschetta but you can't double dip on the coupons--either the Yelp or the Groupon--so of course, we went with the Groupon.\n\nWe were brought iced teas and a bread basket shortly after being seated and ordering.  The bread basket was a let down.  The one piece of lavash was more like pressed cardboard and the two types of focaccia were merely OK.  We did not get butter but rather a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I have to remember in Italian restaurants to tell them to hold the balsamic.  It's just to sweet for me.  Give me plain olive oil and a salt shaker.\n\nWe ordered fried artichoke for an appetizer.  It was very good.  The dipping sauce was quite good.  There were 6 pieces of artichoke.  For mains, we each ordered ravioli.  I got the Lobster stuffed ravioli with lobster sauce--a house special for the evening.  My wife got the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash.  We both enjoyed our ravioli.  The serving size was just right.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered a cannoli and my wife got the vanilla crème brulée.  Both were good.  The cannoli was fairly standard but I didn't taste any of the pistachio nuts that were supposed to be in the cream.  The crème brulée was the winner of the two desserts.\n\nI think Gaetano's is overpriced.  It only makes sense to go here when you have a coupon of some kind.  Service was good.  It was pointed out when the bill was brought that gratuity had automatically been added because of the Groupon.  I'm not a fan of that.  Actually, the server lost because he got a lesser tip than he would have gotten had I made the decision and not the restaurant.  A good meal but a bit of a drive from Summerlin.  I can get equal or better Italian closer and for a better price.
