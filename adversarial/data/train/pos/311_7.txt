Based on the reviews here, I decided to try Born and Raised for breakfast before the Great Santa Run 2010 at Town Square.  I'm glad I listen to my fellow Yelpers, because they've nailed this place well!\n\nI was the only customer when I walked in at 7:30 AM and the staff was great.  They let me seat myself anywhere I wanted.  I chose a table in the lounge so I could watch the 17 or so big screen TVs.  Two channels of ESPN were on, two screens of Chelsea footie, and 5 screens of the History Channel which seemed out of place in a video poker\/sports bar.  \n\nThe important stuff - breakfast was great.  I had their Eggs Benedict.  They were tasty, and the Hollandaise had a nice, distinct flavor.  The breakfasts come with BAR potatoes and a nice bowl of fresh fruit.  My only detraction was my eggs were poached more than I like them, but that may be a health code because of possible salmonella.\n\nThe breakfast is listed on the menu for $9 and that's what the bill was for plus the tax.  No charge for coffee - it comes with the meal.  That's almost unheard of anymore!\n\nI'll return.  This is a gem of a place.  It only opened in October.  I wish them well.  I'll come back and try their sliders.
