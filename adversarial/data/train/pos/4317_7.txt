The first time I had the not-so-secret pizza was in 2011 or 2012 when Marquee first opened up. It is located next to STK inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel. The only reason to go here is after a night of drinking at Marquee, otherwise you can find better elsewhere. I've stayed at the Cosmo many times while in Vegas but I would usually eat at Secret Pizza for the late night munchies. If you ate it sober, you probably wouldn't think it is that good. I honestly think they could put more cheese on their pizza, and I mean double the amount of cheese. I remember I got a slice that almost had more sauce than cheese on it. And the reason I remember the lack of cheese was because we ate there for lunch one time when we were not drinking hehe. And yes it is true they do not have a ranch like some people say. That's too bad because pizza with ranch is so damn good. Also, since there is no seating, grab your pizza slice and head out to the area in between STK and Secret Pizza, there are a bunch of chairs in the middle to sit on if they aren't taken already. \nI don't think it is worth waiting in a long ass line just for Secret Pizza, considering you have to find some place to sit. But if the line is short, go for it!
