So, I was all set to give this bar a solid four stars...\n\nThey feature live music quite a bit.  Been here once a few times recently.  The first seeing a band from Austin.  It's a solid, clean, neighborhood spot a half step above dive.  The drinks are good, and fairly priced.  They don't have a lot of beer on tap.\n\nThe other time there, it happened to be a night where they had the grill going, on Mondays I believe.   Me and two friends each had a dinner platter of various steaks with sides.  The meat was tasty and well done, though not spectacular.  All the sides were fairly good.\n\nThe food was an excellent value for the price point.  Checking out the menu we saw that their other, daily basis, menu items were at really reasonable prices as well\n\nJust a nice four star kinda bar, until after our visit last night.  Five housemates, two ate the burger.  Others had veggie burger, and the chili dog.  \n\nThe fries are pretty great.  Upon noticing the menu claimed the fries were baked, and not greasy, MrT asked why anyone would want them.  But despite the non-greasy they were fairly fantastic.\n\nYou can ask for a side of their house BBQ sauce.  Not bad flavor, but it is a mainly straight black pepper taste; not quite a true thicker multi-flavored typical BBQ.\n\nEverything tasted great, everyone was happy.  All set to give the Iron Post a solid four stars.\n\nUntil a few hours after we got home.  The burger dinner folks BOTH had food poisoning!\n\nOne of the food poisoned has stated since that her six week recovery from heart surgery was less painful than her case.  She ended up having to go to the hospital for it.\n\nSo, be warned.  Maybe stick with sides or veggie options here?  Don't know if I'd ever go meat here again!  \n\nI'd give the place another chance, steering(huhuh) clear of the meat.  I would give the bar more stars, but can't forgive the disgustingly, painfully stricken.
