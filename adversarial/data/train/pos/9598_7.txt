Daaaaamn. This was hands-down the coolest and most fun public arts gathering I've ever been to. Held in an old abandoned second level of the Veterans Memorial Bridge that spans the Cuyahoga River, the gathering was chock full of artists, musicians, opera singers, great food, weird-ass underwater staircases, live drama, performance art, cheap wine, and more fun than you can shake a barrel of fish at. (I think I'm mixing my metaphors here, but you get the idea.) This was my first time attending, and words just don't do it justice. If you still think that \"there's nothing going on in Cleveland\" after attending this, I will personally drive you to the airport.
