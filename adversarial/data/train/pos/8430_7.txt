Bought a Groupon for unlimited hair removal laser treatment about a year ago. \nAfter 9 treatments (not one, 9!), besides the fact that I'm a perfect candidate for laser hair removal (very pale skin and thick and dark hair), I've only lost about 10% of my body hair. \n\nAlso, very painful, mostly on the bikini area (I was crying and screaming in pain each time, which is not normal because I usually have a very high pain tolerance and with my new beautician - because I had to go finish my treatments somewhere else to have RESULTS, with a real laser, not an IPL machine - it doesn't hurt at all). \n\nNo cleaning of the skin before treatments, nor after, no soothing cream, no numbing cream for delicate areas, random and uneven zapping on your skin, uncomfortable table. She's not wearing protection glasses when she uses the machine...\n\nI discovered recently, after talking with my dermatologist, that she should have NEVER done \"laser\" on me during my acne medication treatments  and my Juvederm injections. They should carefully ask you if you had any of those treatments each time you have an appointment.\n\nI finished my round of treatments with her just because I paid for it... but I should have run away after the first one. I could've had health issues because of this scam. I may be guilty of being greedy, but you don't have to be as stupid as I've been. \n\nStay away from this place.
