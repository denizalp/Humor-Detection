El buen is muy bien!\n\nNot in the greatest part of the city, and for some reason, I always get weird ass stares from random ass people. Regardless, this place is currently my favorite taco spot in Vegas. I usually go to El Gordo, but this taco truck gives them a run for their money. I've only tried their carne asada and al pastor tacos, but damn, it's some of the best I've ever had! And that spicy, chunky green salsa and their orange salsa are game changers! I don't even wanna try anything else, because they do the carne asada and al pastor (my favs) so well. \n\nCan't wait til my next visit!
