I have rented from many landlords. MPM is the best. \n\nWe had four guys renting a non-campus house from MPM. As other yelpers mention, MPM doesn't actually own the properties, they just manage them. That is how it works. It shouldn't surprise anyone. \n\nEvery single time I had a maintenance issue, MPM had someone to my house in less than 24 hours. When it came time to show our house, they were prompt in giving us advance notice and helpful when issues arose. If you forget your rent (like I did a few times), you wont be immediately evicted. They understand people forget things and will politely remind you. \n\nBest of all, MPM is the most dog friendly apartment manager in Madison. I have a dog that is generally prohibited at apartments, however, MPM was willing to work with us.\n\nMadison Property may seem like a big company, however, I was always treated as a real person. I would highly recommend anyone go with MPM.
