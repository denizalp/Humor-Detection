I got the ahi tuna sandwich (the waiter recommended) which was mediocre and disappointing actually for such a high end restaurant. My salad wasn't fresh and some leaves were turning yellow. My son got the super hero burger which is more like a slider and the meat was burnt. The total bill was $34 :\/ I would never order this again.
