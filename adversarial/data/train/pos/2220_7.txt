It's interesting and private. The server was friendly but i found the bartender to be annoying. He seemed like he thought he was the coolest guy in Las Vegas and didn't listen to my request. The place doesn't do vodka cranberry or anything generic as it's a mixology type place. Bartender explains this and then asks you to give flavor profiles you enjoy (ie. spicy, citrus, floral, smokey... those were going to be mine but he kept cutting me off). I opened by trying to explain that gins\/whiskeys (though i don't mind the taste) make me feel very sick and i prefer a mezcal smokiness. I literally was going to say one sentence and he would not let me get it out. I couldn't even get to saying smokey or that I'm vegan because he kept interrupting (it was not busy... place seats maybe 14 and wasn't full). Anyways, he sends my drink over and what's inside you ask??? Gin & Egg whites. I didn't even bother complaining because he was irritating enough the first time. My husband ordered another drink for me and had mine. Place was cool just wish i had a different experience. \n\nBartender had long beard and long hair.
