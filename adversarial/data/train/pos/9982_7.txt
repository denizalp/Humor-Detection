Prices here are what you would expect from a College bookstore- high, but they do have pretty much everything you may need, from meds to pencils and calculators, snacks, and shirts, notebooks and even magazines and used, low priced movies. \nBooks are what they are- expensive.\nThe only issue I have with this place is the fricken lines. Why are we constantly changing the way the lines work here? One semester the line is over there, the next semester it is on the other side of the room, and forced behind the book shelves so anyone just coming in cannot see it. Stop being so Bipolar with the lines!\nOther than that, it is a pretty decent place, and the return policies are pretty cool.
