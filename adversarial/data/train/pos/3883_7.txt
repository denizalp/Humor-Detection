From the outside, this Gap outlet store appeared very large.  Upon walking inside, it was not nearly as big as I imagined.  There are clothes for women, men, and children.  Everything was well organized except for our favorite section.  Clearance section for both men and women was so cluttered and unorganized!!!  It was so messy that we ended up just leaving.\n\nWill probably return in the future.  Have a feeling that the entire store will be neater next time.
