Twin Creeks is probably one of our favorite local steakhouses. Why? Convenience, free parking, great customer service along with reasonable prices make us keep coming back.\n\nThe staff remembers us every time we come back, we always bring friends and family here. Sometimes when it's busy service can be a little bit slow but that is part of the ambience as far as I am concerned.\n\nWe enjoy the sit-down area along with the Beautiful light changing Rockwall. This dimly-lit beautiful tiny Steakhouse is a little gem! I'm not sure where they get their Seafood from but it is very fresh and I highly suggest the seafood platter to start.\n\nI am always partial to their petite filet mac and cheese with lobster and their wedge salad. The last visit we had we took friends and went for the tomahawk for two along with Alaskan king crab legs. They did not disappoint and I was incredibly surprised by the huge bone in Tomahawk Steak!\n\nIf you are a local or a tourist give this place a try- make a reservation though because they can get very booked. If you're not hungry enough for a two hour sit-down dinner try their happy hours which are great and include Half Price appetizers and specialty cocktails!\n\nI've been here so many times I've lost count and have enjoyed each and every time!
