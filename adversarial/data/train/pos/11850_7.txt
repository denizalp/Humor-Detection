Wow... time flies when you're having fun.  I just realized I haven't updated my review for U.S. Egg in over two years, so the below is long overdue.  And just because I'm feeling creative today, here's a little something I wrote in honor of U.S. Egg:\n\nU - ultimate place to go for a delicious breakfast\nS - super friendly staff\n\nE - eggs, pancakes, waffles, and so much more!\nG - giant portions\nG - grateful... that's how I feel about having this place so close to home!\n\nI was reminded of how much I enjoy this place after our delightful breakfast this morning.  There was a less than five minute wait to sit down, but the hostess brought me an OJ while I waited which made me very happy!  Once seated, our waitress came over to help us navigate the menu... it had been awhile since our last visit.  Per her recommendation, I went with a half order of the blueberry whole wheat pancakes and a side of egg whites.  A half order is plenty for one person fyi - it comes with a pancake as big as your plate!  It was delicious! J had coffee and a 2 egg breakfast with english muffin and hashbrowns. \n\nI love that they leave a pitcher of water and a carafe of coffee at your table... and fyi this place has plenty of lunch options as well.  If you're looking for a casual place that is consistently good, head over to U.S. Egg... I have to remember to do so more often!
