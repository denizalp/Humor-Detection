So much to offer our ol' downtown Las Vegas.  An upgrade definitely to our downtown.  Jeff C. first introduced me to this family-friendly spot with many awesome unique art work, such as the 'Preying Mantis' fire shooter in front!  I love the art and overall the whole park is art.\n\nThe open area of retail stores, restaurants and bars are similar to Town Square, where you can walk outdoors to each place.  It's smaller and each unit is in a postal kind of shipping container (Hence Container Park).  Very colorful!  \n\nIn the front is a walk-thru coffee spot and on the right, further up, is a walk-up beer and BBQ spot.  On the left is a 'Tree House' which is pretty cool!  Stores are in between and there are two stages, in the front, and towards the back.  Also there are large foam 'Legos' to build with.  \n\nToday was windy and I'd have to say the containers did a good job of blocking the wind.
