Hole-in-the-Rock started off as a rock that fell victim to erosion. Over time it created a hole, hence \"hole-in-the-rock.\" It's amazing how people (including myself) get so intrigued with the wonders of mother nature. If anyone ever ends up in San Diego, check out the \"Potato Chip Rock.\" It's a rock that is in the shape of a potato chip; another magic of mother nature. lol.\n\nThere may be trails, wild plants and dryness, but I wouldn't consider Hole-in-the-Rock a hike. There's a stairwell that leads to the top. (If you are in the right area.) You can survive without a backpack, wear regular clothing and even flip-flops. In January, you won't break a sweat. You may smell, but not the sweaty kind of smell. lol. If you are expecting a workout, you may want to consider somewhere else. It shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes to get to the top, unless you are like me. I ended up at the \"Indent-in-the-Rock\" instead of the actual \"Hole-in-the-Rock.\" Don't ask me how it happened, but it did. LOL! \n\nAnyway, once you reach the top, the views are beautiful. After you are done with the Hole-in-the-Rock or Indent-in-the-Rock, visit it's nearby residents - The Zoo, Desert Botanical Garden, or even Hunt's Tomb. If you are feeling a little more hike-y try out Camelback Mountain. Now that place will get you to smell, the sweaty kind. Lol.
