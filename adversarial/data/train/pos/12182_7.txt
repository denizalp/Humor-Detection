Not sure where the locations are that are giving this company negative reviews, but we're 6 months in now and still happy :) Maintenance is still prompt and responsive when called, they changed our pool service because of the complaints (new service has been GREAT and shows up weekly as scheduled) and we haven't had any problems paying rent online.
