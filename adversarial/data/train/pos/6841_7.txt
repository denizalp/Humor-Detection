Review based solely on the Mont Blanc cake priced at $38 for a small which after must painstaking contemplation, one must declare this very disappointing.\n\nWhile everyone was raving about the macarons, I decided to deviate and try the beloved Mont Blanc cake.\n\nCake was ordered 4 days in advance. However, on the day of the pickup, we were advised they do not have the order. And so, we were made to wait 30+ mins for the staff to look for it. After that, we were told the note got \"misplaced\" which lead to the blunder. \n\nWhile it was a nice gesture to be offered a 10% discount, it didn't prevent expectations from plummeting quickly--I've never been in a position to order a cake and then being told the order did not exist, only to wait for it to be haphazardly made.\n\n[Presentation]\nIn the brighter picture that belonged to their website; you shall see a beautiful Mont Blanc generously garnished with \"chinese almond\" pieces and adorned with what seems to be violet edible floral which was supposed to resemble a snow-capped mountain by the intricate chestnut purée strands. Now, if you look at the cake we received, you shall realize the irony is fitting in this situation, because instead of \"making a mountain out of a molehill,\" the \"mountain HAS indeed become a molehill.\" It more or less resembled half a coconut with shards protruding outward.\n\n[Taste]\nI liked that the cake wasn't overly sweet, and I found the sesame cookie crumbles inside quite pleasant. HOWEVER, the almond flavoured cream layer tasted very artificial as someone had previously mentioned--thought it tasted like amaretto(?) or some kind of strong liqueur upon first bite. The chestnut purée was too soft, and the chestnut pieces garnished on top tasted boiled and wilted. In my humble opinion, it was by far was one of the least delicious cakes I've ever had, and I've had many not so good ones.\n\nLooking forward to more improvements in the future.
