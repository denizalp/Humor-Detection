I am very sad to report that I will never return back to this Coco Nails Spa.  \nI booked an appointment on Sunday night for a Monday morning appointment.\n\nI show up, I get seated - The male manicurist, I will admit - he was a bit rough.  I don't really say anything. He starts doing the colour removal and before he can continue, the manager or the owner prances in. This individual notices that I have put my wallet, keys and mobile on the shelf. He even asks the manicurist, who the stuff belonged to, to which he replied was mine.\n\nFor whatever reason, he starts cleaning the shelf and knocks over my phone. The phone falls onto the floor and now I'm just absolutely livivd. Not only he is self-involved, but doesn't even apologize. Phones are expensive. The manicurist apologizes. Poor guy. \n\nI get up, I march to the front - I swear to you, this manager even tried to charge me for a full manicure. I reply, \"Colour removal\".\n\nThe manager has the audacity to tell me, \"Never return\".\n\nI tell him, that I wouldn't return and that's an asshole. I exit.\n\nI am then bombarded by three different phones calls. Two from the Salon and one from a Buffalo mobile number.  He then proceeds to text message me, rude messages, including a dick pick and some website url. \n\nHe finally stopped. Which was good, because I was about to report a complain at the police station.  \n\nI have recorded all contact and will keep it handy on me.
