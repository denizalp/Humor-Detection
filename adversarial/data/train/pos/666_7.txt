A meal with a show: Shang specializes in hand-pulled noodles, and the open kitchen allows you to watch this while you wait for your order. \n\nMy guy and I shared the spicy won ton appetizer and two noodle dishes for lunch- the Shang beef noodle soup with hand-cut noodles and the chicken and mushroom noodle with knife-cut. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the knife-cut noodle more, it reminded me of a thicker pappardelle. Both bowls were generous portions, and the soup broth was fairly good. I do wish the chicken and mushroom bowl had a few more mushrooms to balance out the amount of noodle received. \n\nThe concept, layout, and menu are very similar to Noodle Man but with a more convenient central location. Didn't notice any desserts, but they are right next door to Very Berry Cafe if you want to continue the Asian theme to complete your meal.
