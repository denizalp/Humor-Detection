Well, that was my last time at Phil's.\n\nAfter frequenting Phil's for over 10 years, I think we need to part ways. Today my husband and I went to Phil's for a nice, dependable Sunday breakfast and were shocked by our server.\n\nAfter the server brought our order to the table, we brought to her attention (in a friendly manner) that items were missed off of our order. She got very defensive. She was so agitated by us bringing up our missing items, that we were honestly hesitant to bring up the fact that the pork chubbies seemed a little under cooked. (Scared, really)\n\nLuckily someone else stepped in and finished serving us halfway through our breakfast. This person was friendly and did not take it personally when we asked if the meat could be cooked a bit longer. \n\nIt's too bad that this situation happened, but there are way too many breakfast\/brunch places in Calgary these days to gamble on having to deal with defensive, impolite servers first thing in the morning. \n\nNext time we're skipping Phil's and going to OEB (yum!) or Kensington Pub (also yum!)
