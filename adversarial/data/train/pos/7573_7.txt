This morning, I was a brow-virgin.\n\nLuckily, the darling Lisa A.  knew I might be a little scared.  She offered me a mimosa, buttered me up with minimuffins and bagels, and charmed the pants off me (metaphorically).\n\nThis fellow New Yorker got the deed done quick (in a good way), and only made me cry a little.  No redness, no swelling, just feeling beautiful and chic.\n\nMM, just how I like it!!
