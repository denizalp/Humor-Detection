I was both curious and hungry when I visited this place. It seems that lots of folks love to eat here. What a disappointment!! I left both hungry and convinced that I will not return.\n\nI'm never a fan of Americanized sushi rolls and its creations, but I could still chow them down when I'm hungry as long as rest of the a la cart menu and the appetizer menu are OK.... Sorry.. the rolls are blend and the rest of the non-sushi stuffs are soooo... bad. I'm not returning.\n\nService was pretty good though...
