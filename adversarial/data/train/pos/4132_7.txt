Fancy Chinese food you say? If not for the great company I was with, I would not have enjoyed my dinner here. We got the $118\/person pre-fixe menu so several courses were served. The duck and scallops were good while the fried dumplings, stir-fry vegetables, spare ribs, prawns and desserts were just okay. I like the layout of the restaurant: each table is enclosed and separated from the rest so you are afforded a more intimate and secluded experience. Our waiter did a really awesome job at filling up the water glasses BUT I couldn't help but noticed that the water glasses were very small. If they used bigger glasses, the wait staff wouldn't have to fill them up so often. But then again, I'm at a fancy restaurant and they aren't known for efficiency optimization.\n\nI think there are much better choices for Chinese food around here, both in terms of price and quality.
