Another disappointing stay at a high end resort in Las Vegas.\n\nTime and time again, I hear that Bellagio is the creme de la creme of resorts in Vegas. So of course I was super excited to stay here especially after my lackluster stays at ARIA and Wynn earlier this year. Now imagine my surprise when I enter my supposedly upgraded suite and discover:\n\n1) The tub is too small to really soak in\n2) No TV while you soak in the petite bath\n3) Bare bone toiletries. Just a soap bar, shampoo + conditioner, and lotion. Not even cotton swabs! \n4) No slippers\n5) Lots of trash around the pool\n\nI am at the right property right? The public areas are beautifully maintained but behind closed doors they left me wanting for more.\n\nThat said, I do like the many pool options they have in the large garden and their fitness center was quite nice.
