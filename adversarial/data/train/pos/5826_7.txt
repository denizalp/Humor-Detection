Such a fun concept. It's like a yeh but it's soft serve and the toppings are much better. The service is pretty fast and the menu has so many good options. The person who made my cone was so careful when he used the machine. I was really impressed by this little shop. If it hadn't been for Yelp, I probably would have never discovered this place. \n\nThe cone itself was delicious. I got a cone with dark chocolate dip and almonds. The chocolate was 55% dark and it didn't overwhelm the vanilla ice cream. The almonds didn't fall off everywhere as I was eating either. It's a small pet peeve of mine when I get sprinkles or nuts and they don't stick to the dip on the cone. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable. It is worth knowing that the mini cone is very small so if you want to try different combinations you can, but it'll be a very small portion. And the small cone is slightly too big so it might be too much ice cream if you want to try two combinations. The mini cone is the size of the maple cone. \n\nI wasn't expecting the ice cream to be poured in the cone so that the centre was hollow but it makes sense since it is then dipped. I thought it was very amusing. Definitely caught me by surprise. \nI just wish it wasn't cash only. \n\nA really fun experience. I will for sure be coming back soon.
