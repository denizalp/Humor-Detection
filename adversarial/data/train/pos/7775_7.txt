Classic government inefficiency.  Lots of excuses and no action.  Staff are rude and lazy.  There was a phone ringing and one staff member asked if it was going to be answered.  His response \"I will die before I answer a phone, I am the only one working the counter.\"   This is our second visit - last time was worse.  \n\nThey open at 830.  At 800 there were 20 people in line.  Good news, by 900 there were 50 people.  Better news - only 2 staff. \n\nFor a $30 fee and high taxes one would think we could get better customer service.  Oh wait - they have lifetime state jobs with good wages and a good pension.  \n\nConsistent with the classic joke - a PENNDOT sign - men working!
