Good prices but Mr. Know it all Alan made me walk out of the store and buy my Springfield at Cal-Ranch.  Sometimes I'll pay 3 dollars more to not have some guy tell me why I'm stupid (exact word).  Funny thing was, after he told me how he trained cops, he actually pointed a 1911 at me while comparing the size of the Springfield.
