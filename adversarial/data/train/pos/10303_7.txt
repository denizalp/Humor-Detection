I definitely love jerk chicken - this is my third review of a restaurant serving jerk chicken. This restaurant is actually the closest to my house - just about a mile away, but I had never been there until I located it on the Yelp mobile app. \n\nThe restaurant is located in a shopping center, right up front facing Arizona Avenue. Plenty of parking and good seating inside. They had reggae music playing and it was a comfortable environment while waiting. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the jerk chicken to go. She said they also had homemade ginger beer, so I ordered one while waiting on the food. The drink was an immediate strong hit of ginger, but settled into a nice refreshing drink.\n\nI ate the chicken when I got home. I ordered it with a side of plantains and rice\/peas. She was just baking the plantains when I ordered. Those were the first bite, and they were wonderful! the rice was good, then I went for the chicken. Wow! It was the spiciest I have ever had. Two bites in and my nose was running and I had hiccups. I loved it. It was a good portion and I ate  every bit of it.\n\nWith this restaurant just down the street and my experience with my first order. I definitely will be back. It would be nice with the spacious seating and good music to sit back with a ginger beer, relax, and eat it there next time. I will definitely be back.
