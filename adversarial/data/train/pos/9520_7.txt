Welcome to the Holy Land. Salam & Shalom to you all on behalf of the God of Abraham or was that Ibrahim? Arab or Jew or Israeli or Palestinian ... we can all agree on one thing ... A MULTILATERAL FALAFEL STATE SOLUTION !!! Yes, folks, next year in chickpea Zion. Come down to your local falafel maker and make peace with your own G-d damn neighbourhood chickpea master. Through the bountiful and unconditional peace of beautiful golden falafel. In the serene name and the holy light of houmous. On the first day Allah (the merciful and the bountiful) created the falafel and on the last day She made the houmous and all was well in Heaven as it is on Earth. Alpha & Omega ... Jesus, Mohammed and Moses ... falafel and houmous. Let us meditate upon the glory of chickpeas. From chickpeas everything came and unto chickpeas everything shall go. \n\nSeriously though, the Levant can get a little silly sometimes, what with all the one God but three religions bullshit and the whole crusades and millennia of senseless murder but goddamn can a Semitic brother make some good food out of some chickpeas. \n\nYou've got houmous, you've got falafel, what more can you ask for? I'll tell you what!!! Everything here is guaranteed vegetarian and murder \/ cruelty free! There are many assorted vegetarian products! They are all very tasty. Vegetarian Général Tao, vegetarian orange chicken, vegetarian shish taouk, vegetarian shawarma, vegetarian butter chicken ... all of these vege \"meats\" are delicious and made 100% shiitake mushrooms. \n\nGet all the Israeli delicatessen specialties you need! Chocolate halava, rougalach, hamentashen, bourek, kniches, tabouleh, houmous, did I mention falafel yet? This place has burgers, pita wraps, salads, tabouli, BABAGANOUCH, tahini, Harissa, eggplant salad, beet salad, potato salad, kubbeh, and French fries. \n\nCome here and all of your dreams will be fulfilled. \n\nPeace be unto you.
