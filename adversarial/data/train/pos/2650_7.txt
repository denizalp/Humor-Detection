I've heard a lot of bad things about Wind but the curiousity just ate away at me.\n\nLast summer, I moved and didn't have enough time to set up internet at my new place. I went around the Eaton's Centre looking for deals... stopping at Rogers and Bell. Finally I ended up at Wind and the manager was very knowledgeable about the products and suggested I get a Wind Mobile Internet Stick.\n\nHe explained that I wouldn't have to pay for the mobile stick right away if I had a credit card and every month I pay for Wind services, I'd get a credit that would go towards the payment of the mobile stick. In addition, the employee suggested I get the $40\/month plan which included unlimited internet (adding that after 10GB's it'd get slower to give Wind customers \"fair usage.\")\n\nEverything was explained well and I ended up getting the mobile internet stick that day.\n\n4\/5
