Frankie's Tiki Room is awesome because the fact that they're 24 hours! A friend and I decided to end our bar hopping in Vegas here, given the fact that it was 4 a.m. \n\nThe bar is kind of on the smaller side especially the interior. They have a bar and a few small tables throughout the room. \nIt's dark inside with only candles lit on the tables. \nThere is no music or DJ here, kind of a quieter scene. \nAt the bar, each stool area has a machine for you to gamble at. \n\nThe specialty drinks are usually around $10 and regulars such as rum and Coke are $5. \n\nBartender makes the drinks really well. \nWill definitely return next time in Vegas.
