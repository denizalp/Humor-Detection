Waffle Love was in the Ace Hardware parking lot (Bluff St and the Blvd) and I had been wanting to try them, so I did. The girl who helped me was cheery and helpful. I was trying to figure out the menu and explained it was my first time, so she suggested I try the \"Red Wonder\" which has strawberries, raspberries, biscoff cookie spread and whipped cream. I thought it sounded good and went with that. Wait time wasn't bad since there wasn't a line. There was actually another waffle truck there that did have a line, but I have heard good buzz about this waffle truck and wanted to try them instead. My name was called when my order was ready and it looked delicious. \n\nWhen I got back to my car, I noticed that I got the wrong order, but it looked good so I just ate it anyway. There were no raspberries and instead, just strawberries meaning I got what's called on their menu \"The Works\" instead of a Red Wonder. The \"liege\" type waffle was good! It was the right crispness on the outside and soft inside. I appreciated the amount of strawberries they put on it and the biscoff cookie spread had a nice flavor that stood out not too much, but just enough to taste great with the waffle and other toppings. I'm glad I got to try this truck and look forward to tasting some of their other creations in the future. \n\nThe waffles start out at just $3.49 which make a great snack for the young ones and the price changes with each topping you add (add-ons range from $1.16 - $2.09) if you want to go custom and create your own waffle. I checked their Facebook page and noticed they have $5 waffle specials often, so make sure and check FB or their website to see what the special is that day. It wasn't advertised on the truck the day I visited, so I missed out. I was given a stamp card so after I buy 10 waffles, I get one free. Nice!
