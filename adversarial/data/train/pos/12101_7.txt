Our A\/C went out last night at about 11:00 pm.  We didn't know who to call because, unfortunately, there aren't that many Yelp reviews for A\/C places.  (Get on it, Yelpers!)\n\nWe called this place because they are 24-hours.  They told us it would be 2-3 am before they could arrive.  My gut said to \"run\" then, but it was hot so we scheduled an appointment.\n\nHis estimate ranged between $400 and $1500, plus tax and the visit fee of $69.  We were told that $69 was the only \"extra\" charge, no premium hourly work rate or anything.\n\nHe finally decided it was a $400 \"part\" and that our total would be $500+ with tax and the visit fee.\n\nHe installed it, it didn't run.  Told my husband that if it didn't kick on in a \"couple hours\" he would be back and take the part and be on his way.  He also said, again, that there was no price difference between 2 am and 8 or 9 am, so we let him do it.\n\nHe installed a $40 part.  40 bucks.  40 smackers.  I Googled to the end of the earth, with the exact part number, this morning.  From NY to Chicago to Arizona quotes online were $200-$250 OUT THE DOOR, installation, tax, etc.\n\nI called the business (very small!!!!) this morning to see what they would be willing to do.  I started nice and escalated from there.  He was 100%, flat-out unwilling to listen, to care, to help.  He kept citing their RIDICULOUS 90-day warranty (WOW!!!!) on the part, and stating that he was a certified technician that came out.\n\nThe question I have is this:\n\nDo I care who your employees are?\n\nThe answer is:  NO.  You hired them.  I assume whomever you send can do the job, from a trained CHIMP to an HVAC tech.  WHATEVER.  \n\nThis place will rob you blind and take no ownership.\n\nI wish I could upload my receipt.\n\n$340 - part\n$69 - visit\n$whatever - tax
