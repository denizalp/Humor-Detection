This review is for the take out window experience.  I used their app to place and pay for my order. The app works OK but is not perfect, especially when compared to most other apps available for smartphones. It also doesn't list dessert options so if you want to add a pie you have to wait until you get there and add it to your order. Payment through the app is easy, or you can wait until you get there.  You can place the order immediately or put in a delay.  Once you hit submit, it gives you an estimated time for when it will be ready.   All in all, it is an easy and efficient process.  Your food comes in a myriad of styrofoam containers.  It was just as warm at home as in the restaurant, and some portions such as the garden salad and cup of chili seemed larger. It all tasted as good as when in the restaurant.  The only negative is the vast amount of styrofoam that I had to throw away.  Two meals worth literally filled the kitchen trash can.
