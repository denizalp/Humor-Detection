So after our dinner at Tao Asian restaurant in the Venetian we somehow ended up at the Craps table at the Palazzo. Beautiful and elegant!\n\nHad I not found a few chips in my purse the next day, I wouldn't have known we were here.  ONLY BECAUSE the casino is intertwined with the Venetian. \n\nI love craps and I love winning.  On this night I made some money for me and for all the people betting on me. Our table was packed and we were sending off positive vibes which led to more people coming over to play and watch.\n\nI can say the highlight was us being invited to some chocolate tasting in the ballroom as guests of the casino-but we declined. The other?  Standing next to a high roller with at least $100,000 in chips!  \n\nWoo-hoo wish I had those kind of chips to play with!  \n\nThis was a fun night and the best part?  Our winnings paid for dinner!
