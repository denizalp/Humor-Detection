Nice brunch spot, just a cool, clean diner with a bit of a brasserie vibe: warm and cozy, fresh and sexy, next to Carré St Louis. A perfect starting point for a walk and shop on St Denis, or a browse and carouse on Prince Arthur. \n\nThe waffles are fat fluffy homemade, the mounds of fruit are immaculately fresh and generous. All the plates we tried came with large portions of potatoes and fruit on the side. The service has been lovable, friendly and fast. \n\nOn a could-be-better note: the mimosa was a little watery today, and the apple, bacon, cheddar crêpe had us pretty excited but flavour-wise fell a little flat - maybe if the apples were more caramelized, the cheddar a little sharper, the bacon more abundant, the crêpe a little lighter?\n\nBut these amount to small tweaks, overall Universel is a sweet solid option. You can't help but love to be tucked into a big, back booth all loaded up with breakfast food.
