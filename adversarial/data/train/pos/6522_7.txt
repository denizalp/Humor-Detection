I should preface this by stating that even this experience, as horrible as it was, isn't anything to lose sleep over. After this, I will forget all about it.\n\n I called the morning of Mother's Day to find out if there was a window of time in which my order would arrive. I was told by Hailey that there were a lot of orders that day and there was no exact time slot, but it would arrive before 5pm. Totally reasonable and completely understandable. No big deal since two of my family members were home all day expecting deliveries. \n\n   When the doorbell rang around 7:30pm and my Gran went to answer it, there was nothing there aside from a \"Sorry we missed you\" note clocked at 7:30pm. When I called the next morning to find out why my arrangement was NOT delivered, I was told by Charlene that the delivery driver arrived at 12:30pm and no one was home. When I told Charlene we had a note from the driver stating otherwise, she hung up on me.\n... \nI called back. Charlene, it seemed, could no longer hear me so she hung up on me again. \n...\nI called back again, from another number, and after trying to cancel the order all together and being told my mother and grandmother were lying about the delivery time, I was hung up on again. \n\nLong story short: I've disputed the charge with my bank and will not be ordering from Edible Arrangements again.\n\nI've never been a believer in \"The customer is always right\" philosophy. That's ludicrous. I do believe, however, that honesty, transparency and open communication will solve 99.9% of disputes. I hope this was a fluke and nobody else has to experience what I did. I'm sure Charlene is a good person that was having a horrible day, but I have to write this review as my family matriarchs do not have the chocolate dipped pineapples they deserve.
