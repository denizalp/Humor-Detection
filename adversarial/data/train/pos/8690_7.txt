When I first called Aniu, a huge salon (the largest in the country, I've been told), I asked for a stylist who is creative and likes to do different\/edgy haircuts. They assigned me to Bentley, who is the bomb. She is the only person I've found in Madison who truly understands curly hair, and mine especially defies logic by being curly when long and straight when short. What I love about Bentley is that if you have an inspiration, you can begin to talk through it and light bulbs go off for her, and she'll share lots of ideas. \n\nHaving lived in major cities, I can't say that Aniu is particularly expensive, though some of its services are absurdly priced, such as the pedicures (I got a Groupon for one, which made it reasonable, though it was also excellent).\n\nA high point of Aniu is that it seems very committed to training its employees. It supports their travel to hair shows and conferences, and so the stylists are trained well and up-to-date. \n\nIt does not have the hipster, local feel that many people crave in a salon. This is a pristine salon that caters to jet setters, suburbanites, and weddings\/events.\n\nI'm giving it four stars instead of five because the color work I've seen out of this salon has varied. I've been really happy with Bentley's vision and when she paints my hair with crazy colors, it's been great. The atmosphere is also not my favorite; it is just a little clinical.
