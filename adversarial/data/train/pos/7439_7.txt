Not too shabby for a walk by bar... They advertise $5 for a Bloody and mimosas. Either this or you can spend a ton at a nicer bar, but this does the job. \n\nIt's literally a walk by bar, they don't have much to work with... The bloodys are from those store bought clamato juice, so it's not going to taste home made or premium. But $5 isn't too bad!
