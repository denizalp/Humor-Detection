Hey Akron--do you want to look like a rock star? Do you love a great haircut? Pick up your phone, RIGHT NOW, call up Dino Palmieri at Summit Mall, and make an appointment with Jenn Kidd.\n\nI have always been a stylist's nightmare, because when i want a cut, i know EXACTLY what i want. and if it's not right, i tend to have a bit of a meltdown. In the many years that I have been going to Jenn, i have never once had a haircut that i've hated. We've done colors from platinum to pink to black and back, and i've gone from hair down my back to a pixie, and i've always looked and felt great.\n\nJenn is a genius, period. She will cut my hair until i don't have any hair to cut. I recommend her to everybody i know.\n\nFeel free to come back to this review and thank me after your transformation :)
