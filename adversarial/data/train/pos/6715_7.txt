Horrible service!! The Asian host needs some customer service training and an attitude adjustment. She has a straight out of high school attitude, poor service skills, and a trashy mouth.\n\nWe took my mom here to celebrate her 52nd bday because she is a big fan of Guy Fieri. The estimated wait time was 45 min, which we were totally okay with and surprised when we got a \"table ready\" text, after waiting only 15-20 min. It was 7:48pm when I received this text.\n\nOur server was great at first. We ordered a few cocktails, an appetizer and 3 burgers.\n\nThey then seated a couple to our right, and then two ladies to our left. Both parties were served there appetizers, and then burgers, and FINISHED before we were ever served our meals. Our server came out 3 times to tell us our food was \"on its way\". If you forgot to place the order or something got messed up in the kitchen, whatever the case, just let us know so it's not a waiting game!! We were chatting with the couple next to us all night and even they were amazed.\n\nBy 9:20, hour and a half later, our server was nowhere to be found, so I told another server if he can let ours know to just box our food. Our server comes out with 3 plates and says \"oh are you sure you want boxes?\" And thinking the food he was holding was ours, we said now we weren't sure. He says \"ok it will be right out.\" And serves the now third table that's come in after us. We were done waiting and requested a manager and walked up to the host area. No kidding another 20 minutes passed and we were pissed!!  At this point we wanted to pay our tab for the drinks and appetizer and leave. We explained this to a different host and she said \"I have no idea where the mgr is, let me get the chef.\" Uhhm ok?\n\nHere comes the other Asian host, Ms. Thing with her poor attitude and rolling eyes. My parents were upset, especially my mom because this was her bday night!! And she loves Guy Fieri!! She was disappointed and telling Ms. Thing, and the young girl just gave attitude and very smartass remarks. Extremely unprofessional! \n\nThe mgr FINALLY comes out, no apology at all, just stated that our server said the two parties next to us \"ate faster\" than we did. Dumbest thing I've ever heard. Seriously.\n\nSays he'll be right back with the check.\n\n10 more minutes. My dad tells the host if the mgr doesn't come back in 2 min we are leaving. She states \"That's fine I ran track in highschool I'll chase you down.\" WHAT?!??? What in the hell? The look on the faces of the people standing in line observing this whole thing, some were laughing at the little girl and one group turned around and left!!\n\nFinally the manager comes out and I don't even know why at this point but we paid the tab and left.\n\nI've met Guy before, he's a cool dude and I'm a fan of his show, but it's really a shame this is how his restaurant is ran. I work for Caesar's Ent. and I LOVE the Linq! I'm always telling my guests that it's definitely a spot to hit while in Vegas and I will sadly not be recommending this restaurant. We made it up to my mom the next night and took her to Burgr at Planet Hollywood.
