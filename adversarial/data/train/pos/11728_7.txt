Pretty legit Taiwanese joint, down to the Taiwanese news\/shows that they were showing on the TV.  Lol.\n\nFood is pretty standard Taiwanese fare: braised pork belly, either in bao or on rice, fried pork chop, popcorn chicken, etc.  They also offer a few of the usual American Chinese choices such as xxx and broccoli, general Tso, Lo mein, and etc. as well.  But if you're here, I would highly suggest that you at least try the more traditional options as they do it pretty well here.  There are plenty of other places that can do American Chinese...\n\nPrice was decent and the kitchen banged out food pretty quick.  Fair enough since most options are either on fryer or already braised and ready to go.  Definitely a solid option for lunch.
