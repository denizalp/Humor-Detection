My 2 stars are for the pleasant demeanor of the person who took our order.\nThe food was below expectations. We ordered the bhindi masala which had absolutely no salt, yellow daal which wasn't good either. The chicken Tikka masala was eatable though.\nAlso we ordered laccha paratha hoping to eat laccha paratha but it looked and tasted like butter nan.\nAlso the service was extremely slow.\n\nOverall a disappointing experience. I would definately not recommend this place to anyone.
