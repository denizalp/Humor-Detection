This place is nice indeed.  Very modern.  A great feat to architectural design, though I'm no expert. It looks good. I haven't stayed here but its got the whole new Las Vegas feel.  Class, ritz.  If it were a piece of furniture, it'd be a deep cappuccino color.  If it were a candy, it'd be velvety chocolate.  \n\nBut I think I prefer old Las Vegas.  Dirty, cheap, lackluster, there's something beautiful about all the crazy lights.  And drunk old guys.  Ummm nevermind.
