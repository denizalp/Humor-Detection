Writing a review of a chain restaurant is like staring at the sun during an eclipse: it sounds like a good idea at the time, but... \n\nThis is the first Whataburger I ever went to in my life and each time I've been since it's either been a nightmare or a pleasant experience. It makes me feel like that ping pong ball in Priscilla: Queen of the Desert. Well, not *exactly* like that. This one time, after Charlie's, Robert M and I stopped by here to sober up a little in the drive-though. I ordered the chicken tenders because I wasn't eating red meat at the time. We brought our order home, I put vodka in my soda and started eating. You know that drunk delay you have? Well, I ate a whole chicken tender before I realized it was raw in the middle! Don't worry; I survived. Then this past weekend I went for a breakfast bacon sandwich and everything was perfectly cooked. And the service was splendid. \n\nI'm certain if I keep coming back and they maintain this level of good food and service, I'll update with a higher rating. But, for now, I'm still tasting that raw chicken in the back of my throat. That, and they don't take reservations. So, there you go, so.
