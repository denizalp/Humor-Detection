Terrible! Horrible! Awful! Beauty salons don't do shaves. When I find a shop that does shaves, I assume it's a BARBER SHOP....M.U.G. is a lousy salon and is a rip off for shaves. A classic Barber shop uses a straight razor. M.U.G. is a salon that uses a disposable razor...BOOOOO!!! A straight razor is a world of difference when it comes to relaxation. I have a disposable razor. I can shave myself every bit as good as they can shave me with their disposable.....I pay $25 for a STRAIGHT razor shave. I will never be back to M.U.G. and I will leave feed back at as many online sites I can find. Men should be warned about M.U.G. is a salon masquerading as barber shop.
