If your staying at the palms you get free entry which is pretty cool\n\nLocated on the ivory tower of the palms casino, the ghost bar has a outside patio that offers a panoramic view of the strip which looks spectacular, There's also a cool see through glass on the floor that shows u how high up u are, quite scary if your afraid of heights\n\nThe dress code is pretty loose, I got in wearing supra skytops, jeans and a diamond supply sweater, same with the gf who had a similar get up (we didn't expect to go clubbin\/lounging so she didn't bring her skank outfit). I think that was the line though cause I did see some dudes gettin rejected in the front for wearing sandals and shorts (c'mon man)\n\nDrinks are about $13-15, if ur a veteran drunk, don't come here sober without pre party, cost me $100 just to get tipsy. \n\nOverall, the Venue is worth checking out for the views, its not that big, but it is well decorated, has friendly service, drinks are the same as any other lounge or clubs u go to, music is ok, I'd say this is a great stop-by place if ur In town for a night out with your boys, but definitely not a finale
