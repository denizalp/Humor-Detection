Money money money moneeeeey, moooonaaaaayyyy. Its a bit pricey but, BUT, super good. I had the tartare and my man had a cocas. Its a Spanish pizza. Both were solid. The mains are big portions so get ready to get your eat on. They spent coin on the decor and its a nice ambiance so, congrats. Cheesecake was yummy. Great date spot. You'll get a second date unless you're boring, Meson can't help you. Sorryyyyyy. (Not sorry). Definitely will be back to try more of the seafood dishes. A bientot!
