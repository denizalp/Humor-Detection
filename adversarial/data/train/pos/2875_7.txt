I had a problem with our heating unit. Well, what I thought was a problem. I requested to have it looked at through my home warranty company and A-Quality Refrigeration promptly called to make a same day appointment.\n\nTurns out (sheepishly) the weird noises and cold air in my heating unit is a normal defrost function and no repairs needed to be made. However, Daniel was really helpful and did what he could to make his time valuable, giving me tips on maintaining the compressor, and even changing out the air filter for me. \n\nThanks for the great service and we'll be sure to request you if something ever breaks for real. :)
