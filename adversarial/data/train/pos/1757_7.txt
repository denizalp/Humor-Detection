Stopped in for something sweet after running errands with the GF.  There are plenty of other places to cure a sweet tooth and as fate would have it we ended up here.  Rolled into the drive thru, which is split allowing for two separate lines to make orders.  Several vehicles were ahead of us but the line moved quickly.  The process from order to pick-up was quick and smooth.  The vanilla shake we ordered and shared was the topic of conversation until it was gone.  The experience was A-OK but the shake (small) was another matter.  It was 550 calories, 10 grams of Protein, 91 carbs. 81! grams of sugar, 16 grams of fat, 310 milligrams of Sodium, vanilla soft serve and vanilla sauce (what the hell is that?) of \"what the F&%$! are we doing\"  experienced betterness.
