This place is a complete joke. My cousin is getting married in June and we decided to check this place out to see if they knew how to add custom alterations to a wedding dress for a reasonable price. It was a waste of time.\n\nThe lady who greeted us was friendly. She had my cousin try on her wedding dress and went to the back room. The owner came out and I had to bite my tongue the entire time we were there. \n\nShe criticized my cousin's choice in the bra she was wearing. I'm sorry, it's not her wedding day and she's not wearing the bra made for the dress. It's just a damn fitting and none of your business. My cousin explained what she wants for alterations and that was beyond her mental capacity, apparently. \"Honey, that's just a jacket.\" No, it's obviously not a jacket if we specifically described everything BUT a jacket. She was incredibly rude and I had to stay on my phone the entire time to not flip out on her. How do you own a bridal alterations business and not know how to speak to customers? \n\nOn top of the attitude problem and inexperience, she tried to quote my cousin at $550. Such a waste of time. I would hope she can read these Yelp reviews and adjust herself and business accordingly.
