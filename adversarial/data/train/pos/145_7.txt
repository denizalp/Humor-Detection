Denise Gulia at the Clark County Recorder's office is THE most compassionate, kind, and helpful government official I have ever dealt with ANYWHERE. And I deal with a bunch!\nAfter botching three attempts to record a document (my fault) I was lucky enough to contact Ms. Gulia. Because the document had a hard deadline, I decided to drive to Las Vegas From Salt Lake City Utah to straighten it out. Ms. Gulia spent a great deal of time making sure I had the right documents and properly filled them out before I left. She even went to the trouble of contacting the state BLM office to be sure I had their proper documents also.\nThe morning I was driving down, Ms. Gulia even called my cell phone to see what time I would be in. When I arrived, she stepped out of an obviously important meeting to personally make sure my document was recorded properly. She spent a great deal of time explaining what I needed to do and how to avoid problems in the future. Then to top it off she insisted that I contact her personally next year for the same recording!\nAfter years of dealing with countless local and state government departments I was totally blown away by her service. Clark County should be extremely proud to have Denise Gulia representing them in the Recorder's office.
