These guys were great! I had two flat tires the same exact day on two different cars! The exact same tire(rear right)! After blowing out a perfectly brand new (second tire) on the freeway, these guys showed up in 20 mins and saved the day! After the second car was towed they went and towed my first car to the garage as well.Should be done soon. I hope I dont need another tow truck but if I do then I'm calling Apache sands ! Kudos to Tony for prompt service with a smile! Actually lots of smiles and giggles over this particular case lmao  !
