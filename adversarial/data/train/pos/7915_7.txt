Let me paint you a picture. \n\nIt's 2 am, the bars just closed and all of a sudden the only thing driving your feet forward is your hunger. For some reason after consuming gallons of alcohol all you wanna do is shove food down your throat. You are wondering around the southside with your friends, 2 girls you met in a bar and a random homeless guy who you thought was the funniest dude alive. All of a sudden you stumble onto a little shack type place with a lit sign outside that says \"mike & tony's.\" \n\nMy friend you have just hit drunk heaven.\n\nFor the rookie orderer at mike and tonys it may seem like the \"soup nazi\" skit from seinfeld. You need to know what you want, these guys move quick, they only take cash and the gyro is an even 5 bucks. Don't studder or they will move on to the next person until you are ready. Once you order, move to the right, wait for your bag and get the hell out! \n\nUsually by the time you get to the corner you have unwrapped it and taken your first bites of this magnificent spectacle. I've seen many a rookies first reaction. You slightly tear up at first, embarassed you wipe the tears of joy from your face. Then you look down at this magical wonder you have just traded for five dollars of currency and try to speak through your full mouth of tender lamb meat, \"this is the greatest thing I have ever eaten.\"\n\nThey have won, Mike & Tonys will forever be a southside tradition now.
