I just love this place. It's a dive and a gem all at the same time. And anything that is the \"world's largest\" is certain to not let you down.\n\nMy favorite time to drop by is on the weekend around 2:00 in the morning. (Don't worry, there is sure to be at least one overweight, sleepy security guard on duty.) Not only does this time provide terrific people-watching and overhearing, but it is also the perfect place to wrap-up (or revive) your Vegas evening.\n\nOnce you've gone broke at the tables and slots, but still have a good buzz going, there is no better place on the Strip to spend some time. I have literally spent hours in here, been easily entertained, and spent nothing. Perhaps I am just easily amused, but there is endless fun here if you are in the right mindset.\n\nAnd if you are in search of just the right cheap Vegas souvenir to enthrall your friends and family back home, you will find it here. There's nothing quite like a naked woman salt and pepper shaker (you can imagine what detaches and are the actual salt and pepper shakers) or a male stripper writing utensil (when you flip it, the clothes on the picture magically disappear). It is a virtual treasure trove of trashy. And that makes it awesome.\n\nPlus, if those high-heels are killing your feet after a night of partying, there is a plentiful soft moccasin section just beckoning those barking dogs. (I just may have a pair or two - it's better than walking the Strip barefoot.)\n\nIn sum, you really just need to go here and experience it. (And pick up a pair of Vegas fuzzy dice for your ride on your way out.)
