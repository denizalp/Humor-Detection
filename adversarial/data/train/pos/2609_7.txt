We were looking for a place to grab dinner and stumbled in here. The outside grabbed our curiosity: how can Mexican and Chinese food be housed under one roof? \n\nNot a fusion by any means, the menu is split and offers an array of choices; small and large. \nThe immediate difficulty we had was understanding what the dishes were. The descriptions weren't easy to grasp. We ended up choosing four things to split, one of which the waiter suggested. \n\n+ The ambience was cool; lots to look at it, and it wasn't too loud. \n+ I had a glorified warm steak salad that was delicious.\n+ All of the food came out in less than 15 minutes despite how busy they were. \n\n- We weren't served water promptly.\n- Our waiter almost got our order wrong. Luckily I caught him as he was entering it in the computer.\n- The shrimp ceviche was bland and needed more acidity. \n- The noodle dish that our waiter recommended was nothing special, it was actually better a few hours later when we reheated it. \n\nThis goes down as an average place to eat on the strip. Not overpriced, but not amazing either.
