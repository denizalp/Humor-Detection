I had a piercing that closed up on a recent vacation. I originally had it done at New Tribe but since my last experience there wasn't the greatest, I was looking for someone new to stab my body part with a needle. Using my trusty Yelp app (shameless plug!), I saw that Exotix had stellar reviews; also, Six (owner and piercer) was a Now Magazine \"Best Of\" winner several times. So with those in mind, I emailed to find out about booking an appointment.\n\nSix responded right away. We discussed my options and he let me know the potential price and when we could meet for him to take a look. He let me know that sometimes piercings could be reopened, even if it appeared closed to me. I didn't know that so learning something new made me feel more comfortable choosing Exotix.\n\nI went in the next day and didn't have to wait long for Six to appear. He was very professional and after studying the piercing, realized it would have to be re-pierced. He was meticulous at getting my piercing straight, and explained each step while he was doing it. It hurt like hell for me but he made sure to make it as smooth and quick as possible.\n\nThe piercing itself was more than other places I had checked out but Exotix uses internally threaded titanium jewelry. I constantly lose the beads on my piercings so I was happy to pay more, knowing I'm getting top quality products with my piercing.\n\nWhen Six was done, he explained the aftercare and let me know that I could call anytime if I had any questions or thought anything was wrong with the piercing. I left there happy, confident--which is a lot when you're also in a bit of pain! Exotix will be my no 1 choice from now on for any other piercings I decide to inflict on myself.
