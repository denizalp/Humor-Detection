Here in Vegas we are spoiled with a variety of top rated buffets. And this place is pretty good for a non-casino buffet. There is a good selection of food items, and they usually change up the featured dishes every so often and include specials during the holidays. \n\nI have been here several times, and haven't been disappointed. My favorites from my most recent visits are the BBQ chicken flatbread, Smokehouse BBQ pulled pork with choice of 4 different BBQ sauces, my fave sauce is the South Carolina vinegar!!!  \n\nOn the weekends till about noon or 1pm they have breakfast items and an omelet station. I usually go here on Saturday and Sundays. \n\nTIP: Come in during that time so you get a choice of both, breakfast\/brunch and lunch items! \n\nThere are a lot of options and you can easily craft your plate to fit low carb or Keto diets, or at least be Keto friendly. I've shared some photos of my Keto friendly plate creations. \n\nGreat service here from almost all the employees except one. He's been rude on several visits so we avoid sitting in his section. \n\nI can't wait till they finish the Henderson location! It would be much closer for me. \n\nGreat for families and my first choice for non-casino buffet!\n\n2018 Yelp Challenge Review #1
