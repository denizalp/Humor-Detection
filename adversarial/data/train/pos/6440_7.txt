Stand Up Live has potential. It's nice, comfortable, and a new venue. However, it's extremely over priced. You have to order two drinks minimum per person. My boyfriend and I are on diets, so we opted for bottled water. We were in shock when the bill came... $24.83 for 4 bottles of SPARKLETS water. If you're going to charge those prices for water, at least make it Voss or Evian. WTF?! \n\nAfter the show we walked by CVS who had 20 bottles of Arrowhead water on sale for $2.66. Wow. \n\nI'm all for supporting local businesses, but I really feel like I was bent over and done dry.
