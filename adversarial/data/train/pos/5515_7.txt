Is this the only museum in Las Vegas? !! Why are people giving high reviews when it's boring and pricey ?! \n\nI went to both the museum and Area 51. It was a lot of reading and text than artifacts and pictures. I got so bored. \n\nExpect to see A lot of rocks and tiny  metal pieces cased in a glass containers then a large amount if text to go with it. \n\nOnly good thing was there was a few film clips. Not worth the money or the time .
