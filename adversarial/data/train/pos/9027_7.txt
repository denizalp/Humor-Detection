I really put off writing this review for a while. I just had nothing to say about it. And honestly, I still don't. As far as Starbucks go, this is the Starbucksiest. It's on Wash, so I'm guessing most of their traffic is like me: passerbyers out doing shopping, etc. (I'm usually hitting this one on the way to church). As such, I really haven't formed a, \"Heyyy, Aaron! Iced americano today?\"-relationship with them. But I've been here so many times. But they've all been forgettable. But it's better to be a forgivable chain shop than one negatively remembered. All in all...This is the most 4-star rating I could possibly ever give. It's just Starbs.
