Live crabs in barrels! Whole fish! Gross weird things I have never seen!\n\nI love this market. i used to live down the street and loved to pick up some yummy fishes and all sorts of noodles and whatever Asian spices smelled perfect for the night.\n\nI had no idea what i was doing half the time but the ingredients made themselves.\n\nThe fish was all fresh and the whole store interesting. I don't think I am a fan of boba. I love this store I love this store. I love this store.
