On a Sunday night after dinner time (around 7:30pm) it was super busy with families and young couples lining up for their post meal sweet rewards\n\nI brought the parents here because we've tried Dolce, and Hollywood and this is by far the best Gelato in Toronto so far. \n\nWhen you get there, it's a mess of people, and you don't know really where to stand, order or who to talk to. I thought, at first, the guy was being really rude, telling us to pay first, and then order. And I was annoyed at the people taking their sweet time. \nBut. \n\nWhen it became our turn, we did the same, and the guy was very patient with us trying all the flavours before we made a choice. We had two flavours set in our minds, and when I asked for a recommendation for a 3rd, he was unable to give us an answer, which made the whole process even slower. \nIn the end, we got a perfect trio, Ferrero Rocher, Pistachio, No Sugar Raseberry. \n\nWhat they also need to do, is separate the Sobettos from the Gelattos to make it easier for a avoidy dairy person like me to choose, or at least have some distinguishing mark. Yes, you can assume all fruit is Sorbets but it's easier to see it physically. \n\nLots of seating, outside, a little cramped in doors.
