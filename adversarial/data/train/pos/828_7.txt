In what is one of the most confusing parking lots I've seen in Mississauga, this Popeye's is located not far from the north east intersection of Dixie and Eglinton.  When I say confusing I mean confusing if you're trying to go southbound on Dixie because there's no way to do it.  You're either exiting at the gas station at the Eglinton side near Mary Brown's or you're going northbound on Dixie as there's no exit that will allow you to legally turn left.\n\nAs far as Popeye's restaurants go this is one of the nicest looking Popeye's I've ever seen as far as cleanliness, decor, space and lighting.  The customer service is friendly and polite I have to say.  This time around we went with the family dinner which is 12 pieces, 2 large sides and half a dozen biscuits.  After tax it came out to just over 40 bucks.  Yes, Popeye's is more expensive here than in the US but that's a given.  I had asked if they had Cajun Sparkle at this location and they didn't know what I was talking about.  I guess that magic dust is only available in the USA?  I did get it once here in Burlington which is the only time I've ever had it outside the US while even some locations in the US don't always have it.\n\nFor the breakdown of the 12 pieces it was as follows:  4 thighs, 3 drumsticks, 3 breasts, 2 wings.  So basically that's 7 dark to 5 white meat ratio.  12 pieces is more than a whole chicken but less than 2 and I had asked before hand what the breakdown would be like and they said it would be about half\/half which is about right.  I had also asked for about half\/half original and spicy too.  In addition to being a lifelong fan of Popeye's, I believe many of the Popeye's establishments here are Halal certified as well.  \n\nThere used to be a Popeye's across the street but I'm not sure if this store moved here or if it's just an outright new place.  Either way it's nicer and newer but harder to egress out of to get back on Dixie southbound or Eglinton eastbound.
