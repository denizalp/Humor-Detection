This place has an amazing selection of fabrics.  Most of these fabrics are the stuff you see covering furniture at La-Z-Boy or Target and they have it here.  They have more upholstery fabric than anything else but you could make out with a smoking deal if you are looking for team-licensed fabric or for trim.  They have a ton of that stuff.  Their stock seems to change pretty quickly.  If you sew or just feel like re-doing your barstools, you have to check this place out.\nWe are talking about $3 a yard for some expensive fabric people!
