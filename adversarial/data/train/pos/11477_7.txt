Hmmmm... what to say that has not already been said about the lovely Momofuku Noodle Bar? I've been a few times, for Winter\/Summerlicious and otherwise. Thanks David Chang for coming to Toronto!\n\nWhat's inspiring me to write this right now is a recent lunch. It was absolutely frigid outside and a nice bowl of ramen was just what the doctor ordered. I had a spicy ground chicken ramen bowl with bok choi, scallions and a perfectly poached egg. For me, the soup was singing my favourite song and it warmed me from the inside out. We also had some pickled vegetables to kick things off- not as thrilling, but crisp and fresh. \n\nThe atmosphere is casual. The chairs have no backs and service can be hit and miss depending on the rush. But pro tip: if it's too busy to get a table right away, just pop a squat in the lobby of the Shangri-La Hotel. If you're lucky, you'll be serenaded by piano.
