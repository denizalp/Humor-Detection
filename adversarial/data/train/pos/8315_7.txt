This is my first visit to a Fletchers tire and i won't go back.  I had a groupon for an alignment and wanted to try them. As soon as the employee saw i had the groupon his demeanor changed.  he was clearly annoyed and not very helpful.  When the car was done he simply said here are your keys, thanks for coming in.  no paperwork, no mention of what was done.  i have had alignments done elsewhere before and they ALWAYS  told me or provided a print out of how far out it was and the adjustments made.  And they mention warranty.  when i asked for details the fletchers guy says, the tech did the work and he doesn't discuss it with me.  no print out, no explanation.   he then says we do this for free.  groupon keeps the money and we do these for free.  Really? What business would do that? and if you don't like it, why keep doing it?  this groupon has run quite a while.   the customer service is  non exisent there.  he grudgingly printed me an invoice but i had to ask twice.  Stay away from this place
