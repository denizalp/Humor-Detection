A solid Vietnamese joint. Period.  Its not the most authentic but it gets the job done!\n\nWhy you should be eating here:\n\nx Pho Dac Biet: clean and balanced, beefy broth, meat and noodle portions are just right (fresh veggies + lime)\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/Rvj3cDAiXInbZD4l6bw-lg?select=EGWxdJ5WZ8XaXuLnfcK5Sg\n\nx Bun Bo Hue: good, tasty broth, well cooked meat, good portion on noodles, sadly bone-in pork and pork blood were not provided but still enjoyable without! (fresh veggies + lime)\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/Rvj3cDAiXInbZD4l6bw-lg?select=YiuFqOiNEoF4YUtGEasI4Q\n\nx Vermicelli: Excellent portion, nicely cooked meat and shrimp, tasty fish sauce, egg roll pieces were crisped and cut to fit bowl (fresh veggies)\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/Rvj3cDAiXInbZD4l6bw-lg?select=LPKP2hyjUy6gyQwHH1afUA\n\nx Chicken Wings in Butter Sauce: Served crispy and hot, very tasty\n\nx Ban Xeo: Crispy shell\/batter, good, tasty pork\/sprouts filling!\n\nService is pretty typical of any other Viet joint except this place is a tad friendlier, actually! Warm welcome and refills water when low.\n\nViet music played in the background, LCD TV will have something playing.  Decor is very clean and modern.\n\nFor the most part this place is really straight forward, no mixed messages or dramas.  Sit down, order, eat, and bounce!
