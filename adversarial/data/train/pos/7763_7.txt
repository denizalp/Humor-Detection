I stayed here for three days this past weekend.  I checked in with the $20 sandwich trick. Didn't work and the receptionist kept it. Lol unreal. Now for the room. Stayed in the jubilee tower. It smelled funny, the handle on the sink came off. Wall paper was peeling and there was what looked to be blood stains on the sheets. I only noticed when I woke the next morning and the sheets were untucked. When I complained to checkout with pictures to prove it the manager offered a 10% discount on an over $500 bill.  Hilarious, you think they would be more accommodating for something so severe. How bout a complimentary stay next time Mr Bosinger?  Is what I was hoping to hear. Not the case though. Needless to say I won't be staying at Bally's again. Oh I forgot to mention they kicked me out of the poker room and for saying fuck twice at the table, and tried to have me removed from the entire casino. What a joke!  Only when I told them that this is where I'm staying did they change their mind. One of the worst experiences I've had in Vegas and being from LA I frequent it often. I don't often write reviews but was compelled to do so here. Mostly because upon checkout when the manager told me a 10% discount was all she could do I threatened to write a yelp review and her response was \"go ahead\". Lol. That's some of the worst managerial customer service I've had the displeasure of. I'd rather stay somewhere else and get treated with respect than ever waste another minute at Bally's hotel. Thanks for reading and stay away from Bally's, you might catch Hep C from the bedsheets.
