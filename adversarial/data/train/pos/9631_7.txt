This is another one of my reviews that prove that you need to do your research! After reading the reviews, we started getting cold feet! We rented a car here on Labor Day. Hubs reserved a car weeks in advance, after reading the Yelp reviews, I started to panic! Even though they sent a confirming Email days before our arrival, we tried to call to confirm, to no avail! The line was busy-all the time! \n\nDollar had told us in the email that they would pick us up at the hotel and drive us to their site. After reading all the negative reviews, we had a back up plan and reserved a car at the rental agency at our hotel as well. The price at the car rental at the hotel was three times as much but we didn't care since we needed transportation. \n\nOn Labor Day morning, we were elated and relieved to see the Dollar Shuttle waiting outside! Our driver drove us to their office down the street! There were two female agents working the desk and they were friendly and professional. We were in and out in less than thirty minutes. It was so fast in fact that my hubs was already waiting in our rental before I could finish peeing. Oh, and the car we got wasn't a Hoopty either! At $25 a day, I thought for sure it would be, but it was a new Hyundai, phew! \n\nIt was a great price, great service, and Dollar definitely came through for us!
