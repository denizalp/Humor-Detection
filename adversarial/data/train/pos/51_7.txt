Full disclosure: I graduated from the University of Calgary. So I spent a lot of time at its campus bar, the Den, and adjoining-but-technically-different upstairs sister, the Black Lounge.\n\nLike all campus bars, the Den is usually filled with ne'er do good students drinking and taking a break during campus. They have a delicious menu, so it is a great place to go. It was especially good when I had cash. My favourites were the pizza and the burgers. The service was usually so-so - the servers are really nice, but often really slow. \n\nAnd then of course, there is the drinking. Lots of people start early, but each night has a special. Wednesday is wing night. Saturday is Cab night. I think they have shows on Friday, but no one really goes to the den on Fridays. Also, lots of people stop by to have a drink before going to shows at Mac Hall. It isn't just for students!\n\nThursday nights - we called'em Thursden. It was also known as Student Appreciation Night, and the jugs of beer and highballs would go on super special. There is usually a lineup after 5 for Thursden, though it depends on what time it is during the semester. It's popular with lots of young people in Calgary. Thursden is for shenanigans. If you do decide to go down, it is tame during the day, but at night it gets pretty crazy.\n\nAHHHH... Nostalgia. I miss it.
