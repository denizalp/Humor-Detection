I was disappointed. I moved recently from NYC, so I wanted, of course, to find here a good coffee. I saw that \"Not Just Coffee\" has very good reviews, but I guess that it is just because they have hipster fashionable logo, and people who give them 4-5 stars drink latte or other similar coffee drink with milk.\n\nWhy my good hopes to find good coffee were ruined at these place? Because these guys simply can not roast the beans or they buy badly roasted beans. They spent $4000 or probably $10000 on La Marzocco espresso machine, but they didn't bother to go to Italy and learn to roast the beans, or at least buy good roasted beans from Italy, like beans from \"caffe Corsini\". Usual Lavazza beans would be enough. I am a huge fan of espresso and only espresso can show if the beans are good.\n\nThey wrote on their website: \"...to craft flavorful brews, each made with decided precision and care...\", \"Believing as much in the hand of an educated barista...\". Well, I guess, they lied or they are the fans of latte and don't know what's it like to drink a good espresso. Beautiful phrases, fashionable logo and expensive espresso machine can't hide the bad quality of the coffee.
