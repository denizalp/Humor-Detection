I'm giving it three stars because it's pretty and we've never had to pay a cover as girls (our dude friends had to pay). I don't really like the music; I've been on Friday and Saturday and it was mostly house\/trance\/high energy. Even if I wanted to dance, it's way too crowded on the dance floor, especially when the patio and pool are closed during the colder months. I don't know how much drinks cost but I'm told they're pricey. And I still gave this shit three stars because it's so fucking gorgeous (and maybe because I'm so fascinated by all the Asian girls posing for pictures in the restroom).
