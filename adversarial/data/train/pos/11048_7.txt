I love, love, love this hotel. \n\nIt's got to be one of the best-value luxury hotels anywhere on the planet. We paid $250 a night for a room that would go for $600+ in most cities.  Rooms have everything you'd expect from a luxury hotel...huge bathrooms with a soaking tub and bath salts, electronically-controlled blackout curtains, tv in the mirror, valet closet, and the bed to spoil you for all other beds. There were lots of little touches too....when I left a book folded open on my bedside table, housekeeping had closed it with an MO bookmark to mark the spot. They even rolled up cellphone chargers every night. \n\nThe service, of course, is fantastic. And the property doesn't nickel-and-dime you like other luxury hotels. Despite being in the middle of the action, the MO feels like an oasis where you can escape the Vegas craziness whenever you enter. \n\nOne word of warning: the bathrooms don't offer complete privacy (some walls are fairly translucent frosted glass), so it you're staying with a friend, it might get awkward.
