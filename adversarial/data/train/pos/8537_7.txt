Excellent owner who runs the place.\n\nI had an engagement shoot during the Victoria Day long weekend (Monday) and decided last minute to get some helium balloons. \n\nI called around to try my luck and low and behold, Catherina, the owner had picked up on her cell. After a brief conversation, where I explained the situation, she agreed to open up shop to help me out. \n\nAll in all, I got the balloons I wanted, at a decent price and I got them on a holiday!\n\nGreat service! Definitely recommend for all your balloon needs.
