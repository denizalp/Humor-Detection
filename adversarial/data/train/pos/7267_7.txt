Wow what an insane store this is.  I've been here once in awhile but have never purchased anything.  I went this time to kill time while The Girl went to the James Perse store for 45 minutes.  Dick Butkus was there signing autographs.  Of course, you had to purchase something to be signed.  The cheapest was an 8.5x11\" glossy for $99.  There were package deals like an authentic Butkus Chicago Bears jersey for $799 with a mini helmet thrown in.\n\nI was very tempted but I decided not to.  I admire Butkus but he's not someone I have to have something from.  I stole a quick picture with my dSLR and left, as even at the ripe old age of 66, he could most likely still kick my ass.\n\nOh and I saw Gary Payton walk right by and when people started noticing him, he ducked into a lingerie store while talking on his cell.
