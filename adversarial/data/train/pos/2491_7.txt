Ahhhh how I love you City of Cleveland..  I moved away and came back.  There are a lot of great things going on here food wise, entertainment wise but not sports wise..  Im glad the city is taking a positive turn but I wish the city officials and police would embrace the people who have lived here, are still here and continue to pay taxes in this great city!  The weekend warriors and tourists may look like nice on paper but the people who are here when there is a foot of snow and still spend money are the ones that count...REKINIZE!
