What makes this place so scary is just how good they are at presentation (pay no attention to that man behind the window!)  You will not be bombarded (initially) by high pressure sales tactics.  You will be offered snacks, coffee, and enough bottled water to drown in.  You will be greeted by smiles, and led to believe that you are a welcomed guest in the household of a wealthy, benevolent cousin, with beautiful toys all around just yours for the asking.   If you've found yourself lured by the promise of a newer, exotic bike with low miles at a fair price, yet you find yourself signing the dotted line for a much older bike with higher miles at a much higher price, accompanied by sharp pain near your perineal.  Call the parametics ! you've just been \"Spanned\".
