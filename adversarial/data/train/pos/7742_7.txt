The BEST STEAK and STONE CRABS I have EVER had!!!\n\nThe 21 ounce signature bone in rib eye was absolutely AMAZING...  the tenderness...  the succulence...  this is true bliss in steak heaven.\n\nThe stone crabs were meaty and mouth-watering.  They crack the shells so you don't have to struggle with it.  In fact, you just peel the shells away from the meat and enjoy.\n\nAnd for dessert, their signature key lime pie is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I was in the Key West 2 weeks ago and had the opportunity to sample some of Key West's top key lime pie locations and it's interesting to say that Joes Seafood (in Las Vegas) was better.  Wow... Now that's impressive!
