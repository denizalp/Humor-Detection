Terrible experience. Came here for the first time with group of ten friday night. Nachos were disgusting. Later into the night, one of my friends had too much to drink and threw up on the floor. One of the servers started yelling at us and didn't even check to see if my friend was alright. He yelled at us to clean it up and threw out our bags that were under the table without our consent.
