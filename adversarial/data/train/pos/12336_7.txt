While the East Coast has been suffering in winter weather, us fortunate residents of the WestCoastIsTheBestCoast have been blessed with temps that make being outdoors in February a dream.  I just finished a fabulous Saturday bike ride on the Wetlands Park trail that I've heard about but never experienced until this morning.\n\nGo for these things:\n-runners, walkers, cyclists, and horse riders are welcome\n-great views of the valley, including the Strip\n-rolling hills that make you feel like you're on your own roller coaster ride if you're on a bike- whee!\n-changing landscapes to help you appreciate the different desert terrain we have: greenery, rocks, dirt, water.\n-you'll pass the water treatment plant.  Maybe that's not a real plus, but it's something different.  You can also see the Las Vegas Wash.\n\nIf you've never been here, add it to your list of things to experience in our great outdoors.  I'll definitely be back for more.
