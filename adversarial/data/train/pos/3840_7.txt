A friend was looking to relax and go for a pedicure, so I decided to join in for an afternoon of girl talk. We ended up getting manicures as well because both of us were in dire need of one. \n\nI arrived early and was directed to pick out my polish colour - they've got a typical selection and I picked dark red for my nails and sparkly blue for the toes. The overall experience was really good. They were thorough, exfoliated & massaged limbs, scraped the calluses off my feet without my having to ask and did a good job of painting my nails considering I was gesturing with my hands as I talked. They even offered us water, coffee, tea, etc. and brought us each a bottle of water, which was a new one on me.\n\nAs usual, I had messed up half my nails within two hours of getting them done, but that's no fault of the salon. I'd go back if I were in the area.\n\nReview #26 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012
