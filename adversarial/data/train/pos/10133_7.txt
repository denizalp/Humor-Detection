If i could give them less i would but 1 is the lowest and trust me these company is much lower than the lowest! shady, bait and switch!, written quote, verbal quote all good until the actual agreement and then its way UP and the written agreement is nothing like the verbal conversation or the initial written quote!They couldn't even spell my simple name correctly.  In the end I was told \"take it or leave it!\" Customer service? If you want a MORTGAGE: GO SOMEWHERE ELSE and I DID. I am telling you about my first hand experience with this less than honest company.  5:00pm the quote was one way, the email agreement 5 minutes later was TOTALLY DIFFERENT.  Do yourself a favour and save any aggravation and GO SOMEWHERE ELSE and be sure of your lender.  This company is not honest.  I am glad I read the agreement before i signed anything.  MOVE ON TO ANOTHER COMPANY, why chance your money to these people?  You have to TRUST someone before you sign an agreement.  You have been warned!  I would rather not say, \"I TOLD YOU SO!\"
