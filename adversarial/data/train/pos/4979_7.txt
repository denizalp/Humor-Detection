This place has gone downhill. I'm currently attending the Nickleback concert. Security is worthless and refuses to do anything about all the people smoking weed and cigarettes, even when they see it happening. I think it is time they bring in drug dogs in addition to the metal detectors. All of the smoke is sickening and does not belong indoors.\n\nI asked a security guard about all the weed being smoked inside and basically said that this Vegas. I'm thinking I am going to stop coming here if they don't take health and safety serious. I've been to many concert venues in Vegas and it seems The Joint has a big weed problem.\n\nI highly recommend some type of mask or respirator if attending a concert here. You will also want to immediately wash your clothes and shower after leaving here.
