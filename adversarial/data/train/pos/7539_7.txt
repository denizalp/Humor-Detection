In the middle of residential homes and a mechanic's shop, I didn't realize Politica was even there until my sister mentioned it (she lives right across the street...and yes, I still missed it after a couple of years). Anyway, I went there on a Friday night for dinner at 6:30pm. I didn't think too much of getting reservations but I'm glad my friend thought ahead. Most of the tables were already reserved for the night. Dark, espresso brown decor (the usual) with a nice bar. Our server was thorough when he explained the specials, recommending a nice wine to go with my dish and we were well attended throughout the night. He gave us enough space for us to chat and didn't rush us out once we were done. \n\nThe complimentary bread came with hummus instead of butter, which was nice. I have a thing for hummus, so it made my boat float. I had the gnocci w\/herbs, garlic, extra virgin olive oil & shaved parm. The gnocci was lightly pan seared which gave it a nice subtle crispness to it. A good change from the way gnocci is usually prepared.  My friend had the veal capaletti which tasted as good as it looked (though the big chunk of brussel sprout threw him off. We didn't have room for dessert but we both ordered lattes. You can get a large or small (just less milk) for the same price. I enjoyed the latte - better than your typical coffee joint. \n\nOverall this place was nice and I have no complaints. I'd go back to check out the desserts - my sister raves about it. Another thing, is that you can't go wrong with a  restaurant that plays Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels on the bar's TV.
