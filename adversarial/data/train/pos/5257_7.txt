I only reviewed this place on June 3rd--why do such a negative update?  In a word, service--or lack thereof.\n\nOur bad experience started with a waitress named \"Dulce\" or \"Dulcie\" or something like that.  She and another male employee were all that were running the place that night.  We sat down, and she, without any kind of \"pardon\" or \"excuse me\", starts pushing my cell phone and our hands and menus out of her way on the table so she can put down the utensils.  Quite rude, and not the end of it.  The male employee was somewhat nicer, but he and her began to engage in a kind of fake belligerence in front of customers--yelling at each other from across the restaurant and using profanity.  Not pleasant at all.  Our food was okay, but showed some degree of not caring--my daughter's chocolate chip waffle didn't have the chips mixed in.  They were thrown on and then burnt on the griddle.\n\nI have been to this location a number of times and this is my first bad experience--unfortunately, it was a lulu.  Hopefully it won't be repeated or I will be going elsewhere for my waffles from here on.
