One if the smaller parks I've seen here in Vegas, but it packs a lot of punch in a small package. There are a few covered bench areas to reserve, there's also a covered playground, tennis courts, basketball courts and a baseball field. \n\nNot one the nicest parks and not one of the worst just a solid, middle of the road park in a pretty busy part of town.
