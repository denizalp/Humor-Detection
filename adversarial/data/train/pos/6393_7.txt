Just left the place and am absolutely unhappy with the customer service. The gentleman by the register was completely unprofessional and unhelpful. I came to return vape items that were not consumable, the mix was extremely unclean and harsh. \n\nI was told that I cannot return anything. No explanation. No reason. Just can't. The man I spoke with said HE cooks the juices himself. Huh? In that case stand behind the product. \n\nThe business violates FTC regulations for return policies by not having one displayed by their register or anywhere else in the store. I was not able to get even an exchange for my product. Basically wasted money and got no assistance. \n\nOne of the worst experiences I've had with a retailer.
