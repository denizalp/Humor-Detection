I have been here sober and hungry.\n\nI have been here drunk and hungry.\n\nI have been here with a hangover and hungry. \n\nIf you come here hungry your going to leave full BUT:\n\nIt's that kind of full that makes you feel sick. Like a taco bell taco eating contest. Or a sandwich from a gas station. Or a large buttered popcorn on an empty stomach. \n\nI get it I really do. Your drunk and hungry and want to save a few bucks.\n \nWhats that the buffet has a 29 dollar special to eat all you want for the whole day?\n\nReally? Dream come true right?\n\nMore like a death sentence. I never got the all day meal deal but by the end of the day you would want to pull a scarface at this joint and come out guns blazing. \n\nAll the food is not good. It's bad. Not good. Terrible. Horrible. \n\nNothing is fresh, everything is nasty. Even the drinks taste bad. All the food has previously been frozen (since the ice age I assume)\n\nIf all you can eat tv dinners is your cuppa tea then by all means.\n\nBut if you think your drunk enough to like this food you just might be wrong. \n\n It's that bad.
