I came here for breakfast on a Monday in October to use myVEGAS coupon buy one get one free buffet. The cashier didn't understand what I was telling her about myVEGAS coupon and finally she understood. W got there at 8am and line to pay was short. By 9am, breakfast changes to brunch and few dollars more. The Asian had congee which needed to cook longer and sui mai taste good. The omelette line was long. The slices of pizza was good too. My sister had crab legs and it was plenty to pick. The pork belly was tender. We waited to 9am to see the difference was paella, chorizo rice, Barbocoa beef was tender, tortillas, ham was good, mussels and crab was good too. The server was good on refills. I was too full to eat dessert.
