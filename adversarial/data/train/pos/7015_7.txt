3.75 stars, truth be told.\n\nIt was quite interesting to stay at the Venetian after having stayed at Palazzo so many times.  It was like going back in time to see the original designs; I kept comparing the rooms to see what the Palazzo had upgraded when it was built.  Pretty much everything.\n\nThe rooms are strikingly similar.  Where the Venetian has the wrought iron \"divider\" between areas, the Palazzo has a marble-esque \"bench\" where you can actually sit or put some stuff.  The Venetian's TVs are smaller (so not a big deal), the beds are in a worse state (comes with being older, I suppose), and the tower is smaller (so the views aren't as good).  What is better, I'd say, is the bathtub.  I'm a sucker for a soaking tub and, while the Palazzo's is awesome, no question, Venetian's has this little shelf in the tub so your arms can rest underwater.  It's a small detail, but I like it =)\n\nWhat I perceived as the main difference between the two, really, was the amount of people.  It was Labor Day weekend and every place was crowded, but Venetian was a madhouse. People everywhere.  That, and the shorter ceilings, makes one feel a bit claustrophobic at times.  Palazzo is less crowded and chaotic.  I like that a bit better.  \n\nAt the end of the day, however, my rooms are free, so who cares?  We'll be back (but probably at Palazzo)!
