I just started seeing Dr. Reddy, my family has seen him for a couple years now. He is awesome, I highly recommend him as a family doctor. As for the front desk girls they are rude and careless. They have an attitude every time I make an appointment. They specifically told me the other day \"we won't double book you\" then I go in and the girl upfront tells me there's nothing they can do about it. They double booked me and I was late for work. If I would have known that I would of came in the next day on my day off. She ignored me and told me she can't do anything with snarky attitude. I'll continue to go back for Reddy but you girls need to change your attitude. Your patients deserve kind respectful people not ones who act like they hate the world.\n\nThanks;)
