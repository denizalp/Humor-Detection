Boooo! I seriously feel like this place bent me over the communal table in the middle of the restaurant and gave it to me wrong. Service was slow, waitress was awful, portions were small, flavors were mediocre at best.... and the worst part, the waiter\/owner could tell we'd been waiting an hour too many for our APPETIZER and asked if we wanted some rice... oh, that's nice... we thought, at least they're being sensitive... NO! HE CHARGED US $8! FOR RICE!\n\nAVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE SCHITZY SCABBED METH HEAD PLAYING WITH HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THIS PLACE. IF YOU EAT HERE AFTER READING THIS YOU DESERVE WHATEVER HAPPENS TO YOU!!!!!!
