Indulge into Pineapple Heaven. This has got to be the freshest drink you can get from The Strip! They sell a variety of drinks but the best one is the dole whip. \n\nHad to pass on the Dole Whip float and go with the Ultimate! Inside the contents are the actual pineapple itself, pineapple pieces, shake, then the rum goes in for an additional $6 and then comes the Dole Whip! \n\nPerfect treat to beat the heat. Everything inside the pineapple we'll have u wanting more. Even the rum finds itself inside the pineapple itself.\n\nDidn't really care to try other things but they do have a bunch 2 for 1 drinks and they are open super late. This Proly the best drink to get if your staying at Ballys.
