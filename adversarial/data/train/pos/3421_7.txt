This place is terrible!!!! They make you wait outside in the heat because the place is so small!!! All this outdoor seating and no mister system!!! Menu is very limited and you cannot separate checks!!! I wouldn't be coming here if it wasn't for the other half family wanting to eat here!!! Terrible, just terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!
