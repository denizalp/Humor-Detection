I've driven past this place many times, and I always thought it kind of felt out of place on Mill.  I'd heard mixed reviews, and obviously it isn't super popular here on yelp.  But when I saw the Living Social deal (two drinks, any appetizer and any two entrees) it was time to try them out.  Upon arrival, got a nice quick tour of the building, with a little history of the oldest building in Tempe by the host who sat us, thought that was a nice touch.\n\nWe were there a little early, so we successfully brought down the demographic as most of the patrons were quite older.  Granted, it was game night @ ASU so I'm sure that had something to do with it.  Started with a couple of drinks and the blackened prime rib appetizer which was tasty - even though I prefer my prime rib medium... the creamy horseradish sauce was bomb.\n\nFor entrees, we got the seabass and porterhouse, as they were the most expensive items available.  And as it turns out, they were both spectacular.  Perfectly cooked, amazing presentation and excellent service throughout.  The sides were mashed potatoes and chipotle mac & cheese, both really tasty.  The GM stopped by a couple times to check on us, and was quite cordial. \n\nAll in all, it was a really nice meal, and much better than expected.  I had enough left of the porterhouse to make a perfect steak and eggs Sunday breakfast, so that's always a nice bonus.  As far as steakhouses in the area, this place is 2nd only to Durant's in my book - which says a lot.
