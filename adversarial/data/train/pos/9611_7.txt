Got the VIP packages and that was now way worth the additional 100 plus for this experience. If your lucky once inside you can find a staff member with a red hat who is supposed to be your concierge to get to the head of the line. Well that only works on entry and one interactive exhibit. You stand in line for everything else. The VIP tent is tiny with $7 drinks and your VIP T shirt. NOT even close to being worth it. You do however save the $10 parking fee, whoohoo , it's a dust bowl dirt lot. Overall the group running it mentioned several things were not right, like the screen printed poster not being available (part of VIP), the 3D not working on something's , and the RFID wrist band, what's with that? It didn't do anything.  Overall the $25 ticket might be okay, but not the VIP.
