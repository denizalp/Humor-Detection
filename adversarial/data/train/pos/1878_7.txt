J'adore!!! Been meaning to come here since it opened and here I am, finally eating my noodles, and can't wait to go on a computer to write this review. \n\nThe seating is renovated and looks modern, unlike the old and rotting congee place that used to be here. The service is impeccable, with \"thank you's\" and \"you're welcome's\" that you rarely hear in a Chinese establishment. As said in other reviews, it's very similar to deer garden. I actually prefer ordering on paper like this for detailed menus, because it makes it a lot less confusing for both the waiters and I. The food was actually a good portion. Lots of soup (laksa base was delicious by the way) and a good amount of noodles (don't wanna overload on carbs, right?) and the price was not had. The Japanese ramen noodles were actually very good and tasted authentic, which makes me feel like the price was worth it.  $8.99 (includes 2 toppings and a drink). I'm satisfied, because now my stomach is happy and feels like it's going to burst. I agree that the side dishes are very small. The chicken wings are tiny but I enjoyed them- they're like the typical HK style wings. The Japanese dumpling side dish is amazing! Pan fried to perfection, it makes me crave more and more with each bite. \n\nFor Markham food, I am VERY impressed and I don't think it's pricey at all.. it's cheaper than most meals I eat... AND NOW I'M TOO FULL, SEND HELP! Chef papa, I'll be back for you.
