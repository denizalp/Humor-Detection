I would like alter my review a bit from before --- Though I will take more than partial blame for the condition of my hair right now -- I do feel that my stylist was a bit scissor-happy -- because after the shock of getting it cut so short-- it is not what I was thinking it would look like or behave-- at all.  The back is so undercut (something I have always absolutely hated having done) that will take another year or more to grow out -- I 'm getting extensions to deal with my anxiety over the style of it right now.  Though his intentions were good I feel -- he should have been more conservative than so extreme in the cutting.
