KJ is located inside of the Rio. It's a little fancier than your run of the mill dim sum joint. It's clean, well-decorated, and the service is excellent.! Feel free to bring your non-Asian friends here--they'll be comfortable! \n\nI'm a big fan of small plates. You get to try everything without feeling like a total glutton. But I can remember coming here a few times (ok, maybe more than a few) where our eyes overestimated our stomach. Perfectly steamed dumplings, chicken feet (yeah, I said it), pork ribs, tripe, and vegetables rolling around on steel carts. Excellence!\n\nMy favorites being the aforementioned + the shrimp noodle, Shu Mai, shrimp dumpling & leek dumplings. Basically, you can order anything and be satisfied. I can truly say everything is excellent except for the temp that the food comes off the carts. Some days it's steaming hot. Other days, lukewarm. Either way, it's a small sacrifice for Chinese restaurant servers that actually want to serve you and a place you feel comfortable bringing your friends who would be mortified by the hole in the wall down the street. :) enjoy!
