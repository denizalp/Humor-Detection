Alright: Just so we're clear, I swear I'm not a snobby suburban white kid.\n\nGot it? Got it.\n\nSo, I have never been to this park, at any time of any day of the week, where I have felt completely safe with the people there. Occasionally, the group of guys playing basketball will be middle aged men. Occasionally, there will be happy young families enjoy happy warm days on the lake. More often than not, though, I feel like I'm steps away from some mysterious *bad part* of town. Like there could be drug deals going on. Like people are there cruising for a hookup. Like if there were more forested areas and less bystanders, I could probably get robbed.\n\n(insert another attempt at convincing you I'm not a rich, snobby, suburban, hateful, etc., white kid, entitled to a perfect public park)\n\nThe plusses: there is a lot here as far as what parks can offer goes. And it's a big park, with a lot of lake frontage. And it's in a great location (especially being a block from my apartment).\n\nBut these plusses really don't make up for it. I'll generally cross the isthmus to Law Park, head north to Tenney, bike out to Picnic, or find one of the smaller lakeside parks if I'm looking to just sit and relax. I'm just not a fan.
