Hot and sour soup had a gallon of vinegar\nMongolian beef had a pound of sugar\n\nGross, gross, gross.\nThank god we only stopped by while road tripping.. \n\nIck\n\nUpdate: im close to throwing up from that gross taste of sugary (whatever the hell they used in that \"mongolian beef\" sauce). Seriously it was chunks of leathery meat swimming (really) in gross brown syrupy sauce. With several pathetic pieces of onions. Thats it, folks. Thats mongolian beef for the ghetto house of hong kong.  This is not chinese food. No, this should not even be food.
