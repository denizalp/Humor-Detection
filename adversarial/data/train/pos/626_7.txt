Only been here one time, but so far so good.  Had one of the inside out burgers (very tasty) and some cheesy buffalo chicken appetizer that was pretty good so I can't complain.  \n\nI need to go back and try many more items because everything looked so good.\n\nKind of a small place so it was loud and crowded, which I guess could be a good thing for a restaurant these days.
