When I saw an ABC store on the strip in Las Vegas, I had to make sure it was *the* same one locally back home in Hawaii. It was! It had the usual touristy items in the front like T-shirts, Hawaiian Mac Nuts, cute cellphone charms and baseball caps with \"Maui\" on it.\n\nI found it so funny that there would  be a cap with Maui on it that I took a picture. Who would buy a cap that has Maui on it when you come to Las Vegas? Maybe some sneaky cheating spouse who *was* supposed to go to Maui but took a detour to Las Vegas?? \"Oh honey, here's your cap....from Maui...where I went last week!\" How much of the Maui caps do they sell? I'd give this place five stars if the Maui Cap saved my cheating ass.\n\nI was so glad they had ALCOHOL. A bottle of Yellowtail Shiraz was $9.99, which is not marked up that much considering it costs $6.00 at a local Costco. Beer, mixed drinks and Sake! Just don't forget to pack your corkscrew.\n\nI was thrilled when I saw an ICEE machine. It was $1.99 for a medium sized ICEE, which I slurped down joyfully, never mind that it was 40 degrees outside. \n\nMe and my traveling companion ended up flocking to their ISLAND GIRL cosmetic area: nail polish in every imaginable color, with or without glitter, fake flowers in massage oil, lipstick, lotions, etc. I walked out buying three bottles of nail polish that said \"Hawaii\" on them. I bet ABC stores subliminally plants these messages into people's heads so they will visit Hawaii and buy more ABC stuff.\n\nNext time I go to Vegas, I'll go back to the ABC stores as their booze prices were less marked-up than the mom-pop type stores that carried booze. Oh yes, and if I am in need of things that say \"Maui\" when I visit Las Vegas.
