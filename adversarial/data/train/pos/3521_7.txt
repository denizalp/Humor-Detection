Shine is about as hip as you would expect a delicious coffee shop in a truck to be. The shiny silver trailer is small but might and very mobile! The coffee that lives in this trailer is caffeinated delight in a cup. Shine travels all around the Valley and chances are, you'll see them sitting outside of several events and Valley businesses throughout the week. That's a bonus about having a mobile shop! Their coffee is freshly roasted and provides the exact kick you would hope for. That's about all I have to say, but if you ever find yourself in the same parking lot as Shine, make sure you stop in for a java!
