I also hate giving a bad review to anything downtown, because it's such an underated and underused community that's developing around my hood, and I want every new business to succeed.  However, I feel the disappointment still within me a day after my so called \"celebrity chef\" meal.  This is in the top 5 worst meals I've ever paid for.  \nTo start, the hummus was served with store bought lavash, and it wasn't finished by 3 people, and that was not because of the size or lack of hunger, and all three of us love hummus.  The albacore on skewers was overcooked, dry, and served w a \"homemade\" aoli, that to me tasted like Helman's with a bit of red pepper.  If the majority of the ingredients in a sauce are pre-made, it's not homemade.  That's like buying ceaser salad dressing at the store and adding some parmesan to it and calling it your homemade dressing.  weak.  Lastly the sirloin with chimichurri sauce was also overcooked to about medium well and flavorless other than a seemingly similarly made chimichurri sauce.  \nThis place is just half ass in general.  I put quite a bit more effort and thought into making a sack lunch.  Man, this is my first review on yelp, and i feel like an asshole cuz it's scathing, but I was that disapointed with this place that is trying to be something it is absolutely not.  \nOn a final note, our server was extremely friendly and attentive, though the \"celebrity chef\" had not educated her on much more than maybe 2 items on the menu.  I hope that somehow, someway they can turn this place around, but as of now, the only thing worth going for is the free, crappy sangria.
