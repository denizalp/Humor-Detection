This intersection seriously needs a Starbucks with a drivethrough but there's just no room here. Or maybe they need a parking deck, but there's no room for that either. This very small Starbucks has a few parking spaces nearby but they are in a high traffic lane and so you can expect to have to walk a bit.\n\nFrom the lack of parking, you can expect it to be smaller on the inside that most Starbucks with only a very few seats. This just isn't the sort of Starbucks where you're going to be hanging out with your laptop for hours and hours.\n\nThe crew gets the job done, keeping the place tidy and working through the queue. It's not the best Starbucks, but it is the one that's here and that's okay.
