Viva Las Vagueness!\n\nMan, they ruined that song by turning it into a Viagra commercial. Can I get a witness? I mean, seriously. I hear that song and I start seeing blue, which brings me to my review of Blue Martini. \n\nHere's how it breaks out, and let's start with the good:\n\n1. Hot patrons (for me, the women).\n2. Hot waitresses (yes, they're female as well)\n3. Large and roomy venue.\n4. Indoor AND outdoor space.\n5. Waitresses=hot.\n6. Did i mention there were a large number of attractive women of the female persuasion there?\n7. The place was mostly populated by locals, which gets you away from the rotund, behemouth, gargantuan, midwestern, muumuu-clad tourists that seem to permeate the Las Vagueness vicinity.\n8. See numbers 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 above.\n9. They have a happy hour that offsets #2 under the \"not as good\" section below. Unfortunately, we weren't at it.  Bah.\n10. They're open LATE, i.e., like 4:00am.\n\nThe not as good:\n\n1. My \"Blue Martini\" was blue, but it wasn't a martini. It was also overly sweet.  They have other \"martinis\" that I didn't try, but perhaps those are better. \n2. $12 martinis feels like NYC, price-wise, and let's be serious; this is Vegas, not NY.\n3. $6 domestic beers.\n3a. $8 foreign beers.\n4. The lovely waitresses lost one of my party's credit card.  That kind of put a damper on the evening temporarily.\n5. Service was a little uneven, but we got hugs from the waitress, so uh, let's just leave it at that.\n6. At a venue filled with hot chiquitaz, they managed to seat us next to a table full of gay men, which would have been ok, except one of them was rubbing his ass up against me after having hit on me.  I could have lived without that, mos' def.\n7. It's a little ways out of town, and as any of you who have been to Vegas recently knows, cab rides are freakin' astronomical. Don't be surprised when it costs some bucks to get there, but hell, you're in Vegas where ponying up is part of the reason you go, am I right?\n\nOverall, this is a fun joint. The band was playing bad cover tunes, but hey, it's Vegas, you can forgive them. It was more than made up for by the quality of the eye candy therein, etc, and what have you. In between band sets they played some cool 80's tunes, which seemed to work nicely.\n\nIf you're in Las Vagueness, hit up Blue Martini. I'll be sure to go there again next time I'm in town.
