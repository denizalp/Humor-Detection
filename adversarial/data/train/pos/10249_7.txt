No idea how this place can get any stars to be honest.\n\nWe were about to leave Vegas that evening so we decided to eat at the Cosmo where we were staying. Located in the new food hall Block 16 on the 2nd floor in the Cosmopolitan, you can't miss it. But if you go there, please eat something else...anything but Tekka!\n\nTHESE ROLLS ARE MADE BY MACHINES. The only thing the humans behind the counter do is put the rice and fish into the machines. The machine then rolls it AND cuts it. For something as simple as a roll (handrolls are even easier), I don't see how this is necessary...not only are the rolls not sealed well, they also fall apart super easily. Food was meh, not enough flavor in anything that we ordered (we got a mix - salmon, yellowtail, scallop, crab, tuna).\n\nOh, and when you do take-out (even if you just want to sit in the back of the free seating in the food hall), they do not allow you to order the handrolls. You can only get stuff on their take-out menu which does NOT include handrolls...lol. Only regular rolls................. \n\nThey give you a plethora of sauces (including a weird super sweet yuzu, and another sauce), but for the soy sauce that most people use the most, they give it to you in a little container that doesn't even fit a single piece of the roll. Makes no sense.\n\nI would suggest getting some fried chicken from Hattie B's, we all really liked it! The crust was crunchy and flavorful, and the meat was really tender and juicy.  It's a little messy and too oily, but when you're in vegas, you're allowed to indulge a little!\n\nIf you want real delicious Japanese food, spend a little more money and time and go to Kabuto and Raku off the strip!!!
