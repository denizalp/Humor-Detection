Godiva!  How I do love thee....  If there's a special occasion you can't go wrong with anything from here whether it's dipped strawberries, a cone, a shake, coffee, cookies, truffles, chcolate bars, boxes of chocolates or just your free monthly piece!  Yes, that's indulgently true.  It's a bit of magical chocolateyness each month for stopping by.  You sign up, get a piece, spend $10 per year & voil√† free stuff.  Of course, I periodically make up my own holiday like this month's double red box firecracker chocolate cookie fiesta day.  Its not really a tongue twister but it sounds excellent.
