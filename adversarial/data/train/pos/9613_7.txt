This Toys R Us is located at Arizona Mills Mall and since I rarely go AZ Mills and hate the traffic gridlock in that area, I tried to call ahead to see if they had the specific toys I was looking for, but all you get is a recording with the hours the store is open, no actual human answers the phone.\n\nSo, I get in my car and fight the traffic to see if they have what I am looking for. This is supposed to be their discount store for the chain, but the prices were only about 10% less than the full price at other stores. One item I was looking for was some type of Gund stuffed animal that would be suitable for my 1 year old granddaughter and some Fisher Price furniture and figurines for my 4 year old granddaughter's dollhouse. They didn't have any of the items I was looking for. \n\nThe only employee in the store seemed busy writing something in a notebook and when I asked some questions about these products he seemed uninterested. There was another customer in the store who clearly was also having trouble finding what she was looking for either and the employee seemed oblivious to her presence.\n\nWe both left without making a purchase. Poor customer service, limited selection of toys, and confusing layout that makes finding what you need impossible adds up to a less than acceptable toy shopping experience.
