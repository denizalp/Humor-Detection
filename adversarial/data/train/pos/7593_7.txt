My first and only visit to Nome Izakaya (Nome moving forward) was like going to the gym - except for the inside of my stomach. The end goal was to get my stomach as flexible (read: stretched) as possible. How'd we plan on achieving this not so loft goal - I'm a seasoned stretcher at this point.\n\nWell it wasn't going to be easy, we were going to order often, order a lot, get some help from the owner himself who offered to help spot us with some of the heavy lifting and take down sets of food while achieving PBs (personal bests) at each interval of training.\n\n***I need to make this review SOUND like I was exercising so that I don't feel as bad about all the food we consumed in one night (and in the days that followed due to leftovers).***\n\nDue to the high volume of food, rather than go on and on about each item, I'm going to copy and paste from the menu directly and give brief comment on each item.\n\nTAKOYAKI $ 5.50\nDeep fried octopus ball served with tonkatsu sauce, mayo.\nKU - Loved these. Eat them hot the taste changes once they cool - not for the better\n\nYAM FRIES $ 5.80\nDeep fried sweet potato with a house dipping sauce.\nKU - they were OK, Yam fries, nothing wrong or crazy about them\n\nJAPANESE CHICKEN POPPERS (KARA-AGE) $ 7.50\nJapanese style fried chicken with wasabi mayo.\nKU - Loved these. OMG. I ate them for days after 10 stars.\n\nCALAMARI (IKA FRY) $ 8.50\nDeep fried calamari served with Japanese style tartar sauce.\nKU - Great taste, well cooked, excellent hot and fresh.\n\nMARINATED BLACK COD (GINDARA NO YUAN YAKI) $ 10.80\nBlack Cod marinated with citrus soy sauce.\nKU - This was new for us to try and it was excellent. A small portion but amidst the rest of the food it was perfect.\n\nJAPA-BURGERS $ 9.80\nNom√©'s original homemade sliders made with sliced rib eye meat and topped with tomato, spring mix, onion, smoky bbq sauce and garlic seasoning.\nKU - I would marry this burger if I wasn't already engaged. HOLY SHIT these were good.\n\nFRESH OYSTERS $market price + was on special\nKU - Had a set of Fanny Bays and an assortment of others that were on special Too amazing for words\n\nDESSERT $??\nKU - Chef\/owner brought us something special and off menu that I can't speak to other than it was amazing.\n\nSome additional info worth noting: The venue isn't very big so be advised to either make a reso here or get there early. The staff are super good at their jobs and will be all over your order so don't hesitate to order up as much as you like - their minds are like steel traps of knowledge. I'd avoid the cocktails here TBH, not my scene even though they're popular, next time I'll stick with the Asian beers they have!\n\nAn amazing experience overall - big thanks to the owner for coming out to personally say hi and offered some complimentary snacks to try off the new menu (as if we needed any more food).\n\nEatcrest Out!
