My husband and I had two dinners at this location within a pretty short period of time. This branch is convenient for us as it is only about 20 min away from our house. We also were pretty happy with the service and the food the first time, we decided to come back. \n\nDuring those two visits, we ordered pretty much the same thing with small changes. We ordered a catfish basket the first time and tried the cod fish basket the second time. The catfish basket was definitely our favorite in comparison to the Cod. We felt that the cod was not seasoned well and was lacking salt in particular which brings me to a very good point, why is there no salt shakers on any of the tables?? \n\nWe also ordered shrimps. In both times, we chose the trifecta sauce, mild, but the second time, they were flexible and accepted to offer that to us with the shrimp boil as I am trying to avoid dairy (the regular sauce is a butter based sauce). Between the two, really, butter is better! We also always order corn. It also tasted better when it was in the butter trifecta sauce. \n\nThis time, my husband decided to try their Angry Edamame. I didn't try any but my husband said they basically use the trifecta sauce on it and he said it was pretty good. \n\nMy absolute favorite order here is their fried calamari. It is always crispy, fresh and seasoned perfectly. We always enjoy it very much. \n\nOur server in both times was Lita! She is very attentive and is always close to her tables without being annoying. Her service was excellent! \n\nI always say to myself that I will order trifecta with extra garlic the next time and I keep forgetting. One thing I love about a competing restaurant is the punchy flavor that is always spot on. At Angry Crab Shack, the food is good but it just needs that extra kick (not heat) to hit the mark perfectly. \n\nFor the price, the quality is pretty good and is worth returning here.
