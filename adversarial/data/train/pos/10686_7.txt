Buyer beware! The worst business I've ever dealt with. Asked for writing on a cake and they said they would charge but didn't tell me how much. I called days in advance to cancel writing and they told me I wouldn't be charged. When I looked at my bank statement the day of pick up it showed a $5 charge. Seriously what bakery charges to put writing on a cake in the first place. \n\nI called back and spoke to the SAME sales person and she told me she would just give me $5 in cash and tried to ignored the fact she lied to me about the charge. When I addressed it she blew up at me  and told me she was canceling my order and didn't want anything to do with me! With ME. The customer she charged and told me she didn't. Unreal! \n\nLiterally unreal.
