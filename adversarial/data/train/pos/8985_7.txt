The Cromwell was one of the worst managed hotels I've had the displeasure of staying at. The front Desk managers were unbelievably insensitive, and downright rude. They lost me as a guest within 10 minutes, and if my room hadn't been prepaid, I would have looked to go almost anywhere else. The management of this hotel has a lot to learn.   I was told when I made the reservation, that the \"resort fee\" was something to be discussed with the front desk and that they generally would waive it if I asked. When I got to the front desk not only would they not waive it, but they made it sound as if I were trying to rip them off. The manager had the gall to tell me that they do waive the fee in certain cases but that I didn't meet the criteria.  Excuse me? For a front desk manager to tell me that they waived it it under certain circumstances but that they wouldn't do it for me was just stupid. From a business perspective they have no sense of what should or should not be said. when I politely expressed my displeasure and said that the inflexibility shown to me would mean that the hotel would lose me as a future guest, the manager shrugged, and said \"that's your choice.\" Wow that's good business sense. So let's lose a guest over a $25 resort fee rather than try to make some accommodation.\n\nThe room itself was pretentious and not very comfortable. And as almost every guest reviewer has mentioned, it was noisy. The room was clean, and the housekeeping staff were very nice. Too bad their sense of how to treat a guest was not shared by the front desk.\n\nI left a voicemail for the general manager of the hotel to call me back. Let's see if he ever does. Bottom line unless I hear from him, this hotel is history in my book. I could never recommend it to anybody I know based on how I was treated.
