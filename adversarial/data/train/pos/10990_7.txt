It's surprisingly hard to find a place on the Strip that still serves breakfast after 11 a.m.  Come on, we're in VEGAS!  No one goes to bed before 3 a.m. here!  Do we really have to be up and out of the hotel room by 10 a.m. for a decent breakfast meal?\n\nThat's how we ended up at La Creperie.  They actually had a crepe (the \"Du Soleil\") with veggies, scrambled egg, cheese and bechamel sauce on top.  Not the best crepe I've ever had, but fulfilled the egg requirement and was pretty tasty overall.  There was a fruity one that would have sufficed for breakfast as well, but I needed the protein.\n\nService was fast and friendly, and prices are better here than most places we found.
