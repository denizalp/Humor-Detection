I really, honestly don't think I can do it anymore. You were the theatre of my misspent youth, the place I saw \"The Mummy Returns\" two nights in a row for some ungodly reason, the place that I spent way too much time in after spending way too much time in the nearby Jack Astor's. Fond memories of the \"The World is Not Enough\" (okay, not the movie itself) and way more than I can even remember. But now, erstwhile Coliseum? I don't think I can do it anymore. \n\nYour parking remains surprisingly adequate (which is more than I can say for a lot of other theatres) but that's probably because half of the amassed throng there to see \"Hunger Games Part IX\" aren't old enough to drive and took the bus. Otherwise I really have little reason to go back, unless you're the only theatre not showing the latest, overlong Hobbit movie in non-3D (I hate 3D). But even then, it ain't worth it. It's too crowded and no one says 'thank you' when you hold the door and that's assuming you can even wiggle your way in on a Friday night. \n\nSo nuts to it all. You, Queensway and the former AMC on the Mississauga - Oakville border are all equidistant to my house and I don't have to fight the seemingly never-ending traffic on Hurontario to get to the latter two. So I'm done. It's not really your fault, but I'm still done. Still, I'll hold on to the memories. Sitting in the back row watching \"The Green Mile\" and making out during the entire three hour movie? Good times. And yes, I probably couldn't have picked a less appropriate movie to make out to but what are you going to do?
