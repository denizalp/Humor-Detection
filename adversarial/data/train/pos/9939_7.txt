I was excited to come here on a semi-recent trip to Pittsburgh visiting sister and brother-in-law. I'm sorry to say, I was let down.\n\nWe came for brunch. We each opted for the pasta trio. Sounded like a good deal, so why not?\n\nThe sangria was good. The little buffet of sorts was a total let down. Bread and flavored butters on the table were pretty good.\n\nAs for the pasta...\nMore landed on my fianc√© and sisters clothes than did land on their plates. 2\/3 were complete duds. The pesto was pretty good. \n\nService was okay at best. Nothing was done about the spillage, so I wonder if this a regular occurrence. If so, find better servers because if you don't, you'll be losing a lot of business.\n\nI'd consider coming for dinner, maybe, next time I'm in town.
