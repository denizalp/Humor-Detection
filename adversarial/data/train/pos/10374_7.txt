My experience with this facility only goes as far as their inability to schedule and cancel appointments. \n\nFirst, I called to make an appointment to have a filler consultation and the girl that answers the phone ask your name as part of her greeting, why bother she didn't remember it! I was also surprised they charge for a consultation with the doctor but the RN can see you for free. I scheduled my appointment for Wednesday and gave her my credit card information, as their standard practice is to charge a fee for short cancellation and no shows.  After thinking about this practice, I decided to cancel since I had done some research and Dr. Jeffers did not have positive comments online and I really wanted to ask her about the procedure she would be performing and not the RN. When I called to cancel my appointment we discovered they scheduled me a week later than expected! Good thing I didn't drive over an hour to find that out.  Needless to say, I happily cancelled my appointment.\n\nNext, I was sent another appointment reminder roughly 24 hours prior to my already cancelled appointment, really?  I cancelled this appointment a week ago?!?!  I don't know if they were hoping I would not call again so they could charge my card but I called them immediately to cancel yet again. Furthermore, I sent an email to validate my cancelation. I feel as though they would have tried to charge my card for their mistake.  \n\nMy suggestions Suddenly Slimmer:\nWrite down the name of the person on the phone if your going to ask for it.\nDon't start our relationship asking for a credit card, it looks tacky.\nLastly, take your loses in stride.
