Was not a fan of this buffet, I stopped by for breakfast recently and the only items worth eating were the omelettes, flank steak (awesome because I enjoy me some beef for breakfast lol), and the smoothies.\n\nBut yeah, it was very subpar...most of the dishes consisted of potatoes! I'm saying...hash browns, ranchero potatoes, potato hash, etc...hella spuds! Selection was very poor compared to other Vegas buffets.\n\nI wasn't even hungover or anything, but you're basically dining in the dark here. Seriously, turn up the lights a little bit!\n\nFor similar pricing, you're better off eating next door at the Paris buffet! I'm glad I only came by for breakfast (~$20). Based on their breakfast items, I wouldn't have high expectations for lunch\/dinner.\n\nFinal thoughts? AVOID
