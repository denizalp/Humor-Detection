This place is a unique one of a kind place. Great selection of beers to choose from-whether you want domestic, imported or craft beer. Awesome digital jukebox. There are a series of rooms which gives you the opportunity to explore and enjoy your buzz at the same time.  One room is a small bar\/seating area, one is more of a small dining room (the food looked YUMMY by the way), one room is a pool room and the other is s eating, darts room. VERY cool set-up....I can also imagine siiting on the porch area when it cools down. Right in the middle of Heritage Square. This is the kind of place you go when you want a cool chill, just-sit-back-and-drink afternoon\/night when there's no place you have to be. Definitely worth checking out!
