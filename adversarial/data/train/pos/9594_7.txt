I had a horrible experience this past week just going in to inquire about prices.  I was met by a sales person-whatever they are called who began by weighing me and \"measuring\" my BMI.  Though I don't know how they can measure in such a way as they did.  \n\nMind you, the only reason I went in was to inquire about prices-nowhere in there did I say I wanted to be weighed, measured, etc.  I'm normally a runner, however have found with starting a new job, and the summer heat I'm having  difficulty finding time to do this outside.  I was only looking for a facility at which I could use a treadmill and maybe take in a few classes here and there for the next couple months till it cools off enough for me to run outside at a decent hour.  \n\nThe salesman treated me like I was some fat lady who had never seen the inside of a gym before.  Without even asking he assumed my lifestyle was \"sedentary\" and then proceeded to tell me my BMI was the highest on the \"chart\" far beyond what a healthy BMI should be. \n\nI'm not stupid.  I know my body-I'm not thin, but I'm not obese-I'm quite average, and I'm quite active.  I took huge offense to this.  I also told him I would like to lose about 15 lbs and no more and he whipped out another chart saying someone my age and my height is actually supposed to be about 30 lbs less than I am.\n\nare you freaking kidding me.\n\nWait.  it gets better.  When he FINALLY got around to the pricing (hidden startup fees, etc)  I asked him about a couples rate as my boyfriend was interested in joining too.  He gave me the rates.  After the shpeel I said \"thank you very much, I'm not ready to make the decision at this time.\" and he said........\n\nhe said.......\n\n\"Is your boyfriend keeping you from signing up with me today?\"\n\nI said...\"no,  he may still join, but  I think I'm going to stick with the Y downtown near my house.\"\n\nIf this is the sales tactic at LA Fitness they are badly mistaken-I left there feeling like CRAP.  I have been off the wagon for a month or so and am ready to get back up and at em...but I felt like this guy was trying to play on my self-esteem or something-like he was actually trying to get me to feel bad about myself so I'd sign up for a membership.\n\nBoo LA Fitness....boo indeed.\n\nBecause of this experience I will not got back to LA Fitness-the salesman surpassed the stereotype I had in mind of sales people at chain gyms like this.
