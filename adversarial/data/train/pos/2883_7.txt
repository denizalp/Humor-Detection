This was okay!! Expected so much more than what I got. The customer service was horrible, the last was rude and didn't warm my pastry up enough so the  cheese can be soft. I asked the employee of i could get a cup of hot water, she told me they only sell tea, i asked her do you only sell tea bags or do they come with water, and she literally just ignored my question like she didn't understand me. Overall this is a quick bite of you need something to get you by for a few hours.. They have no  seating incase you wanted to hangout...
