This was so much fun despite the rain! \n\nI came on the Saturday it was open at around noon (if I recall correctly) and was there for a good hour. We obviously knew it was going to be raining by that time since it had been raining all day and on the news etc so we made sure to dress appropriately and to bring umbrellas. The rain really wasnt that bad at all.\n\nWe got several tacos from lots of different vendors then did another lap to get a couple more from our favorites! Price wise, everything was as expected and advertised. \n\nIf it wasn't raining we would have probably spent a ton more time there. We pretty much did a couple laps to eat then left. But the Taco Fest was generous enough to give every single Saturday ticket holder free entry for Sunday. What a nice touch! We didnt end up going again but it was nice that it was an option.\n\nThank you Yelp for the tickets! We will totes attend again next year. Maybe next time get a margarita ;)
