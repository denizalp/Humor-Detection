The food was fine, think chevy's quality, but I wouldn't eat here again nor would I recommend it, so two stars. \n\n-Guacamole: large portion, was brought to our table ice cold; either avocados were in the freezer, or guac was made in the morning & refridgerated. Taste was decent, but I couldn't tell til it thawed. \n-Chicken taqutos: again crazy portion sizes; fat, thick rolled tacos. Ends were crisp the way it's supposed to be, middle was soggy. \n- Tacos: disn't take more than a bite of each. Fish taco tasted like a frozen fish stick, & was kind of fishy. Crispy taco w\/ shredded beef was just huge & salty & greasy. \n\nObviously, quantity over quality is the name of the game here. \n\nWaitress was overwhelming. We were one of three parties there before noon & she annoyingly showered us with attention, asking every 5 minutes, \"and how are things tasting?\" I was polite & didn't tell her. \n\nI'm seeing a pattern with vegas eateries: as long as a restaurant doesn't completely suck, they're bestowed a near-perfect four-star rating. That rating system doesn't work for me.
