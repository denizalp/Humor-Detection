We are staying in room 34-232 where every morning we have been awaken by drilling noises. I called guest services to ask what was going on. The woman explained that there was construction taking place on another floor in this tower and that's where it's coming from. If the hotel knew of this construction, why did they not inform us of it or better yet, place us in another tower. We all know when you come to Vegas, you don't get to bed early and you want to wake up late. My husband and I took a weekend getaway thinking we would get to sleep in and relax and it has been worse than being at home and being woken up by my own kids. If construction is to take place, do it between 11-3, when people check out and before others check in. I am very disappointed to say the least. I should also mention that waiving our resort fees does not suffice. I would appreciate a reply.
