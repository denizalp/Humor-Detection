Bad customer service, food tasted bad, could it be because of this see the picture and judge by yourselves \n\nBy the way I ordered for take out and didn't realized until I got home ... I can also tell you the place is dirty. Still wanted to give it a try I was really hungry and had been wanting to try for a while .
