This is a great little lunch spot near where I live. I don't work in Parkway Center but I live nearby and work from home, so on my \"treat yo self\" days I will order lunch from here.\n\nThe thing about The Alcove is that pretty much everything on the menu sounds good. Some of my favorites are the Cajun Turkey Caesar Wrap, Honey Mustard Chicken Wrap, Turkey Club Wrap, and Chicken Pesto Panini. AND YOU GUYS. The fries are life changing. I'm not sure what's happening there but they're SO good.\n\nWhen you see it, you think, oh. This is probably the standard little cafe\/deli in every office building. But it's so much better than that! Their food is cafe\/deli food kicked up about a hundred notches, so much so that I go out of my way to visit. I really recommend if you're ever in the area!
