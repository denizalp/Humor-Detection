I recently held a conference in Charlotte and needed the dreaded \"Boxed Lunch\" for 120 guests traveling on buses. \nI could have ordered a wrapped sandwich with a cup of condiments, individually wrapped salt, pepper, mustard & mayonnaise, a cup of salad, a cup of fruit, individually wrapped plastic-ware, a wrapped cookie and a bottle of water all neatly crammed in a White Box that our guests are expected to unwrap, smear, spread, layer, open, stir and toss while bouncing said box on their closed-legged laps!\n\nDean & Deluca saved the day with their Bento Boxes! These things are Ahmazing! Everything you need while balancing just one simple container; just remove the lid! Filled with moist, tender and delicious morsels (about 7-9ounces) of beef or chicken, 3 fresh salads, a slice of cheesecake w\/ brownie swirl and the cutest miniature salt & pepper casters nestled along with plastic-ware and a napkin and served with a unique soda.\n\nIMPRESSIVE and Affordable...I SAVED over $2,000.00 by choosing Dean & Deluca's Bento (I suggest renaming them \"D\"ento) boxes had I chose to use the Westin Hotel to cater those aforementioned White Boxes.\n\nThese are my secret weapons now.\n...I just wish there was a Dean & Deluca in Every City!
