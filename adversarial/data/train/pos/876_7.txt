Met some friends and colleagues for drinks and appetizers here last night.  It has been a couple of years since I was here....before the renovation.  I was anxious to see what it looked like.  The Better Half was here recently and said it was nice.  Happy Hour is from 4-7 pm and has $3 Beer, $5 on select glasses of Wine, and $8 Appetizers....normal Appetizers are anywhere from $11-$16, so $8 is a good deal.\n\nSince there were going to be around 10-12 of us, with some coming and going throughout the evening, we grabbed a table at the bar near the entrance.  The renovation was a success.  I like the new interior much better....it has a nicer feel to it.  The old design felt very stuffy and segregated the room into many sections.  They expanded the bar and made it larger.\n\nOne thing that hasn't changed though is that this place is not your typical bar in Las Vegas....it's targeting the higher end demographic.  What does that mean?  When I asked the server if they had any IPA's, she said \"No, and we don't have any Beer on tap\".....I said \"What?!  Seriously?!\"....she said \"We're not THAT kind of bar\".....ha ha!  I forgot how pretentious this place was....no big deal, I should have remembered.  So consider yourself warned.....\n\nThat ended up becoming the joke of the night.  I told the rest of our group about the exchange with the server so we told everyone who arrived to ask the server \"Where's the Beer Pong table?\" or \"Do you have a Golden Tee here?\"....ha ha!  The server thought it was funny.\n\nBack to the experience....we ordered several appetizers.....Oysters, Sliders, Chicken Satay, and Calamari.  Since I don't eat Seafood, I only tried the Sliders and Chicken Satay.  The Sliders were Angus Beef with Grilled Onions & Cheese....very tasty.  The bun was moist & chewy, went well with the Beef.  The Chicken Satay had a nice tangy flavor to it....very delicious.  The rest of the group who tried the Seafood said it was good.\n\nWe hung out at Sedona for 4 hours or so....we all had a blast.\n\nWill I return?  You bet!
