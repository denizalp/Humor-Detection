Since we knew Baseball Spring Training was a busy time, we made a 3\/23\/11 reservation at this restaurant on March 6, 2011 via phone (they don't use Open Table) at 3:00 p.m. (I have phone records to prove it).  We asked for an inside table at 7:00 p.m. and were assured it was reserved.  However, when we arrived for our reservation last night, it was not to be found - and the hostess blew us off as though we were trying to scam our way in!  Since they don't use Open Table or email, I have no written proof but didn't think as a \"customer\" it was up to us to re-confirm the reservation!  Although we have enjoyed this restaurant in the past, their recent notice in SF Chron seems to have gone to their head!  They need to improve their reservation system so this doesn't happen to others who have the foresight to make advance reservations!\n\nJean\nSan Francisco
