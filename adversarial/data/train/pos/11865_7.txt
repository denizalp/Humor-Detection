This place is the theme park version of your favorite Delta city- only smokier. And without the amazing food to redeem itself. On the bright side, they provide shuttles so apparently they're aware of their limited ability to hold people's interest.\n\nInitially came by because they were hosting the western conference- there was also a Golden State game on, so I planned to hang in the sportsbook to get some action and watch both simultaneously. Unfortunately, the sports book here is stuck in time- the majority of TVs seemed dated and the larger screens were not even on. There is a limited number of nice chairs, and a lot of individual TV screens with buttons that do not work and no way to access the expanded channels with the preferred games.\n\nAs a result, BF and I sat apart to watch the games, and were peering up at two lone screens showing the GS game that were probably a good 80 feet away. I could barely make out the scores, let alone follow the plays and determine whether the calls were valid. Not a place to watch a game, at all.\n\nAlso, this is a SPORTS book. Is there any reason whatsoever for the fact that every other screen was showing not a game, but music videos? And old ones, at that: we're talkin' the Cranberries and Bob Marley. Not sure who fell asleep at the controls, but that's pretty bad for a place that's hosting a sports game to be so clueless in their execution of a sports book.
