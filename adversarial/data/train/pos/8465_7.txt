DO NOT USE THIS BUSINESS. This business is beyond incompetent. They were assigned last night by AAA to change a tire on my wife's car in a sketchy neighborhood. She was told they would be there in an hour. An hour and quarter later she was called and told 15 more minutes. Half an hour after that she was called by the operator who had gone to the WRONG CITY. Operator finally showed up TWO HOURS after the initial call. Okay, that part was AAA's fault, they dispatched to the wrong address and city.\n\nThis doesn't even begin the story of incompetence. The operator told her that he didn't have the right size lug wrench to remove the wheel. After a bunch of phone calls, he and his bosses decided they would send a flat bed truck to haul the car to our repair shop.\n\nI had to leave home and drive 40 minutes to her location. I changed the tire myself, in the freezing rain, using the tools that were in the vehicle. Why didn't his lug wrench fit? Because you have to remove decorative plastic caps that fit over the lug nuts on this vehicle. How could a roadside assistance operator not know this? \n\nI finally got the tire changed and we were on our way FOUR HOURS after the initial call to AAA. The flatbed truck had still not shown up at this point, and who knows if it ever did.\n\nAgain, DO NOT USE THIS BUSINESS. They are completely incompetent and unable to perform even the most basic of roadside assistance services.
