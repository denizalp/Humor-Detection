I've said it before and I'll say it again: Sabor's habanero pineapple salsa is the best condiment in Charlotte. Mike D argues and says it's the green sauce at Viva Chicken. The battle continues.\n\nRule #1: make sure to check in on your Yelp app. They have an offer for free chips. I mean, your queso is going to need a bag of friends. And let's face it, queso is a must order. I like everything here, so my orders are all over the place. I love the empanadas and elote loco (corn). On Mondays, you can get a Three Amigos burrito and a drink for $6 (I always get ground beef). Taco Tuesday is one of the best deals in the city with $1 tacos authenticos. The nachos are the hidden gem menu item, they're massive.\n\nI love their salsa bar. Salsa bars just make everything better, it's science. You can place pick up orders and pay online to speed up your to go process. \n\nOnly downfall of this place is the parking situation. The lot is small and it can sometimes be impossible to find a spot. Be patient, your queso and salsa bar are worth it.
