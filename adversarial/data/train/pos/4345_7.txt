Maybe my higher rating is cushioned by the fact that this was where I would celebrate all my birthday's and every neighbor kid's birthday growing up... so i guess you would call this nostalgia. \n\nIt looks like a shed, and I was a little scared of all the people who I would call regulars skating around there... You walk in to a little room and slip your money under the window.. $9 for those without skates.. the same price for a movie, but a greater amount of time... AND cardio!\n\nYou get your skates and set up, they have lockers for your belongings, so either bring what you need and leave the rest.. well uhhhh.. very well hidden in your car. \n\nThen you skate, skate, and skate. In circles. There's some N'Sync and Britney playing. But you just keep skating. Then there's some hokey pokey to dance to with all the little kids of old Henderson... and some limbo!!\n\nKeep an open mind, and if you can't do that, then pre-medicate with a little alcohol.. A LITTLE. Because your bound to fall at least 14 times without inebriation.
