So disappointing that the City and County or whoever is in charge of this park STILL has a difficult time maintaining it...\n\nYes, it's a cool place to hang out and kick it with the family, but it is a huge turn off when it smells like A$$\nas soon as you get out of the car. It's a combination of things-\n\na) trash cans are overflowing  with garbage and poop from responsible dog owners and there really isn't anyone visibly replenishing garbage bags in a timely manner \n\nb) irresponsible dog owners and the waterfowl leave poop all over the park  grounds causing one to swerve left and right when approaching the land mines\n\nc) the water area is in dire need of a clean up. Still lots of debris and the stench of the stagnant water just makes it that much worse\n\nAlso, feeding the wildlife here seems cool and all,  but it destroys the wildlifes' ability to fend for themselves and become accustomed to human handouts which also affects their migratory process over the years. I've seen five different families doing this, and the wildlife just gets very aggressive towards each other which is also a bad sign. Keep all your human food at home and just don't feed the animals!!!\n\nSpeaking of signs, TEENY TINY signs saying \"do not feed the birds\" posted around the playground fence (???) as well as that tall sign posted  up front that people walk right past by is very ineffective...people never notice it and keep feeding the wildlife. Bigger signs need to be posted all along the waterfront and information on the effects of feeding the wildlife should also be visible so that  just maybe, a responsible adult may think twice,   just like that big visible sign saying \"do not jump in the water\". No one's broken that rule...yet.  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter: \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  2
