From the outside, this reminds me of the pubs visited by corrupt villains in the movies. It has the grimiest exterior! I could go on with explicit metaphors but do not want to be sued for libel!\n\nAs you can see, I have not outgrown my foolish, childish pop culture imagination. But I am not against checking places out.\n\nAnd I went there.\n\nWith work friends.\n\nIt was such a lovely time!\n\nOk, so back to the actual pub. This place is a long, inside box! There's the bar section with tables. If you continue walking past a small hallway on the right side, you enter a pool room and family room table setting!\n\nSo I joined the gang for the predictable green beer. The Rolling Rock hit the spot. The nachos were edible, but for a platter, they seemed mighty medium sized! The company was amazing! But the service was slow. Considering the day, I am neither upset not surprised.
