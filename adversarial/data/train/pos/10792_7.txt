This is a deli. Let me state this is actually a great deli! You traditionally order at a counter and they bring it to your table. Extra bonus for the outdoor patio set up which is super cute.\n\nLet me start by saying it's super clean... I love that! The owner came to our table politely engaged in conversation and gave my daughter a nice little gift. What a great guy and great staff- everyone was happy and enjoying what they did. I feel like if you're going to go to any italian place, this is how it should be or why bother.\n\nThat being said $80 including tip got us the following:\n\n* a bottle of pink moscato which was cheap Barefoot but I didn't care because it was half off during happy hour.\n*A big ass Caesar salad with chicken added\n*Kids cheese pizza meal which included chips and a drink.\n*Spaghetti and meatballs.\n*Lobster ravioli.\n*Meat lasagna which was definitely the fave.\n\nWe really liked getting in and getting out quickly with a little one while still enjoying a good from- scratch dinner! \n\nThis is my new go-to for quick authentic Italian!
