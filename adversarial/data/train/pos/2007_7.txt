Came here with my boyfriend.  As we were walking up we saw a couple sprawled, horizontally across each other, enthusiastically making out (dry humping) on the patio furniture in the almost empty, outdoor smoking area in full view of anyone that walked by.\n\nWe should have just left right then and there.  But no, we're hardy souls (and easily amused) so we ventured inside and were offered a seat at a high table that had a padded booth that runs the length of the South wall.  The problem with the booth seat was that it had a slight floor-bound tilt to it, so being in jeans I was in imminent danger of being dumped on my ass the entire time I was there.  I eventually turned sideways to brace myself on the stupid booth so I didn't shoot off the end, like a ski slope, and wind up in a crumpled heap underneath our high-top table.  Ridiculously awkward.\n\nOur waitress was prompt, but our drinks were largely forgettable.  We opted not to order any food, despite the fact that they offered a 'Shannon Burger'.  I wasn't even tempted enough to stay with a burger that featured my name.\n\nEventually the doxy that was getting it on out on the patio, came sashaying into the bar area for more drinks, and she had that hardened look of a girl with daddy issues that'd been rode hard and hung up wet...sad.  She also had a familiarity in her interactions with the other waitresses and the bartender that made us both think she was somehow employed there or maybe a regular customer; not sure which, but we were sure by then it was time for us to leave.\n\nThe one redeeming thing I will mention about this place is that the d√©cor was decent, staying in the Irish theme, and there are a TON of TV's showing different games, bar trivia, and one was even showing a movie so there is a distraction factor if watching drunken floozies isn't your style.
