I had come to expect good quality from this place but this time around found it very disappointing.\n\nThe price was right-2 comped buffets. The service was great, quick to take the plates on top of the drink refills and extra napkins.\n\nThe salad & soup bar was great. Bleu Cheese Chunks for the salad and great chicken noodle soup with tender white meat chicken.\n\nThey have lots of sushi, fried sushi, wontons,potstickers,dim sum and lots of aian cuisine.Most of it is very weak with little pop to it.\n\nThe beef brisket was tender & juicy  and had a nice smoky flavor. The Roast Beef was a little uhhh..No seasoning on the meats.\n\nThe cornish game hens were super juicy and very good.The fried chicken however was tough and dried out.\n\nMost of the side dishes like mac n cheese, beans,potato salad, coleslaw, and collard greens were just bland its like its all the same food with no fllavor.\n\nThe pizza was doughy and the vegtables and meats were not cooked. The whole Italian section of ravioli,rotini and spaghetti is all pretty weak. Dinner they usually do made to order pasta with shrimp etc.\n\nThe desserts were pretty dry & crusty with a very limited selection.Real diappointing.\n\nThere's lots of other things available but I did not try tham because they didn't even look appealing. \n\nI see there is quite a varied opinion on this place and I would say 6 months ago the food was 4x better now it just seems like all the same quality as other station bufffets, one of which I tried just yesterday at the Palace Station. \n\nSame tasting food. Red Rock had better presentation plus a little more selection.\n\nFor my money I'm sticking to the Palms-filet mignon & crab legs
