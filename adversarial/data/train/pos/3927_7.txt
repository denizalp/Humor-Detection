Out of sight, out of mind. Maybe that's why this place doesn't get the love it deserves. Tucked away in an old strip mall by The Lakes, you have to hunt to find this place. It's a tiny shop with virtually no room to dine in. Take out or delivery are your only options. Specializing in New York-style pies, you'll find crusts with a good balance of crispiness and chew that are slightly blistered. I've been meaning to try their red sauce, but their white pies are so good I haven't passed them up. My usual order has been an 18\" white pie ($22) with added caramelized onions, pepperoni, and mushrooms. The 'shroom pie with the white sauce wasn't bad either, full of a variety of mushrooms. Service has been friendly and efficient, even during peak hours. For take out, Those Guys has become my go-to place for a quick-fix of pizza.\n\n4.5 Stars
