If you have never been to an aquarium in your lifetime and have possibly been landlocked in this desert state I'd say go. \n\nIf you have toddlers or children up to age 5 I'd say go.\n\nFish dissection was the best part the teachers were very knowledgeable the rest of the workers lacked basic social skills. I would never ever pay full price for this place not even on a good day. Cool dino fish and shark exhibit, jellies were neat, the walk through aquarium was ok but the floor underneath is completely scratched you cant see anything a bad design choice I'm guessing.\n\nAquariums are so tiny I feel bad for these fish they are all saying HELP ME!! You could basically stick your hand in any of these if your over 4 ft and touch the poor fishies, which is probably a really bad thing!!\n\nMy 10 yr old took a whole 10 minutes to go through the entire thing they said your pass is good ALL day, considering we couldn't get out of here fast enough ummmm def not worth a trip from the other side of town just for this def not a tourist attraction I'd rather watch reruns of Tanked from the comfort of my layz boy.
