I've been meaning to get over here since they opened and finally made it this morning for breakfast.  I love this whole plaza.  The buildings have a beautiful Mediterranean feel to them, and it's a pleasure to just stroll around, especially on a nice morning like today.  When we lived closer we were over here all the time to hit Sauce Pizza and Fresh & Easy.  \n\nI knew I liked Press coffee from trying it at the airport location, but had not tried their food options.  All you have to say to me is eggs, avocado, and bacon and I'm there!  I had a mocha, which had a lovely rich flavor, and the avocado toast on sprouted bread with one poached egg.  For an extra dollar you can get another egg.  One was plenty for me.  It was delicious with the fresh avocado crushed on toasted bread, and the yolky goodness spread on top was perfect.\n\nMy husband ordered some ginger ginseng tea and the breakfast burrito with bacon, Swiss, eggs, potatoes, avocado, and pesto.  That burrito was fantastic!  We were passing our food back and forth so we could share everything.  It's a little pricey at $25 for those 4 items, but everything is high quality and so delicious.  Afterwards I went back for a $2 snickerdoodle, and that was very good as well.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is nice and relaxing.  I hope to stop in more frequently.  Great place!
