This place was awful. Went for a friends birthday party everything was fine for the first few hours until they closed. My friend ( the birthday girl) and I were quickly using the ladies room while our boyfriends were settling a tab of over 600 dollars when one of the managers burst in the bathroom and refused to leave! We were on our way out just washing our hands when we asked him to excuse us we would just be a moment he refused. I understand they need to get people out but refusing to leave the ladies bathroom is just creepy. The only reason we were still there was because they weren't finished w our tab. He proceeded to speak to us very rudely saying we had no manners and kicked us out the back door saying \"we didnt deserve to go out the front\" really after having a table and bottle service all night. It was ridiculous when outside I told them they were being so rude and they physically shoved us off the property saying \"get off our property\" to push around two little girls like this completely un provoked is just ridiculous. It seemed to me that manager or whoever  was totally abusing his power around there. I have never been treated this rudely anywhere but the fact that we spent that much money and they literally threw the birthday girl out the minute they closed is just really tacky and unprofessional. They shouldn't be treating anyone like this and expect to be open too long. I for one will never be back and will tell everyone I know never to go there. It was ok prior to their rudeness at the end but knowing that they would ever threat people this way I would never go back. So I guess go if you want to spend a lot of money then be treated poorly.
