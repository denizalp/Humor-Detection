Came to Iron Maiden on July 3rd.  I completely understand security and abide by it.  What I couldn't understand was why the 10 yr old boy was not allowed to bring his sign in.  The sign said it was his first Maiden concert and he was completely heartbroken at the door.  I think that's pushing limits on security if a little kid can't bring a sign the 1st time he's see his favorite band.  If it was an adult on the floor, I'd completely get it.  But a kid?  Shame on you T-Mobile.\n\nAlso, WTF is up with taking the caps off the bottle dog water?  So I have to buy another $8 bottle when this one spills over?  I'm not 3, I'm not going to choke on it.  I've been in the concert business for 20 years and haven't seen one incident from a dangerous bottle cap!  Why to snake more money out of the guests.
