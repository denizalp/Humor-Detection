I was really reluctant to try this place. Two dollar beers? That sounded like a recipe for lunkhead brawls and hooknasty mayhem. \n\nThen I tasted their mac and cheese at an Avon summer festival. It was spectacular mound of creamy Gouda gooiness. So we decided to try going early on a child-free night. \n\nIt is now my go-to place for a quick, cheap, amazing dinner. They have sliders-- from portobello lentil (perfect for veggies) , to buffalo chicken to Angus burger. I haven't tried them all, but I intend to. They come in orders of 3, for two dollars a piece. The Buffalo chicken slider tastes more like a true Buffalo chicken wing than anything you could get in this town. It's perfect. \n\nTheir flat bread pizzas are loaded with cheese and great toppings. They also have an appetizer list full of homemade, battered, fried love. The staff is friendly. They generally don't have all the beers on the menu in stock-- but the menu is big enough that you are sure to find something you like. $2 Christmas Ale? I'm in. \n\nKids-- this place is a bar. The staff welcomes children earlier on in the evening for dinner. But yeah, this is a bar--cement floors, zinc tables, sports on the flat screen and loud music. People will be drinking. If you don't want your little snowflake seeing that sort of thing, get take out.
