Came in with a client based on the reviews and our mutual desire to get some BBQ.\n\nSmall establishment located in a tiny strip mall with limited parking but the trip was worth it as the BBQ was creative and fantastic. I went with the Household of Three sandwich which consisted of smoked pork sausage, pulled pork and beef tips served on a brioche roll with slaw and onions.\n\nIt was certainly one of the better BBQ sandwiches I've ordered and the combination, while sounding daunting, worked well together as the various barbequed meats worked nicely with each other and the spicy scotch bonnet BBQ sauce they had tableside. I tried a few of my guests waffle fries as he could not finish them and also enjoyed these.\n\nOnly reason it was not 5 stars was owing to every table we tried to sit at was filthy was sauce spills and crumbs from the previous diners.
