So happy to discover this new place! The owners are super nice and was more than happy to explain to me about the concept. I end up taking a 12 mixed pack frozen units to go.  Didn't know what to expect, it turned out to be surprisingly great!!  Will try a sit down lunch or dinner inside next time!
