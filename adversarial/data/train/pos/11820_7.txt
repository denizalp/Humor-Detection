Sushi Rok! You had such promise! You had a vegan menu, a cool atmosphere, funky tunes, pizzazz, and a drag queen hosting the space.\n\nHowever, I have encountered the rudest service I've ever encountered. My friends and I were at the bar and decided to move to a table to better talk and eat.\n\nThe hostess was super sweet and had a table made for our party of 6. I'm assuming our \"server\" came over and we couldn't hear him and we didn't acknowledge him, but he rolled his eyes at us and just left.\n\nAt this time, a busser came over and dropped off waters, and my friend ordered a round of saki bombs for the table.\n\nThe waiter then came back and asked if we'd like anything to drink, my friend stated that she ordered it from the busser. He again, just walked away, and started talking about my friends and I to another server.\n\nAfter this, we decided to head to the bar, close out our tab; then the waiter looked surprised when he went back to an empty table.\n\nI get that doing your job in a loud place can be difficult, but this was ridiculous. It was a Tuesday and it wasn't even busy.\n\nThank you, but no thank you.
