I've been holding off on reviewing this show because it really doesn't need yet another review.  So mine is going to be short and not contributing much to the yelp community.\n\nSo here was my reaction during and after this show:\n\nwowowowowowowowowow\n\nYes, it really is that good.  After seeing this show I wanted to go again, and again and again.  And re-buy some of my favorite Beatles CD's (Abbey Road and Sgt Pepper).  It's the coolest Beatles themed circus you'll ever see.\n\nAnyone that doesn't like this show doesn't have a soul.  I'll just put that out there, Beatles fan or not.
