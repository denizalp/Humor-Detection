I was kind of undecided about this place but the more I think about it the more I've decided to go with it was an ok try it one time but probably will be fine without returning type place. Gen had a chill atmosphefe, work staff was nice, but what I first thought was super cool, ended up being a downer for me instead. I think it's great that they have a grill in the center of the table to be able to cook your own food. Can't beat the all you can eat stipulation BUT it took FOREVER for your food to cook. If you are starving, do not sit at the tables with the grills. The food and the extra sides were great but as far as what you had to cook for yourself it was like ughhhh hurry up so I can eat you! Lol
