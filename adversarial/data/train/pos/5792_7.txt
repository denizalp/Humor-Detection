After dinner and drinks nearby, we decided it'd be fun to stop by here and explore a Kmart - it'd been like a decade or more since we'd set foot in one. And it was awesome. Their $1 area has some pretty good bargains. It's like a mini Dollar Tree inside a Kmart. There's a food section with lots of frozen and canned items. There's also a liquor area. And then there's clothes, toys, and all the other typical items you'd expect from this type of store. A step up from Walmart (but you don't get the same crazy people watching) and a step down from Target (including a significant step down in prices). And it was practically empty when we went, so navigating the store and checking out were a breeze. It was clean, orderly, and well-kept. We scored some good bargains and enjoyed ourselves. Can't say I'll be shopping here regularly, but I'm sure I'll pop in every once in awhile.
