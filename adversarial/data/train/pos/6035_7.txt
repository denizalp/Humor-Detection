I have moved from Las Vegas to New York.\nThis was my first time using this company they had a very cheap price fair price and i did get lots of quotes from at least 20 different companies . The the agent was helpful from the first call up to the delivery...\nsent two guys and a large truck I had some concerns about my over sized furniture fitting thrue doors dissembling and reassembling they handled everything whith out a glitch and put up whith my neurotic nagging and were patient and polite the hole time they new exactly what they were doing professionals !and I was also concerned about bed bug !!!! I've heard to many horror stores there truck was clean and well keep up I still made them shake out each padding bblanket one by one just in case ! did it with no hesitation and were very nice about it !they both were very professional hard working and took direction well and respectfully careful with my stuff ! Overall Hard working honest business what a breath of fresh air !hands down the easiest move !\nI hope other customers would be treated like i have been treated, Caring.\nIf I'll move again I will for sure use this Moving Company!
