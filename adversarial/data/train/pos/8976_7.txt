Ah, just one more thing I love about this big old country; shoddy regulation of marijuana laws. That means that Roach-o-rama can serve its clientele the finest bud this side of BC without being handcuffed and thrown into a cruiser (right after a Tim Hortons run). \n\nAnd where else would such a place be but in Kensington Market or course! Located in the middle of the most magical place in Toronto, Roach-o-Rama serves the city's pot heads vegetarian and meat filled meals as well as smoothies and some other \"baked\" goods. \n\nThey also sell all your smoking needs in-store, like bongs, grinders, pipes, papers, hilarious t-shirts and weed related paraphernalia and hemp everything. Be warned: There are very serious rules about the Hot Box Cafe - like patronize the store politely by buying something, don't sell weed and don't bring in minors - things that pot heads sometimes forget.
