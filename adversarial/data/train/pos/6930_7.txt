Armed with a $1.00 off coupon on a combo meal that was soon expiring, I had a better than average experience here on my first dining jaunt to this particular Del Taco.  My medium-sized Macho Combo was anything but medium.  The large Macho Combo Burrito that was filled with meat, beans, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and some mayo soon became a gooey yet tasty mess in my hands.  The rippled Fries were well cooked and abundant, and an extra hard Deluxe Beef Taco overflowed with suitably red, cold, and fresh lengths of cut tomatoes.  Even my medium Coke Zero only required one refill to successfully wash down the whole repast.\n\nDiane's generous helping of Cheese Fries, too, were laden with melted grated American Cheese, although her Cheeseburger patties were quite well done and the burger was low on melted cheese.  The dining room was rather chilly on a cold night.  But service was good, and the food ingredients that should have been hot were.\n\nAs always I had to be careful to select the right hot sauce packets to adorn my selections.  Del Taco's spiciest packets are not colored red or orange.  El Scorcho--which is very aptly named--is black!  Inferno is red.  And mild is orange.  So, if you just want to spice up your burrito and taco a little bit, don't reach for black or red packets.\n\nProbably my best Del Taco experience to date!  3-1\/2 stars overall.
