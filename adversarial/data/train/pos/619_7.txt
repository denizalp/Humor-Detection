5 stars for the Cheesecake Tarty goodness! Lol. I kept coming back once I had a small spoon of it after trying everything else they had.\n\nWhich, btw, they have the best customer service! There's a girl there, who I wish I got the name, that was ALWAYS smiling, collective and patient. Not once had I ever seen her get annoyed by a customer. Not even an eye twitch. She's good! On the next visit she remembered me. And I swear it wasn't like that next day. More like 2 weeks. Impressive. Haha. \n\nI'm going to be honest though, my very very first time was quite sometime ago and I had a really bad experience. I had ordered a crepe and it was never made. Everyone in my group had gotten there's and they didn't bother to tell me that they were making the batter to make mine. I was patient and was only informed cus I asked them what happened when everyone was half finished with theirs. I couldn't wait any longer and asked them to refund my card and that I was leaving. Everyone had already finished their crepes at that point. \n\nBut hey, I gave them a shot months and months and months after that incident and I was greeted and had a great experience. Recently, there has been another girl I've been seeing. She asked about my tattoos and from then on, she remembered me the next visits. Lol. Yay! She also has great customer service! \n\nAnyway!! Simple...\nIt's home made creamy gelato. Try the cheesecake, and the biscotti! \n\nAlso, don't forget your coconut cookie! \n\nOnly bad note: There is bad reception inside. For some reason, once I'm inside my bars go down and cant receive any connectivity. Which, at the end, should be a good thing. Talk to someone you're with and put your phone down! I just couldn't check in on here. lol. But check in before or after your visit. .
