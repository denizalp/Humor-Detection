It's what you think it is.  The food might be a skosh better, but the service a few trips worse.\n\nI got a basic basic sandwich (french dip... though they called it \"classic beef dip\") because I really wasn't sure what this place could handle.  It was just fine, minus not really providing enough au jus for the whole thing (a common complaint of mine with this sandwich... so maybe it's just me!).\n\nOur waitress... there are no words.  Well, maybe there are, but I need to stop and think for a sec.\n\n\nOkay.\n\n80% of the servers working in this establishment are 100+ lbs. overweight and look like 5-year-olds that got into their mommas' makeup.  Our particular waitress also looked like she was suffering from advanced gingivitis and gum recession.  The positive spin on this is that it really kills your appetite looking at servers like that.\n\nShe was distracted from the moment we sat down, acted like everything we said either bored her or posed some major imposition (or both).  When she brought our food, she set down one of three plates and then sneezed on the rest, followed by a loud, deep, long snort and wiping her whole face on her sleeve.  We were all shocked when she then went about her business, serving said sneezed-upon meals, without batting an eye.  I was utterly speechless.  My plate was the only non-sneezed-upon meal, so I offered to just split mine with my friends (there was certainly enough of it).\n\nJeez Louise.  I've never felt so shocked at such disgusting service... I mean, what on earth was she thinking??
