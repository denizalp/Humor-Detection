August Trip\n\nWe wanted to come here simply for the view and atmosphere. This place is a work on art and I find Mr Chow likes his places to represent Artwork.\n\nWe get there right when it opens and find our way to the bar area. Lots of nice seating and the place is very open with lots of light.\n\nThe bartender Tim was awesome and recommended some great drinks for us. We had a few Chowlinis, Tribeca and the Pineapple 100. I think my wife also had the Red 22 & Collins. That might be in the last photo :) \n\nFor apps we had the Chicken Sate, Mini ribs, Beef pancake and the shrimp rolls. The food was really good but the service and atmosphere was simply amazing. \n\nThere are some people stating on Yelp about rude service and you need min to eat here? We didnt see that, and they even had guests come in just to take photos and leave.\n\nWe will be back for Social hour, I hope Tim is still there! Thanks Mr Chow for the great time!
