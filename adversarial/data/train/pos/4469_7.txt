I'm sorry but I cannot say my experience here was good. The good news: I got a Groupon for a bikini and leg wax so it was cheap.  The bad news:  1)  I had to call Sherry 5 times and leave 2 text messages b\/c her mailbox was full and I couldn't leave voice messages.  She finally called back to tell me she was leaving for Mexico for 4 days.  Really? You just sold numerous Groupons and now you leave town in the Spring?  She said she will squeeze me on Sat.  2) Within 5 minutes of my session, she dribbled bright pink wax over my white shirt. 3) After my session, I still have hair stubble and numerous missed spots all over my legs and knees and will have to shave in the morning.  I had not shaved my legs in 9 days and Sherry used the excuse that I have light hairs so they won't be removed.  Really?  You're an esthetician and you can't remove light hair?  4) Sherry told me she was using up the rest of the hot wax on me but then said it was ok b\/c she was looking forward to using her new \"wax with aloe\" on her next client. Really? I even told her I have very sensitive skin why couldn't I get the wax w\/ aloe.  But it gets even better - She runs out of hot wax in the middle of my session so I'm thinking that I'll be getting the good wax but boy was I wrong.  The \"new wax\" hurt even more than ever and when I asked if this was the one with aloe she said \"oh no I'm using up some old wax\".  Gee thanks for nothing. Like I said in the beginning, not a good experience.
