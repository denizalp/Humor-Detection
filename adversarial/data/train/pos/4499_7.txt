Things I do not eat:  beef (and pig, however that is unrelated to this particular review).\n\nToday I learned that if you do not eat beef, America's Taco Shop is not a good place for you.   I was caught off guard with the very limited menu containing only beef items.  The two non-beef options did not include chicken, which I found odd and irritating at the same time.  I went for the vegetarian quesadilla which was a huge disappointment.  It was lettuce, a little bit of cheese and guac in a tortilla and it was not in any stretch of imagination a delicious meal.  I had ordered chips and salsa as well, and I did find that the salsa was pretty tasty.  \n\nIt is in a cute house and the salsa is decent.  If you don't love the cow, I'd pass on America's Taco Shop.
