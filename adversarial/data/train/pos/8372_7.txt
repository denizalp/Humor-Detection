I had really, really high expectations for this place from the reviews... But I was sorely let down.\n\nLong story short, this is a place that takes care of its regulars well... But treats new customers terribly, apparently. It was at the point where the credit card machine wasn't working, so I had to charge my own card, print my own receipt, and sign my own receipt and give myself a customer copy. It was not busy then either. The barista also forgot my order until I reminded her.\n\nI'm sparing this place a one-star rating because it's decent, but even then - it's still expensive.\n\nDefinitely disappointing...
