Based on Yelp reviews, I was attracted to try this place.  After having now dined here for dinner on four separate occasions, I consider 50's Diner Omelet House to be my favorite diner in the Las Vegas valley, or anywhere else for that matter.  Although it is rather dated and quite casual, with a classic 50's ambiance, I have been very impressed with the range and consistency of fine cooking in the kitchen, as well as stellar service that I have received when here.\n\nI have enjoyed everything I have tried here, including deep-fried Zucchini Sticks with Ranch Dressing; lightly battered Onion Rings; homemade Chicken & Vegetable Soup brimming with mixed vegetables and fresh white meat chicken swimming in a very tasty broth; a rather sizable Small Dinner Salad with Iceberg Lettuce, tomato wedges, cucumbers, hard carrots, Green Onions, Cheddar Cheese, & good Italian Dressing; two large slabs of tasty Meat Loaf with well turned out Mashed Potatoes & memorable Brown Gravy, and a kick; one of the best Grilled Ham & well-melted Cheese Sandwiches on lightly toasted Sourdough Bread I have had; the best Club Sandwich that I have experienced to date, with both bacon and ham on lightly toasted Sourdough Bread; and a first-rate Tuna Salad Sandwich with fresh lettuce and tomato slices, again prepared on lightly toasted Sourdough.  \n\nSkinny French Fries are quite well made, but I prefer the inventive, delectable, and addictive \"Spuds\"--scallops of lightly fried potatoes--as an included side with a sandwich or entree.  \n\nThe only item I have tried thus far that was simply okay was a cup of Chili with White Onions, Cheddar Cheese, Kidney Beans, celery, and bits of tomato.  I appreciate that I can spike a Diet Coke with a shot of vanilla to make it a Vanilla Diet Coke, while a spurt of cherry is also available if so desired.  IMHO, based solely on my own experiences, and rated against other dining establishments of the same type--diners--this place deserves five stars.
