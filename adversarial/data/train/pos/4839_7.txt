Plaza Kia is a relatively small and down to earth dealership. Nothing too fancy in deco, but after all as a consumer, I am here for good price with good service.\n\nOur salesperson is really nice and sincere. Relatively new so a little not sure about the specification of the car we were test driving. But I guess I can always look up those information from the internet.\n\nIf you looking for a Kia, this is good place to come in and kick some tires!
