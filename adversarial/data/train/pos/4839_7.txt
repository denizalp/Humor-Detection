So I got this on a Groupon because it said Henderson, but it's pretty far out there inside some Casino called Rail Pass I think. The casino left much to be desired. It was more of a truck stop type place. The restaurant inside was okay. Service was very good. The maitre'd and our waitress was great. The steaks - we ordered Ribeye with bone and one without- were ok. Mash potatoes pretty good but could have used garlic. The Asparagus was really good and mushroom ok. Overall it's an okay experience but not what you might call a great steak. With strip being so close I'd opt for something there in way of steaks. Again for what type of casino this was I expected much worse, happy it was ok, but not coming back.
