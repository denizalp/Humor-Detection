Cool little place that's been open for a few weeks. There are often hipster type places with deeply underwhelming overpriced food. SmashBurger and MOD Pizza come to mind, glad to say this Place has solid pizza. It was tasty and reasonably priced. The staff was super friendly and carried real conversation while they made my pizza. It caught me off guard but was refreshing. I'll definitely drop by again and recommend giving it a shot.
