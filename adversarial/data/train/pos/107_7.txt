If the employees get dibs on new release firearms, and have to put em on layaway to be able to afford them, then it's a terrible business.  Which is exactly what is going on here.  I was told on a Saturday by an employee working behind the firearms counter that the rifle I was looking for \"would be in on a shipment late Monday, and would be out on the shelf Tuesday morning.\"  He then explained how he personally had several firearms on layaway to secure them at the current price and was paying them off slowly to afford his budget.   Too much information in my opinion, but hey, thanks for letting me in on how the employees get to pick what they want of limited merchandise to screw over the people that keep the business open, THE PAYING PUBLIC CONSUMER!!  \nAnyway, here it is, Tuesday morning, and I'm standing at the door while they unlock the entrance doors to allow the public in, open for business,,,  walk up to the counter to inquire about the rifle I was told \"would be out on the shelf Tuesday morning,\" only to be told \"it's on layaway!!!\", as the employee looked over to another employee with a grin on their face that I read as \"yeah, it's mine\".  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!??!!!  So I have to assume that as soon as it was received, off the truck, last night, that one of the employees instantly put it on layaway, to pay it off over the next 3 months, instead of allowing their place of employment to actually make money off of it by selling it today, to the people who keep the doors open and business flowing, the paying customers who can afford to buy it NOW, not using the layaway program.   What a crock!!   The last time I will set foot in this dump, til they correct the issue of allowing the employees to LAYAWAY product from paying customers.
