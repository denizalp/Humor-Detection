I really wanted to love it here!!\n\nSadly, I didn't.  \n\nThe idea is genius: drinks, music, and video games!!!  There are a lot of games, but not enough that I loved.  Also, they were all full!  Maybe I would have a better time if it was less crowded.  Also, it was nearly impossible to see the game console to put the quarters in.  How are we supposed to Insert Coins?? We had to use our phone as a flashlight!\n\nThere were two pinball games; they both sucked, sadly.  \n\nI think I might give this place another go during the day or something, when it's not too busy.  Otherwise, if you actually wanna play some games, good luck!
