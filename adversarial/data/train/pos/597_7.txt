THIS PLACE IS NOW CALLED THE WHISKEY ISLAND STILL & EATERY\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sunsetgrilleohio\n\nDuring a visit to Cleveland this past weekend we enjoyed some time on a boat docked at the Whiskey Island marina, which is adjacent to the Sunset Grill.  After a bit of time on the boat, we moseyed over to the Sunset to listen to the band and do some people watching.  We were not disappointed!  \n\nWhile I have no idea about the food as we didn't eat here, reading from the prior reviews, you may be better off bringing a cooler.  You could eat from said cooler on some picnic tables closer to the marina if you so chose that option.  Just putting it out there.\n\nThe location is awesome, the views are spectacular, and the people watching was a delight.  Lots of drunk people (and a few sober ones) dancing, including one middle-aged woman who's shorts dropped to her ankles while she was gyrating to a \"GunsNRoses\" cover by the band.  Nice purple thong, m'lady!\n\nThe beers are cheap, the crowd is fun and the band, at least on this night, was what you could hope for with no cover charge.\n\nI'll be back on my next visit to town, hoping to see more purple thongs.
