I have had my eye in thai location for a little bit. I saw the coming soon sign and when I started seeing the reviews slowly trickle in I was excited that they finally opened up.\n\nI walked in around 7am and they were well stocked on goodies. They offer mini versions of their croissant donuts as well as fritters. I bought a few different donuts to share with my coworkers. \n\nThe croissant donut was delicious. Not at all greasy and have a great crunch and was still moist inside. The cruller was perfectly cooked and had a nice texture. The blueberry fritter was nice as well. Lots of berries in the fritter and not overly glazed, which is a big plus for me.\n\nService was nice and their prices are on par with other donut shops in the valley. I'll be back.
