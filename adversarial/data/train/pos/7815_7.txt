Bought a $300 coffee table from them a while ago. The coffee table on display had a big scratch on it. I stated explicitly that I would only buy if they have a new one. The owner promised me that, but when I got it a few weeks later, it was the same scratched item. Also, the delivery personnel was just the owner and a staff. The owner offered a discount on my next purchase, which I reluctantly accepted because I needed the coffee table.\n\nBecause of dishonesty, I will never buy from them again, so I never used my discount.
