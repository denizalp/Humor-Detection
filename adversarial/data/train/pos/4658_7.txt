Wells Fargo  Dealer Services  are the worst  to get a loan for your car.  Avoid  at all costs.  First I could only make a minimum  payment  online.   Second  when I sent in a paper  check I forgot  to spell out the full amount  so they  only  took  the payment  of 21 dollars.   Next I paid  off 90% of the balance by the end of  December  but they still insisted on getting  my insurance  proof which  my insurance  company  sent in 4 times before  any action was taken.  Wells Fargo  still took  out  insurance  on me for a 1\/3 of what  I still owed on the loan at the end of January.  As of today  I am still trying  to get  this fixed and none of my last 2 payments have  gone  to the principal  but the overpriced  insurance  Wells Fargo  should  never  have  taken  on my  car.
