Ever get that feeling of being in an enormous place with too much stuff in your face and you're completely overwhelmed?! Well, in this case; it was a pleasurable experience I received from my first step in Ashley for the first time. I was in awe with the beautiful stages of room settings and d√©cor and I wanted just about everything this furniture store had in it and then approached the Brooklyn, New Yorker; the incredible salesman rep: Rocco and pronounced Rock-O, NOT Row-co, so let's get that right, right now! There was something about Rocco that made me gravitate towards him with his knowledge, professionalism and expertise. I truly wanted to hang with this guy because he has the slickest east coast presence, attitude and speech about him. Rocco is beyond 5 stars and he helped me with several ideas and choices to finally narrow down on my entertainment room leather sectional with 4 fully reclining chairs. This couch is so gorgeous and works with both masculinity and rustic charm. Not only has it fit in to my home perfectly, but its an additionally focal feature to this spacious room and it is absolutely comfortable and the price was met with being matched from another online seller. \n\nI am thoroughly happy with my decision to try out Ashley's and as long as Rocco is holding it down out there, I will continue to do business with them. I cannot wait to update my additional major furnishings and with the help from my only go-to guy Rocco!! I decided to write about my review a few weeks after the delivery and use of my sectional and so far I still love it like the first day I seen and reclined in it on the sales floor. Thank you Rocco for being YOU.
