***Bob Evans makes a savory, hearty and even somewhat spicy sausage gravy with biscuits; it is a good dish and their other breakfast options are decent too***\n\nI think Bob Evans is really good for one dish, which is their sausage gravy and biscuits.  The biscuits are good.  They are not dry and the insides of the biscuits are light and fluffy.  The outsides are great too.  The biscuits have an appetizing color as well as a buttery and crunchy crust.\n\nThe sausage gravy is very good.  It is very creamy and the sausage flavor is good--savory and even a little bit spicy.  I have found most places feature a bland gravy for biscuits; it really ends up just being a creamy milk gravy.  Often, these other places don't really mix in the sausage that well to get that really great sausage flavor.\n\nThe french toast here is decent.  Several of their breakfast items are good like their sausage patties and sausage links, but the sausage gravy and biscuits is definitely the star attraction here.\n\nPrices are good.  Prices at Bob Evans are similar or maybe even a little less expensive than what you would pay at an IHOP or a Denny's.\n\nService from my waitress was good.  She was friendly and attentive and had that twang in her voice that I have come to expect at this restaurant in this area.  Checks are paid at the front and I felt the manager\/cashier was a little lackadaisical and not as friendly and welcoming as you would get at a lot of other Bob Evans locations.\n\nIn terms of decor, this Bob Evans looks almost exactly like all the other Bob Evans locations.  The outside looks like a big red barn while the inside features a dining room of a lot of booths and a counter for quick dining.  There is also a little store in the front where you can buy candy, Bob Evans pantry items and souvenirs and such.\n\nEven though Bob Evans is a chain and a big chain in the Midwest, their sausage gravy and biscuits is a good breakfast dish.  Their other breakfast items are decent and probably better than what you would get at a Cracker Barrel, Denny's or IHOP.  If you've never been to a Bob Evans, I think it would be worth one try for breakfast.  You can probably skip lunch or dinner here, but they have a few okay non-breakfast items (and their lunch and dinner menus are less expensive than a lot of chain restaurants).\n\nLike most Bob Evans locations, this one has its own free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space.
