Read all the reviews, and checked out all the pictures, so we decided to give it a try. As I walked in I thought the decor was plain, an very bright. I had ordered ahead of time. The service was very friendly always smiling and very polite. \n\nI got home and opened the container and the portions were huge, although I did find the rice a bit bland, the chicken was good, but didn't blow me away. \n\nIt's not a bad place to go, but there are better in the area.
