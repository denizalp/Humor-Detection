New Chinese dessert house on the block. I had high expectations before coming in because I love Chinese desserts and I love to explore new good eats in the area!\n\nFirst thing that went wrong: I HEAR THE MICROWAVE *gasp* It was rather quiet in the restaurant, so I can clearly hear the microwave going on and off in the background lol. But wow, food still came out lukewarm... use microwave properly, god dammit!\n\nEven the table next to us expressed the same dissatisfaction. It was rather funny to watch because the 1) House special fried sticky rice ($4) came in a bowl SO dinky, the man at table next to us laughed at it and said \"I'm so surprised lor...\" and then sent it right back. We almost burst laughing... but we didn't sent ours back.\n\n2) Hong Kong styled glass noodle with chicken soup ($4) - bigger bowl, salty, lukewarm, not what I have expected compared to the street-styled ones in Hong Kong.\n\n3) Mango shrimp roll ($4) - 3 pieces. Only thing that was served hot, but mango was sour... actually, what did I just eat? Would be nice if you have a mango sauce to go with it.\n\n4) Cashew dessert soup ($4) - bigger bowl, made with powder (heard them whipping it up), microwaved and served barely warm. I was so excited to see cashew on the menu because you rarely see it anywhere in Chinese dessert houses. But THIS, I can make this at home with powder. Why am I paying $4? As expected, it was tasteless and gloppy. I was expecting it to be steaming hot made with freshly grounded cashew and a taste that will linger in my mouth, leaving me wanting more. Nope, did not get that feeling.\n\nThis place deserves a 1-star, but I give them balls to even serve that fried sticky rice in that dinky @ss bowl and charge me $4 for it (+1 star)... it was literally 2 bites. I dare you all to order it. \n\nOne time thing.
