Pecan-crusted mahi-mahi I love you but DANG you are expensive!!!  Having been at the new location twice now, I do have to say I approve of the decor and beauty of the new place.  White leather booths and soft lighting, who doesnt feel chic here?  \n\nThe service is a little spotty and whose fault is it if we are sat at the worst table in the joint when the place is half empty at 9pm on a Saturday night?  If I was first to arrive of my party I would not have approved but I wasn't the first to arrive so I had the pleasure of watching the scantilly clad escorts stumble to the restrooms all night.\n\nThe first time my friends and I were here the service was exceptionally bad and the food quality was spotty.  This time, things seemed a step up, dishes like the crab cakes that were barely edible before were now perfected (but too much breadcrumbs?) into crabby patties.  The mahi-mahi was light and hot in the center, perfection.  It came with fig risotto - (I could have made a meal just of this!!!)  Two glasses of mediocre Chard and my entree only and my tab was over 50 bucks.  So I do love your new location and decor and food LaVecchia, just cant afford you as much as I would like!  \n\nPer the 'patio' :  yall better hope you are with pretty people because that will be your only 'view'!  Lol!
