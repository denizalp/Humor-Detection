Four stars and not 5 because of their prices! \n\nService is extremely friendly and professional like everyone says but I'm just so shocked at the arm and leg pricing! \n\nMy 1st Brazilian was $67...a bit of a shock but fine. I came back less than 4 weeks later with very little sporadic growth and was hoping it would be significantly cheaper for the touch up. \n\nBooked myself for a 20min Brazilian and the person I was with even commented on how little there was to do! I was in and out including changing and paying within the 20min window... And it was $54! \n\nWhattttttttt. \n\nI still love the service, people and products they use though.
