Oh Twin Peaks Vegas, how I wanted to like you more.  The beer selection is slightly better than I had feared.  You close down the area of your restaurant with a view of the strip unless it is Friday or Saturday, you charge $10 for a beer.  It was from San Francisco Bay Area....not even local.  No such thing as happy hour here.\n\nYour recommended mozzarella a sticks were limp and flat, both in taste and appearance.   I was about ready to leave and then a strange thing happened.....you changed shifts.  I got here just around 5.  Once the dinner crowd workers and customers started coming in, I disliked you less.\n\nYou started climbing walls, and shaming grown men.....but so did 15 year old boys.\n\nI decided to put your faults behind us all, an give you another go.  At the suggestion of another customer, not you staff, I tried the trout.  Oh my goodness, that was pretty darn good.  Having caught a trout myself last week and cooking it, yours was better.\n\nThe beer temp fluctuated between 27. Something and 32 degrees.  I'm happy to see your beer temps did not fall too low, for too long, to separate the ingredients.\n\n\nAs the night went on, I almost enjoyed myself....until I discovered my siphoned wallet, but that is Vegas, not you.\n\n\nBetween here and the Phoenix location I've been to, I give you three peaks.  I almost gave you twin peaks, but you pulled pulled out some surprises like Total Recall to make it three peaks.
