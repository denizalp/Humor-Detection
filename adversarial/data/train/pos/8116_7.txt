In vegas? Need some clothes washed? Go here.\n\nThey operate as a do it yourself laundromat or as a full service wash and fold. If you are traveling through, the wash and fold service is well worth it! They promise a turnaround time of 5 hours, but it will probably be done before that. They are quick and efficient.\n\nIt is fairly easy to access from the Strip or a bus. The 108 or the tourist busses will drop you off at the corner of Sands Avenue and Paradise road. From the strip the 203 goes down Sands\/Twain and will drop you off across the street from the laundromat. The east side of sands is Twain Avenue and the laundromat is about a half a block walk.\n\nThe staff is very nice, and as I mentioned, the full service is very affordable. The location is convenient, and if you want a taco, I can also highly recommend the Taqueria across the parking lot!
