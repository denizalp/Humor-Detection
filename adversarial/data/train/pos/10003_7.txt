I've been here twice now and pretty impressed, more so on the second visit.  First visit I had the prime rib which was pretty good but I have had better.  The portion size was pretty huge.  This time I had the carnivore pizza which was part of the $20 special which was a pizza and a bottle of wine, very good deal.  The pizza had this Tasso ham which is a must try!  It also had sausage and pepperoni.  Crust was very good, made with caputo flour which is supposed to be the best for pizza.  Also had the side salad with homemade Green Goddess dressing which was amazing.  It's made with yoghurt and basil.   Our server was very knowledgeable about the food, recommended the Green Goddess and also had an interesting conversation about cheese.   \n\nThis place is attached to Luci's and it is a destination in itself.  After dinner you can walk the grounds and if you feel like ice cream go over to Luci's ice cream and candy shop.  It is very peaceful to sit outside on one of the benches enjoying ice cream.  \n\nThis is a place you will want to come back to over and over.  Bring your friends!
