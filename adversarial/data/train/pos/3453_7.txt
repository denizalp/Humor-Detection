The first time I had Islands was in Los Angeles.  The second time, in Mesa.  The third, here are Avondale.  And since I'm lazy, I decided to mark my review here. \n\n[focus point here]  When I had first had Islands in Los Angeles, I thought this was as good as it gets.  Pineapple slice on a burger?  Count me in!  As soon as I got home from my trip, I googled the joint and found that we have our very own Islands.  I was ecstatic!\n\nSo I rounded up the buddies and we went with high spirits.  Although the food wasn't nearly as good as I remembered, it wasn't bad.  It's definitely a good little place to get together with friends.\n\nAs Margaret L. said, it' s pretty much like Applebee's except the quality is a million times better!  I recommend trying Islands yourself.
