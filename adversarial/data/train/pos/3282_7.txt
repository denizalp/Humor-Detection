Decor is atrocious. Chaotic check in scene, likely due to opening day jitters but a disappointment nonetheless. No dedicated SPG check in line and the air is heavily artificially fragranced. Oh and a dude literally walked into the room without knocking an hour after I checked in! I mean, what if I'd been taking advantage of the delightful mirror  on the ceiling? Finally reached front desk after ten minutes of calling various numbers and they don't seem concerned and only offered to move me to a different room. Bed is super comfy though and a really nice shower. Once the sun goes down and I can turn the lights off maybe the baroque fabric wall coverings won't be such a boner-killer.
