If you ever have to return a product, make sure you get a receipt \/ paperwork SIGNED by the owner. I had returned a jersey and asked him if I needed a credit note and I was advised that he'd remember me and that I didn't need a credit note. \n\nI came back ... surprise surprise ... conveniently for him ... \"that credit note is gone\" ... he wouldn't explain it and then went off on various tangents on what I should do ... talk to my friend who came in and took the credit note ... get the original receipt (it was a gift) and bring in the jersey.\n\nI'd be happy to elaborate further for any skeptics of this review.
