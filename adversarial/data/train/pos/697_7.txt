There was a time when you insisted on getting your Pierogies from the churches. They were authentic recipes made with love by church ladies. Pierogies Plus hires church ladies, and it's a lot easier than buying from churches. Seriously, they ship Pierogies all over the world, and their product is the gold standard. Plan some extra time, because this is not fast food. The counter always seems slow to me, they do things their own way, but now I find it rather charming. \n\nThey have some coupons on their website, and there have been Groupon deals in the past, so check for those.\n\nBottom line, the Pierogies are amazing and authentic.
