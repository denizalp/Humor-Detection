Beach, Lake, Trails, Forest, Prairie, Views, Fishing and that smell of woods I love.  \nStewart Lake is tucked behind Mount Horeb on the way to Tyrol Basin and on the way to Vermont.  The lake is nestled in the valley with gorgeous trails all terraining the lake and the miles of trails.  \nWe love that it's so close yet feels so far away.  Take the trails and be ready for a variety of trail, gravel, grass and plenty of hills.  Hang out on the beach.  Unfortunately by late summer it's gone to the geese and weeds, but early spring and summer I would still swim in it.  The beach area has some tables, the sand is usually clean and the in the water you can walk out at least 100 feet.  \nPlenty of nature here.  We've seen snapping turtles, deer, frogs, toads, birds galore, and of course the fish.  \nThey installed a brand new fishing pier on the other side of the lake to keep the swimmers away from the fishing crowd.   You can canoe\/ kayak no motor boats.\nWe've even ice skated here.  Cool but a little freaky as it freezes so clear.  \nThere's a newly updated parking lot, playground and basic bathrooms as well as street parking next to the brand new pier.\nDrive by car, bike route is very popular with the road bike crowd as well as a scenic route on your motorbike.\nPlenty of do after you walk the trails and head over to Troll town to refuel. \n\n* Rope swing on the opposite side is still there.  The rangers keep cutting it down but seems to magically reappear a tree down a day or two later.
