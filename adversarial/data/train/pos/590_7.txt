Yelp Eats Week 2011 (50% off!), Take 4:\n\n07\/16\/11\n\nArrived before a friend did, was seated at a two-top, and I was handed a dinner menu.  Had to ask for the Yelp Eats menu (oddity #1 as all the other restaurants I've visited since the start of it all had hosts\/servers deliver them w\/ the YE menu on the very top of the pile), and when the host handed it over, I noticed a sticker that asked not to share dishes- oddity #2.  As I waited for Linda to arrive, I ordered a mojito ($7.50) and asked server Ana about certain dishes, and she demonstrated great knowledge of both food and beverage menus (kudos to Ana!).  The wonderful mojito (dark rum, fresh lime, muddled mint, sugar, and a \"splash of soda\") arrived just as L. arrived, and, having had their mojitos in the past, she also ordered one for herself.  (If you do not come to dine here, you should at least try their mojito... probably the best I've ever tried, besides the ones I've made!  Not very sweet, the rum not overpower, but still a potent cocktail.)  \n\nAfter a little chat, we placed our order (split checks) for the Bistec Encevollado (steak w\/ onions, for me) and the Frituras de Frijoles Negros (black bean fritters w\/ avocado dip, for her).  Despite my preface of \"I'm going to skip on the apps and order an entree, because I want to have dessert later,\" Ana asked me AT LEAST two times \"And what would you like for an appetizer?\"  She even pointed to the app portion of the menu the second time, and again I said I was only going to order the entree as I'd wanted to leave room for dessert.  L. was going to start w\/ an app first and see if she was going to order more later.  Again, Ana asked what she'd like for an entree, and when Ana left, we already felt like we were being treated rudely and pressured to order more.  (L. eventually ordered another app, and then a dessert.)  App and steak arrived together, and for the record, I offered L. a taste of the wonderful steak, and she turned it down, bec. she tries not to eat too much red meat, but she did try the Papas de la Casa (spicy homestyle potatoes) and found them very salty.  I described the side dish as \"highly-seasoned.\"  Yes, they were very salty, and I hadn't noticed they were spicy, but Mom did when she tried a little bit at home.  L. tried to share her fritters w\/ me, but I've already tried them before, and I wanted to concentrate on the steak.  It was a \"good\" thing that Ana had pressured L. to order a second dish, bec. she actually ended up liking the Frituras de Camarones (three crispy shrimp pancakes served w\/ a Romesco sauce).  (Hey!  I was correct when I thought the sauce looked like it was thickened w\/ some sort of nuts... friend described it having a flavor she couldn't put a finger on, aside from the pepperiness and acidity... it also contained almonds and sherry.)  I very much enjoyed the Bistec encevollado and would not hesitate to order it again!\n\nAna had asked a couple of times if I was ready to order dessert, but I decided to wait for L. to finish eating.  I was still enjoying my mojito and was even contemplating on having another.  (Actually, I was stalling for time since I couldn't decide whether I was going to order the chocolate bread pudding w\/ homemade dark fudge rum sauce, or the lime pie!)  Finally, I decided to order, and I chose the bread pudding and asked L. if she'd get the lime pie, and she said yes.  Score!  While I enjoyed both desserts (I'd had two \"tastes\" of the pie before I asked for one \"to-go\"), I favored the pie.  That night, however, I couldn't get enough of the fudge rum sauce!!  I tell ya, I don't know what I WOULDN'T do to have another chance at savoring this fudge sauce again.  ;)  As far as the lime pie is concerned, I don't know how Linda could sit there and watch me take three swipes off of her pie... I think I was only able to restrain myself from having more, bec. I knew I'd have another one to enjoy at home!  Oh yeah, take the bread pudding (but leave the rum sauce!), and I'll have the lime pie every time from now on!\n\nWe plan on visiting again, esp. on Mojito Mondays ($3 mojitos all day), and we hope that the rudeness was only due to Yelp Eats Week (although there really isn't an excuse for the rudeness!), bec. it would be a shame to have to skip this HC location-- L. said that this location is less noisy than that on Camelback.  I probably should not have tipped 20% off of the original cost of the my bill (original would've been $40.50, plus tax, and w\/ the YE discount, a total of $27, w\/ tax), since she was so rude to us, but I didn't want her to think that Yelpers were cheapskates.  \n\np.s.  Almost forgot to mention, upon entry to this location, I couldn't help but noticing that the restaurant smelled strongly of body odor!  (Onions.)  If I wasn't meeting a friend here, I might've walked out and gone somewhere else.  \n\np.p.s.  The Cuban bread was terrific!
