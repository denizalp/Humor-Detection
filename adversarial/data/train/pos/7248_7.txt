Welcome everyone to Las Vegas HIPSTER PARADISE!\n\nBeen spending most their lives, living in the hipster's paradise\nBeen spending most their lives, living in the hipster's paradise\nKeep spending most our lives, living in the hipster's paradise\nKeep spending most our lives, living in the hipster's paradise\n\nI really love how the built this near fremont. It gives the Fremont another thing to do at night. I really like the vibe here, a bunch of boutique stores, a jungle gym, free live music concert on the lawn and a friendly atmosphere!\n\nA few of the notables are the trampoline, giant lego blocks, black wall and chalk, and giant praying mantis! We checked out the disney store, the ice cream bar and the beef jerky store. We loved it all.\n\nDefinitely, a cool place to hang out when you're bored of the strip!
