This place has the worst customer service ever. I was asking about the cakes and while I was talking to the boy he started hugging some girl and was not even paying attention. So I picked a cake on my own. Not one that I wanted but it will work. I then went to the counter to pay and I asked for my military discount that I have received at other Baskin Robbins. My question was returned with a standoffish no from the cashier. We don't do that here. Okay. My bad. I will never return again. I highly suggest the owner works on the customer service at this location. I'm okay with being told that there is no military discount, however when I am made to feel disrespected because of a question like I am bothering you, that is when I get upset.
