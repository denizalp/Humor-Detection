Never considered visiting this place because their logo led me to assume it's a strip club. You know the girlie silhouettes like the truckers have on the mud flaps? Yeah, that's pretty much what's on their signage, and having exited 95 on Rancho for over a decade, it smacked of Larry's Villa vibe to me. So I diligently stayed away because I'm PG 13, except I love beer. And I swear. I'm just a stick in the mud with a foul mouth, I guess. \n Recently stumbled on a review by another yelper and realized it might be worth checking out. \nBJ's has multiple locations around the valley, but this was my first visit and I don't know how they vary from one to another. This review is for location behind MGM Grand, off Trop and Koval.\n I was very surprised by how nice it turned out to be. It's huge, open, comfortable couches and tables throughout, two pool tables in a separate alcove with the windows overlooking McCarren. No smell of stale smoke, in fact I didn't notice smoke odor at all. \n A liquor store on site that looks like a giant walk in humidor. Not sure of their selection or prices, but I'm sure there is a hefty markup. A cigarette vending machine in the pool table area.\n Definite plus- no country, music selection stuck to classic rock. \n Food selection is pretty typical of a kitchen open 24\/7- salads, burgers, appetizers. I expected every ingredient to be pre made and canned, and it was. So these aren't the freshest nachos that ever nachoed, but I still ate them all because it's midnight and I get more open minded about my guac at this hour. Newcastle and pyramid on tap- plus.\n All in all, I loved the place- clean, spacious, comfortable and safe. Yes, it's important. I have visited a PTs where I didn't want to get out of my car. Decor is quite nice and staff is friendly. Just watch out for the hump where the faux wood floor bowed by the pool tables and you'll do fine.
