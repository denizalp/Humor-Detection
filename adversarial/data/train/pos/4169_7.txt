This place had some really cool stuff and has so much potential but for what turned me off was that as soon as we got in our room the light bulbs was out so i had to call for that, 2nd the remote to the air condition was missing. 3rd at night my wife and i wanted to go for a swim and go in the Jacuzzi, Well the pool was full of sand and dirt and the Jacuzzi was ice cold. this place should be known as a motel not a hotel. 4th he building looked beat up and needed to be painted. I'm never coming back here again.
