We're like hot chocolate and marshmallows:  You're hot and I want to be on top of you.\n\nA place true to their hastag of #CropToCup --- from their farm in Brazil to your steaming [or iced] cup of joe!  Peixoto is a cozy coffee shop situated in the heart of downtown Chandler.   Hipsters can be seen taking up the limited seating and it just makes you want to scream, \"If you're done with your drink and aren't buying another, get the hell out and surf Facebook somewhere else!\"  Peixoto has an industrial chic vibe and they make a great beverage.  It's not coffee but I'm currently loving their hot chocolate made with almond milk. The almond milk gives it a nutty flavor.  ;3\n\nWe were here for their one year anniversary this past weekend and the staff was in a festive good mood.  There were drawings and door prizes, balloons and party hats, and there was even live music.  When the staff is happy, you know you're in a great place!  So grab a seat at the window bar and enjoy a delightful beverage while you people watch.
