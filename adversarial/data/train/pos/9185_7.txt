It's a hassle to come here, but if you're into seeing sights, its doable! There is always a line, and its usually pretty freaking hot while you're waiting outside on the street. Parking is in a lot next to the shop. We had no problem parking when we went.\n\nIt's free to enter, but can be difficult to see certain things in the cases with so many people near by. Customer service was pretty good. We got helped immediately when we asked to look at various coins. \n\nThe shop has some interesting things, but it's pretty small and I'm not sure that I'm a fan of the pricing on a lot of items. \n\nIt's not a place I would go back to, especially to score a deal! I'd rather go to a shady place in Vegas with real treasure! \n\nActually, on second thought, I do value my life and I'll just let Vegas keep its dirty treasure.
