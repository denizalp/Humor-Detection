Had a great lunch here when i was visiting the neighborhood on a work assignment! Gotta try the French Dip (with fries, duh) and some chicken wings!  Service was very friendly; and thorough. Work has me coming to this area every month now for a couple days, so i'm highly looking forward to some more french dips in my future! ROCK ON CB&G!!!
