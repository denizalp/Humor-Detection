I live in a community managed by Vision. Communication is great and things do get done at our community because the HOA Board makes decisions in a timely manner. I think homeowners forget that the management company is limited by what the Board decides (and Board members are homeowners in that community).\n\nFor the longest time, we had a crappy-looking common area with patches of dead grass and had issues with kids breaking the sprinkler caps. They had the caps fixed and eventually, when the HOA had enough reserves, the grass was improved as well. We had issues with many homeowners not paying the monthly dues and we couldn't build up the reserves, but Vision helped us make a budget plan to start saving up so we could fix issues with the common areas. \n\nVision is great with working with the HOA Board so as long as there is an active community and a responsible Board, they're great to work with.
