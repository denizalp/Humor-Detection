What is going on at this place?\n\nStopped in with my boyfriend over the weekend, and left feeling pretty disappointed. A lot of things seem to have changed since the last time I visited a year or so ago, and not for the better. \n\nThe food seems like it's from a completely different restaurant! Everything has suffered, in both quantity and quality. \n\nOther than the bread (which is still delicious), the food was all wrong. For starters: the actual burger patties and toppings seem about 50%-70% smaller than they used to be. The garlic aioli on the Godfather tastes way different than it used to... now it tastes artificial, like Lipton soup mix instead of like fresh garlic. Also, we ordered one medium fries, and it was smaller than the small size we used to order to share between two people... and the fries were completely different. \n\nThe obnoxious teenage employees are as awful as ever - the difference is, I never cared about the terrible service when we used to enjoy the food. \n\nOf course the prices have probably gone up as well, although I can't remember what they used to be. This time around, two (gross) burgers, one order of fries, and two small fountain drinks came out to be about $23. \n\nLastly, small change: they changed from Coke to Pepsi for fountain soda. \n\nMeh...
