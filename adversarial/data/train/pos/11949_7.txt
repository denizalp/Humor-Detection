We had a ball! My 16-year-old grandson was dressed up in his first suit and looked like a littleheart throb so they made a fuss over him which was hysterical. Afterwards, other guests asked to have their picture taken with him?! We laughed and laughed. \n\nThe actors managed to make the show feel fresh. Lots of fun. This is not for snobs. Go hungry, the food will be better. Outstanding table service. The website doesn't mention it, but they do politely accommodate vegetarians.\n\nGo, relax, and enjoy.
