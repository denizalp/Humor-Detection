I'd love to review the food, but I have been sitting here for 57 minutes (yes, exactly) and have yet to receive my meal. I have also received no apology for the wait. \n\nThis is my second visit here and it will be my last. The first one was not that good so I'm not sure what possessed me to come back. Maybe because it is Christmas Eve and there are not many places open. My bad. We actually know of an Indian restaurant where the service is great and the food is better, but my family was hungry and it is further from home. What a mistake!\n\nI wish I could give this place zero stars. Not happy.\n\n40 minutes later - finally got the food (but still no apology) and brought it home. Surprise, surprise...it was good. Too bad my family had filled up on snacks during the LONG wait and were not really hungry.
