Wooooohoooo!!! I have found a new coffee house!! This place is awesome!!\n\nFirst the only bad is the parking is super limited. You can park across the small street in front. It's a short walk away.\n\nInside is great. The setup is nice with open tables. There is even a cool elevated seating area against the far wall. I especially like the seating area near the front window.\n\nThe selection of coffee is on point! The honey vanilla latte and the pour over coffee is real good. Also I tried the first breakfast item on the chewed menu which was awesome!! Oven backed eggs with prosciutto and leaving toast. Great way to start the day. \n\nThe service was great as well. Very polite and cool to converse with!! Also the have square system that's very convent. \n\nAll in all a great coffee house to try and regular at!!!
