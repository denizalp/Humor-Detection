Pretty patio - if you're a smoker.  I felt like I was in the Horseshoe back in the go-go 80s.  Blech.  \n\nFood - the salads are always overdressed.  They are soaked and wet with uninspired dressings. The steak was average.  The bright spot was the salmon on the salad - well seared and juicy.  Too bad it was \"Atlantic,\" which invariably means \"Farmed.\"\n\nLast word: COCKROACH.  After we'd moved inside because the smokers were literally lighting one cigarette off another like a leg kick sequence in a  Busby Berkeley chorus line, the COCKROACH ambled right up to my friend's elbow, perambulated along the bar, and then went in search of beer.\n\nUGH.  Also, COCKROACH.
