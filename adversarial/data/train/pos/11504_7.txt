To be fair, I do not do the AYCE sushi thing in town anymore since I would rather pay more for quality than quantity.  So, this was a rare occasion for me to try out Konbea during their soft opening week.\n\nSoft opening week meant $20.95\/dinner.  \n\nTheir first issue was not having a host\/hostess dedicated to filling empty seats and keeping the wait for the guests to a minimum.  When we walked in on a Sunday evening, we told the first employee we saw that we were a party of 2. He brought us to the register desk and pointed to the sign-in sheet.  This was rather confusing because we could plainly see there were plenty of seats along the sushi bar (versus the 6 booths) and lots of people waiting.  We added our name to the list and proceeded to wait.  It was very apparent that many other customers waiting were irritated by the long wait when there were seats available.  We asked numerous of times if we could sit at the empty seats and were told \"Just a second.\" \"Give me a moment.\" etc. At my final attempt, the waiter explained he was only allowed to sit customers in his section.  This made a lot of sense and I understood completely why it was so disorganized.  I asked which staff member was in charge of the seats I was inquired about and he pointed her out to me. I asked if we could sit down at these two empty seats (that have been empty for good while) and also told her we were next on the list as well.  She agreed.  That solved our waiting issue.  \n\nThe waitress came by to take our drink orders and to explain a little about the menu.  Overall, the sushi was okay and there was nothing special or spectacular about it.  It was standard sushi and rolls.  The rice to fish ratio was okay too.  One exceptionally bad piece of sushi we had was the uni.  It was really awful and tasted like ammonia.  It was truly horrific and would probably be the cause if I was in the toilet later.  (The oyster on the half shell could also be the culprit as well as it's just a bit too milky to be eaten raw.  The squid was also a bit too chewy as in you end up swallowing it whole since it doesn't break down.) We also never received our \"One Time\" Blue Fin Tuna order.  Okay, so there were a few negative points.\n\nFor any hot appetizers, you need to order these directly from the wait staff.  A little robot thing will bring it down to your seat above the revolving belt.  The Husband really enjoyed the salt and pepper chicken wings though as they were quite hot when we saw them coming down the belt.  \n\nOur waitress was great about refilling my water, I never had to ask.  And her, along with the clean up staff, were pretty quick about clearing the empty dishes. So that was never an issue. \n\nThe dessert menu indicated items and had \"One Time\" written next to each one, so we assumed it meant you were allowed one of each kind of dessert, not one total.  So, we were disappointed when we tried to order a second dessert and was told we could not. This needs to be clear on the menu that it's one dessert only.\n\nThey also add an 18% gratuity because of their promotion, but do not tell you this upfront.  You discover this when you get the bill.  Again, these are things that need to be clear to the customer.\n\nSuggestions to the owners: Hire a dedicated host\/hostess for greeting customers and ensuring parties are seated quickly and efficiently. With only 6 booths, we noticed at least three families who needed high chairs be seated at the bar seats.  I heard the staff member ask each party if the bar seat was okay and they all agree only because they were waiting so long.  It was a struggle for each of these families while they attempted to eat.  These parties could have easily been seated at a booth as there was always one available around the same time they were seated.  (Example: A party of four was seated at a booth on the right section right before a party of 4 plus high chair was seated at the bar in the interior left section.)  With the wait staff being only responsible for their sections, they cannot oversee how to accommodate these parties to be more efficient and that's what a host\/hostess can do.\n\nI initially was going to give this place a three star, but after writing this review I had to move it down to a 2.  Even if they fix the host\/hostess situation, the questionable sushi will not have me returning.  \n\n------------------\n\nRegular prices: $25.99\/pp, Children 3-7 Half price; Children 3 and under can share for an additional $3
