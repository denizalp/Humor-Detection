I really like Guy Fieri, but I'm not a huge fan of his food.  His food tends to be so over the top as it tries to incorporate almost every culinary cliche known to man.  It is like TGIFriday's on steroids.  Of the dishes we had that night I thought the Motley Que was pretty decent albeit a little on the sweet side.  The bread n butter pickle chips gave a nice dimension to the sandwich.  Mac n cheese burger was a bit too much and flavor of mac n cheese got drowned out by the burger.  The Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries is as if Nachos Supreme had an unholy love child with chili cheese fries.  I know that it may be a bit paradoxical, but there are so many flavors, that it ends up having no real flavor.  \n\nService was a miss for us that night as our server never came  by to check on how we were doing.  Sure he passed our table many times...at warp speed. We even had to wait 20 min for our to-go containers.  But this may improve as time goes on as it was pretty clear that they were all overwhelmed. An interesting dinner to chalk one up on my list, but probably won't be returning. $20 for a burger?!?!? Seriously. Burgers should not be the same price as a lap dance.
