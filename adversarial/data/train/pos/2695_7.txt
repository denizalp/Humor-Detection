I stopped in here while waiting for my colleague to drop his car off for service. It smelled god so I floated on in with the aroma of baked goods.  They must have just opened their doors because it was a little sparse on the product.  But that's ok.  I grabbed a donut.  Donuts make me happy. End of story
