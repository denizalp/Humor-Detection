This was my 3rd visit to Rosa's, only because my parents like this place. To me it is crowded, with bland food, high prices. It is kind of nice there in Christmas time as the place is nicely decorated. Yet, it is not real Italian food so, unless you like older crowd and music from 50s, I'd suggest going elsewhere.
