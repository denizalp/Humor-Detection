I came here with my son and his girlfriend and we ordered 4 donuts. We knew exactly what we wanted and told the young man behind the counter our order. I had to repeat my order of 3 different types of donuts because he was not paying attention plus he moved at the speed of a slug. If you have a spare 15 minutes to stand and place an order then this place is for you. How hard is it to use tongs to turn around and pick out ready made donuts on the cart behind you? Should not take half of my life waiting around. \n\nAlso a weird man came from the back and just stood there and stared at us. It was a creepy feeling and made us feel unwelcome.
