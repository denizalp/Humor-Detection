This place is horrible.  The front desk girls are two faces.  They look so unhappy and bitchy there, causing them to give horrible customer service.  No friendly hellos from other staff, groomers, doctors, or even the girl that took our dogs away.  \n\nWe placed our dogs there for boarding for two nights, it came out to $27.50\/ night for the long run.  Some test crap that cost almost $30, just to make sure Dusty can get the Bortedella shot. On top of that, it was $10.50 for the shot.  We wanted extra walks for the dogs, which was $2 an extra for each walk,  $8 for each dog and I don't even think they walked my dogs.  We took them home and they ran to the back right away to poo and it was 12 noon already.   They charge for things and say things like \"there is no way of separating it.\" \n\nI strongly believe that this place neglects your dog.  Our dogs name are Hiro pronouncing heer-ro and Dusty.  They cant even take the time to pronounce your dog's name correctly, which insulted me.  My dogs now have the runs because of their care less ness of feeding my dogs the food that we gave them. \n\nIt is five minutes down the street for my house, but I will never go back.  i would rather cough up more money or even drive further to make sure my dogs get the right tender, loving, care.
