This buffet is overpriced. I have paid the same or maybe more to taste a way better buffet (at the Cosmo) and a slightly better one (at the Wynn). I really don't mind paying if it lives up to the quality, but everything here is a gimmick.\n\nFor starters service is ridiculously terrible. You know most places train their employees to move out of the way for guests when they're walking by, here you have to move for them? As if we should be lucky to taste tacos being served up by someone who probably just got released from a rehabilitation home or omelette's from a \"chef\" that messes one up, doesn't apologize and just cycles through another 5 minutes to give you it. \n\nIt's a large buffet. They have a lot of sections to chose from. I did sample sizes of I'd say 75% of the food and nothing stood out. Really..NOTHING. Things were either decent or a disappointment. I was sad, I usually use table time to talk about how great or good certain things are, I was silent. I had to check my location and make sure I wasn't inside of like the Southpoint Hotel or something of that level.\n\nAvoid this buffet. I don't see what's so great about it? If you want a specific thing I suggest to just find a restaurant that specializes in that in Vegas. If you want brunch find a romantic little spot that will give you a quality experience. And if you really want to go to a buffet, there's a great one at the Cosmopolitan. Even though this buffet is a little pricey, it's ironically cheap.
