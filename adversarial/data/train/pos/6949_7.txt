Worst purchase experience ever.  This was a whole house purchase not a small job.  Seven months after purchase and still not resolved. 100 percent of our contract price collected without our approval.  Wrong blinds order; blind ordered without our approval. Salesperson was unresponsive to our issues. Owner evidently refuses to talk with us and resolve the remaining issue.  A $2500 slider Luminette hangs improperly, has gaps in the pleats, uneven pleating in open position, top corner is folded over and does not lay flat, end bunches into layers instead of hanging evenly, the end does not cover the motor box and it's wires are exposed. The window is exposed on that end.  Hunter-Douglas was consulted, supposedly a new blind was manufactured except it has the same flaws. The before and after pictures show the issues.\n\nThis is the third home we have Hunter Douglas window coverings.  We know the product well.  Our original purchases 20 years ago still hang in beautiful condition in that house.  The problem is the seller not the product.\n\nAfter months of phone calls and emails, two refunds were issued.  We now have no master room shade, several pleated blinds we did not order, three of one kind of shade and a fourth that doesn't match in one room, and a large $2500 shade that looks very unattractive.  The company says that the manufacture is now responsible.  Their response is questionable as this issue remains unresolved.  Since house of window coverings has had our money since early December 2013, the owner of hwclv is responsible.  Sadly, very poor customer treatment.
