I avoided this place like the plague because of its name.  I never thought the skit on SNL was funny.  It's just... I pictured some fat, wife beater-clad gentleman giggling about the name \"Cheeburger Cheeburger\" whilst wiping gravy about his chin.  \n\nI don't know why the mental image came into mind, but it grossed me out.\n\nA few nights ago, I dropped into Tempe Marketplace to catch a movie.  I was also extremely hungry.  I bought my ticket and I was going to grab something to eat super quick, wolf it down and maybe die of a meat coma halfway through the flick.\n\nI saw Cheeburger Cheeburger sort of looming out of the corner of my eye.  I sort of cringed because it's the worst name ever, but I wanted to try it out because I haven't had a decent cheeseburger in forever.  I thought it was gonna be a fast food kinda order, get in and leave type of thing but it was a sit down restaurant.  I had like twenty minutes before my movie started.\n\nI was kinda like, \"Aw shit.  I'm gonna miss like the first five minutes of the movie probably.\"  The place was packed so I thought service was gonna be slow.  My food came quick and I made it to the movie like right in the nick of time.  It was awesome.\n\nService was awesome.  At first, it was a little surreal, because the hostess, like, went on this long, \"How to order...\" monologue and I zoned out because, man, I know how to order food.  I'm kind of a hick sometimes but I know how to order food.  Shit.  I didn't pay attention to her at all.  \n\nBasically, you build your own burger.  Fries aren't included.  Got it.  I built my own burger and it was pretty bomb.  I ordered one of about thirty TRILLION different kind of milkshakes they have.  That milkshake brought me close to orgasm.  \n\nThe food was great.  The service was super awesome.  Considering how hectic and busy it was, it was great.  There was a mix up and I only got half an order on my milkshake, but I never would have known unless my waitress told me because it was already pretty huge.  She said she'd bring me the other half but I was like, \"Nah, this is already bordering gluttony.\"\n\nIf I'm in the neighborhood I'll pop in again.
