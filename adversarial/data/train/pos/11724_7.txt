Incredible variety, fast service, Highly Recommended!\n\nFood:\nAs others have said, this is a Chipotle-style place (think build-your-own) that serves mainly enchiladas and tacos. But if enchiladas and tacos aren't your thing, you can build your meal using a different base, such as tortilla soup, poblano chilis, or a salad base. Since I wanted to go low-carb, but with some spice, I started with the poblanos. This was a good choice, then the difficulty comes in deciding what to add to the base - there are soon many options! To stuff my two poblanos, I finally selected green chile pork, and roasted tomatillo chicken - and they were awesome!! I topped them with \"Christmas\" sauce (red and green), chihuahua cheese (like cheddar), and pico. They put your creation through the oven to bake it and seal in the flavors, then you add the toppings.  The taste was amazing! And there are so many combinations to try! Yummy on steroids!\n\nCost:\nMy two-poblano meal, with iced tea, was $10.43 including tax, which was very reasonable.\n\nService: \nThe staff were fast, although not very helpful in guiding me to the perfect enchilada. \n\nAtmosphere:\nOk, functional, but no booths or privacy.\n\nOverall:\nAmazing flavors, so many options, I will definitely be returning again and again!!
