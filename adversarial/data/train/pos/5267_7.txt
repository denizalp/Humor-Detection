This is a little kiosk in the mall.  I came here about a year ago to get my daughters ears pierced with my lady.  I'm here today because she keeps taking her dang earrings out and losing them.  So what better place to come to than the place I originally brought her.  There's really not much to it.  2 employees and ally of the jewelry.  I was helped fairly quickly by both employees and I ended up getting my daughter some gold screw back earrings.  \n\nI'm sure I'll be back here in the future and it's my first choice for kids earrings and reasonably priced.
