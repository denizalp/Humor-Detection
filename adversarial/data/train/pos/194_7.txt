You were there when I needed you LCBO..and for that I will never forget you..\n\nI just wish you didn't close so bloody early..what..people in Ontario don't need alcohol past 9pm?? Seriously?? What up with that?? I mean..I am greatfull you were there for me and all but I have to say I am a bit hurt to think you won't be there fr me past 9pm....and for that I can't give you 5 stars..but you should know that it hurts me to deny you that honor...
