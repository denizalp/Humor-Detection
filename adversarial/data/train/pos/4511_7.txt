Given the recent shake-up of events at KSR, my Yelp bud Abbas & I decided to finally make a date at Sukho Thai's to taste and experience what all the fuss was about.\n\nThe interior of Sukho's is pleasantly modern, with dark woods exposed brick and has MUCH more room to move than Khao San.  Service was fairly quick and friendly, as it should be given it wasn't the mad house that KSR can be.\n\nMenu wise it is fairly close to KSR , but sadly Sukho does not offer the squash fritters   :(   On the plus side, you can actually make a reservation at Sukho's and not have to wait an hour to mope around the entertainment district to be seated...that's  certainly something of a leg-up on KSR.\n\nI ordered Lemongrass iced tea, like Abbas states is pretty underwhelming if not a tad too sweet, pretty much like glucose pimped out water, but the real shocker for me was that it was that Abbas ordered a virgin drink???\n\nThe Khao soi chicken was good, and the curry itself was so creamy rich and filling.  My problem is, I had to spoon out a huge dollop of chili paste\/flakes beforehand as I had specifically asked for MILD, NOT SPICY!!!  I was not impressed, but remained quiet about it like the nice Asian I can (sometimes) be.  \n\nOkay, here comes the bitching...How is it that I went to Khao San two weeks earlier and was able to order THE SAME THING in an environment where the music is cranked at concert like decibels, where it is packed to the gills and the staff is worked into a near frenzy\/riot from the skirmishes happening near the endlessly crowded doorway from the anxious folks all lined up, acting all cracked-out waiting to get in and yet my order came EXACTLY PERFECTLY MILD like I asked, yet at the serene calm quiet and seemingly controlled environment of Sukho Thai, not a single fuck was given toward my request for mild?\n\nWe finished off with a duo of desserts which was the Tapioca with coconut milk and the incredible cassava cake!  The tapioca dessert was alright, but the cassava cake was the clear winner as it reminded me of a much more decadent and creamy flavoured version of mochi with coconut flakes...okay so a small victory for Sukho's.\n\nIn conclusion, I have to agree with a good portion of previous Yelpers and say while the food is on par if not rather excellent in quality, the service at Sukho Thai NEEDS to be FINE TUNED.  Yes we all have PMS days and yes sometimes customers can be picky as hell, but if you wanna be bigtime and roll with the likes of Khao San, a very simple request for not spicy should not be overlooked.
