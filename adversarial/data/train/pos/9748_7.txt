This used to be my favourite comic shop in the valley hands-down, I've been popping in every couple of months or so since I was still in elementary school. Back then, it was in a different building, but even up until the last year or so the staff have been really helpful. Most of the things I read and watch are foreign, so up until a few months ago, the staff were incredibly helpful in tracking down whatever it was that I was looking for.\n\nWell, I don't know where they got their current staff, but they need to send them back. Most days I walk in, I'm either ignored completely while the staff seems to have disappeared, or when they are there, the person I can only assume is the manager (?) hits on me. I realise I'm taking my life into my own hands as a female entering a comic shop, but the staff there is awful either way.\n\nThe prices I can forgive if the service is at least going to be good. But Atomic Comics charges WAY more than other stores in the valley, especially on back issues, toys, and shirts, at least from what I've seen. I don't remember if they were always this pricey, but for less money I can go down to All About Books and Comics, Hero Comics, or wherever and buy back issues for cover price with a floor staff that actually seems to know what they are doing. \n\nOne of the more aggravating things I've noticed is how often they rearrange this store, as well. It's like navigating a labyrinth some weeks just trying to get to the posters in the back. Only instead of a minotaur in the center, there's an asian guy waiting to hit on you, or some kids screaming and playing magic cards. I haven't noticed the big card tables outside on weekends in a long time, maybe they finally cut the card playing out or something, but either way that's really the only positive thing I can add.
