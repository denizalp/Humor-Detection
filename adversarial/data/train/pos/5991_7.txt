A Fox Restaurant Concept on wheels?  Yes, please!\n\nNot only is this the prettiest food truck I've ever seen, but it serves some damn good food along with friendly service.  It's reliable too... I had The Rocket's pizza and salad for the first time in Flagstaff of all places.  \n\nIf you like the menu at North Italia and you're looking to cater a private or corporate event for up to 300 people, give Lauren at The Rocket a call.  And then give me a call so I can plan to attend!
