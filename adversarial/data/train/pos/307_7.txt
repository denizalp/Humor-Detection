Attended a birthday dinner for my friend with about 10 others, we placed our apps and dinner orders and ended up waiting close to 2 hours for anything resembling food to appear......I mean we didn't even receive the appetizer ahead of time.....and no explanation as to what was taking so long until 2 hours later.....the manager comes out to make sure we still want the food before they put it on plates...really?  How about a manager appearance at the 45 minute or 1 hour mark?  We did get an apology and half off but still completely unacceptable for a 'wanna be' upscale restaurant...
