So what can I say that so many others haven't about Target? I can tell you that with my near daily visits to this place (I live literally right behind the store) that I've really gotten to know everyone here and most I have become good friends with. An outstanding customer experience every visit!\n\nThis store is one of the most well kept in the area. It seems that the Mooresville store becomes a zoo and it's hard to keep a zoo in order. Huntersville has major crowds as well and it doesn't help that it is a considerably smaller store with limited perishables like Produce (and not a deli to speak of). When you step back and watch how the employees operate, they work as a team and keep a 'guest-first' attitude while stocking or making aisles or displays look presentable.\n\nMy favorite part about this store is the fact that their produce section is very open, clean, and well stocked with a good selection. You go to some locations and the produce is tucked into a corner and it seems as though one person is working half the store. Not here, I've always been able to find a friendly associate to help me if needed. There are some speciality perishables I have to go to Harris Teeter for, but 95% of the time it is a convenient stop on my way home.\n\nTheir 5% off with a RedCard combined with Cartwheel (google it if you're unfamiliar) can save you a ton of money if you're a Target loyal. Ask a cashier or the customer service desk as they have debit and credit options.\n\nI definitely applaud the management team here, as attitude always reflects leadership and you can tell they run a tight ship.
