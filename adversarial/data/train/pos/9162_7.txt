This place is so close to me, that I can walk here. The ladies who work here are all very nice. With the exception of Lee. I don't see how they can walk around and work in their tiny high heels, but they manage.\nYou walk in, sign your name on a list, mark if you want a pedicure,manicure, fill etc. Pick out your color and then either wait if there are people ahead of you, or go straightback.\nI was getting a pedicure. The massage chairs they use are so close together, but it wasnt a problem. The chairs work nicely and I was very relaxed. They have a t.v there that plays nothing but \"Friends\" reruns. Sometimes I can't help letting out a giggle or two when Phoebe sings her crazy songs. A pedicure runs 18.00. If you want a callous remover,or sea salt scrub it is 5 dollars more. I have done both and came home with baby soft fooooties. Once I broke my right toenail and they managed to add a tip on that toe only that looked so natural. I think that was only 5 bucks. \nI usually don't do the decorations. I seem to get the techs that are new at designs. Last time I heard \"yooo wan flowah?\" I said a tiny one..and ended up with a big bouquet on my big toe. So not pretty. She was even more upset when I diddnt like it. yeah we are talking about Lee ladies. Mai and the rest of the girls are great. I still continue to go here and have been going now for a few years. I have also had a manicure here. When my daughter was 6 she used to go in and get her nails painted with a flower for 7 dollars. Its a great thing moms and daughters can do together.\nEDIT: Lee is just not a pleasant person. The place decided to squeeze in more chairs to fit more people. It feels over crowded now. I liked it better when it was \"my place around the corner\", now it's everyones. I will go back. Just try to avoid the dragon lady Lee.
