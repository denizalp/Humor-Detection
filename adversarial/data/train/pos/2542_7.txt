I am a huge fan of this place! As far as restaurants in Lorain County goes The Jackalope is the top of the line! The best time of the year to go is definitely during late spring through early fall. You can enjoy the sunset over the marina and over Lake Erie while eating dinner or having a few drinks with friends. Have a boat? Take advantage of their public dock where you can park your boat and then come into the restaurant for a nice dinner. \n\nIf you go in the winter it is also nice. They have a great fireplace and dining room area that is very cozy. \n\nThe wait staff is always polite and helpful and the owner is usually around as well. \n\nI have never had a meal that I didn't like at the Jackalope. My favorites are always their daily seafood specials. The dinner portion sizes are perfect, but they also have great salads, soups and desserts if you have a bug appetite. I do wish that their menu was a big more extensive, but what they do have is great!\n\nThe Jackalope can be a very classy and dressy place, but I would think nothing of walking in on a week night after leaving the gym in my sweats and a sweatshirt. Pretty much anything goes here as far as dress...especially in the summer. \n\nIf you are looking for a nicer, more upscale dinner in Lorain County or are looking for a nice romantic restaurant then I would give the Jackalope a try!!!
