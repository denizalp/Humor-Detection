Decided to stop here because it was a beach bar theme which I love, and also to watch the Ducks play the Pac-12 championship game. It's a big bar, with plenty of gaming areas, a couple pool tables off to the side, and an electronic dartboard.\nIt also has an outdoor patio area that they use for giant beer pong. I believe this is owned now by the group that owns all the Lodge places.\n\nThe place was pretty empty for 6pm on a Friday night. I think only me and 2 others were there. They have no happy hour specials. They also do not have a kitchen, so you can get your food from Roberto's Taco Shop next door, or The Stop N Shop. I hope they put in a restaurant for better food selection.\n\nTV's for the game are all above the bar, and maybe 30\". They need to upgrade that to be considered a sports bar. \n\nService was pretty good, and friendly. New waitress there was very kind. \n\nOverall, it has loads of potential, but they need management to create an atmosphere that will draw in the crowds. A happy hour is a good start.
