I've been waiting for this place to open after trying their acai bowl from their food truck. Located across the street from UNLV (Greenspun building\/ Student Union) and same lot as Cafe Rio, Rebel Books, etc. I marched here and dragged a friend with me after class. \n\nThey have acai bowls, smoothies, and fresh juices. I avoid bottled\/pre-packaged fruit juices as they're loaded with sugar even if they claim to be organic\/ natural\/ healthy and what have you - fresh is where it's at. They also have vegan cookies, granola bars, MAQ 7 juice (7 super fruits: maqui, Siberian pineapple, cili, goji berries, acai, Alaskan blueberry, and gac), Bowl of Heaven mercy such as caps and shirts. What they don't have is nutrition facts - not even on their website. Their protein is plant-based (pea, hemp, chia seeds and rice).\n\nNorth Shore Acai Bowl:\nAcai, strawberries, bananas, granola, honey, MAQ7 juice, apple juice, blueberries, hemp and flax seeds. Great flavor and texture combination. I love the granola they use because they're crispy and not the typical crunchy-but-chewy-stick-to-your-teeth granola texture. 4\/5\n\nPeanut Butter Acai Bowl: \nPeanut butter, acai, bananas, granola, honey, MAQ7 juice, chocolate almond milk, strawberries, blueberries, hemp and flax seeds. I added chocolate protein powder (you can add 11g or 22g of vanilla or chocolate protein powder to anything).  I typically hate chocolate + peanut butter combo so, I'm not sure what I was thinking for getting this. But oh my, was it delicious! This would probably be the menu item with the highest calorie content. I would guess the regular bowl I got was at least 800 calories - perfect for those who are bulking or those that have a crazy metabolism like me. 5\/5\n\nClean and spacious interior. They have tables and chairs as well as bar\/counter top area with plugging stations. There's free wifi - just ask them for the code.\n\nI noticed that they currently have only 2 sizes for the bowls: regular and large ($2 difference but portions aren't that much different) and they're not set up for online ordering and rewards program yet. However, they've only been open for 2 days so, calm down. They're giving out free samples, pens and fridge magnet clippy things.\n\nI'm just happy that we have a nutritious option around campus. We can have fruits, veggies, protein, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents served deliciously in a bowl or cup instead of lard slapped onto carbs!
