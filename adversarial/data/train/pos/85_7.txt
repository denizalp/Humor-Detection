The Guinness World Record for fastest to eat a jelly-filled doughnut is 33 seconds.  Can you beat it?\n\nThe cake doughnuts here are really dense which was amazing for the blueberry.  The yeast-raised doughnuts are soft and fluffy.  The cherry buttermilk doughnut?  Oh man!  So good.  I didn't try any of the others in my bounty of doughnuts as I'm not a fan of the filled doughnuts but I heard they were amazing --- especially the free bear claw we had received. \n\nI know Daylight Donuts is a franchise that has been around since 1954, there are over 900 locations, the guy who works in this location is the sweetest guy ever, and the doughnuts aren't all that bad but I gotta admit, I've had better!  But this doesn't diminish the fact that they have a great product.\n\n*sweats*  Oh man, I hate to be the one that breaks a 5-star streak...
