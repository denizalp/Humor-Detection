I tried this place tonight.  The buffet had several tasty options.  I enjoyed everything I tried.  This is a family run place.   I thought it was very welcoming.  I can see why folks have complained about the service in other reviews.  I found the service to be low-key, but still accommodating.  You just make yourself at home.  To me, it felt like I'd been invited over to a family dinner.  \n\nThere is a wide selection of beverages.  The price is very reasonable, especially for the kids.  And I found it very kid-friendly (assuming your children are accustomed to ethnic foods).
