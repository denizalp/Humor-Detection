I dropped by here on the way back home, and I must say that I am not a fan.\nReally smoky.\nReally dark.\nThe carpeting was really old.\nAlmost seedy-looking.\nEven though I only drink water or iced-tea, the cocktail waitresses were more than happy to serve me quickly and very politely.\nI can't really comment on the gambling, because I didn't put in enough hours to give a proper evaluation, but I couldn't stay in there very long because of the smoke.\nThe casino that it most reminded me of was El Cortez, so if you've been there, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
