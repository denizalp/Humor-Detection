I frequently have very naughty dreams about the Butter Chicken at Bombay Mahal.\n\nIn them, I am alone at the restaurant with a giant tub of Butter Chicken. It's just me, the tub of butter chicken, an endless supply of garlic naan bread, some rice, and maybe a few cold beers.\n\nAnd some vegetable pakoras. And some samosas.\n\nWhat happens next is too hot for Yelp but let's just say in the end, I have to be carried out of there.\n\nTrue story, I have offered 1000$ to the owner of Bombay Mahal (Jean-Talon location) for their butter chicken recipe and they refused.\n\nI will agree with the other reviewers that this place is probably a disgrace for the true, incredibly amazing Indian cuisine, but the butter chicken is so good, once it touches your lips nothing else matters.
