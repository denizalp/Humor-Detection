Eh, i liked it with the other management before they fired everone and hired uber trendy \"cooler than you\" people.  They still get decent shows and have some great beer deals but man.  its so clean now.  And the girl jeans wearing crowd has moved in on certain nights.  Dont get me wrong, Ill still patronize when they have decent shows, but it's not the kind of place you go after work to unwind with a beer and good conversation.\n\nOne thing Ill give them props for, the be your own f-in DJ night. Great idea where people show up with random records and get to spin them.
