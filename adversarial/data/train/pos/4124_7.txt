Let me start with the fact that if I could give less than one star, I would. When arriving to \"Daring Escapes\" there is no clear direction as to how to enter the building, where to report to, or even if the place truly exists. Through the other participants who arrived before us we learned that you wait in the generic lobby of an office building and someone will come get you when they are ready for you. \n\nAfter entering the \"briefing room\" and signing a generic waiver a lady with a fake accent reads you a list of rules. Might I add, she does it very quickly and with the other participants talking and the \"zombie\" beating on the door of the room, so they are hard to hear. One rules I did hear her say was \"Do not move the furniture\" (one of the clues involves movement of the furniture).\n\nWe are told there are 5 clues that we must open to obtain freedom from the room where the zombie is encapsulated. This room is roughly 8'X10' and they crammed 12 participants in there with 3 desks, a small end table, a book case, two cabinets, plus the zombie and the \"moderator\". I get this is a for-profit business but this should have been my first indicator for what we were in for. Putting 12 people in a space that small is just out right irresponsible. Multiple times I got slammed into walls and stepped on by other participants.  Almost immediately I notice the room is getting hot... as it turns out there is no air-conditioning in the room, nor is there ventilation. \n\nThe \"moderator\" is there to help you while figuring out clues. If properly done this would not be needed. With only 20 some people getting out \"alive\" and 40 some succumbing to eminent \"death\" by zombie with the help of this woman.... Should tell you something about the complexity and\/or clarity of their clues. Within the first 10 minutes of being in the room the moderator scolded us like children for removing a \"clue\" from the wall. It was a laminated card. \n\nNext the moderator told us when we figured out the combination for a brief case she would hand it to us as a group prior had broken the lock. Why this was not replaced is beyond me. Using a broken prop that can be replaced for under $100 is unprofessional. \n\n At one point this \"moderator\" told us to \"wrap ze zombies chain around ze desk\". Considering he was already \"wrapped\" around the desk just by crawling his way around it a member of our group misunderstood her direction and touched the chain. To this the woman broke character screamed at the top of her lungs AT the member of our group \"WHAT ARE THE RULES?!?! WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT TOUCHING THE CHAIN?!?!!\" All of the air (the little that was actually in there) got sucked out of the room. Everyone stopped. Her irrational reaction leads me to believe she is dating the zombie and is VERY overprotective. But let me tell you.... You DO NOT treat customers like that. No one was in danger (except the participants of HEAT STROKE). And if you want people to hear and listen and follow rules DO NOT distract them when you are giving rules. \n\nAfter her little temper tantrum I had decided I was done with this little \"adventure\". I was so hot and thirsty I lost all interest in solving the mystery. Unlocking of one of the clues involved a mechanical toy. Which malfunctioned. How are we to solve a clue when the equipment is broken?\n\nDO NOT WASTE your time or money. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had.
