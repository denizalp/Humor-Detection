It had been awhile since I had been to Lenny's and I was really looking forward to it. \n\nThe food is still great but you should take it to go...unless you want a hooker with your burger. Yeah got propositioned by a hooker in the drive through.\n\nThe burgers are big and delicious with many combinations of condiments to choose from...fries? crispy on the outside soggy in the middle and just a hint of garlic salt..yum. They close the shake machine at 8 which blows. I really wanted choclately goodness. \n\nThere is also one of those meth billboards with the gross mouth right across fromt he drive through and that is not appetizing. Oh yes and the kid working the drive through kept playing with his lip ring which I must say grossed me out a bit...just not enough to not eat my delicious goodies....\n\nIf someone had picked the food up for me I would have gone four stars but I must say...the hooker, meth, and piercings brought my appetite down a bit.
