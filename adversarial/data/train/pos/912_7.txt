Excellent service, gorgeous desserts, bagels & lots of choices.  A regular recommended the ham or soft salami sandwich & said not to order the fried chicken or shrimp.  I took his advice & ordered the Salami on Rye w\/ Pepperjack.  It tasted like bologna & I hate bologna.  \n\nI do like Carnegie type of deli's, and maybe if I ordered a different meat it would've been more enjoyable.  Next time.  It was made perfectly & I like everything else about the deli, but rating off of the Salami, I put two packets of mayo on it & thru all of the meat still couldn't taste mayo so I took off half of the salami.  \n\nI definitely want to try more here, but not this again.  Also the dessert case looks like dessert heaven!
