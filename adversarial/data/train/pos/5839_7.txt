First time visiting the Summerlin location which is in a newer building compared to the original in North Las Vegas. The interior d√©cor is full of southern charm and Saint memorabilia.\n\nBeing a Sunday, the restaurant offered unlimited brunch mimosas, a brunch menu and beignets. Unfortunately they ran out of fresh crawfish.\n\nI inquired what was popular and my friendly waitress suggested the Drew Brees po boy sandwich - in addition, we had a order of jambalaya and beignets for dessert. Overall, the food was solid and satisfied my Cajun craving.\n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere of this location over the original not to mention this is spacious inside even at the tables in the bar. I'd recommend Lola's if you're in the mood for some southern hospitality.
