EXTREMELY RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE. BEWARE! Walked in and asked for some information and a tour. Number 1- nowhere on here does it say \"tour by appointment only\" number 2- if you're running a business don't ever tell a potential customer \"you wouldn't be able to afford us\" you run a shit customer service based dog day care out of your home. You turned away a nurse and a bank employee. Don't always judge a book by its cover. You're $55 a night for a medium sized home but now Luxe Pet Hotel is going to be getting $205 a night. I will be sure to let anyone I know to avoid this place. Thanks! \n\nTo your reply, George- you're apologizing for your own customer service? I spoke to the husband of the company, assuming that would be you. Once again, you should make it clear that it's by appointment. You are running a business and I would assume you'd like to keep the business running and based on the way you talked to potential customer's was beyond me. I'll also reporting it to the BBB. No excuses for the comment that was said. Why would there need to be an appointment, anyways? I visited 4 other boarding places with dogs roaming and no appointment needed. Seems a bit odd to me.
