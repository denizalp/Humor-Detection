Exceptional Entree - Spicy Thai Basil with Asian Eggplant, Beef added!!! \n\nTonight for Dinner first there were the appetizers:  Pot Stickers (fried not steamed Dumplings in a sweet Curry), Beef Satay with Peanut Sauce (Deejai has my favorite Peanut Sauce).  Jai  (the Owner) recommended Satay with Beef (last Year not tonight) and I have been getting the Beef almost every time.  I like the Chicken Satay very much and you can get a Combo Satay (may not be on the menu).\n\nThe entree was Exceptional and Inspired a new list for any Entree this AWESOME ... ready here it is \"Chimpballistic\" Sensationally Exceptional Entrees - Here is the rundown on this one - It is Rich in Flavor Complexity though its makeup is simple (no clowney extras): Garlic, minced Hot Peppers (level Two spicy was perfectly HOT), Thai Basil, Soy Sauce, Oil (just enough to cook it in - Not noticeable in the dish at all!!!), Asian Eggplant (the long Beautiful purple kind) and I ruined it for the Vegetarians when I added Beef (not listed this way on the Menu).\n\nDessert:  Mango and Sweet Sticky Rice  with Ice Cream, topped with Sesame Seeds!  Excellent!!! A  Tracy Chapman song was playing (not \"Fast Car\") and it sounded like some new R.E.M (maybe) also.  They usually have some music I like here!\n\nTonight was my 29th dine at Deejai and 8th time this year!  Their service team serves the whole restaurant and inspired my \"Smooth Operations\" List!  They are that incredible!\n\nModern - Modern - Modern!  The Decor - The menu - Deejai adds a modern twist to many dishes, so if you want more traditional Thai - ask someone what to order (not me I have my mouth full)!
