\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is pretty accurate.\n\nLet me preface this review by stating that I'm by no means a \"ramen connoisseur\", as I've only had ramen once before at Kinton Ramen on Yonge.  However, that one time at Kinton Ramen was a better experience imo.\n\nThe service was pretty decent.  They even brought me a hamper to put my backpack in when they seated me.  One peculiar thing that happened was that they gave me a glass of lukewarm water - it wasn't cold\/didn't have any ice (-1 for serving me lukewarm water).\n\nNext thing to note was the buttload of \"upselling\" that occurred here.  The first thing they mentioned when I got the menu was their special \"Chinese New Year\" special that costed ~$19, which included ramen and a drink.  Next, I asked my waitress if she had any suggestions.  She proceeded to show me a couple of the more expensive options that costed ~$15.  Nah, I was looking for the more basic options, just looking for a quick bite, so I chose the Shoyu Ramen.  She then told me that the large was $1.00 extra (wasn't even indicated on the menu).  I ended up just ordering the regular size.  She then asked me if I wanted to add any extras - egg, etc.  I got the egg, because protein.\n\nThe ramen only took like 3 minutes to make, so that was nice.  In terms of the taste, it was okay.  It probably has the nutritional value of a pack of supersized Mcdonald's Fries tbh - it was pretty salty - but such is ramen.  The ramen noodles were pretty decent, the pork and egg were good too.\n\nI much preferred Kinton Ramen.  Their menus were better laid out, and you got to customize your ramen more.  Here, the menus were crappy quality with set prices + waitresses upselling.  Not down.  I ended up spending $15.60.  I feel like I could've got a nice bento box at a sushi place for this price, or got the same nutritional value and satiety from a box of fries from McDonald's for $3.
