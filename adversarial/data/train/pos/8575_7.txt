Overall - better than I expected. \n\nI came here for a birthday party (late at night), so the majority of us only ordered drinks and desserts.  \n\nI ordered a glass of red wine and the Nutella crepe. The cabernet was okay, I would recommend the drink goblets, but the Nutella crepe was yummy.\n\nA little expensive for something I could make at home for $3.00, but when you go here, you pay for the atmosphere and view.  Sugar Factory has an AMAZING view of the Bellagio fountains - one of the best in the city, in fact. Gorgeous french doors opens the restaurant to views of Bellagio, Caesars, and the Cosmopolitan.  During the day, I would imagine this location being great for people watching.\n\nThe restaurant was extremely loud, and it was difficult (to say the least) to hear across the table.  Even the waiter had to yell at us in order for anyone to hear him.  \n\nThe service was okay.  The server was not as attentive as he could have been (it took forever for us to get our bill\/drink refills). \n\nThe store connected to the restaurant is pretty neat.  They have just about every type of candy you could imagine (and of course, the world famous lollipops).  - Pretty cool, I must say.\n\nI do not think I will be back (out of choice), but if a friend ever wanted to meet here, I wouldn't oppose.
