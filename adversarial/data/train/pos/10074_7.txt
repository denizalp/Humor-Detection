Hi Sisters!!!!!!!! (in my best James Charles voice)\n\nMind blowing flavor explosions in your mouth. \nThat's how I would explain the Sister's food.\n\nBeing plant based I have had zero problems getting my fix on Drunken Noodles, Papaya Salad, amazing veggie rice, veggie Pad Thai.......and I get the actual medium spice I want! :D The sisters understand no fish sauce, no meats and accommodate. \n\nComplex flavors in a non complex place. \n\nPeople scrunch theirs noses when I tell them where it is. Don't be a stuck up a-hole and just go here and eat.\nYes, I have had encounters with men asking me for money and water near the front of the door of the place. I dealt with it and got over it. Never had an issue parking here either. \n\nI usually call in my order and I usually do my pickup for lunch. Food is ready on my way there. Hot and ready with a kind smile. \n\nIf you ask for medium, you will get medium. Peppery, spicy love. Veggies are crisp and fresh, the eggplant is soft and yummy, the noodles are abundant. Love that. Check out my photos, they will make you drool.\n\nThis is also a market and I get all my noodles, pepper paste and sriracha here. Low prices with a smile.\n\nThis family is amazing and I feel welcomed like a sister! LOVE THAT!
