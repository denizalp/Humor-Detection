Stopped in here one morning for breakfast with a few coworkers. I was super optimistic and excited to try the place out because it comes so highly reviewed on yelp.\n\nThe food was good, but our service was really subpar. It took about 8 minutes for us to get any attention when we walked in, so we were off to a pretty bad start. \n\nAs it turned out, we ended up being somewhat in a hurry but after about 25 minutes we finally decided to tell the server that when the order came up to please box it to go. \n\nThat took yet another 10 minutes or so before we finally got our food. So all in all, about 40 to 45 minutes to get food and we didn't end up dining there.\n\nBecause they realized how incredibly slow the service was, they did offer us some free cinnamon rolls that were very tasty.\n\nI may stop back in sometime for cinnamon roll but I can almost say with 100% certainty that I won't be going back for another meal.
