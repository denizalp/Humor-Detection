1st time and I'll definitely be back. I liked that the hostess takes your number and calls you when your table is ready. The chicken satay was very tender, and the peanut sauce was delicious. I ordered the Red Chicken Curry for dinner and it was pretty good. I think we both ordered it with a level 1 (she made me nervous that it would be too spicy) I loved the spice level, but my friend found it a little too spicy. Cute place, and I really liked the covered outdoor patio. \n\n12\/14 I had to update my review. The Tom Kha soup with shrimp is absolutely delicious. We also tried the ginger fried rice was so good. We ordered it with beef, but next time we will get it with chicken or shrimp. \n\nThis place gets better every time I eat here.
