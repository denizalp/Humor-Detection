Well, first I'm a Bucs fan so I rarely come here since it would be to a division rivals crib, but since the ACC championship game was held here, I had no choice , as I wasn't going to miss my Canes playing for there first, like ever conference championship!  Sad, I know.\n\nBut it is a nice stadium (4\/5) and the access is not bad by stadium standards imo (5\/5). However, wouldn't suggest bringing a clear bag as the bag lines are ridiculously long.  \n\nOnce inside, the infrastructure is nice which facilitates efficient access to the various levels (5\/5) and considering the game was sold out at 74k people, that says a lot. The food service and restroom lines were long, but par for the course compared to other stadiums I've been to (5\/5) and since it was sold out.  There are two large jumbotrons, so watching the field\/game was easy to do (5\/5) and since I like big crowds, it added to the fun.\n\nThe games outcome sucked as my boys got whupped, but still had a blast!  Great stadium to visit. Go Canes!!
