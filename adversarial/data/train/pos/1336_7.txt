Cant believe how busy it was on a Wed morning! About a 15 minute wait at 9:40 am. Very nice though, prompt service, freshly squeezed fresh OJ, lots of choice. Food was fresh delicious and served quickly. Approx $9 for each item (omelette, burrito, pancakes, eggs benedict). NE corner of Hayden and Via de Ventura. Nice patio with umbrellas and misters.
