Yu can't pass this one up!\n\nIf you like an overpriced plate of 80% rice, 10% chicken, and 10% heavy, syrupy, cloying, sauce, don't go here - go to Pei Wei or PF Changs (btw PF stands for \"Paul Flemming\" - sounds like authentic Chinese to me, doesn't it?). If you don't want to eat in a converted 70's era Taco Bell minus the hanging bell (the parapet remains however), then don't go here.  If you think the fortune cookie was invented in China, don't even think about going here.  But...  if you have sense enough to know what authentic Chinese food is, this is your place.  Heck, even if you have chosen to avoid decades of chain smoking in order to preserve one or two taste buds, please visit Yu's.  \n\nYu's has all of the classic Chinese dishes that want to call your mouth home.  They are executed perfectly and all look good enough for the opening screen shot of an episode of \"Yan Can Cook.\"  And all this for dirt-poor bargain prices even my parents could have afforded.  \n\nBreakfast?  What do you mean, breakfast?  Yes, they have breakfast too.  Now this is the Southern-California Chinese-American take on breakfast.  I'll fill you in on a little secret.  Even  the Chinese don't like Chinese breakfast.  So, they have adopted some of ours as their favorites.  Examples include pancakes, bacon and eggs, and biscuits with gravy.  Don't go here looking for eggs Benedict.  The Chinese don't eat that for breakfast, and neither should you.  And did I mention they have American desserts as well?  When was the last time you had made-to-order Chinese food followed by a brownie?  So Yu go here and eat.  And if Yu can't make it to the restaurant, and you are lucky enough to live in the gorgeous enclave of Sunnyslop (\"e\" omitted for emphasis), or even in the quaint hood of Moon Valley, then give Yu a call.  Their delivery driver uses a motorcycle.  Seeing that balancing act is worth the admission price by itself.
