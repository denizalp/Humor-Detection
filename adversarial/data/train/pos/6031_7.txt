24\/7 American Diners... just like the good ole' days of late nights out in the suburbs.\n\nThis place is aiite. Typical Diner food, but pricier. I accompanied my girlfriend here after a night of drinking and staying up late. She was hungover like a mofo, so we thought food would make her feel better. Plus she said she'd pay, since I held her hair for her while she puked up a boot. Unfortunately, I wasn't very hungry and I'm kind of trying to watch my figure so I went with the biscuits and country gravy with a side of grits. My alcoholic girlfriend ordered a glass of orange juice and a country omelet. Although the food is pricey, you get a pretty large portion. My biscuits were very buttery and the country gravy gave it a nice creamy texture to them. The potatoes were delicious and the sausage was just wateves. Luckily my girlfriend had to puke some more, so while she was gone I got to taste her country omelet. It sucked. cold, gross, and rubbery. Anyways, I asked for the check and to my surprise the meal was over 40 bucks. My girlfriend's OJ was 6 bucks. damn. if you get a screwdriver on the casino floor, that would have been free. I went thru my girlfriends purse and gave the server her credit card. -1 star for lack of security.\n\nA little about my credentials:\n\nI first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.
