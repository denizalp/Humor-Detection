As someone who is 100% Bangladeshi, I can say with great confidence, that this place is fantastic. From their wonderful buffet to their food off the menu, this is as close to my mama's food as I will ever get in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe buffet contains your typical Indian fare, from Tandoori chicken to vegetable korma. Whenever my parents come to visit, I always bring them here and the owners of the restaurant treat them like royalty. We all converse in Bangla, discussing everything from politics to Bollywood music. My mom was so comfortable that she went back to kitchen to talk to the cooks about cooking techniques! \n\nAs for the food off the menu, I once ordered the Fish Curry and it was SLAMMIN'. Perfectly spicy and most importantly, tasted like home. No fishy taste at all. \n\nDecor could be less cheesy, I think. I wish they would put more items that embraced Bangladeshi culture, but that is a small price to pay for excellent service and great food. \n\nBottom line: I've always had a great time here, whether I'm eating their buffet or food of their menu. I highly recommend this spot if you want to try some authentic Bangladeshi cuisine!
