It is my theory that all things mixed end up greater than their two parts...ever seen Halle Berry?  Exactly.\n\nSo during my last Vegas adventure, the girls and I stopped in to China Poblano...the beautiful baby of when Mexico and China do it.\n\nThe decor was cute. Not only a mix of Chinese and Mexican iconography, it was also a mix of casual and a tad more upscale. The staff was friendly and on point.  Quick with the smiles and the conversation.  But the real pride of the litter was the food.\n\nWe ordered:\nGuacamole\nWhen Pigs Fly\nBeijing Glass\nTuna Ceviche\nMexican Mimosa\n\nIt was all fantastic.\n\nFirst of all, the guacamole was flavorful, smooth and had enough kick to make the table of Latinas eating it nod in appreciation.\nWhen Pigs Fly (pork buns) were fluffy and rivaled the traditional buns I've had.\nBeijing Glass was zesty and refreshing.\nMexican mimosa was refreshing with just the right bitch slap of booze to make it interesting.\n\nBut they all were dwarfed by the sheer awesomeness that was the Tuna Ceviche.  There were so many textures, flavors and spices that we all could barely contain ourselves!  It was the perfect marriage of Mexican spice and Chinese textures...exactly what this place is all about.  \n\nNext time I go to Vegas (it will be soon) I'm going back to see my little half breed one more time.
