As a guy, I have to say that the place looks very girlish. It is a very cute place, very modern and is somewhat of a gimmick to get people inside.  Having said that, I can see the attraction of this spot, and definitely maybe somewhere to bring a date for dessert.\n\nI went  to this place this evening with  friends because they wanted to have some frozen yogurt. I happened to check-in on yelp and lo' and behold, a yelp deal popped up.\n\nGot a free yogurt because of it after my friend Andy paid for his. I had a small peppermint with raspberry toppings, which was absolutely perfect. I do recommend this place since it is in a great location. It's a lovely place to go after a dinner with friends.
