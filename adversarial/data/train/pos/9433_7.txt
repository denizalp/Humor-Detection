I brought a group of ten people here for dinner.  Due to a severe rain storm and flash flooding the majority of my group arrived later then 2 other people.  My ONLY issue is that they refused to seat them until we arrived.  These people were my guests and I wanted them to have a drink before we got there.  I didn't like that policy at all.  \n\nWe ordered the Hogapeno Dip, a Queso Dip with Meat, a Queso Dip without meat, Fries with pimento cheese and the Bacon wrapped jalapenos to start with.  WE LOVED EVERYTHING.  My personal favorites were the Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos and the Hogapeno Dip.  OMG!!!  So good.  We ate every appetizer and everyone raved about how much they liked it.\n\nI had the Carolina Pulled Pork with Creamed Corn and Cole Slaw.  PERFECTION.  Then I ordered a pig out platter for everyone to try all the meats.  The ribs were a huge hit and the brisket was amazing.  But those who ordered the burnt ends were in heaven with their choice.  They LOVED IT.  Since we had pigged out on the starters, we all ended up taking our items to go.  The Pecan Cobbler was so decadent and everyone loved it.  I had the strawberries and cream pie and it was delightful.\n\nOur server was awesome and so polite (that southern charm is always appreciated).  He even took a group photo for me as well as one of himself.  LOL\n\nA great night was had by all and I can't wait to come back EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm in Charlotte!
