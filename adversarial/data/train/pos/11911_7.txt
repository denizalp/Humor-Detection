(Lyrics - Led Zeppelin - The Ocean)\n\nWriting about the Ocean, I can taste the Ocean's Poke\nWrite for free, I Yelp for me and Yelp a whole lot more, more!\nSinging about the good food and the bowl that full of Poke\nI used to sing in the valley, had the Ocean's Poke Co.  \n\n\nLike most poke places, Ocean Poke serves up some delectable poke bowls.  However, I have to say this is the first place that I've been to that offers up a preset menu of poke bowls.  I usually have to do the picking of ingredients, but this time I don't have to!  I enjoy the customize ability, but hate having to sift through so many choices of ingredients sometimes!  I just want to eat!\n\nFor my poke bowl, I went for the Go Green; quinoa, mixed greens, cucumber, watermelon radish, carrot, green onions, avocado, daikon sprouts, edamame, and pickled red onions in a sesame ginger sauce.  I added some jalapeno to give it a kick.  Overall, it was a solid poke bowl and I didn't have to invent it; it was already there!  I'm a texture guy and this bowl definitely provided a crunch as well as a crispy punch to my palates.  The sesame ginger sauce was a tad bit too sweet so I had to add some heat to level it out with some siracha sauce.  \n\nIn the end, Ocean Poke is fresh a welcoming atmosphere next to some of my favorites bars to attend; Zipps and Dilly Dally's.  Along with other restaurants and fun bars to walk to; this poke place has some prime real estate! - Enjoy!
