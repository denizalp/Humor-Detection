The service here is non existent. I walked to the back where the \"hostess stand\" was and asked if we seated ourselves, to which the two girls said nothing, then one of the girls grabbed two menus and walked us to a table. We sat for a good 10 minutes without being acknowledged. I called over one of the girls to ask for water and to place my order. I ordered the chicken yellow curry and spicy Thai basil both with brown rice. The yellow curry had a good consistency and came with white meat chicken while the Thai basil came with dark meat which was low quality. Both dishes were minimal in size and came with a big scoop of rice and a small amount of the actual dish. \n\nThe prices here are considerably lower than most Thai restaurants but the quality and value is about the same as an average neighborhood Thai restaurant. They do offer brown rice so I may come back if I am in the neighborhood and want a quick straight forward meal.
