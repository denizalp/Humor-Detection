Go big or get the hell out of Vegas.\n\nEveryone should start their days off in Vegas with one of these. (I certainly wish I did!) \n\nThey have fruity flavors which are yummy, but seriously, for the best buzz (or blur) for your buck - 190 octane with at least 2 shots of everclear.  Towards the bottom, it'll start tasting like ish, but keep stirring throughout and just man up! Guaranteed FUN for the rest of the day... and if you keep drinking, even more fun for the rest of the night... I make no promises for the next morning though. :D\n\n[note: if it is particularly hot and you're walking the strip, please be sure to have water on hand...you have a very high likelihood of passing out...I would know. :P ]
