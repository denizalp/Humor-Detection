DON'T GO HERE IF YOU ARE ATTENDING A SHOW THAT NIGHT!!!!  We had been in contact many times before the day of our reservation with the restaurant, letting them know we were attending Phantom of the Opera (which shows in the Venetian, so close by the restaurant) that evening.  We were originally not even going to eat here becuase we thought it may be too much of a time crunch, but were talked in to it by the hostess on the phone, so we consented and made a reservation.  So multiple times they had it in their notes that we had to get out in time for the show.  Then night of reservation, we let the hostess know again on our way in that we were seeing the show later and also let our server know.  And unfortunately, we ended up missing our show, and out over $500 in show tickets, on top of over $600 we just spent on dinner there.  So a +$1,000 evening ruined and frankly wasted!!!  I've been trying to get the manager to call me back to see about getting some kind of compensation as the restaurant caused us to miss the show, and they will just not be considerate and get back to me.  I talked to him once, night of after the fiasco happened and he said he would \"assess\" the situation and get back to me, and has yet to do so, and we've tried calling him 4 times since, and no return phone call each time because he's \"too busy.\"  So my recommendation, if you want a nice meal out (like we did) before seeing the show, go elsewhere!  **If you see this CUT, it'd be nice to get a call back and get something figured out...I'd be more apt to leave you a better review!**
