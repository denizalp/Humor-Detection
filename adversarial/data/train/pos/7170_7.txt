Updating this review from years ago because we had sooooo much fun here the other day. Everyone who sang was amazing, the crowd was so supportive when I went up there, the pitch issues from my old review seem to be fixed. Best of all, the staff were rad. The waitress found us a spot even though it was kindof in her way and took care of us all night. The KJ did a great job of keeping all different groups there singing, and he was an incredible singer himself. Awesome time in the Village, can't wait to go back.
