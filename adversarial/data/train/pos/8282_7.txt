This place is terrible! Save your money and go anywhere else! This place has been open for a few months now and after seeing it on Groupon, I decided to give it a try. When I looked up the location, I realized it was located inside the Arco gas station on Craig and Rancho...that should have been the first red flag right there. When I presented my Groupon, I was told that it couldn't be accepted because their Groupon system was down. Ok....but I have the paper print out right here...But still the cashier refused. After some convincing, along with a few choice words he accepted my Groupon and I placed my order.\n\nAbout 5-10 min later, I received my order which was pretty reasonable given that the cashier appeared to be the only one working at this joint. It's pretty much a hole in the wall at the back of the gas station convenience store and isn't a pretty place at all. The only good thing is that their prices are dirt cheap, however, the food is garbage and basically inedible. Expect to get your order to go because there is only enough counter space\/stools for maybe 4 people.\n\nI'm not sure how anybody can mess up a burger\/slider but they managed to. Their sliders are so bland and the meat is so low quality I lost my appetite. Their fries would be decent if they weren't over-salted but they put so much salt on them that it was basically a salt lick. The shakes are terrible too...they basically tasted like a concoction of ice and milky water - bleh! I barely ate any of my food before I stopped and trashed it all. It's absolute crap and disgusting. If there were an award for Worst of Las Vegas, this would be my #1 pick.\n\nI would not come back even if the food were free and would never recommend this place to anybody, unless you're purchasing it to feed it to a dog or something...
