Nice gym... don't know if I'll like this place on squat days because of the stairs.\n\nWe find that we will be in this area at least once a week.  So, what better to have access to, than a nice gym.\n\nParking was plentiful.\n\nThe front desk was nice and the employees friendly.  Easy check in and to the locker rooms we went.  \n\nThe locker room was nice and the lockers were big enough to hold my stuff.  The showers had individual stalls.  I like that because I don't feel like I'm showering in prison like I do at the other gym I go to.  Easier to clean your ass as you don't feel eyes on you.\n\nA small walk upstairs, which will be a problem on Leg day.  I usually give my legs a beating on those days, but I'll make it part of my work out.  Not really a problem.  The cardio area was set up well and easy to walk around.  The free weight area was the usual for all of the 24's.  A good selection of DB's and benches.  So, I don't foresee any problems coming to this gym.  \n\nSo, I give it a thumbs up.
