I love a Bookstore. I love the smell, the sounds, and the whole feeling that you have inside a Bookstore.\nOf course I love to read Books.\nThe sad thing is my Nieces and Nephews don't like to read books . They all want to read electronics. So what can you do?  I will just buy the books for myself.\nI was here yesterday and had a most enjoyable time. I joined the B &N Book Membership, which gives you a percentage off of all your purchases.\nIncluding on line. I joined a few years ago in Seattle. But, really did not take advantage of it. I will this time. As well as you can use it any where in the Country, at any B &N. It is only good for a year though. Then you must renew it.\nI bought a stack of wonderful Hardback books. Which were all at a really good price especially with the discount.\nThey have a wonderful Cafe inside that serves Starbucks. I bought a Coffee with Almond Milk and 2 Apple Tarts to go. Everything was great!\nIt is very clean and well organized in the cafe and the book store itself and they provide free Wifi.People that work there are always asking if you need help finding anything or if you have any questions. \nLots of parking here as it is located inside Tempe Market Place.
