I bought take-out from here a few days ago. Let's just say, the food and service here is garbage. \n\nInitially when I called to place my order, I had to repeat everything like 5 times. Annoying as that was, it wasn't  half as rude as me being in the middle of asking a question and the person on the other line just hanging up on me. \n\nWhen I got there to pick it up, it was no better. The guy at cash didn't even greet me with a hello and just shouted \"WHAT IS YOUR PHONE NUMBER?\" No thank you was said after I paid too. \n\nI thought this could've been excusable if the food was great. But when I got home to devour the party tray, the fish was not fresh at all and they didn't even give us miso soup. \n\nYu Sushi is WAY better than this awful joint.
