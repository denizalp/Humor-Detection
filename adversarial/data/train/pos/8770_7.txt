Was here for a Mushroom Hike. Had no clue what I was getting myself into. \nThe RibbonWalk Nature Preserve is a hidden oasis from the city of Charlotte. Over 188 acre urban forest, you are whisked away into an enchanted forest like the ones in movies. The glorious tall trees that guards this forest. The leaves protects you from the rays of the sun and provides shade as you walk on the trail in search of mushrooms. Mushrooms sprouting everywhere all you have to do is to look for them. Near the trees that have fallen down lies a family of Turkey mushrooms. Further up the trail are red mushrooms ready to greet you and all you have to do is just look all round you and take the time to breathe in fresh air from all the oxygen that the forest provides. Smell the cedar trees, and where your nose takes you is an adventure waiting to happen.\n\nAmazing finds since it rained the night before. Mushrooms sprouting everywhere where. Like the colors of the rainbow when it comes to mushrooms. We saw red, indigo\/blue, green, purple, white, and many more. Definitely, treasures to be found but do not eat any of them. We were lucky to have a guided tour and learn about the various types, class, and species of mushrooms.\n\nThese hikes are run by Mecklenburg Co. and great educational tools to teach children and adults about what is in your local parks. Nothing beats being one with nature. When was the last time you spent a couple of hours with mother nature at it's finest?
