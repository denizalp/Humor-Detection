This place is cool. Sure, they try REALLY hard to be cool (Willow on loop? Come on), but at the end of the day their hard work pays off. To find the place, simply look for the 140 150 above the doors to the right of the salon. I'm a bit older now, so I look for a bar with some atmosphere and the ability to have a convo. If I want to go to a club, I will. I don't need a DJ playing garbage on volume 12 while I try to end the week with a cocktail. That rant aside, the place is decorated with bookshelves lining the walls (I didn't check to see of the books were real) and comfy victorian looking furniture strewn about. The drinks will run you $10+, but they are larger than your average cocktail lounge drink (compare it to Velveteen & DCL) and will get you nice and toasty. All it takes is a minute of silence from your convo, a sip of your drink and a glance around the room before you find yourself saying 'I like this place'.
