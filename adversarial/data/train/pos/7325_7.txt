I've patronized Hayashi for lunch(weekday) and dinner(weekend) half-a-dozen times and sat at the bar or in a booth. I am there for the rolls and and not much else.\n\nThere are numerous roll selections. Almost too many for my taste.  The rolls are good, although I usually stay away from any cream cheese contained rolls.  The fish tastes fresh. The eel can be too dry. The \"white\" fish used in some rolls tends to be very dry when served tempura style. My favourite roll is the Volcano roll: Spicy tuna piled on top of rolls. Seattle roll is good too.\n\nAs far as price, don't kid yourself. $50\/person is pretty average. That's 3-4 rolls and two drinks.  Yes, they are $2-$3 more than I'd like them to be but considering the available choices: acceptable.\n\nThe place is very busy on the weekends. I've had lunch during the weekday. It provides a great opportunity to ask the sushi chef questions about what is in the rolls and watch them make it. Considering the small size of their sushi bar and regular bar, service isn't too bad. I've been told there are plans to construct a larger sushi bar. That's good new for customers.\n\nDave at the bar provides great service. Haley is a work horse. Smile more Haley!!! I've only sat at Pua's tables and have nothing but good things to say about her service and roll recommendations.\n\nThe one glaring deficiency is the lack of customer service from management. Roam the floor, greet the customers, ask about the service and food, offer advice to those undecided on what to order. How about having samples to help entice those who are totally lost.\n\nConnect with the customers and we will come back for more.
