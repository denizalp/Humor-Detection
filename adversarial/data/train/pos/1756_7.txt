This place stays true to its ratings..DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL UNLESS MISERY LOVES COMPANY AND MORE MISERY!\n\nparking lot is hard to find, we ended up parking at Flamingo which has a walkway to Quad so it was fine, turns out parking for Quad is at the \"Employees only parking\" thats in the back...omg! this is so stupid.\n\n got smoking instead of non smoking as requested, we had first floor, we were like yes! no dealing with bad reviews of elevator...actually no, you have to go to the 2nd floor to get to the first floor but the elevator that goes to the 1st floor is one of the three elevators thats located on the 2nd floor, only one elevator takes you to the 1st floor cause the one closest to the elevator that takes you to the second floor is broken...got it? good.\n\n so we walked down all 3 different hallways of the 2nd floor taking guesses which elevator worked and didn't.. we had to go to the one thats furthur back halfway through the hallway, \n\nevery floor we went to stunk super bad like a broken garbage disposal & landfill\n\nas we were looking for the elevator, some asian guy with a lazy eye who was obviously a tourist asked, \"Do you need help?\" confused, I stated that i am looking for the 1st floor elevator, and the guy just continued walking by us as if he wasn't talking to us, WTF?!  \n\nthen we kept walking around this maze of Quad up and down floors, escalators and hallways trying to find the damn 2nd floor elevators to go to 1st, while we were doing that, this guy was asking if we were looking for registration and we said, no we were looking for the elevator to go to the first floor & then he stopped talking...this place has a lot of random scarey strangers who probably want to find out how to mug you!!!!!!\n\nfinally we found it and the room as shown in my photos here, it was soooo cruddy and scarey, ghetto floor is what it should be called, its the cheap floor.  \ncheck out my photos and see all the bad dirty conditions we were in, I felt like I was in a scarey movie where the hotel is so run down and the guy will kill us later that night\n\n in less than an hour, we were feeling asthmatic & having respiratory issues from the dust and dirtiness so we went to the front desk, talked to the manager about how it was inhumane and horrendous for a person to be staying there, her reply was: the rooms are basic rooms, they were remodeled 10 years ago, what should we expect?  We demanded her to fix it by giving us a room thats not for animals, no smoking room or refund.  she said she wont because its sold out and all thats left is the switch and bait $15 room upgrade that was upgraded 5 yrs ago so its a bit better.  so we ended up going to check it out on the 17th floor and it was less scarey looking, since we were not going to get a refund, we ended up paying $15 more for the \"less ghetto\" rooms.  it was still scarey.. \n\ni really hate the manager who was telling us to suck it up and too bad go screw yourself and wasn't trying to solve the problem or make it better, she didnt apologize or have any care or concern for our health and safety, you would think a place that has a reputation for having the infamous \"Hash House a Go Go\" AND being on the strip would try to be a nice hotel,  but instead they just upsold us so we would stop complaining, we shouldve been comped that upgrade.  \n\nSending a maid to the crappy room wouldnt make the room less crappier so she was stupid thinking that just because a maid half assed cleaned a room that it would somehow be nice. can't shine a turd right?  Obviously the maid felt the turd couldn't be shined so she didn't clean it up thoroughly.  the maid knows theres no point in trying to make something nasty into something nice because its impossible unless they remodel the place, throw everything away and turn into everything new... \n\nEverything was dirty, dusty, sticky, hairs on the shower wall, lemon thrown on the mirror that was still wet and had lemon chunks on it...\n\nthe 1st floor is the basement aka the scum of people and places\n\nLiterally right behind the hotel they are constructing some new place so there is major heavy construction going on for a year I am guessing\n\nhotel is loud all hours of the night, a lot of shady people stay here and the smell is horrendous!!!!  \n\nDont mind the trash in the elevator, it shows how much disgust and disrespect guests have for this hotel\n\nthis place is a maze to get in and out of the hotel and the parking lot!  Bad customer service, bad rooms, bad smell, bad people, bad reputation, bad place to stay, stay away!  you'll be much better off at a crack house!
