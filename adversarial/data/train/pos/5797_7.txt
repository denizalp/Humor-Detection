Stopped by for a beer during porch fest. Place was mostly deserted but the woman behind the bar was very put out by our request to sit on the patio and have a beer.\nOn the plus side the young waitress outside was extremely friendly and upbeat. She must be new. She hasn't yet had her life force sapped by the older barmaid inside.
