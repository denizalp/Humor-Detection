Honestly !!! \nExcuse me ? \nWhat are you thinking ! \nAdmittedly I am from England so I may be considered a bit of a snob with regards to fish and chips but pleeeease please tell me Gordon, where have you eaten crispy fried chips in England ? Please tell me ! I have never in my life had such an opposite experience of somewhere claiming to be authentic fish and chips ! \n\nHonestly ridiculous ! \nYou may like it of course but English it is not ! And that is stupidly disappointing for someone that has high hopes from a well known English cook. \n\nWhat a waste of time ! \nFish was ok but not battered in traditional English style either and three small pieces instead of one decent size is also typically un English, so representative of real fish and chips this is not and again I invite mr Ramsey to point to where he has had over cooked crispy fried chips from an English chippy ? \nThose things had barely seen a potato let alone come from one ! \nJust awful !
