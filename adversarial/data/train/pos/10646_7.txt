Was in the mood for Indian food but wanted something on the more affordable end, so we found this spot. Located on a stretch of Parc-Ex that's filled to the brim with Indian or Pakistani restaurants, we figured it had to be good, right? \n\nIt was a Saturday night and the place was packed, but luckily we were able to get one of the last tables left. The decor isn't a whole lot to brag about, but we weren't bothered too much. It was particularly loud this night, and they seemed to be understaffed on the floor. After waiting for about 15 maybe 20 minutes, I flagged down one of the servers to take our order. \n\nWe had the Thali for dinner (curry lamb and butter chicken, respectively) along with some chai. Long story short, the food was amazing. The lamb was tender and juicy. The chicken, creamy and sweet. Both had just the right amount of kick, excellent use of spices. The naan was the \"fresh out the tandoor\" kind. Plus the chai was tasty as well. \n\nOf course, after we were done, we had to jump, holler, and do backflips for a server to get us our bill. I think they were probably swamped. \n\nFour stars for the food and value, two stars for the service, a solid 3. Maybe we'll just get take-out next time.
