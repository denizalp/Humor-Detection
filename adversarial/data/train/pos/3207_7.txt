\"What nicer thing can you do for somebody than make them breakfast?\" â€• Anthony Bourdain\n\nWhat truer words.  Here at Sunny's, they do things right.\n\nI got the Chicken Fried Steak with over easy eggs and some rye bread.  It's not going to win any awards for the the prettiest dish but it was tasty and it got me going for the rest of the day.  The seasoning was spot on, the eggs were cooked absolutely perfect, and the home style fries were a delight.  I love being able to stab into the yolks and watching it ooze everywhere.  I wish my chicken fried steak was a little crispier though but who doesn't love extra gravy?  \n\nI also got to try some of the Bubba Gump Omelette and it too was delicious.  The toast on that dish was burnt though so that was a bit of a bummer.  And $5 for a large fresh squeezed orange juice?  Yikes.  Can I get a side of champagne with that at least?  I jest... but it would be pretty great if they served some mimosas. ;D\n\nGood portions, decent prices, and not a bad breakfast!  There were quite a few items on the menu I'd love to come back and try.
