The Perch is definitely a breath of fresh air for Vegas.  There really aren't a lot of bottomless brunches in Las Vegas unless you do a nasty hotel buffet. Perch is located in Container Park near downtown.  The d√©cor is simple and the restaurant has a great view.  Make sure to make a reservation on the weekends because the place gets packed. I went with a group of ten people and everyone loved their food.  I had the chicken chimichurri sandwich and it was delicious!  Just enough sauce and spice.  The French fries were seasoned to perfection and crispy. Hubby got the chicken n waffles...the waffle was to die for!  Now for the best part- $15 bottomless bloody marys, bellinis and mimosas!  The bloody mary was spicy and not too filling.  The bellinis, made with peach juice, champagne and peach schnapps were a nice change from just the basic mimosa.  I can't remember our server's name, I wrote it down in my notes on the Yelp app, but somehow lost it (she had short blonde hair).  She was amazing!  She kept the bottle of champagne flowing and even split our checks at the end.  Can't wait to go back here on our next visit to Vegas.
