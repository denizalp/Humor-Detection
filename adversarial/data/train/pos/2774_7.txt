It's Valentine's Day, so I'm gonna write about something I love. It's no surprise (rather, it shouldn't be a surprise) that I love good dessert. Anyone can slap together sugar with carbs and call it a day, but Jean Philippe is something else.\n\nI've never had something I was disappointed with at his patisserie. From the gelato (the hazelnut is heavenly) to the flaky pastries (pain au chocolate that rivals some of the best in Paris) and creamy custards (yes, please!) to their coffee, even: everything they serve is undoubtedly delicious.\n\nSure, it costs a pretty penny, but when is perfection cheap? Never, that's right.
