My boyfriend and I were really excited to check this place out.  We really love wine, and live downtown so we decided to give it a go, I think it was a Thursday.  We have been to other bars on the block and enjoy the feeling of a bar \"district\" of sorts.  \nAfter taking 10+ minutes to find a parking space (we should have walked), we were ready for a glass of wine.  Approaching the bar everything looked like a go! The decor was unique to the area and tasteful.  Although it was empty we walked in anyhow without a cover in sight.  We walked out just as quickly as we walked in when the music drastically changed to top 40 crap!  And the two customers in the bar immediately jumped up and started dancing to go right along with it.  Was it an off night?\n\nWe really just wanted a new wine bar, with maybe some jazz and a cool atmosphere.  We were left very disappointed, maybe we will have to try on another night? We didn't even make it far enough to see the wine list...
