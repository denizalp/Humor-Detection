Every year around spring training I seem to watch a game on TV where some asshole is sitting in the 80 degree sun drenched outfield grass section with a beer. Its usually raining here at that time.  I curse him up one side and down the other.  I have not even met his mother but she gets a little bit of bad mouthing too.\n\nThis spring training, I am that asshole.  (But please don't talk about my mama)  \n\nMy first introduction is being 5 minutes away out of a 40 min drive and realize i forgot the tickets.  No worries.  I bought them on line and a guy named Brian in the ticket office saved my butt a long drive back to get them.  He reprinted after he asked if I bought them online.  I did and he checked it out and i was good to go.  You saved my trip and my experience to this ball park.  I appreciate you.\n\nThe stadium is small in comparison to major league parks and I loved it.  The staff is made up primarily of retired folks and they could not be nicer.  The lines go a little slower because they BS and make jokes.  It's all good.  Loved it.  Except the 70+ year old man that was trying to take a run at my girl.  Back it up old man.  I will push you down.  Its all fun and games until someone breaks a hip.\n\nFood is better than big league parks in LA and beer is way cheaper too.  Everyone seems to really enjoy the Cactus league when it comes to town.  I had a great time and if my girl can promise to behave in the future, I will take her back with me.  Either way, I'm going.
