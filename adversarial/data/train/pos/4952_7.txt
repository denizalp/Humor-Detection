BEWARE!!  Bought a tree from Star 3 months ago and it died.  We were told when we bought it that it was guaranteed for 1 year.  When we returned the tree, with the receipt, we were told by the young lady at customer service that she would refund the purchase.  However, when she took the receipt to the register the \"manager\" told her that they don't refund, they only do store credit.  So, we were stuck shopping for a new tree and carting it home in 105 degree weather.  Don't trust Star Nursery for backing their products and guarantees.
