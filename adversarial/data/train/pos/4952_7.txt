Like Hale & Hearty in the States but more expensive and less delicious.\n\nThey really need to put up a sign telling newcomers where to stand and how to order, otherwise you will end up waiting on an imaginary line where your number comes up...never.\n\nOn my first visit, I opted for the freshii designed spinach-tuna salad with almonds, apples, and honey dijon dressing. The spinach was so metallic tasting and the tuna so bland, I \"tossed\" it (in the bin) after a few bites.\n\nI went back weeks later to custom create my own salad, spending $11 to compose the salade par excellence. It was only when I took my ingenious creation home that I realized the salad maker forgot to add the protein that I was charged an extra $4 for. \n\nBlech ingredients + incompetent service = Not impressed.\n\nLettuce hope they improve.
