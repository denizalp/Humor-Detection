\"Bang bang into the room, I know you want it.\nBang bang all over you, I'll let you have it.\nYo, I said...\nBang bang,\nBang bang, \nbang bang.\"\n- Nicki Minaj\n\nThanks for capturing my thoughts about Bang Bang perfectly Nicki, I couldn't have said it any more eloquently. \n\nHong Kong Waffle ($8) - Similar to my sentiments about wine and peanut butter & jelly sandwiches, egg puffs are a food item that I don't really enjoy. Yet, always take a bite when offered...in hopes that I will like them more than I did before, finally understand why the rest of the world is so in love with them, and basically assimilate as a normal part of society. I mean, I get it. They smell sweet and creamy. They look super cute and fluffy. Yet, I just always find them really bland. Thanks to Bang Bang for adding ice cream to the mix, because I now have a newfound appreciation for them. The clock's ticking, P-Mall. Step up your game. We picked two flavours of ice cream to go with it, description below.\n\nMacaron Ice Cream Sandwich ($5) - Macaron flavour of the day was Chocolate. It is much chewier than your average macaron, making it extra fun to eat with the ice cream. \n\nFavourite ice cream flavours, in order:\n\n1. London fog- According to the super friendly staff that worked there, Hazelnut Chocolate or London Fog pairs goes well with the macaron. FUN FACT of the day time! London Fog is actually based on Earl Grey tea and originated in Vancouver, BC. What. This was delicious and + points for the unique flava. Good for those that prefer a more mild flavour, not too sweet but still creamy. \n\n2. Halva- black and white Sesame. Also very unique.\n\n3. Pumpkin Spice- The basic girl in me was so excited for this flavour. It certainly lived up to expectations. \n\n4. Avocada- Like an avocado smoothie you get from pho but in ice cream form.\n\n5. Corn on the Cob- Sweet and creamy!\n\nBang on, Bang Bang.
