This place is pretty average. The lure for us was the buy one get one free cocktail coupon we got while walking on the Strip. I can not pass up a buy one get one free cocktail!!! \n\nThe restaurant is back behind the bar, however you can still hear all the shenanigans happening in the bar. It's quite noisy and brought back memories of our Carnival cruise last year to Baja California, drinking whistles and all! \n\nThe food portions here are HUGE. I had the stir fry veggies and rice. (oh and bad place for a vegetarian.) The plating is inventive, with the take out box spilling your rice onto your plate. My husband had the tuna. When he said he wanted it \"rare\" I was sure they would overcook it, but they did not! Nicely cooked. \n\nThe drinks were so-so. I had a pina colada and the Bahama Mama. Meh. Barely felt a buzz. Come here if you have some sort of coupon. Otherwise skip it...Oh! and you can come here if you're gonna see a show. The staff brings out the food fast and are very aware of the various 7PM showtimes that are happening around the Strip.
