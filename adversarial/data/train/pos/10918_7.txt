THE BEST HIP HOP NIGHT IN THE COUNTRY!  POETRY IS THE Shiggidy!!!   F@#! WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS TALKIN ABOUT.  IT WAS SO OFF THE CHAIN IN THIS DAMN CLUB!  Just let me tell you...\n\nAfter being in Vegas for a few days and DOIN IT BIG, I thought we would be bored here.  We got on the guestlist early on Saturday and told to be there  AT 1100 and ladies get free champagne until 12.  We're girls we didnt make it!  So, after showing up late we try the guestlist anyway.  The bouncer let us in, YAAAAAAAYYYY!  We hadn't even waited 5 minutes.  We took the journey up the flight of stairs into the club.  It's a small club, not really spacious at all.  The bartenders were all girls and the drinks were THE BOMB WITH A NICE TIP, OF COURSE!!!!  They don't play IN VEGAS AT ALL!!  There weren't many people there at the time and everyone was sitting around.  We go to the back where the free champagne was after getting a cocktail.   They have a bar in the back that overlooks the Forum Shops and I just think that is so ILL!  \n\n\nTHE CROWD IN THIS PLACE IS SO LAID BACK AND EVER SO FRIENDLY!!!!!  I MET NIECY NASH UP IN THIS PIECE!  She was so friendly and humble without the uppity attitude!   I'M A CERTIFIED FAN NOW!   I met this girl in line that looked like Asia (pic uploaded) from Baldwin Hills on BET...then the Patron started coming.  The crowd was so laid back. Even the other girls were friendly. The men  were actually respectful but still about their game.  THERE WERE NOOOOOO FAKE BALLLLLLLERSSSS!!  REALLLLLL BALLERS IN A CLUB ON HIP HOP NIGHT!!!!  YESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!  \n\nThe reputation of this club being off the chain definitely proceeds itself.  I was told to come here countless times and I am soooooooo happy I did. Unlike allllllll the other Vegas clubs, THEY HAVE SEATING FOR THEIR PATRONS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR!!!  BIG PLUS ON THEIR PART!  We ended up in VIP with a birthday party and they were DOIN IT UP!!  Overall:  Poetry has all the elements to make for a memorable Vegas experience.  Celebrities, Good Bouncers, GOOD MUSIC, GOOD DRANK, SEXY MEN with money in their pocket, friendly women, and PLACES TO REST YOUR FEET!!  It doesnt have all the trickery and Vegas club decor.  But still one of the best nights I had in Vegas.  GO TO POETRY ON SATURDAY..PERIOD!!!
