My first day in Vegas I visited Gordon Ramsay's Burger Gill for a dinner.  The casino itself is at Planet Hollywood which is quite the disappointment but sort of makes sense; seeing how ironic the Michelin Star owner is actually selling burgers it makes sense to make it at a trashy hotel.\n\nThe restaurant itself has a quite modern vibe, they have a huge fire pit in an infinity shape outside.  The lines are long and I have no idea why.  When we were seated, we noticed half of the restaurant was empty; so maybe they make people wait just for a show.\n\nTHE STAFF -\n\nThe waiters were really accommodating and knew which line to read, they aren't very personable but they are quite fast when it counts.   \n\nTHE FOOD -\n\nFor starters (or \"snacks\" on their menu), we ordered their 'Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings' which in my opinion over seasoned and lacked originality.  The parmesan cheese that was skinned on top of the onions gave me mixed views on if they were to be salty, sour, or sweet; It was just a mess!\n\nI ordered their 'Chanterelle Burger' which did not taste very good with their caramelized mushrooms and figgy-onion jam.  I didn't get it.  Come on Gordon, that's embarrassing!  My friend ordered their 'American Burger' which was absolutely astounding and the way it was presented was pleasing to the eyes and also the taste buds!\n\n(To recap, we ordered the following) :\n\n- Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings (Parmigiano-Reggiano and chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip) $9\n\n- Chanterelle Burger (Chanterelle mushrooms with arugula and figgy-onion jam) $16\n\n- American Burger (American cheese with butter lettuce mixed with tomatoes, pickles, and onions. \n\n*** Their drinks were very hardcore, but that's just me; I can never drink hard liquor even if it has a fruity sensation to it***
