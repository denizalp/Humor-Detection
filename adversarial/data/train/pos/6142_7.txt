Apparently, I am a slow learner.  Last year I visited this place for lunch and ordered the pad thai with peanut sauce.  Extra peanutty pad thai!  How could this be a bad thing?\n\nPicture a pound of rice noodles.  Picture a separate bowl.  Picture yourself emptying a jar of Skippy crunchy peanut butter into this bowl.  Then, add a can of coconut milk.  Then, add four cups of flavourless vegetable oil.  Blend.  Apply to the pound of rice noodles.  Remove flavour.  Serve.\n\nActually, I don't know the recipe, but I dare anyone to contradict me.  It was a mass of rice noodles, sitting despondently in this pale, thick, oozy, oily sauce.  I shuddered, dumped it, and moved on with my life.\n\nWhat happens?  A year passes.  Memory fades.  Surely it was just that one dish?  I have two bites of a friend's amazing red curry (from another establishment), and I have a terrible jones for Thai.  I'm picturing a combo with red curry and pad thai.  How bad could California Thai be?  Even bad Thai is pretty good.  \n\nI head up to the eerily deserted counter and order combo #1 (under $6):  a rice\/noodle selection, a veggie, and a meat.  I get the pad thai noodles, the tofu & thai eggplant, and some basil beef.\n\nI taste all three.  Or, rather, I fail to taste all three.  My orange pad thai noodles are as innocent of flavour as my plastic fork.  The tofu & eggplant is disgusting; floppy, mushy ears of tofu bathing in oil, with a couple of slivers of equally bland eggplant.  Only the basil beef has any flavour; that flavour is salt.  I sigh at my gullibility, dump it and move on with my life.\n\nNever again, ever, ever, ever .
