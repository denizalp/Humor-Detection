WARNING: STAY AWAY. \nPaid for a table, got 4 bottles. When we had half a bottle left, the promoter said we needed to buy another bottle or that we had to leave. Wait, what?!\nFirst, we got 4 bottles and a table, they had already moved us off the dance floor and now they say we have to leave because we werent gonna buy more bottles?! \nWe obviously refused, saying that we are paying customers, and are responsible enough to not drink more than we should, and that we still have some alcohol left, they have no right to kick us out.\nSo they threatened to kick us out, and if we refused the bouncers walking us out, they would have us arrested for attacking the bouncer, and there was nothing we could do about it.\nMost of us were willing to roll with it and see if they would really do that. But some said its not worth it.\nI wont tell you the details of what happened next, because i dont want to waste anymore of my time reviewing this shady, horrible nightclub. (I bet you want to know though!)\nIn summary, the promoter doesnt have your back, they are shady, greedy and horrible people. This is prolly one of the more ghetto nightclubs on the strip anyway, so i strongly urge you to go elsewhere.
