Wow, what an experience. I hope the sales manager reads this review and takes it to heart. He's likely missing out on some sales otherwise. \n\nTwo days ago my husband and I went to the dealership (along with our toddler) and out walked Patrick, a sales guy. He shook our hands, asked why we were in, and we told him we wanted to test drive the Chrysler Pacifica (minivan). We were very clear- we told him we are torn between that and the Honda Odyssey so we were looking to drive both, get as much information as possible, see the numbers on each, etc so we could make a decision. \n\nHe then sat us down and asked us what we wanted to see for payment goal, to which I replied, \"I can't answer that because we'll likely pay cash. We have someone interested in our current SUV so that, plus money saved, we'd probably just pay for it outright.\" I then said, \"Unless we can get 0% financing then I'd consider financing a portion of it but it wouldn't be a monthly payment I'd be worried about.\"\n\nHe gets the vehicle ready and we go to test drive it (he did not start it ahead of time and it was 110* out, which I thought was weird). \n\nPatrick knew NOTHING about this vehicle. Absolutely nothing. He read off the sticker in the car and that's it. \nHere are some examples of questions we asked and Patrick's answers:\nQ: What awards has this received?\nA: 10 stars\n\n(10 stars of what? 10 stars by whom? This is so not helpful... what about safety ratings? We have our toddler in the car with us so this is obviously important to us... )\n\nQ: What does the Pacifica have that the Honda Odyssey doesn't?\nA: It's personal preference\n\n(I swear to God that was his answer!!)\n\nQ: What's the difference between the Touring L and the Touring L Plus?\nA: You're paying for cosmetic differences.\n\nWe informed him early on that we saw the internet pricing for the Touring online, which was why we came in. Since we were test-driving the Touring L Plus, we asked\nQ: What's the internet or promotional-pricing on the Touring L Plus?\nA: There is no internet pricing \n(It two seconds to search on our phones and see that wasn't the case at all... a difference of about $5K...)\n\nAt one point he also said, \"I would totally drive this. If my buddies tried to give me a hard time about driving a minivan, I'd totally tell them I didn't care.\" (Mind you, we're SHOPPING for a minivan!)\n\nAfter the test drive we went back inside and sat down. Besides learning that we liked to drive the van, we knew nothing else about it so we told him we needed to do some more research on it. I'm not going to spend $38K (or more) without doing more due diligence ESPECIALLY since he wasn't really helpful. He kept saying, \"IF I can get it to a magical number of $38K do we have a deal?\" We said No. He wasn't getting it... it wasn't about the money yet that's all he kept bringing up. \n\nFinally he said that if we weren't going to buy that day, he couldn't help us anymore. He got up, walked away and that was it. He did not shake our hand or walk us to the door. He literally walked away and left us sitting there, it was quite awkward.\n\nWe were 50\/50 on buying that vehicle. We will definitely be buying a vehicle this week and there's a 50\/50 chance it was the Chrysler. Instead of nurturing the relationship, because he didn't have a sale that minute, he lost the deal. My husband and I own our own business and if one of our sales people treated a potential customer that way, I'd fire them. \n\nPatrick needs training on the vehicles to start. He also needs training on how to treat customers. He acted like a bratty 8-year old who wasn't getting his way right then and there.
