My husband and I went to this church for years. I became a member and volunteered quite a bit of time. My husband and I went through a personal travesty and I went to my church for help. I requested someone to talk to, someone that could assist me with the life changing event that was going on. The only thing my church came back to me with was a class that took place every Monday evening and was $70. I don't mind paying for a class, what I do mind is going to my church requesting for help, requesting someone to speak with and pray with and the only resolution was to pay for a class. The church let me down in a HUGE and after being so devoted to them. I will never trust this church again and will never recommend it to anyone, their views have become so skewed it is sad.
