When four friends simultaneously text you to get out of bed at 10:30 on a Sunday night to come meet them, it's probably going to be for a ridiculous reason. Last night was no exception. The combination of one friend's birthday and the state-wide party that was the Packers defeating the Bears to clinch the NFC Championship led to only one logical outcome: go to a strip club. \n\nA couple miles out from where University Avenue and the Beltline intersect in Middleton, Outer Limits feels like it's in the boonies, tucked away across from a golf course and in between industrial buildings. Despite the seedy-seeming surroundings, Outer Limits is by far the least creepy and gross strip club I've been to. \n\nEverything looked clean, the girls didn't look sad and coked out, and while the clientele was mostly male, there were several mixed-gender groups. \n\nSince it was a Sunday, admission was two-for-one ($5 a person), and ladies do have to pay (in my previous strip club forays, ladies got in free - but those places were gloomy dens of sadness so it made sense they'd cut women a deal to get them in). \n\nGoing to a strip club isn't something I'm necessarily going to recommend, but if you find yourself in the position, there are far worse places you could end up than Outer Limits.
