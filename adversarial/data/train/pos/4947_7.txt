Miss Dessert is like a dessert oasis in the desert!  \n\nTheir milk tea drink toppings include purple sticky rice and the more common boba.  I don't totally dig the sticky rice version... as it always seems like I have so much rice left over in the bottom of my cup because, well, it sticks and clumps up (and thus, does not suck up through the straw as well as boba).  And I always forget to order with a little less ice so it seems like my drink is gone in the blink of an eye... but that's on me!  For boba places, what it comes down to for me for is consistency... and Miss Dessert delivers!  \n\nTheir mango pancake is also a creamy fruity tasty treat that definitely hits the spot!  And the Yogi Signature Nectar is the bomb!\n\n****FOUR STARS****
