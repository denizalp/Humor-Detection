Thank the lord that I live so freaking far from Charles David and that Kerland Commons is outside of my typically traversed bubble. Because if it wasn't, my ass would be officially broke. And I mean broker than broke. So broke that I would be begging on the street corners of N Scottsdale to feed my high end shoe habit.\n\nCharles David has style, elegance, and most importantly a sale rack in the back that encompasses half of the store's collection at any given time. This is literally the only store I will buy shoes from. I love them. They cover everything from giant spiked heels, to classic pumps, to slip on slides and every single pair is somehow comfortable and doesn't make me want to rip off my feet at the end of the night. Craziness, I know.\n\nAnyhoo, Charles David is heaven, plain and simple.
