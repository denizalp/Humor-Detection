Went here with my brother today and we had a blast! I can't believe they have dolphins in Las Vegas! Keep in mind that there isn't an actual set show so you may want to be wary about that before spending $20+ for a ticket.\n\nIt was pretty cool to be able to see the dolphins up close and we got to see some of their training which consists of the trainers giving the dolphins food for performing simple tricks. They have 2 sessions every hour and it lasts for about 15-20 minutes. They are really advertising Coco right now! She is their youngest and smallest dolphin who is 4 months old. I was able to get some nice pictures of the dolphins and will be posting them along with this review.\n\nThe secret garden also includes some lions, spotted leopards, and tigers. I really felt bad about this portion of the experience because the animals seemed really stressed out. The lions kept pacing back and forth in a small part of their exhibit and their eyes had this empty stare. The spotted leopard was just staring at the wall for the most part and seemed to hide behind the tree for the most part. I really hope these animals are really being cared for.\n\nOverall the experience was nice because it was different from the usual magic show, gambling, and clubbing entertainment on the strip. I'd recommend visiting this place if you have a few hours to spare to enjoy learning about animals and seeing some of them in person.
