Along the stretch of road that we Charlotteans call \"Burrito Way\" is of course, the Burrito Factory (which shall be referenced as BF). A shining star in a desert of Central American \"burrito special with rice and beans for $5.95\" restaurants.\n\nA bit like the Californian burrito joints that have gone mainstream like Chipotle and Moe's, BF has a menu board of various meats and recipes already put together, but this is America and if you want to add or remove, you go right ahead.\n\nI opted for the Curry Chicken Burrito and asked for extra tomatoes and onions. It was extremely tasty. For my wife, I got their veggie burrito with extra cilantro and she absolutely loved it.\n\nChips were great - maybe a little thicker than I like. Salsa bar was decent. The pico de gallo was really great - not hot at all. Yum.\n\nI wish this place every success!
