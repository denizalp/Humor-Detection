Spiffy (anytime I use a word that ends with a \"y\", as in \"nifty\" or \"flashy\" I feel it is a man-card violation.  Not a red card, probably just a yellow card...but a violation nontheless) little (arguably another minor man-card violation...things must be bold and brawny, not little...too cutsie) Mexican joint that offered a heckuva (now that word definitely connotes manliness) deal on a plate of tasty (damn did it again) enchiladas.  Margheritas (now I did it...I should be drinking bourbon) were solid as well.  I mean, they were liquid, but solid.
