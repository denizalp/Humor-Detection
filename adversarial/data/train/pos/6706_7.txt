3.75 Stars\n\nAfter traveling for over 14 hours to get from DC to Vegas, and enduring BO and disobedient children (other people's) on the flights. And dealing with the front desk at Harrah's who tried to stick me in a smoking room....I was exhausted and starving.\n\nWe tried to go to KGB Burgers first, but after standing around for 5 minutes waiting to be seated, we left. ZERO stars for them!\n\nWe headed over to Ming's Table. Now, I have had my fair share of excellent chinese food in DC and San Fran- so keep that in mind with my review.\n\nWe ordered Chicken and Seafood Udon Soup. \n\nWe got Chicken and Seafood Udon stirfry. (It came out really fast)\n\nAs this point we have been awake for almost 20 hours. We told the waiter nevermind, we'll just keep it.\n\nIt actually was quite tasty, good fresh large pieces of scallops, shrimp, \n\nBut it isn't what we ordered. When the waiter brought us the bill, he didn't even comp our $3.50 pot of tea. The entire bill after tip and tax was $43.\n\nSteep for what we got, not horrible I guess for Vegas.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to go to Ming's. If you are staying in Harrah's and it's late and you don't feel like going out, nor spending a lot of money and you're in the mood for Chinese, it's not too bad. \n\nIt's definitely not trying to be like PF Chang's.
