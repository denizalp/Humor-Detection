Here is my pigtail.\n\n When I can, I will stop in a new restaurant, meet and greet the owners and look over the menu to see something traditional and something new. What catches my eye here is the bacon. You know bacon will never let you down.\n\nI learn from the owner that he hires the chef, over several qualifications but will have to cook one meal to get the job. So I decide to order the job winning meal. \n\nI was really not all that interested in testing chef's speed, artistry and creativity, nope I want a winter savory meal representing his interpretation of the classic Eggs Benedict $9, and a side of jalapeño bacon $3. \n\nEverybody enjoys a surprise ingredient and the jalapeño heat in the bacon was a winner. The flavor of the Hollandaise sauce was rich and buttery with that ever so slight lemon tang. The perfect poached egg too.\n\nLunch the next day I had a club sandwich. A excellent sandwich born from the remnants of many delicious things. Three slices of thin white toast, choice of bacon and I chose honey bacon since I already enjoyed jalapeño bacon the previous day. Lettuce, tomato, honey cured ham, turkey and a little mayo and spices. There are three choices of fries, regular, thick and sweet. This meal is very large. $8.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gugN1sgyheBJ6aKtNcv_gQ?selected=UAcma3FjSfkUnnRZkvLGyA\n\nOne last note, the meats are oven cooked in this kitchen, roast beef next up. The staff and the owners are kind and thoughtful. There are plenty of pros to dining here and I have yet to see a con.
