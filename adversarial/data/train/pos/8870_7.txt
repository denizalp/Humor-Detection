It was when I was in India and was working for an American MNC that I got an opportunity to travel quiet a bit, actually a lot.\nAnd one of the perks that I admired the most was to be able to stay, for extended periods, at one of the best hotels at any given place.\n\nSo, one fine day when I came to know that the yearly conference was to be held in Vegas and at Venetian .. I mean, trust me, that was some news.\n\nRight from the time we arrived for to the time we left, about 4 days of stay .. to me the experience was as good as it gets.\nRight from that roof with those absolutely surreal murals to the Chinese new year decorations - the year of rooster, from their lavish casino to their huge halls.\nTheir impeccable feeding capacity (with special meals and all) and an absolutely wonderful service by which they were able to manage some 7000 of us from across the globe.\n7000 of us. It is a lot of people.\n\nThe rooms were randomly given to us people .. some got it in Venetian and some in Palazzo. I got mine here .. It was the 32nd floor I remember and the view from there was beautiful ..\nNothing to complain about the room .. it was luxurious, non-smoking, huge .. decor was fit for a palace and all ..\nAnd we were having our breakfast and lunches here .. which were coming out of their kitchen.\nThe food was wonderful .. might be custom made for us all (not the regular menu from their kitchen) but absolutely wonderful.\n\nHowever, a few things which got me thinking were like if they could provide a little water in the room or maybe a coffee machine or something .. rather, you could rent a coffee machine from them which was odd and funny at the same time.\n\nHaving said that, for me to be able to stay at such a place was something which was beyond what I could have expected .. though it used to happen everytime I was on a trip .. hehe.. staying at some of the best of the places.\nSo, all I have is praise and more of it.\n\nThis is as good as it gets.
