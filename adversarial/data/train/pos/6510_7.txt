FAMOUS FOR:\n- Steaks\n\nBUZZ\n- Prime Rib\n\nI TRIED\n- French Onion Soup (7\/10)\n- Bone In Rib Eye (2\/10)\n- Sauteed Mushrooms (5\/10)\n\nI was once on a flight and saw that someone had left a Robb Report magazine in seat back pocket. I flipped through it and saw it had listed the 7 best steakhouses in Vegas, and I was astonished when it even mentioned Circus Circus. I mean, what is actually redeemable from that decrepit place? I read on to find out it actually won some kind of award saying it's the best steakhouse in all of Vegas. Wait... WHAT? Come again? Circus Circus...THE Circus Circus? The Circus Circus that's way off the strip, and has thousands of smelly kids (and adults) swarming and mobbing all over the lobby, the taxi lines, and hallways? THAT Circus Circus has the best steak? No F-ing Way! For a few years, I've been wanting to go, but probably in the 5 times I've been to Vegas since reading that article, nobody wanted to go. This time, I finally got the chance!\n\nThe menu is very simple. They have quite a few seafood options like crab legs, oysters, lobster tail, etc., but at a place called \"The Steakhouse,\" I feel like those are sort of obligatory menu items. No idea how they taste. Pretty much the menu is STEAK, and very few appetizer and side offerings. Asparagus? No. Creamed spinach or corn? Nope. Mac & Cheese? Psh! As if! They got seafood accompaniments and sauteed mushrooms. Period. So...pretty limited choices.\n\nAll the steaks I've had in Vegas have been decent, but not all that great. I'd prefer Morton's to SW, Carenvino, Delmonico, Cut, GR Steak, and I'm sure I'm missing a couple others. I was actually hoping Circus Circus wasn't good, because if it was good, that means we may need to make trips out this way to have steak from now on. Well..\n\nFRENCH ONION SOUP\nNot my normal appetizer, but considering the limited choices, the only one that made sense. It was pretty decent. Presentation was kinda cool, bowl served on a plate with some extra croutons and cheese shreds in cute little heaps. Seasoned well, onions were cooked well. It was probably what I'd call textbook French Onion Soup. It was good, but nothing really made it unique or special. It was just good French Onion Soup.\n\nRIBEYE\nHere goes. It's presented ok. The cost of the steak comes with your choice of potato. The steak looked healthy - decent spots of char all over. I start cutting a piece, and ended up finding that about 30% of my piece was fat. The fat is the most seasoned part of the steak, and also pretty delicious. Normally I cut it off, but hey, Vegas! It's the most seasoned part of the steak, so this bite should have been stellar...but...no. In fact, there was hardly any seasoning at all!\n\nYou couldn't even fathom my disappointment! If there was any kind of special mesquite flavoring, I didn't find it. The meat was decently tender, and I can't really complain about any of its technical aspects (i.e. medium rare was just as I asked), but the taste was just so BORING! Nothing inspiring, nothing savory, nothing...good! It was bad! I mean, there was nothing going on with this! It's not like \"no news is good news.\" With steak, \"no news is the worst possible news!\" I had to restrain myself from asking for A1, but I did end up sprinkling some salt on it. It did make it taste better but anytime you add salt after the fact, it doesn't taste right. I was so disappointed I probably left 1\/3 of it. I was taking scoops of mashed potatoes with each steak bite, to try to add seasoning somehow. I tried everything. Nothing worked. It just gave up!\n\nIt was a pretty bad steak...not the worst I've ever had, but definitely the worst $50 steak I've ever had. \n\nMUSHROOMS\nWell, certainly better than the steak, and while tasting halfway decent, it wasn't anything special. If I went to TGI Friday's or Outback or Chili's and got this batch of sauteed mushrooms, I'd have found it fitting, but if I paid $7 for them (and it was a pretty small batch), I'd like something with a little more creativity! \n\nINDIANA JONES & THE STEAKHOUSE OF DOOM\nI was really, really upset! I mean, even though it was free (company paid), which should make it taste even better, I couldn't believe what a waste of money this place was. Considering the $20-$30 roundtrip cab ride and having to swim through a roaring (and smelly) sea of children and parents for about a mile (exaggerating), there's more at \"steak\" here (see what I did there?). \n\nEither A) the reviewers were all full of sh*t, or B) We got the C- cooks, because I can't imagine how an establishment like this could have gotten high marks anywhere. \n\nThankfully, I now know, I don't EVER have to go to Circus Circus again! If you're a curious person like me, then you probably do need to go here, just to say that you've tried it and conquered it. Otherwise, if you're solely on a mission to try actually good food. Skip this place!
