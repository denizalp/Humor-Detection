Very disappointing results. I had a face peel on special for $99.- (reg. price $150.-) and I did not peel AT ALL. What I did get, though, was a face so dry it feels like lizard skin. I asked for a refund, but this request was denied. NOT GOOD!! Perhaps their other services are better, but I will never know because I'm never going back.
