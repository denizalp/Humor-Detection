Alright.  To be fair, over the past couple of days I had just gotten caught up on my back issues of Whisky Advocate and I went into this store full of great ideas for tasty beverages for Christmas and birthday gifts.  \n\nI think the Fry's near me has a more varied bourbon selection.  No Elijah Craig.  No Cave Creek bourbon.  Meh.  Basil Hayden will do just fine, but I was not impressed with the overall choices.  Yes there are some good well-known ones, like Woodford Reserve, etc, but not much variety if you are looking for something special or small batch.\n\nI did score some cool Guinness glasses in the gift section that Mr. M will love.  \n\nWhat pushed me to the 2-star review was that while I was in the bourbon aisle it was very crowded because on the opposite side is all the rum, etc and other stuff I don't buy.  The only clear liquors I buy are Belvedere and a couple of tequilas.  OK.  Maybe several tequilas, but anyway, it was crowded.\n\nI had already been almost run over by a tall employee in a big hurry, and then suddenly, in the aisle comes 4 employees pushing 2 large carts with boxes to unpack, and another employee dragging a huge ladder to get or put something on the top shelf.  \n\nI did see the truck at the loading dock, so maybe it was late, but generally isn't all the shelf-stocking supposed to go on after hours?  I don't see why in the world all that mess needed to come into that aisle at once either.  But the real kicker, was that the employees openly expressed their frustration.  I heard one comment, of \"we'll never get this done.\"  Yeah.  Darn those customers anyway.  \n\nYou know what?  It costs nothing to say, \"Hi.  How ya doin'?\"  \n\n\"Hi.  You look thirsty.  Is there something I can help you find?\"  \n\n\"Need any help finding anything?\"  \n\nAnd then, maybe those pesky customers will find their booze and get out of your way.  Ridiculous and rude was my experience today.  \n\nThe cashier was nice so she gets one of the stars and the makers of Basil Hayden get the other one.  I've been to this store a couple of times and always had mediocre to rude service and don't plan on returning.  Every time I find myself in Gilbert anyway, I always think, \"Why the hell am I in Gilbert?  I don't have a mini-van or a fat SUV and a herd of obnoxious kids and dogs I take everywhere.  I don't belong here!\"
