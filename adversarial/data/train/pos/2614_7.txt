This is the newest LVAC. They don't limit membership so this place gets crazy crowed, don't be surprised if you have to wait to get on every machine you want use. Also this is more of a gym that you go to once you are already in shape, truthfully you will feel out of place if you go in there and are fat. Also this is in the nicer part of Vegas so there is lot of decent places to eat and shop right around the gym. Unlike the other LVAC's they don't have tanning places and store in the gym but they are in the same strip mall. A couple words of advice, do not go there and expect to casually socialize the emphasis is on training hard here. Also do not try to make friendly conversation when people are trying to workout or when your in the steam room\/locker rooms as you will likely irritate other members.  They do have a good kids area so you can drop off the little ones when your working out, never had a problem here as the caregiver are very good and will page you right away if anything comes up.
