\"I'm disappointed\" is what I kept saying Saturday night when we left El Mercadito. I was the instigator who dragged our entire group over there for Mexican food. \n\nTHIS IS FANCY MEXICAN FOOD, NOT ROBERTOS, NOT A ROACH COACH, SO THOSE WHO LIKE TO EAT TO YOUR HEARTS CONTENT GET READY FOR A PORTION SHOCK. \n\nI made reservations on Opentable for 6:30 pm for 4, then later added a 5th and we were moved to 6:45pm. That was ok, i can understand that since it was a Saturday night (1\/24\/2015). \n\nNow, the food, the wait, Price, the presentation, vibe and service. \n\nEverything was Disappointing, except for the wait. Thank goodness for opentable.\n\nEverything is served tapas style. (Something I did not know when i read about them coming to Vegas in Zagat).  The food  comes out as it is ready. Great concept right?? Not. My side order to my food (rice and beans $4.50) came before my appetizer of Guacamole ($9.50). \n\nThe portions are small so you kinda had to share and buffet it in order to get full. I felt like i ordered half the menu to fill up. \n\nI had Chicken Flautas (approx $9.50)  which come 3 to a plate. They were good, but spicy! My moms flautas  were never this spicy. My girlfriend and my husband ordered tacos, those were tiny, so I gave her some of my food. My friends enchiladas came 20 mins after everyone's food came. He was the hungriest out of all of us and the last one to be fed. \n\nThe vibe is great for this looking to party later on. Getting your drink on, the music is somewhat loud so coming here to visit with friends is not the place to go.\n\nSilver lining- The presentation is amazing. Their drinks and even ice (blocks) are fancy. The food looks too pretty to eat, but as small as they were I had better for what we were paying. Its fancy mexican. It's good. Not authentic but good. High five to the guys in the kitchen making this magic.. Just maybe make the tortillas a little bigger please? \n\nWe saw our waitress once or twice but the rest of the time we were service by a man in a white stripped long sleeve shirt (i think he was the manager). He just came to pick up the plates and I asked him for a soda re-fill and said never mind, i see my waitress I'll ask her. She bypassed our table and didn't even look at our empty glasses that needed a re-fill. 2 mins later the gentlemen brought it out! He was also the gentlemen who i asked for the dessert menu because our waitress never came back. 10 mins later she showed up and recited the dessert menu (who doesn't have a physical menu to look at these days??). My white friends were wondering what the heck the 3 items were. At that point we were done and asked for the check. I believe she said coconut flan, churros and something else we had no idea (even me and I'm Mexican)what it was. \n\nMaybe she had too many tables? Maybe we didn't seem like people who were dropping hundreds on drinks that night like the table next to us..But we are paying customers. Show a little attention.
