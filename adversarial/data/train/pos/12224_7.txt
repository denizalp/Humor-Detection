Beautiful area in the center of Cleveland. Yes, there are bums, drunks, and other urban unsavories, but it's a part of living in the city and it adds character. My first time in the square, the cops were busting up a drug deal in one quandrant while I observed someone carrying their friend who was ODing in another. That said, there is an imposing statue and monument, as well as live music, food trucks, and a farmers market in the summer. Go enjoy it now, because it won't be the same after they tear it up and remodel it for the RNC.
