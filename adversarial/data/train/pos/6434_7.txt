The town of Searchlight, NV is noted for speed traps (see speedtrap.org).  But Nevada Highway Patrol has another method to extract cash for the State and Clark County, from unsuspecting tourists traveling between Las Vegas and Laughlin on Hwy 95.  There is an obscure law that says a driver traveling on a highway that has 2 lanes in each direction, must move into the fast lane if there is an \"emergency vehicle\" parked on the shoulder.  The NHP cop was parked on the shoulder, to the right of the white line, giving another motorist  a ticket.  I passed  at leisurely speed (~55mph) while in the slow lane (hardly dangerous).  He pulled me over and slapped me with a $198 ticket, my first ticket in 12 years.  Thanks NHP, I won't miss Nevada at all.
