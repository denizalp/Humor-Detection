I just moved to Scottsdale from Chicago and was looking for a good hair stylist in the area. My sister recommended me Mark from Vidal Sassoon. I am very particular about my haircut since I have shorter hair so a it's a big deal for me! \nMark listened very attentively to my wishes and gave artistic advice on a new style. \nI got one of the best haircuts in my life!  I keep getting compliments on my hair style every day!!! Mark is phenomenal! Seriously! My both sisters are very happy with him, and I am definitely bringing my mom there! :)) Mark just gained the whole \"Lithuanian village\"(as we call my family) as his clients! I highly recommend Mark if you want to look stylish and sexy! World class!
