The Mirage volcano is on the strip right in front of the hotel. In recent years they've added music and shaken things up a bit. You can see the show every hour from 6pm to 11pm every night.\n\nBest of all....it's totally free!\n\nThe Mirage was the casino I stayed at on my very first trip to Vegas in the 90's, so I have fond memories of watching the volcano erupting from my room during that trip!\n\n\nIt's nothing as spectacular as the Bellagio fountains, but still very cool and definately worth checking out! \n\n4 stars.
