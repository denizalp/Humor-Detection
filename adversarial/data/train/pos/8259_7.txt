Takeout Chinese!!  On a Friday!  Before it gets busy!  The best!!  Quick! Enough food for several days!!  This place is super awesome! \n\nOrder before u get there & remember the ticket number (Chinese food plus a memory test at the same time)\n\nThe get:  plenty of food\n1. pork filled potstickers x7 - huge size & good with tasty dipping sauce $7.95\n\n2.  classic Cantonese beef tendon brisket stew aaaahh can't go wrong with nice beefy tendon $13.95\n\n3.  orange chicken - well this hits the spot $12.95\n\n4.  mandarin beef filet - comes on a bed of white onions so u get some veggies & again done just right  $16.95\n\nOverall, this is Chinese food executed as well or better than most places.  Even though it's in a casino, don't let that deter you from grabbing & going.  1 dish is plenty for 2 persons unless you want more variety or just are super hungry.  Then get a minimum of 2 dishes which reheats well for later or in 2 hours if you feel hungry again.
