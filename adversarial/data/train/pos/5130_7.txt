Royal's Spiced Chai is my new pick-me-up for a long library day. Royal is a tiny coffee bar located behind Rose and Crown, and I would've never found it if not for Yelp. What it lacks in size it makes up for in personality; Royal is impeccable decorated and makes the most out of its trendy, minimalistic interior. There's even a full fledged coffee roaster behind the bar, and the layout gives a feeling of coziness but not crampiness (that's definitely not a word). \n\nRoyal roasts its own beans, uses delicate loose-leaf teas, and even sells bags of in-house roasted coffee beans. The menu is small but well thought out, and service has always been friendly and efficient even when there's a line out the door and one barista on staff. My one disappointment is that they don't currently offer decaf options for coffee.\n\nChai:\nThere are two chai options here, spicy and regular. The spicy version is hands down my favorite chai that I've ever had. I get it unsweetened because there's already a bit of sweetness in the chai, and the flavors of cardamom, ginger, clove, and cinnamon are heavenly. It's really the perfect balance of spicy and fragrant, and that kick comes in every time I take a sip. It's really a gorgeous drink, and I like it both hot or iced. If you're not into really strong spices, the regular version eases the palate in a little more gradually. \n\nCoffee:\nBecause I mostly drink decaf, I've had various sips of my friends' coffee and espresso drinks whenever we come here. I like the boldness of Royal's beans, and there's a nutty aftertaste that lingers longer than I'd expect. It's also obvious that they take their coffee seriously because the one time that the coffee was too fruity and bordered on burned, the barista immediately took it back and remade the entire drink with a fresh batch of coffee beans. \n\nWriting this makes me want chai.. even if it's midnight.
