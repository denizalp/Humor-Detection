Tinuno: \"We have a breakfast menu available if you'd like... your choice -- heavy (Kamayan Feast) or not-heavy (breakfast items)\" \nMe: *turns to friend* \"What do you prefer? I know it's only 9:30AM...\"\nFriend: \"Well, the breakfast items look really goo---\"\nMe: *turns to Tinuno server* \"We'll take the Kamayan feast\"\nFriend: \"...\"\n\nMy opinion only: TOTALLY worth the $15 + tax. I'd definitely go again. And yes, at any time of the day though, the morning we didn't need to wait to be seated... which was extra awesome. Since we went right when Tinuno opened, we did have to wait for the food to get prepped. So, would recommend going after 10AM. \n\nEverything tasted delicious and it was quite a visual treat to see a spread of seafood on a bed of rice against luscious green banana leaves. I felt transported to another city!\n\nTinuno is tucked away on Howard Street; you'll pass some old-school convenience stores and pharmacies before you see the black sign with white text: TINUNO.
