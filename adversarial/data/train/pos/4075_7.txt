Blueberry hill is a super cozy restaurant located on Flamingo down the street from the palms. I've been here a couple times, my boy friend loves this place. It's great for brunch, reminds me of a Marie Calendars with the desert display in the front. I always get the chicken and waffles which are delicious. The Oreo cheesecake was really good too. Last time I was there I ordered a mimosa which was more juice than champagne, I was a little upset about that. Other then that I've never had any complaints, the service is always fast and they are friendly. I'm going to to try the pancakes next time which I heard were bomb!
