My Chiropractor sent me here and recommend that I get some new shoes. He even gave me a 10% off coupon to get me motivated. I guess it was about time that my feet get the treatment they deserve. He said it will also help my knee and back problems as well.\n\nNormally on my feet all day while at work and the shoes that I have been buying at those generic foot places are blowing out. They just don't make shoes like they used to back in the days. Who would have known that your posture starts with how you stand and your shoes make all the difference.\n\nWent online and checked out their selection and was pleased. Called up and spoke to Sean and told him what brand I was looking for and my size. He was both very helpful and friendly and told me to come on in and he would get me fixed up.\n\nPicked up a pair of Hoka One One Stinson Trail Shoes for Men in a size 13 and used my coupon. Man are they comfortable and pretty stylish. I feel like Forest Gump when wearing these babies. Mama said these shoes are my magic shoes and they can take me anywhere. I think she was right.\n\nThey have all sorts of specialty shoes and items to get you going. There is even a slow motion video camera that they can use to track the way your foot hits the ground while running on their treadmill. This is a free service they offer to make sure you get the right shoes. You can literally see the difference when watching the playback video.\n\nStore is located in the back corner section of the complex. Don't let your feet go to waste. You will not be disappointed. On Your Mark ... Get Set ... GO!\n\n5 STARS
