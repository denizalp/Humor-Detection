My grandfather and grandmother are both buried here. The place is in the same place as palm mortuary but the back section is King David's and it's only for Jewish people. The grounds are beautifully maintained there is even a small pond in the middle by the mausoleums where my grandma happens to be and it's just really beautiful.
