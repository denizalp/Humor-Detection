They have 2% Fage Greek Yogurt! This store is good by me....but wait!!!! That's the only good thing about this place!\n\nNow, I am not really lazy...but I had 21 of these bad boys and guess what I had to do? I had to scan EACH of them for the cashier! Why do you ask? I am still asking myself the same question.\n\nI would rather drive two hours to Target in Wheaton or Glendale Heights than visit this place again. Do your job, sista!
