I have a bit of an obsession with mascots, so when we spotted a guy dressed up as a  bun or something, I promptly freaked the hell out and RAN over. Let this be a lesson to you business owners: if you have a big, smiley mascot in front of your business, you have my interest. \n\nAfter taking some photos with the giant bun, the Hubster and I went in to get a coffee for him and a churro for me. The coffee was apparently quite fresh and delicious and the churro was hot, crispy and just right. I didn't opt for any of the fillings and had some sugar and cinnamon instead. Service was super friendly. One churro and a coffee came to $2.50, taxes in.\n\nThis location is right beside the subway station  I take the northbound Dufferin bus quite often and I can definitely see myself getting a churro while waiting to alleviate some of the frustration that comes along with taking the TTC.
