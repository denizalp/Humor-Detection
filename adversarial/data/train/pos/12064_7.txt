Mehh...\n\nMy friends from out of town wanted to go here so we complied.  Ehh, we had tables awaiting us if you have a group of friends you are going to rock it!  As I said we had a tables reserved but we didn't have enough girls. Hmm these are hollywood guys people know them 'm sure girls will come but maybe they should have taken the sunglasses off?!  or payed more money but why should they!  We have a tables but we had to talk to the concierge.  Once that was taken care of apologies from the door staff and the management.\n\nOur group gets to our table and starts to set up, the waitress is beautiful and proficient and does a great job.  We had a great time getting nutts and the low girl to guy ratio changed very quickly.  However this is an old club had not been remodeled in many years.  The bathrooms are on either side a long walk from VIP.  You pay to be in VIP you are close to the dance floor but you don't need it in posh styled booths you can dance your little heart out IN YOUR AREA yup you heard me someone complained that \"we crossed the line\" into their area.  So over it...\n\nDark club, nice waitresses, crappy door staff phishing for extra tips, kinda worn out club.
