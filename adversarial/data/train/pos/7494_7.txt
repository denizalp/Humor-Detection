New York, New York took my wife and I's Vegas virginity away from us back in August of 2006. It was hotter than hell that week! 110 to 118 the whole time we were there!\n\nThis is one of the last themed hotels on the strip. We had a great time at this hotel. The roller coaster was fun but made me sick. Everyone who worked at the hotel was very nice and pleasant. Our room was clean and comfortable and had a great view of the mountains. Those were the most beautiful sunrises and sunsets I have ever seen!\n\nMy only two complaints are that our room was right near the roller coaster which made it hard to sleep at times and the fact that this hotel is far from all the action in the middle of the strip. (Wynn, Caesars, Bellagio etc) You are also around all of the \"porn slappers\" and the people that try to get you to take timeshare tours.\n\nAll and all a solid place to stay while in Vegas.
