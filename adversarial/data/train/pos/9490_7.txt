If I could give a zero star, I would.  My husband visited today and was greeted by a woman who immediately said, \"You must be here for the clearance, or do you actually need help?\"  He replied with, \"Actually no, I'm not here for the clearance.\"  She responded snarkily with, \"Then I'll get to you in a little bit.\"\n\nSooooooo offensive.  Do not judge a book by its cover.  We're building a luxury home and looking for $60K in Wolf\/Subzero appliances - and you just lost us.
