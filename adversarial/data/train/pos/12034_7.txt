Super disappointed.\nWe were looking for the intimate, walk through time, authentic speakeasy experience.\nOur intro started with an incorrect time reference by the greeter and our bartender- speakeasies did NOT occur in the 40's, they were developed in the 20's due to prohibition.\nAlso, if you want to have a dress code for proper historical feel, don't have the bartenders wear jeans.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nUnfortunately there were four older adults seated at the bar who thought they were at Applebee's, gaffawing and drunk talking over EVERYTHING.\nbefore you enter, you're given a few \"rules\" for ambiance. One rule is no loud talking, to conduct yourself in hush tones as if you were actually in a speakeasy.\n\nTo walk past these buffoons cackling away WITH the bartender, I should've known.\nThe sad thing is the drink was delicious but impossible to swallow with the $15 price tag because there was zero ambience with those hecklers at the bar who were never ONCE asked to tone it down.\n\nwe left to the local raw n dirty tiki bar where the patrons there weren't even as loud!!\n\nAfter posting our disgust online, it turns out we weren't the only ones who left unimpressed.\n\nI guess it was an experience. We experienced it so we don't have to wonder any more. We also don't have to go back.
