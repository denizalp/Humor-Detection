2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     31\/100\n\nInfluenced by my uncle's enthusiastic love for the Pinches' elote corn, this was the main reason my ohana and I went to Container Park! \n\nThis was our first stop at Container Park, and as soon as my uncle parked the SUV he was running off to Pinches. \n\n Quote from my uncle: \"I LOOOOOOOVE the corn, it's sooo GOOD! You have to try it. It's my favorite at the Container!\" This is all he talks about when talking about Container Park. He loves your corn! \n\nI've had the elote corn in a cup from the Vegas outdoor swap meet and I definitely agree, Pinches' elote is sooo good! \n\nThey have an extensive menu and I've been following them on Instagram, and I have to say I wish I saved my appetite for this place! We had lunch right before this, and I was too full to eat anything. I managed to eat the whole cob of corn and a drink a cup of beer. Oh! and I got to sip their horchata with cinnamon, it was so good! Better than what I've had at other Mexican restaurants. \n\nService was 5 star excellente. The women helping us each time we went back for beer were amazing. \n\nI'll definitely be back for the horchata and to try the rest of their menu!
