Pretty sweet spot. It's a a small shopping area with a scenic fountain outside. You get to sample flavors before making the purchase. You can mix in toppings and sauces. They have a wide variety of dipped or drizzled cones. They even sale the ice cream by the pint. It's clean and the staff are nice. I really enjoyed the Amaretto it was delicious. I got it with a waffle cup. I would skip the waffle cup in the future because waffle cup it was stale. I think it's a cool spot overall and I will be back.
