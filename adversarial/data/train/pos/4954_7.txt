LOL\n\nTrying to write a legitimate review here, but I'm not sure if I remember much of my experience other than the tasty cocktails, booming music, spacious dance floor, and live show by who you ask...?? NELLY. My friends and I came around ~11pm to make the guestlist, and it was sorta a bummer to realize that Nelly was expected to come around ~2am. But hey, the middle school me squealed when I heard his voice, and I had a blast dancing to some hip hop (rather than the expected EDM) for a change!
