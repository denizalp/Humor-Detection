Agree with the reviews here - hate that they use paper round your face - it sticks when you move - horrible.  The massage was good, no complaints there, but did not like the set up, in a room with 6 other people, with no separation and the door open to reception.\n\nAlso, when I went to pay I was asked to give cash for the tip.  I did not have any and wanted to add to my card and they did not seem too pleased and then when I told them how much, they questioned me twice, basically saying \" is that all\".  I am a 20% tipper, so did not like the whole attitude towards payment.  Too many choices around put up with that.
