Carson Dunlop's home inspector failed to detect a fairly obvious presence of knob and tube wiring in the house we purchased. It's a seemingly elementary oversight, and a troubling omission from an inspection report about that's about as thick as a phone book. \n\nWe would have certainly factored the presence of knob and tube into our offer to purchase. Instead, in addition to having just bought an expensive home, we now also face multiple thousands of dollars in unanticipated electrical repairs. \n\nStep up your game, Carson Dunlop.
