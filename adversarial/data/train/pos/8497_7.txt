My Roti Place is the newest restaurant in one of Toronto's most cursed locations. Can it survive the curse??? I think so. \n\nFor starters, they stand out with their crazy painted exterior. Which I think will draw people in... And also... Because the food is damn good. \n\nI'm not a roti expert myself. But I do really like Roti. And I've had roti and many spots in the city. I didn't expect much from this place because it's in a cursed location - but to my surprise it was pretty damn amazing. I INHALED a butter chicken roti like it was air. The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars was the amount of meat. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't too generous either. I asked if there was a lot of meat in the roti and they said it came with '1 portion'. Which could mean anything lol. I think they should start serving it with 1.25 portions. If they did, and if other stuff on the menu tastes as good as the butter chicken roti  - I would change my review to 5 stars. Because the food is damn tasty. And the service was really great. I can tell these people care. \n\nI hope this place lifts the curse! I believe it will.
