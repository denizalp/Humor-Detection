Before you read on, the 5 STARS is because I'm comparing it against ALL other buffets I have been to & especially the ones in Vegas.\n\nonto my BRIEF SUMMARY!\n- Buffets are usually about quantity not quality, but Bellagio gives you great quality food & a whole lot of it\n- Smaller than Rio but better quality\n- Great service\n- Wasted food goes to Pig Farm\n- Quality Deserts\n\nEvery time I go to Vegas, I've officially been there 3 times in the last 6 months, I've got to hit the Bellagio Buffet. Bottom line. Yes, you should go to Rio because it's the world's biggest buffet, but when you're done poo-ing your brains out, you'll want to spend an additional 5 bucks and go to Bellagio.\n\nVEGAS = LINES. So if you're gonna cry about waiting in line for the club or a really great restaurant, then don't go to Vegas. It's like going to an amusement park during some busy holiday weekend and crying about how you have to wait in line for a ride. It's RIDICULOUS. Suck it up and wait.. the longer you wait, the MORE food you'll probbaly eat. HAHA\n\nSo we waited like 10-15 minutes in line to eat dinner on Friday Night around 7 or 8pm. Normal wait time in Vegas without reservations can be at least an hour. it is a little bit pricey but again, it's worth it. Yeah it's 34.99 and basically you pay $40\/a person.\n\nIn general the Bellagio is a NICE Casino and the buffet has nice decor. As soon as we sat down we were greeted and put our drink orders in. and then headed towards the buffet!\n\nIf you haven't been to the Bellagio Buffet yet, make sure you go around ONCE and look at everything they have to offer. The stuff on the right side isn't always the same as the stuff on the left side, so you wanna plan out what all you want to eat lol. The thing about Bellagio is that unless you're absolutely stuck on something in particular, you could probably eat a whole bunch of different meals in one setting haha.\n\nMy first stop is always the salad bar. They have freshly prepared salads to choose from and then they have the built-it-yourself. I love that their field greens are always fresh as well all of the other ingredients. They've got plenty of salad dressings and toppings. \n\nOn to the stuff that everyone wants, but rarely matters to me. Seafood! There's so much food in general, that I basically ignore all the crab legs and other seafood. There is sushi available and it looks ok. I think I had it back in December and it wasn't anything to brag about. \n\nBellagio seems to specialize in giving you different \"gourmet\" type foods. I especially loved the Kobe Beef Top Sirloin, Beef Wellington, Roasted Turkey and the Ostrich. Although, I've never ate Ostrich, I thought it was cool that they had it! They also had roasted Quail. Didn't try it but hey if you're adventurous, do you!\n\nBellagio also has all of the staple foods that regular buffets have. Super creamy and fluffy mashed potatoes (& a pesto version), fresh artisan bread, Asian cuisine, pastas, and carved meats.\n\nDeserts is where I think Bellagio sets itself from the Rio. Rio has a lot of selection, as does Bellagio. But Bellagio's cheesecake is legitimate. I think it's plain cheesecake with a fruit topping is equivalent to cheesecake factory. The cheesecake itself is very rich and smooth. And they have other deserts as well. I ate a few different things, but usually you're too full to even eat desert, depending on who you are.\n\nAll in all, Bellagio to me is the best buffet in Las Vegas. I prefer it over any other buffet that I've been to and the service is great. They constantly filled up my drink, took away my dishes and offered advice on food. I'm sure there's people that may disagree with me, but ehh they're not as cool as me! haha.\n\nGo to Bellagio and eat the buffet. Don't waste your money on a cheap buffet that's gonna keep you on the toilet. Get quality & quantity here!
