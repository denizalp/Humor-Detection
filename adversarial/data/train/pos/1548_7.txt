SWEET!!  Who could say no to a free upgrade to the grand deluxe suite?!!  It was like a 1 bedroom luxury apartment, minus a kitchen, replace it with a bar!  Corner bar with marble counter, stools and a flat screen too!  Also a little living room area with couches and another flat screen!  Next to that was an office area.  The room was cool too with a jacuzzi tub!  \n\nDidn't do too well at the BJ tables tho!
