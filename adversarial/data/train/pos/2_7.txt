The office was busy with all kinds of ladies waiting to get their girl parts looked at for one reason or another. I was there for my yearly checkup. \nThe waiting room was very cold but there were plenty of seats, a fish tank and TV to keep me occupied. Magazines are scarce so make sure your phone is charged up for extra entertainment. \nSeeing the nurse was quick and pleasant while she checked my vitals. \nDr. McHale made the experience easy, virtually painless, and quick. She did make sure to ask me several times if I had any questions or concerns, which made me feel like she was there to help keep women healthy and informed. We discussed some common women's' issues and that was that. \nEven though Dr. McHale was only in the room for a few minutes and most of the time she had her hands on or in my private parts, I feel like I made a new friend today. I would recommend her to any of my gal pals. See you next year, Staci.
