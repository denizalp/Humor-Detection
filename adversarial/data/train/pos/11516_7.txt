It's restaurant week, and I finally had the opportunity to try Beckett's Table. Having read so many good reviews, I decided to book a reservation here to take my mom out.\n\nI carefully inspected their prefixed menu, and was elated to see that they offered a vegetarian option.\n\nFor our main course, my mom tried the chicken meatballs which, unfortunately, was not a fan because of the onions and peppery taste. (I guess she didn't look at the menu)\n\nI ordered the vegetable salad with champagne  vinaigrette, which was fine.\n\nFor the main course, mom got the meat loaf, and I ordered the vegetarian mushroom lasagna (their vegetarian option).\n\nMy mom said the entree was delicious and not greasy unlike other meat loafs she had tasted.\n\nMy lasagna was decent, but I wish the vegetarian option wasn't a pasta dish.   I've been eating pasta this whole week, so I was sort of  sick of it.  A Total overload!\n\nNow as far as the service goes, it was great. Our server Michael did a great job explaining the menu, and the waiter's assistant kept our beverage full.\n\nMy only fret is where they sat us. They gave us a table smack in the center of the restaurant, so regrettably, I could not provide pictures. Next time I'm going to ask for  patio seating now that the weather is getting cooler.
