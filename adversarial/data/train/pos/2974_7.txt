BB King ought to be ashamed to have his name attached to a place like this.\n \nYea I knew going in not to expect much, I DID read the reviews this time. But the group I was with \"raved\" about their experience a few days before and they had a coupon, and you know they saying: majority rules..... \n\nSooooo where's everyone?!??!?! I mean the place was practically empty, I'm NOT putting 2 on a 10! Out of the whole establishment, there were three tables (including mines) that were in use. Not even one person sitting at the bar! That's not good...\n I ordered something simple a fried catfish po'boy. It was good but the fries are horrible! \nThey even had the nerve to try to set the ambience by diming the lights and putting candles on the tables. Turn the lights on so folks can know that you're open and they'll come in. DUH!\n\nNot coming back and not recommending......Sorry BB.
