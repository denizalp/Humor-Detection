Merrrrp. I was skeptical about going to a buffet off The Strip because I've been to two buffets on The Strip and became a major fan of those. When in Vegas, you GOTTA hit up an awesome buffet to bring out your inner glutton. I was told good things about M Resort's Studio B buffet and was persuaded into making the 20 minute trek off The Strip and giving it a shot. Unfortunately, I regret it. \n\nThe only reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars is because we came at 2:15pm, paid lunch price ($17), and waited until 2:30pm for the lunch buffet to be changed to the dinner buffet which basically meant I got to get my chubby little hands on the prime rib. Holla, cheap Asians in da hizzouse. Oh, and also alcohol is included in the buffet. By no means is it top shelf but hey, it'll get you smashed to the point where you'll think the food is amazing if you drink enough of it. For $17, I got my money's worth. The food was overall somewhere between mediocre and average. \n\nLet this be a warning to all that they only serve seafood on the weekends. I was very upset there were no crab legs but instead of trusting my group I should have done the research myself before coming here. My fault. On The Strip, the majority (if not all) buffets will serve crab legs for dinner everyday of the week.
