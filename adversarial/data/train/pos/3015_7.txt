The inside was incredibly tacky, but the food was decent.  Hey, did you know that they sing here?  They do!  It's like Max's Opera Cafe but called something else with different food.  That was an interesting and unexpected touch.  Our waitress didn't sing though, so I dunno if they all do, or just some.\nThe service was lukewarm but fairly efficient (we only had to ask for water once).  I started off with the bruschetta which was much sweeter than any other bruschetta I've had (clearly from the balsamico they used) and the bread was harder than diamonds.  I had to send it through a wood chipper before I could manage to bite down on it.  The bread they serve at the table is soft and delish though, so if you're thinking you want to kick your meal off with bread, I might just stick with that.\nFrom there I moved on to the goat cheese and spinach ravioli.  Served in a yummy, tangy pink sauce, I don't know how they get away with putting spinach in the name of the dish.  It was goat cheese ravioli (I wonder if they were house made, or just under cooked - they were incredibly firm on the edges), with a few wilty pieces of spinach on top in the sauce.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but this dish was too. . . . \n??  Salty?  Intense?  Rich?  I'm not sure.  But I could only eat half, and where goat cheese is concerned that is totally unlike me.\nThe mamacita's minestrone also featured undercooked beans, which meant she only ate half of her meal as well.\nThe good news is, this leaves room for dessert!  I ordered the creme brulee and was sufficiently underwhelmed.  Now I remember why I never really liked the stuff.\nA wholehearted meh.  Plus a star for singing I suppose.
