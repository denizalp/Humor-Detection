This place has received so many good reviews I just have to assume I either came on an off night or ordered all the wrong things.  However, nothing I ate stood out and a few of the items were mediocre.  After having a few small plates, I was still hungry so I ordered the koro koro steak.  It didn't have a great sear on it and the flavor wasn't very pleasant.  I left most on the plate and ended up snacking later when I got home.
