Being the tourist that I am, I ventured into Downtown Toronto my first weekend in the Great White North. And how did it welcome me... with FREEZING COLD weather. Nevertheless, I had to go to CN Tower, jump on the glass floor in the viewing area, have my new umbrella blown out, and then stumble into a bar. I was heading towards Air Canada Center when I saw Hoops & some shelter from the cold. \n\nWe were seated pretty quickly in a booth that was honestly a little small and a lotta claustraphobic surrounded by HELLA TVS! \n\nBig ones.\n\nSmall ones.\n\nMulti-screen ones.\n\nOnes in your booth.\n\n(Even ones in the bathroom!)\n\nI guess when you're there to watch a game... you'll never have an excuse to miss a moment of it.\n\nThe food was your typical sports bar faire. Pasta & Burgers FTW! Full bar, too. The warm fuzzy feeling definitely made the rest of the walk to ACC a little more tolerable.
