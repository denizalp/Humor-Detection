The club itself is pretty remarkable.  We had a table on the \"patio\" (outside near the pool) and they were very accomidating and nice to the 13 of us girls there for a bachelorette party.  The staff was VERY cool and got us all pumped up when taking us over to the table.  You pay a pretty penny for a table but it's Vegas so it is what it is.\n\nHere is why I give them two stars ... it is what happen AFTER that night.  We paid in cash and the waitress held my ID till we paid.  Well there was a lot of back and forth with the cash and getting it counted correctly, getting our change back, etc.  So after that debacle (I suggest paying with a CC!!) the ID didn't even come to mind (and I hadn't event had a drink yet so I cannot blame it on it the booze).  \n\nThe next morning I woke up and was like ohhhh crap, I didn't get my ID back and I had to hop on a plane later that afternoon.  I called the club SEVERAL times - I was given BS answers and \"oh well let us take your information and we will call you back\".  After the FOURTH call I was VERY mad and even though on call #3 I told them the waitress' name I was told \"oh umm the manager has to call each person working that night\".  \n\nI left SEVERAL vm's throughout this week and today finally somebody answered when I called.  \"Oh yes, we have your ID\"  Great ... thanks for the call back.  Now I am waiting on some \"liability release form\" ... we shall see if THAT ever comes through.  If it doesn't come through this afternoon I am going to call the Vegas police and report it as stolen.  Seriously ... this is a JOKE.  And for that I will not step into that nightclub again.  WORST customer service EVER.
