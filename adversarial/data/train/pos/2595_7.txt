Be warned!  Questionable auction in a not so great part of town.  Home page of website advertises they accept all major credit cards. How it works page indicates a $100 deposit is required, but doesn't indicate it must be cash.  Only in the fine print under Auction Rules does it finally indicate the deposit to bid must be cash, and will be used toward any purchases.  \n\nI show up to have fun and buy some new furniture.  Only to learn about the fine print, and no flexibility. I rarely carry cash and tonight was no exception.  Had I known, had they told me when I called, had it been more obvious on their website, I would have stopped at the bank. They wouldn't take case from my debit card, or from any credit card I own.  They claimed \"I could dispute the purchase\".  This makes no sense, since I could spend $1000, and put $900 on a card and dispute the next day just as easily.  \n\nI just didn't feel safe in that area trying to find an ATM at night. It was obvious they've had problems in the past since they felt a need to hire an off duty police order to dress in uniform and stand \"guard\" at the front door.\n\nIt was a wasted a trip.  I'd rather by new from a reputable store or used from Craigslist.  I think I'd feel safer with less hassle.  What a shame.
