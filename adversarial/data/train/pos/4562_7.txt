My home girl Elizabeth A. loves, like totally BFF4LIFE LOVES this place so I've been to Woodlands many a time celebrating her birth or us surviving another work week - honestly, she loves this place many many times over so we go when the diets are thrown to the wind and we're looking for an excuse to get down the ground on some grub.\n\nBeing an Indian food idiot\/novice, I can't tell you a whole lot of what I've tried on their lunch buffet (it's always changing!) but I can tell you that about 90% of it is amazing, followed by 10% of it which is pretty good.\n\nThe naan? MMMM. That's right - 4 M's. Carbs, freshly cooked (fried? please god don't let it be fried) and available to scoop up your rice and whatever cheese, chicken, spinach, potato, eggplant stuff you've put on your plate along the buffet - seriously, this naan stuff is NO JOKE. Good bye, garlic bread! Don't call me Parker House rolls! I have a new carb fave in town and it's Woodland's naan. I love thee!\n\nMoving on to the random list of stuff I don't know the name of, I simply say: Girl, don't take it personal. I love you - like, forreal! And while I wouldn't buy this crapola from a dude trying to hustle me for my lovin', I hope that you know that I am true and love all of you. Variety is the spice of life, and lunch buffet, you always got me hooked like that. Everytime I go it's something new to experience and you got me twisted up in your Indian game.\n\nIf my review\/hip hop montage doesn't make you want to go to Woodlands, I am concerned about your reading skills and\/or knowledge of late 90's R&B and kindly request you download \"Pony\" and proceed directly to Saturday's lunch buffet @ Woodlands!
