We had a meeting with this firm for 30 mins. The associate was helpful but not too knowledgeable. The senior partner Kanu is a good lawyer (probably), but just wasted our time regaling stories about his experience and college. He is very friendly and personable though. We did get some of the answers clarified, but the time was up pretty fast. So at the end of it, we still had some lingering questions\/concerns.\n\nSo all in all, I DO NOT feel that it was worth the money or the time. There are better ones out there.
