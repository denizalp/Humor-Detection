so as many yelpers know, writing a review may require some deliberation and even some soul searching, this is that kind of review.\njobot is my frenemy - sometimes i want great coffee without the shitty attitude (imagine!!) and sometimes i dont care - yea its that kind of place. i know im not saying anything new here - ive been coming here since they opened & im always excited to go & then after...well its like eating donuts; excitement, anticipation, enjoyment then regret...you get the picture\n\ncoffee is pretty damn good\nfood is hit or miss - quality is usually above par, but serving size varies depending on the day (?) and for the price that aint cool!\nservice - well if you have enough gages and a tragic hair-do then youre in! but if youre like me & you love spandex and heels (dont hate im cute!!) then youre probably not in!! \nO well, i love good coffee!
