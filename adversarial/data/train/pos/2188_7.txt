It's just barely okay. Like the last two restaurants in this location it's very overpriced for what you get. I don't know if this landlord charges too much or all three have been operated on the same lease by a crummy restaurant group. But there's a pattern and it stinks.\n\nThe service and atmosphere isn't good. Decor is fine, layout is cramped. Service is trying hard to be posh without the effortless grace you find in better places. Feels awkward and forced.\n\nThe food is alright. It would be good at half the price, the value proposition is terrible. Don't get the lamb.
