I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:\n\nBrunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.\n\nAppetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.\n\nMeals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.
