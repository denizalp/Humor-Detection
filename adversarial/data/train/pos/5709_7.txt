I came into this store for the first time in over 4 years. Actually they have relocated and completely remodeled. I am going to tell you that this is the Best looking Victoria's that I have seen in a long time.\nVictoria's Secret used to be a very fancy Lingerie Store with high Quality Items. You paid a little more, However, you had good quality.\nI'm sorry to say that has all changed, and while I do like going there to shop, It is not what it used to be.That was before many of the current clients were born. Heheee.\nAnyway, I was very, very impressed with this store. Starting with the staff. Every single one of them was very helpful and truly willing to help you find what you were looking for. As well as telling you about all the deals and specials.\nThe store was laid out so nicely. Not crowded with product. Not dirty! \nI cannot tell you how many VC stores I have been to across the country that are dirty and disorganized! \nThis shop was so nice that I actually bought more than I went in for. I felt like shopping here. It was inviting.I wish more stores would be like this. It would make you want to go in and shop.\nThis is a large store as well, so there is a lot of selection.\nThis is a great Victoria's Secret shop.Well worth driving to Tempe Market Place to shop. It is located near one of the stages and H&M.
