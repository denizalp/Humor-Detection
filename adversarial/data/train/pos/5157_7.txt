Stopped in here for the first time last week, and we really enjoyed the food.\n\nWe ordered a cheesesteak, and the chicken tenders with fries. \n\nService was super: the girl at the counter, Devina, was super friendly, and offered suggestions when we weren't sure what we wanted.\n\nFood came out quickly, and was delicious. \nThe chicken fingers were not greasy, and were breaded well...and there were TONS of them!!!  Seriously, that was a lot of chicken.  The fries were addictive.  \n\nThe cheesesteak was excellent as well.  Not \"The best\" as the sign outside claims, but definitely up there!\n\nI'd be glad to stop in again, now that I know where they are, this could be a regular stop on our disc golf days!
