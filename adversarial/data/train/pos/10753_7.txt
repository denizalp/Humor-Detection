Super cute place! \n\nMy friend actually painted the designs on the outside of the building, super cute!\n\nWe did not eat here we just met some friends for drinks. Hubby and I shared a bottle of Merlot and it was appropriately priced at about $20.\n\nI really love the decor in here and there tv's are hung in a fashion that watching a game would be easy.\n\nThey have a \"Wine Wednesdays\" plan coming up so I will def go to that when they start it :)\n\nI will update my review the next time I go!
