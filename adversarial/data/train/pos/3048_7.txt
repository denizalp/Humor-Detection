When I am on the Strip and want to slow down or get away from the adult beverages, Starbuck's is my place. Actually Starbuck's is always my place.\n\n  The Starbuck's at the Linq is the newest Starbuck's on the Strip. Technically it is in the new Disneyfied street called the Linq that will lead people from the mid-Strip along a walkway that resembles Bourbon Street past bars and entertainment venues to the High Roller Ferris Wheel. It is between the Flamingo, O Shea's and Quad entrances. In other words it is hyper convenient.\n\n   There are countless Starbuck's on the Strip. This one is different because it looks like you are entering a building off Bourbon Street. It is the anti-casino Starbuck's with the casino pricing.\n\n  Inside the Starbuck's is modern. There are plenty of seating. The sun does not heat up the cafe. And in the age where the smartphone is practically a body appendage, there are plenty of phone outlets.\n\n  When I hang out on the Strip, sometimes I just want to relax with a cup of coffee. I enjoyed relaxing in the newest Strip Starbuck's enjoying a non adult beverage.
