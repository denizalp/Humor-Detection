Super-cheap Chinese eats. I've only ever tried their lunch specials, which are a ridiculously good value. $6 will get you a couple pounds of food, including an entree, two sides (fried rice and chow mein), an egg roll, and a soup. I couldn't come close to finishing, and even with a 10 minute drive back to work my food was still roughly the temperature of the sun. Food quality itself was average, there were clumps of white rice mixed in with the fried rice and some of the vegetables were a touch undercooked. A lot of other reviews claim the food is disgusting and made them sick; either I have a stomach of steel or the beef & broccoli is one of their stronger dishes.
