Food was good service was nonexistent,  first time i have ever been in a restaurant  and the server never came back to ask how every thing is,   i never got a refill on my coffee.  Place was half empty,   i never saw a employee  with a smile on there face.  I had to flag down the waitress to let her know she forgot the hashbrowns and her response was got it as she walked past the table.  Sorry for eating there and inconveniencing  you all . Dont worry i will not be back.  Ill go to ihop.
