The people here are awesome. Plain and simple they help no matter what is needed and hassle the insurance for what is actually due.\nThey stayed on the line with me for over an hour just to get things sorted out with the insurance.\n\nWARNING: if you are dealing with Fred Loya insurance I wish you the best of luck because they suck and are super unprofessional and the adjuster that I got that \"works\" for them couldn't even take down a simple address. He can go suck himself.\n\nShout out to all the employees there great group of people. Charles WILL get done what needs to be done so stop by and see him if you need anything at all!!
