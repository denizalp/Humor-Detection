Love this location for First Watch. For starters it has been here as long as I can remember.\nSecondly , I love the food! It is always fresh and hot. The service is wonderful as well.\n3 of us came for lunch recently. About 1:20pm. Close to closing ,as they only serve Breakfast and Lunch here. Even though ,they seated us in a section they had already closed,(because, my friend wanted to seat there). I thought that was very nice of them.\nOur service was great and so was our food.\nRemember if you sign up on line at their website , they will give you coupons via email. Even a free meal for your Birthday.\nParking can at times be a little tricky but, you should always be able to find something.\nRestrooms are always clean.
