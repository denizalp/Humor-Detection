This has to be my favorite fast casual concept restaraunt! Not only is the food quality and super tasty, the place it self is very cute, clean, and modern. And they do way more than your typical grab and go pizza and salad joints. They offer tons of cheese boards, Prosciutto wrapped Mellon, and Wood-Fire Baked Truffle Cheese Bread along with a decently priced selections of wines and beers. Oh and don't forget dessert like their very popular Signature Nutella Calzone With Fresh Berries. Everything I've tried here has been super fresh you can tell that they use quality ingredients just like they promise. Natural, high quality, and non-GMO. \n\nCome here for all your Neapolitan Pizza cravings and you wont leave disappointed.
