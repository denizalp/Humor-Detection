So, having a girls' night with my best friend - watching movies, having wine and we both decide (as you do after a little vino) that it's time for burgers and fries! On to Skip the Dishes we go to see where we can order from, and there's Flipp'n Burgers. I'd been wanting to try their food for some time, so the opportunity had arrived. \n\nNow I will be honest here. The food was delivered right on time, but still we found that the burgers were still not super. (Beefy bacon - definitely worth writing home about! That was what I enjoyed the most about my burger.) \n\nThe star that stole the show for us, however, was a complete shocker: MEXICAN POUTINE, WE ARE NOT WORTHY!! Fries - crisp and hot. Peppers - jalape√±o and banana...oh my...and the gravy...wow. A little on the salty side (but that's what we wanted!) and the right amount of gravy to cheese curd ratio. Don't be fooled by the menu on Skip indicating that it's \"Swiss\". Nope. These were the real deal cheese curds. \n\nI may not be raving about your burgers, but that poutine is the stuff of legends. Keep on Flipp'n!
