The start of the Vegas weekend was at Light on a Friday late night!  My girls and I got picked up in a limo from our hotel that we were staying at.  Fancy huh?!  Well, it was all thanks to our big hearted, sugar daddy!  Yep, I said it.  We were a group of 6+ girls and we had a sugar daddy with us!  The limo ride was just the start of what it seemed to be an endless, fun night.  We were listening to, \"Make It Nasty,\" by Tyga and getting pumped up.\n\nWhen we arrived, however, we were super late and it was my first time having to pay for a $30 cover charge.  Eh, it was way past midnight by the time we got there so I guess that should suffice.  Entered.  Got drinks and eventually made our way to the ground, dance floor area.  This place is pretty spacious and has acrobats performing here and there throughout the night.\n\nKREWELLA WAS DJ-ING THAT NIGHT!  YES, I FELT \"ALIVE!\"  What a perfect song for the first night in Vegas!  \n\nLight set the bar and really paved the way for the expectation to my Vegas club experience for that weekend. \n\nI am seriously having Vegas withdrawals and can't get enough of Krewella's Alive song!
