This is my favourite dive in the Greater Toronto Area. Hands down.\n\nGreat location. Big patio. Super cheap beer. Cheap food. Great service.\nWhat you see is what you get.\n\nI see reviews here criticizing the quality of the patio furniture. I see reviews complaining about the quality of the Vietnamese beef noodle soup. Seriously? What did you expect? Java House is a place where you can get piss-drunk on a nice summer day without making a dent in your wallet.\n\nA horror movie isn't supposed to have good lighting.
