I was impressed with how efficient Parma PD was when I was involved in a nasty hit-skip accident with some dumb sociopathic bitch. \n\nAfter filling out a report at the station, a friendly officer called me to say he had tracked down the woman who hit me, cited her for both the accident and for leaving the scene, and gave me all the info for insurance purposes.\n\nThought I'd throw out a positive experience I had with the Parma PD to show that cops do way more than just write tickets...sometimes they write tickets to smug assholes who really deserve them!
