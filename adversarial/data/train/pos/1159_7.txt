This place is always on my list whenever I visit Vegas. The most amazing chicken and waffles ever. The portions are huge and very tasty. Each item can serve two if you're not a big portion eater.\n\nIt was very busy with a 45 minute wait. The staff made sure to ask that I wait in their lobby as once the names are called the table can't be held for very long. They use  a very loud microphone to call the waiting customers so I feel they do their due diligence in attending to the busy line of customers.  My name was called within 20 minutes and I had a great experience once again.
