The family couldn't decide what to eat so they decided to play it safe and have Mexican food for dinner. Located in NYNY, it is fairly close to the Monte Carlo which was where we were staying over the weekend. There was no wait to be seated for a party of 5 on a Saturday early-ish afternoon. We were seated and greeted by our waiter who offered us chips and salsa (not on the house!) as well as some of their many tequilas that they offer. I mean, seriously! they have a good range of different tequilas from the usual Patron Silver under their blanco and silver menu that also includes Jose Cuervo Platino and Don Julio Blanco, they also have Cuervo tradicional and 1800 reposado under the reposado menus, and they also have abocado, muy anejo tequilas and regular anejo. Super awesome if you are a tequila fan. Of course they also have their margaritas, beers, and even wine. \n\nThe husband and I wanted to try to eat something else other than Mexican food for dinner so we only ordered an appetizer to share. We ordered the chicken empanadas which were ok. Crispy, flaky and soft with a good amount of chicken in them. I thought they were a bit on the oily side but then again, I guess it is fried food. My brother ordered the carne asada tacos which I took a bite off and were alright. At $15.95 though, I thought they would be a tad bit better. The meat was a bit on the bland side but if I had enough salsa on them, it was better. \n\nService was ok. We did get our waters refilled  and our waiter came once to check up on us.
