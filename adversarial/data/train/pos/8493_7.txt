This is by far the worst Greyhound station I've ever been to! I've had great experiences in the past but this place is full of staff and bus drivers that are just not knowledgeable of anything.\n\nFirst, I called ahead to make sure I got priority seating. They confirm what it's true on the website; that they had priority seating for the bus ride I was taking, which is an express ride. When I got there, the gentleman working the counter said there is no priority seating, and that my bag would not need a tag when I asked for one, saying it was super full. Her told me I didn't need one.\n\nSo I got in line and I asked the guy loading the cargo if he thought it would be better to throw it under. He also confirmed it would fit up top. I got on the bus, but wasn't priority seated, even with my stamped \"A\" ticket told me I should be one of the first people on the bus. I was 3rd to last. Yay for being next to the smelly piss for 16 hours.\n\nOn the bus I couldn't fit my bag on the overheas bin so I put it on the seat next to me. Tai, the bus driver, came over to argue with me to make sure it went up top despite the fact that he let another gentleman keep his bag on his accompanying seat. When I told him the desk clerk and the baggage loader both told me I didn't need a tag and that it would fit, and of course that it was my responsibility to get a tag, he called me \"sweety\" derogatorily. Thanks for your sexism, but I don't identify as female asshole. He then shoved my bag up top and made it fit by damaging the contents, stating, \"See it does fit.\"\n\nThen I found out only half of the electricity works on the bus and of course it's the half of the bus I'm sitting on. Didn't I pay for this wifi?! Icing on this shit cake.\n\nSeriously difficult to deal with these people. They just really need to figure their shit out, so they don't lie to costumers one second just to have another employee say the opposite thing.
