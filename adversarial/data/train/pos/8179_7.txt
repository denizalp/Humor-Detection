The Lion Habitat is a free exhibit located in the MGM Grand Hotel.  There is usually a lion or two in the exhibit.  And they change out their lions everyday.\n\nThere are actually a lot of lions that stay in a ranch outside of Las Vegas.. and they switch them out.  They spend a few hours at the habitat at a time.\n\nEvery time I have gone to see the lions, they have always been sleeping!  Damn Lions!  Still, it's nice to get up close and personal with a real lion.  These guys are huge!
