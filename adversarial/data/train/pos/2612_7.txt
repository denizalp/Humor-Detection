Tea of Joy-- what a cute name for a boba shop! Sounds extra tranquil and meaningful, like something straight out of a fortune cookie. At first I thought that this place would be one of those fancy afternoon tea spots but it's boba. Oh yeah!\n\nSince I kind of found this place on a whim, I went in blind and just ordered a milk tea. As far as my typical drink order goes, I keep it pretty boring even when there are tons of options. I always go for a milk tea or a Thai tea and it hits the spot. You should be proud of me though, I fancied it up with a Hokkaido milk tea this time. The guy who took my order asked what level sweetness I wanted, and since it was my first time I decided to just go with the normal 100% sweetness (it ranged from 25%-125%). WOW, super sweet. Next time, I will definitely order a 50% or a 75%. The Thai tea was ordered at a 75% and it was perfect. A large drink will run you about $5 without toppings. Toppings are 50 cents.\n\nToppings are what make a boba place stand out and Tea of Joy definitely does a great job of that. I looked at the menu and was pleasantly surprised by all of the options I had to customize my drink. Pudding and jelly are my go to's and I was so excited to see coffee jelly on the menu! ALL THE COFFEE JELLY.\n\nThey also serve food but we just came from dinner, so that will be something we will have to keep in mind the next time we are in the area. At the counter they have different desserts on display-- cheesecake and other delicious things. \n\nMy favorite thing about this place was the atmosphere. The giant outside patio area is perfect for just hanging out, studying or playing board games. Inside was clean and the outside patio area was well lit. I can definitely see myself hanging out here during a warm summer night.
