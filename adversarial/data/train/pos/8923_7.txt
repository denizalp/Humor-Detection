I have been a local for the last 12 years, & the Orleans was the only locals casino that would give back to their loyal customers by giving them a free night once a month which I thought was a nice gesture, which always kept me coming back to them , but they stopped doing that 2-3 years ago...idk why??\nI always refer my out of town guests to stay there as its a pretty decent hotel & prices are great on the rooms & they offer a lot on amenities, so your not stuck with gambling only, but I have to say...\nI've been living here 12 years now & I gamble frequently as that's what locals do & ive been to all the casinos...some are better than others as far as how tight each casino has there machines & the Orleans ? You , the Palms, & Redrock casino have got to be the WORST & the tightest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When I say, the machines at these places \" DONT EVEN GIVE YOU THE ILLUSION YOUR WINNING\" would be an understatement !! I know better when I enter any of those 3 establishments, but I put money in anyway thinking maybe this time will be different , but it never is!! And I'm not the only one that feels that way...I hear other customers sitting at the machines playing saying the same thing & I say to them that I've been coming here for 12 years, & NOT ONCE HAVE I EVER WON ANYTHING! Not even a dime & all 3 places are supposed to be locals casinos which are a little looser than strip casinos cause they're banking on tourists not knowing this where they can take every dime from you & everyone leaves Vegas BROKE! But being a local , I've caught on to all your gimmicks & know your tight machines don't pay you anything...it's like a vacuum that sucks it all up , therefore is not fun for the customer cause there's never any kind of payout whatsoever! One night a few years ago when the Orleans used to give me a free night monthly, I lost $600 playing slots! I was so determined to win something that night, that I kept taking cash advances out on my cc $100 at a time ! Every machine I played on.... A Big fat zero! Nothing?? Orleans, you don't have a very good reputation out there w your casino...you may have decent reviews for your inexpensive rooms & amenities, but wouldn't it be nice if people were out there promoting to play at the Orleans cause you win ? Even if it's the illusion & you end up taking it back anyway, at least the customer had fun knowing it was paying them & the bells kept going off, they would know your machines pay instead of them being so tight, that you'd think a Jewish person owned the casino & controlled it !\nThat's my vent & how it's been for 12 years....not 1 time Orleans have you ever let me leave with even $20 more than what I started with! Today I was there for my free gift & had $10 free play. Lost that, plus I was down $80 of my money , but luckily won $50 of that back & cashed out with only being $30 down now & got the hell out of there ! That was  a 1st for me....won $50! Woo hoo
