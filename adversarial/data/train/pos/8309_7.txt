When I check out a new spot twice in one week, you know something is up!  Love everything about this place.\n\nLocation -\neat. is located on the corner of Carson and 7th street.  There's plenty of meter parking and it is tucked just far enough away from LV Blvd to be easy access.  It wouldn't be downtown if there weren't a few questionable characters hanging around, but this place is an oasis.  \n\nFood -\nFirst time I split the DWBLT with homemade chips (and the really good pickle is aptly named) and the Argula Salad with added chicken breast.  Although the upcharge for the chicken was a little $$, I can assure you it is worth your money.  This salad was very nicely done.  Fresh argula, asparagus, roast almonds and roasted tomatoes.  Definitely unique. Loved both, but I prefer a lighter lunch (although judging by some of my frequent lunch hangouts, you may be calling me a liar) so may not order the DWBLT again.  That sourdough bread is seriously delicious and seriously heavy.   \n\nSecond trip, I had the Banh Mi Chicken sandwich.  This thing was freaking awesome!  I just love jalapeno coleslaw especially when you throw some radishes in the mix!  Chips again because they are just that good.  I also stole a bite of the grilled cheese sandwich dipped in tomato soup.  Yum!\n\nService -\nBoth trips, service has been great.  The servers are hipster enough to prove you are downtown, but not so hipster they forget how to smile.  Love the open kitchen, the entire decor and just the vibe of this place.  It really is something special and further proof that downtown is worth revitalizing and worth a visit for lunch.
