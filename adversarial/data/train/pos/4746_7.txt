Omg.. first time at a Swenson's.  My daughter just moved to Ohio and said we had to find a Swensons.  I had no idea what it entailed but she said the food was good.  First of all, we don't really have drive in's anymore in CA.  Sonic is the closest thing. And the best thing about Sonic is their ice.  \n\nWe drove up and the young worker ran out to our car with a menu.  He told us to turn on our lights when we were ready.  We looked at the menu and I seriously couldn't decide what to get.  I didn't want a burger even though that's their thing.   I couldn't decide between the Sloppy Joe and the bologna sandwich.  Both were so inexpensive I could have ordered both and ate half of each but I didn't.  I got the sloppy joe and onion rings.  So glad I did because that sloppy joe was the best I've ever had.  And I've been eating sloppy joe's since I was a kid.  \nOnion rings were really good too.  My daughter and husband had the burgers, fries, and potato teezers, a yummy potato, cheese, jalape√±o concoction.  They enjoyed everything.  We all did.  \n\nThe absolute best part about Swensons is definitely the employees.  All of them are friendly and hardworking.  They don't walk anywhere, they run and they run fast.  They run to the cars and back every single time.   You can't be lazy or out of shape to work here.  No way!
