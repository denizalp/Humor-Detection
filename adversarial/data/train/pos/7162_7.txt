I should have believed all the bad reviews.  Came at 5:15pm and asked if they were open and if I could look around. They said yes and that they didn't close until 6.  They seemed welcoming. However every camper was locked.  Nobody was willing to help. There were 6 people lounging around doing nothing.   Guess they don't want to sell anything.  I'm leaving and going back to another dealer to buy tonight.\n\nIronically they have a sign posted that says to let them know if a salesperson was friendly and did a good job and they will give them a $5 bonus.  Based on my experience I suppose it never has to be paid out.
