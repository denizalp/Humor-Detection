We use yelp soooo much that I had to write about this.  \n\nWe went on a Thursday eve early.  It was not busy at all.  We ordered margherita pizza and wet pizza.  Took along time had to ask for tea and lemon.  Once the pizza was brought to our table it was Luke war, and looked as if it was sitting awhile.  I would think that a 900 degree oven would produce very HOT pizza.  Well that was not the case.  Kind of disappointed to horrible just bad.  Could have been so much better.  Soooo as to all the fellow yelpers if you go I hope your experience is better.  We won't be going again.  35 dollars too.  Very expensive.
