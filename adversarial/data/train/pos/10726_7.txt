I am a bonafide book junkie. Libraries are my mecca. But, I'm picky. \n\nGetting a SPL card was a cinch. I only needed one proof of residence, although I brought the recommended three, including a Netflix envelope. \n\nOnce I had my card, I was ready to explore. I headed first to the public computers that help you locate books... yes! With scraps of papers and mini-pencils handy, I was good to go, once I had selected a couple books to hunt down. \n\nSo far, so good.\n\nBut then the library got tricky. Running out of the alphabet before I had found my book. Turning into another section - from Fiction to Large Print. WTF? I decided to turn this hunt into more of a tour, so I wandered the aisles, studied the names of sections and eventually re-acquainted myself with the library system. \n\nDon't get me wrong. This isn't rocket science. It's also not pop rocks. \n\nHaving found my books and a couple DVDs, I proceeded to check out. Super easy, too. I can renew online? Bonus!\n\nMy first trip to the library was GREAT. \n\nThen the second one came. The library had NONE of the books I came looking for, and I was prepared to find AT LEAST ONE of the books on my list of 5. Nope. So I put some \"on hold\" for me and wandered about, very disappointed. That's when I began to dislike this library. None of my books? Really? \n\nThis library isn't browsing-friendly like others I have seen. Even the ol' library in Stillwater, Oklahoma was more comfortable than this one. In fact, I miss that ol' library, with its shelves of poetry, psychology, magazines and literature... so easy to find, so easy to browse, so easy to sit for hours and read. \n\nI couldn't leave SPL fast enough. On my way out, a man working (volunteering?) there showed me how to use the self-service check-out system. Nice! He was a friendly ol' man, who assumed I knew NOTHING about self-service machines... and probably doubted my ability to read, for he explained step-by-step what I needed to do in order to check out my books. At least the lesson was in-depth enough for me to fully comprehend - and then some. \n\nSo, the next time I went to SPL - to pick up the books I had put on hold (score!) - I used the self-service check-out. I was in and out in like 7.46 minutes. \n\nSo, let's recap:\n*SLP has books!\n*SLP doesn't always have the books you want. (Sad face)\n*You can renew online, create a profile and share reviews. \n*You can place books on-hold from any computer, if you're logged into your account.\n*People working there are friendly.\n*It's easy to get a card. Just bring in your SRP bill, like I did. \n*It's not an easy place to browse.\n*SPL doesn't make you feel like you want to spend hours there.\n*There are private rooms; just not sure how you reserve them.\n*There are monthly activities at the library - but mostly about old-fart diets and how to use Microsoft Word. \n*There's FREE parking in THE SHADE! \n*You can check your items out yourself, with their self-service check-out machine. \n*It's pretty ugly inside - brown, biege, dull and lifeless.
