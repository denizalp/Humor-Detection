We came early because we wanted to be prompt, turned out we didn't need to as we didn't get our tickets or any information until an hour later.  I signed up as a Yelp Elite for a food judging challenge, what I got was a lot of confusion, rude vendors who didn't even know what Yelp was, and a disorganization from management as where to go (no signs). \n\nThey even ran out of water, so I had useless drink tickets for a couple hours.  The water and soda station had warm beverages.  If you were in the wrong line, you were out of luck.\n\nThe vendors didn't have a clue what Yelp was, either ill informed or just didn't care as they were probably losing money.  If this was a Yelp Challenge I would hope they would know what Yelp is and what we are doing.  We kept getting turned away, either them saying no samples, or get in line with the rest of the others, who are you kind of deal? \n\nI just think better organization is needed, more communication, and better line management is needed.  The beer garden didn't even have it on tap as drinks were on cans.  I had one instance which really summarized this whole experience, there's no VIP line so that was useless.  Some vendors need an attitude check as they were plain rude.  We were even warned of this behavior by the organizer.  This was supposed to be a good experience, but turned out not to be a good one overall.  \n\nI'm just happy we were able to sample some samples.  Either something needs to be done next year (if there is one) or there will be a lot of unhappy people wanting refunds.
