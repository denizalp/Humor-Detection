I would be so interested in peeking into the apartment of the neighbors above me. Ever since the remodles were completed you can hear EVERYTHING that goes on up above you. You can hear the stomping around, things being slammed against walls\/floors, people peeing, you can even hear the floors squeaking when they're having sex; which is actually funny to listen to how quickly its over.  \n\nThe remodeling has seemed to make everything echo so if you live below with anyone above you then you don't get much rest. So be sure to ask to an upper unit but then remember that we can hear EVERYTHING you're doing
