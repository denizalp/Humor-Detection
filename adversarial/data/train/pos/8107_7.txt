I have one word to describe my experience. WEIRD.\n\nFor those that want to know, \"Tambayan\" in english means a place to hang out where you can eat and just relax.\n\nSo me and my party of 7 show up a little after 9 pm on tuesday 5\/15\/18. Found the door to be locked. As we all talked about going to the Thai Bbq place next door, all of a sudden, some dude opens up the door and motions for us to come in. We all give each other a puzzled look and went on in. Now if it was only a few of us I would have hesitated and probably would have said, \"No thanks!\". Since we were a big group we decided to go for it since we all wanted to see if the pork sisig was good based on the pic we saw.\n\nSo we sit down and are given menus by the same guy that opened the door. He said that our server was gonna be here soon. A few minutes later, some lady shows up from the outside and takes our order. Come to find out that the guy that opened the door and sat us was also the cook.\n\nSo we order Pork Sisig, Fish Balls, and Lechoh Kawali. \n\nThe Pork Sisig($13) came out on its traditional sizziling platter. It was made up of pork, onions, garlic, and topped off with a slice of lemon to squeeze on. Was sorely disappointed in this dish. The good kind of pork sisig that I am used to also has chopped jalapenos and should have a freshly cracked egg on top of it for you to mix in while the meat is still sizzling. Overall taste was just ok. Did not meet my expectations and it seemed to be overpriced to me.\n\nThe Fish Balls($8.00) were also not he kind that im used to. These are deep fried and soft and chewy with nothing in the middle. These ones we got were stuffed with some kind of meat that I could not recognize. I only ended up eating just one ball. At least the pickled cucumber dressing it came with gave it some life but this dish was not to my liking.\n\nThe Lechon Kawali($12.00) was probably the only thing decent that we had. Its basically sliced pork belly deep fried until crispy. Comes with a sauce to dip in (Mang Tomas for all you true Flip food connoisseurs). In this case they gave us a sauce that they said they made in house. It was just ok.\n\nFor dessert we wanted to order halo-halo but they said they didnt have all the ingredients so we ended up just getting Turon($5.00). It is plantain sprinkled with brown sugar with lanka (jackfruit) placed on top and then rolled up in an eggroll wrapper then deep fried until crispy. It was just ok.\n\nI almost forgot to mention that when we got our food, another random dude appeared out of nowhere and started singing karaoke. So what got was dinner AND a show. Dude that sang was decent. Sang everything from Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together\" to Josh Turner's \"Your Man\". \n\nSo overall, even though the whole thing seemed weird, I thought it was just ok. Given the facts that the place seemed kind of shady and their hours are not accurate, I dont think I will be coming back here. Plus I have had better sisig from at least 3 other places. Hit me up if you want to know those places.\n\nYelp 2018 Review #45\n714 overall
