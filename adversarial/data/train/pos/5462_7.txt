I'm talking about B R U N C H !!!!!\n\nI'm giving this 4 Stars to bring up the average and I think everyone here is pretty harsh about the MORE Buffet, three things:\n1) Its ONLY $17!  \n2) Its unlimited champagne and mimosas!\n3) Its unlimited champagne and mimosas!\n\nYes, you're gonna hear about the Wynn or the Bellagio being so much fricken better blah blah blah, but you're also gonna pay more than twice as much!  Sure a BMW M3 is better than my Ford Mustang and maybe my wife's ass isn't as small and tight as Jessica Alba's(before her kid) or Angelina Jolie's(before her 12 kids), but thats just life and you enjoy what you have and can afford.  \n\nIf you're objective is eat enough decent food for to last till dinner time, get drunk off your ass, and then head down to the nice pool area and bask in the sun and look at beautiful people(and some realy ugly ones) for the rest of the afternoon, then the MORE Buffet is your starting place.\n\nCaesars has a nicer brunch for $33, but I was too hungover and quesy(AVOID the $1 Margaritas at Bills Gamblin Hall & Casino) to enjoy any mimosas or champagne.  Paris's Brunch is also really good for just under $30.\n\nGood Bang for the Buck! :)
