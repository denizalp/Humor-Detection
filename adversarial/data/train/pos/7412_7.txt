I love doing these overall reviews of cities.  Like I said in the past, I don't really know who reads my reviews but I write on yelp for myself.  It was a good way for me to document my trips and have a way of going back and sending recommendations to friends.\n\nOverall city of Montreal was a fun experience.  I despised all of the traffic and the lack of parking but I did enjoy the French feel of the city.
