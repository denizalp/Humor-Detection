I hate to be one of the only bad reviews but.... I was completely and utterly dissatisfied with my experience here tonight. \n\nFirst and foremost the service was great. Our server and the sushi chef were both attentive and informative. But that doesn't come close to making up for the food...\n\nWe ordered two of the 14.95$ deals. They came with a Nevada Roll, Alaskan roll, white tiger roll, calamari steak, crunchy rice with spicy tuna, and baked mussels. The only thing I found edible was the white tiger roll. Everything else I couldn't even attempt to eat. The Nevada Roll was soggy and the Alaskan roll was drenched in mayonnaise. The calamari steak was so rubbery and the baked mussels weren't even warm... They too were rubbery.\n\nLike I said I hate being one of the bad reviews on here but I will never return. Not to mention I'm totally horrified I may have gotten food posioning..  I've been sick for the past hour.
