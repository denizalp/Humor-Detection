Tutors were late to log in online and missed appointments. The company also charges you a $200 deposit and has questionable business practices....when we asked for our deposit back they made us wait 2 weeks despite the fact we were assured that we would immediately be credited our deposit upon cancellation.....obviously we then cancelled and we will go ahead and look for more ethical tutoring services. Save yourselves the hassle and find somewhere else to get tutoring for your child.
