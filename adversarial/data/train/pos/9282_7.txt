The Wicked Spoon is a fraud. It's all glitz and glam. Every time I take a trip to Vegas I always have a buffet once during the trip. This time we decided on the Cosmos. I was excited because people have said great things like, the food is more on the restaurant quality and things of that such so I believed it. \n\nSo here we go. \nIt's dinner time and it's time to get down and dirty. \nAfter scouting the opposition freshly out, it's time to go to war. \n\nRound 1) Starting with the Asian cuisine, mediocre  sushi at best. Dim sum very lackluster, shrimps and crawfish overcooked. But we remain optimistic maybe I was just trippin.\n\nRound 2) Fight! I make my way on to the meats, had some Prime Rib, fried chicken, sausage. The prime rib lacked flavor, needed salt to say the least. The Fried chicken was actually good, Coke back a couple times with the mini basket. Sausage was too salty. I also had some Paella and that was terrible. Shepherds pie wasn't good either. And yeah that's the theme of my dinner.\n\nRound 3) Hands down was the best round. Every Vegas buffet serves every flavor of gelato and this was no exception. Gelato was good. They had a nice selection of sweets. But the dessert wasn't the reason why I came to the buffet.\n\nSo unfortunately The Wicked Spoon does not get my stamp of approval. If it wasn't for the 2-1 deal I received on my flight in then I wouldn't have been so nice writing this. (United airlines should get the credit for that) The food in pictures look great. But it doesn't taste anywhere what it looks like and that was disappointing. Maybe I should have came in drunk or hungover...? But I got what I deserved by thinking that Wicked Spoon could be better than Bachannel. Wrong!!! How foolish of me.
