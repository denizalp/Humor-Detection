What kind of retard spends $60 on a steak? \n\n^^^ This kind (noob.yelp.com)\n\n             \nThis place is SOOOOOOOOOO good. I have nothing negative to say whatsoever about the food. The restaurant design\/ambiance is on point and so are the waiters\/waitresses. I like their waiting room (piano, drinks, seats, TVs, and all). \n\nSeriously though, I could eat their steak for breakfast, lunch, dinner, AND dessert. That good. Trust.
