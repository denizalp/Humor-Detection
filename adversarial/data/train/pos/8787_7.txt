Wonderful hotel. I come to Vegas quite often and have stayed and all the hotels on the strip over the years. The Cosmopolitans rooms are absolutely amazing. So spacious and comfortable and they are quick to come up and fix a light bulb, or whatever needs to be taken care of. Also have some great deals sometimes. Very much recommend.
