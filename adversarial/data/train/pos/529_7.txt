I never in my life thought I would eat here after the Firefly disaster, but I have to give it to the owners, you have made a comeback. I have tried the chicken, the fish, the shrimp, and the pork, and liked them all. Chips and salsa- BOMB. Corn salad, 6 stars. Even the cilantro rice was impressive. \nWant to know my only complaint? $3.50 for an overstuffed street taco is not ok, ever. $20 for me to have lunch alone, $35 for a Togo order for 2 people to have tacos? Seems a little outrageous to me. \nHowever, if I like your food I am willing to spend the money, because I keep returning. And have no intentions of stopping anytime soon. \nI actually want tacos as I write this. \nThe d√©cor is semi day of the dead type. The service was great. The food, well I have yet to try something I do not like. \nI expected less from this place. It's nice to have a place exceed your desires. \nBut there is always going to be that little voice in the back of my head saying, \"I hope this doesn't get me sick\". Maybe I am harsh, and I should have more love for the Vegas natives such as myself. I consider it realistic. \nPlease don't let me down! \nNext time, I plan on trying the enchiladas. I will keep you posted.
