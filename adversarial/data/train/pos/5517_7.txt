The charm of an ol school diner in a strip mall. The uniforms alone will transfer you to time when customer service was golden and pride is n the cooking. \n\nWelcome to the best Bfast place your not waiting in line for. Seriously. My first visit ever was on a lazy Sunday and I figured it was too late for a bfast place so I kinda wanted a burger. Walked in, saw the menu and \n\" WHOA y'all have bfast, y'all still serving bfast?!?\"  \nIn perfect diner fashion the lady winked and told me, \" just for you, we can\" HOOKED After a few visits I was told about a \"basted\" egg. This last visit my server noticed I put my eggs on the hshbrns and eat it that way. She immediately told me that I can order it that way so I don't have to do anything but eat. THE SERVICE IS.....WOW Bacon so thick I use it as a tortilla\/shovel. \n\nThe burgers are really good too. I like the fiesta version with the grilled green chilie. Veggies are fresh and the meat is good. Xtra crispy fries were done right. \n\nAND AND the pies ,yes I said pies,  are amazing as well. Slices are priced out,  perfectly, based on the size. Yea, I'll take a 1\/3 of a pie please and , yea, ya need too git yo own....*burp*
