Brugo's serves the best spaghetti and meatballs my husband has ever eaten in a restaurant, and we have lived and eaten  in NYC for over 30 years.  It is outstanding!!  I order the individual thin-crust mushroom pizza which is delicious-incredibly fresh. We shared an order of BBQ chicken wings which were also fabulous.  But they REALLY need to offer hand-wipes!!\n\nThe room is lovely and the staff is incredibly attentive and friendly.  We ate there 3 times while staying here, and the staff remembered us and welcomed us back.  We've sent a lot of people there for the sp. and meatballs and everyone has agreed that they are the best they've ever eaten in a restaurant.  Definitely the best restaurant in Carefree.
