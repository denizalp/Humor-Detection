I wrote the following email to the ReStore...........................\"I'm not sure if you've heard this before or to WHOM I should be directing my comments but I have been a LONG-time supporter of the Re-Stores....all over NC. HOWEVER, whoever you have doing your pricing lately (like over the past couple of years) REALLY needs to get a grip on things!!!  I have seen some ABSOLUTELY outrageous prices that have actually made me laugh. As a regular to my 2 nearest ReStores every, single weekend, I have drastically switched up my weekend routine. I rarely hit up ANY of your ReStores anymore because they aren't what they used to be - the prices are ridiculous and I've recently started taking pictures of these \"jokes\" that I find....thinking, \"they've GOT to be kidding, right?\" For example, I went in to your new location at University and had to pull some folks over to me to make sure I was seeing the below correctly. \"Is this for real?\" They couldn't believe it either, we had a good laugh and both left. \n\n(********** The photos I attached in this email to the ReStore were ones I took of a pricetag of $1300 EACH for small bedside tables and then the matching dresser & it's pricetag of $2500!!! ************ Insane. Period.)\n\nThe ReStore really needs to come back down to reality with their pricing so you can actually MOVE things out of there a little quicker. I'm wondering if I'm the only one who thinks this but in asking around, I'm clearly not alone and I'm sure this cannot be the first you have heard of this. Anyway, I've always loved the ReStores and what they do but I feel like folks are starting to turn eslewhere for their \"good deals\" (since clearly the good deals are few and far between at the ReStores these days) and I wanted you to know what a long time customer thinks. Thanks so much.\" \n\n********** The photos I attached in this email to the ReStore were a pricetag of $1300 EACH for small bedside tables and then the matching dresser & it's pricetag of $2500!!! ************ Insane.
