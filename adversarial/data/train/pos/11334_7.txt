I really wonder if the people that own and operate this place have ever seen that Seinfeld episode where Elaine is getting her nails done. Anytime I go to one of these nail places it's exactly like that. You KNOW they're talking about you. \"Look at this bitches ugly ass feet! Can you believe how fat her toes are? God damn, do you think she knows what a pumice stone is?\" \n\n I didn't pay for an Aveda pedicure (and there's NOTHING like an Aveda pedicure, ladies). I think you really get what you pay for here. Mani \/ Pedi combo was $42. They do a decent enough job --- even though they talk shit about your feet or whatever. We'll see how the polish holds up.\n\nAlso, not really important but I'm pretty sure the Asians who named this place didn't really mean to put the \"S\" on the end of  \"Nails\". It even says so on their receipts. Talk about a typo. Whooops!\n\nOh, and yay me.... this was my 100th review!
