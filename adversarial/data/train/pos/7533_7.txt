Ajimi Sushi just recently opened at the corner of Yonge and Davisville, in the same spot where Haru Zushi used to me.  They have an a la carte menu, an all-you-can-eat lunch for $11.99, and an all-you-can-eat dinner for $18.99.  They are currently offering an additional 20% off those prices as part of their Grand Opening.\n\nMy friend and I went for the all-you-can-eat lunch.   Ajimi boasts a 138 item all-you-can-eat menu, but apparently this is only for dinner.  For the lower priced lunch you miss out on some items and dessert is not included.  The selection was still decent though as we sampled edamame, mango salad, avocado salad, miso soup, gyoza, teriyaki salmon, calamari, tofu, sushi pizza, a chicken skewer, and a variety of rolls.  The service was very fast, but it bothered me that the server did not take a second to tell us what she was putting in front of us as she brought it out.  When you order a wide-variety of items like this, especially maki rolls, it is not readily apparent what`s what.\n\nThe food was decent, some things better than others of course, but all in all a good deal for lunch.   Not spectacular, but good value for sure.
