It's glamorous, it's a pyramid, it's shining a beam towards the sky, and I have never felt so insulted as a hotel resident. As of the writing of this review, the issue has yet to be resolved, despite numerous calls to the hotel front desk. I came here for a business meeting, and before meeting a soul from the airport to grabbing my keycard, I was met with a half filled shotglass of ketchup rudely hanging from our door handle and a murder-like scene with ketchup all in front of the door. As appalling as this was, I called the front desk for prompt cleaning of this debacle, which occurred after an hour of wait.\n\nHowever, when I returned back to my room later that evening, I found the same ketchup cup on the door handle with another pool of insulting ketchup on the floor. This has been brought up to the managerial staff and I have yet to hear back from them.\n\nAs for the rest of the amenities, the TV was not working, there is no mini-fridge, but the beds are incredibly comfortable and I had the most difficult job of waking up at 5am after going to a social event that ended 4 hours prior.\n\nI have yet to feel so targeted and insulted at such a well-known hotel and unless this issue can be rectified in a timely manner.
