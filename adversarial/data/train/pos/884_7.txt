***You used to be able to only get fresh Garrett popcorn in Chicago, but you can now find it in other cities like New York (next to Penn Station) or at this shop in Las Vegas (located among Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops); Garrett's Chicago mix combines salty cheese popcorn with sweet and evenly coated caramel popcorn; it is not the healthiest snack, but it is also tasty and addictive; like other Garrett popcorn shops, the popcorn here is a tad pricey (especially if you opt for one of their souvenir tins)***\n\nI have not parked at Planet Hollywood, but I imagine they offer complimentary valet and self parking like the other major casinos and hotels on The Strip.
