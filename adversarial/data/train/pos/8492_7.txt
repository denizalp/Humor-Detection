I absolutely LOVE this location! It's very clean, neat, and well laid out (yes, even throughout the coveted items during the semi-annual sale). I can always find what I'm looking for (even if I only go in to make a payment on my credit card, and not looking for anything specific, haha). The staff here is extremely personable, friendly, and even know me by name (not sure if I should be proud of that or not, lol. Perhaps I shop here too much? Naaah.)\n\nThis location, to be honest, is my absolute favorite location! I love the fact that it's at Kierland\/Scottsdale Quarter area (more shopping? Yes, please!) This Victoria's Secret always seems to have all the cool \"Angel\" freebies (gotta sign up to be an Angel credit card holder... but careful, it's dangerously addicting), and all the brand new items. Score! \n\nThe best part is that, if for whatever reason they don't have whatever it is you're looking for, the awesome staff will give you exceptional customer service and order it online for you, having it shipped straight to your house, and get this -- FREE shipping! Woot woot! Awesomeness! Gotta love VS! And, of course, love all the staff that makes each shopping experience enjoyable... thanks, ladies!
