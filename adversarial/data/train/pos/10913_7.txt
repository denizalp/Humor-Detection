Exactly what you'd want and expect from a local bar.  Wings are great, beer selection is venue-appropriate.  Prices right on target.  Bartenders vary significantly, with Autumn being the single most stunning creature ever to walk on God's earth.\n\nNoisy and boisterous at times, not a great family \/ date spot.  And that's why it's awesome!
