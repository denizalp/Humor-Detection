A few months back I moved into \"ghetto ford\" apartments off southern. I thought Apache junction was bad, but this place seems that they bussed everyone in from south central....not kidding. Not only the environment, but the management is a total JOKE! Years ago the management was awesome (from what I've heard) but the management has changed and literally is run like a prison. My buddy who has a sticker on his car, was towed! He was allowed to park there because he had a parking sticker. When we asked the office about it, they literally said \"old mustangs aren't allowed\", WHAT! insanity! Did I mention the roaches? EVERYWHERE!! They claim they use Burns pest control, but we all know how much of a joke those guys are. Besides the roaches there are these huge green beetles that hiss at you, and fly towards you almost to attack. Please do not live here! Don't waste your time.
