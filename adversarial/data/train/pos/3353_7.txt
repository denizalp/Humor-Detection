I have to say I was very scared for my first experience with a Chiropractor. I pictured a Frankenstein man coming over and snapping my neck in half. Yes... that is where my brain went. I'm happy to say that I was very wrong. I had such a great experience. From the lovely ladies at the front desk, the fun office, and office atmosphere, to my Chiropractor himself, Mike. He was full of personality, asked me tons of questions, and put me at ease. When I came in for my adjustment he made me feel the same. I haven't met the other Chiropractors here and I am sure they are great but I say come see Mike. I look forward to feeling better and I am glad my fellow employees recommended me to this place.
