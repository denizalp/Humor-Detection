$70 for my iPhone 5S screen replacement when the iPhone 5S was still somewhat new. \nI dropped off my phone and then picked it up in about 1.5 hours. All of the employees were extremely nice and answered all questions that I had. \nFast forward to about a 2 weeks later, I dropped my phone off of my bed onto my carpeted floor. It was very low impact and should not have damaged my phone, however, the screen went black. I brought the phone back in with the receipt and they fixed it for free. Turns out the wires just needed to be put on tighter (or something like that lol). \nThey also sell cell phone accessories and fix other electronics. \n\nI am not too big on their location. If it is your first time make sure you do not miss it as Paradise is a 1 way street so if you do miss it, you have to go all the way back around. They have some razor flags placed by the entrance to help you so just stay in the left lane...
