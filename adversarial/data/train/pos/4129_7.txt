This is one of the new casinos, but even though it could be amazing, it comes off as being cheap instead of classy.  Upon entering you get a scent like at ENCORE, but instead of a a pleasant, soothing one, it's a more strong odor reminded me of a stripper with lots of baby oil.\n\nThere are a lot of youngers here partying it up.  They must have lots of deals on hotels.  This place has one of the highest ratio of douchebags and skanks.\n\nThis is the only place i got carded for gambling.
