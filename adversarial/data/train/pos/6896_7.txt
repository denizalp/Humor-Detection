There are not many places in town where you get to order off of the periodic table.  So, this is my go-to spot when I feel like drinking barium and taking a ride on an x-ray machine.\n\nThe waiting room is a bit like a cattle call (especially on holidays, geez).  But, once you get past that stage, it's pretty smooth sailing.  \n\nThe technicians are pretty friendly and make jokes to ease the weirdness of the situation (hey, let's irradiate you now!).  The doctors, however, well, they need some patient interaction refreshers.  In and out in 30 minutes is a good thing, as well.
