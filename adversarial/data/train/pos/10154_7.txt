There's ice cream here. So it's got that going for it. \n\nThe employees aren't the friendliest, which is a drag when your kid is in full on OMFG ICE CREAM mode. Don't bring me down, groos.\n\nAlso it doesn't appear that there's a bathroom? Sticky messy melty stuff and nowhere to wash it off.\n \nCool. \nCool cool cool.
