Had lots of fun day drinking & playing Scrabble. Didn't try the food yet so stay tuned for that.  The food we saw looked yummy. The fried pickles & the burgers looked awesome. The atmosphere is fun & chill. There were a few Dbags running around but I don't think they'll stick on a Friday\/Saturday nights. Just sayin'! So it may be a safe haven amongst the Scottsdale scene on the weekends. Cross your fingers that only the good peeps stick.
