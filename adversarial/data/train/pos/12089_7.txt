This review is for the full-service car wash, not the gas station. I remember when I first moved to Las Vegas almost 7 years ago.  This Terrible Herbst came highly recommended and the overall wash was sparkling clean.  This place was popular and packed on the weekends.  A full interior\/exterior cleaning would take about 40 minutes.  But times have changed.  I don't know what happened over the years.  Now, a wash takes about 20 minutes and it's not as busy as it used to be.  The quality of their detail has changed over the years.  I found multiple areas outside and inside my car that has been missed. Overall, a full-service car wash at this Terrible Herbst is not Fabulous.  Prices start around $20 for an interior\/exterior wash.  A full-service car wash at this Terrible Herbst is quick.  I'll give them that.  But it's not as detailed as it used to be.
