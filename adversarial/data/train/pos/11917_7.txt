Came here last night after leaving the murder of douches (shoutout to ben!) at Loco Patron. This place was a much needed change from the fratty atmosphere of LP.\nI've always seen this place when I used to work at Pure, but never found the time to make it over. I'm so glad I finally did. This place is cute and I'm sad the old owners left because I knew them from Pure and they were awesome!\nSo my friend and hit this place up around 10 because our party of 15 had dwindled to us (You can tell who the real alcoholics are!).  This place had a few people in it, and we decided to hit up the bar.  The guy Josh was awesome!  He is my old co-workers roommate and was really friendly.  I always had a bottle of Sunshine in front of me!  And he made us a variety of shots.  Love when bartenders take the wheel and just do everything they can to get you drunk!  You were awesome Josh!  I hope to be back here soon!
