I really wanted to like this place, but I totally had a 1 star experience. \nIncorrect items where given to me. I couldn't eat them because it I'm a vegetarian and they gave me meat, even though it was clearly stated to them, \"no meat\"\nThe cheese quesadilla was boring. I ordered it with beans and they didn't give me beans, either.\nThey were out of chamango... that was disappointing. \nTheir guac was probably the least favorite guac that I have ever had.\n\nI will not go back.
