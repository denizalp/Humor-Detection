I found Burland here on Yelp (thanks, guys!) when searching for a jewelry appraiser. While a generally responsible person, I recently dropped my rings in a pool and realized (after my sister found them) that I really needed an updated appraisal to ensure that if I actually had lost the rings, my insurance would pay out the full value. Why does it always take a scare to get me to do the responsible thing? Sigh. \n\nI called earlier on a weekday to get more information and the woman who answered was incredibly helpful. I said I was interested in an appraisal and she promptly let me know the hours the appraiser was available and how much it would cost. Given that you often have to fish for information, I highly appreciated how upfront she was. \n\nI ended up going into the store on a Saturday around noon and was immediately greeted by a very friendly couple, who owned the store. The woman immediately noticed how dirty my rings were and asked if she could clean them - I loved how willing she was to help before even knowing if I was going to buy something. \n\nThe owner got me started right away by making copies of my existing diamond certificate and previous appraisal (helpful hint: make sure to bring any similar paperwork you have). Then, the appraiser came out and let me know that he could take care of the appraisal in 45 minutes. I decided to go shopping at Old Navy and come back. \n\nWhen I got back, the appraiser was done, as promised. (Score another one for honesty!). He walked me through all of his paperwork in detail and then sent me on my way with a smile. \n\nWhat a great local shop run by genuine and skilled people! I would definitely not hesitate to come back for my future jewelry needs and I highly recommend Burland to others looking to get an appraisal.
