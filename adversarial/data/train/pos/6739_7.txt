Fast service, food came really quick and empty plates were cleared from our table promptly. However, the quality of the food wasn't super impressive or memorable and the lunch menu seemed a bit limited. One of my favourite things to order whenever I go to a sushi place is spicy salmon roll, so I've had a lot of spicy salmon rolls in my life lol but the spicy salmon rolls here were probably the worst I've ever had anywhere. They were all just filled with mostly \"crisp\" and hardly any salmon as if they were trying to conserve\/cheap out on ingredients during the lunch hours when people aren't paying as much. Would probably not come again..
