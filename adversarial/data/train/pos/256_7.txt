So happy to see that WK has found a new home! I was heartbroken after they left their old space, and really appreciate management reaching out to message old customers via the Yelp reviews to let us know about the new location.\n\nThe most important info: they have 80 flavors, but garlic parm is the best. They now offer chicken strips in addition to the chicken wings and pig wings (not always available), order by the pound. New location is a counter inside of a bar, must be 21 to enter- dine in or take out. Friendly service, food made to order, can call ahead to minimize wait time.\n\nThough the garlic parm has my heart, I tried the Jamaican slam and really enjoyed that- the medium garlic was medium but had not even a hint of garlic? Found the wings to be smaller and less meaty than past location. The wings are sold by the pound but did not seem to be that weight. One pound order, per menu, is at least 7 pieces- my order had 8, each pound is $8, works out to $1\/wing which is on par with most places in town.\n\nDropping my review down a star- don't know if it's an \"absence makes the heart grow fonder\" thing or what, but I just remember this place being better. It's now a bit out of the way for me, and I will keep them in mind when a wing craving hits but won't be going out of my way to get out here regularly.
