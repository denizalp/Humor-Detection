An old afghani restaurant that became an indian restaurant and now back to persian cuisine ! The food is so lovely, the decor and ambiance is very warm ! Some items were missing but they were able to accomodate with nice alternative .. The interior of this place is small cozy and just too lovely , you just want to eat there and stay for longgg :)! I recommend and i will go again for sure
