A little taste of San Diego, CA in the middle of Sin City. \n\nWhen buffets and typical franchise fare ain't hittin' it, drive the rental car over to the far South end of this strip mall on Nellis Blvd and get your Carne Asada fix. \n\nThey got it all and a salsa bar included. Sorry, the hot sauce is self serve, no tiny pre-packaged plastic tubs thrown into your bag. \n\nThe folks working here could use a little more personality, in the kitchen there's a stack of tortillas 3 feet high, the burritos are smaller than what I see in SoCal, the prices are about the same and the joint is cleaner than most. \n\nIt helps they put up photos of the food on the overhead menu. \n\nThe ignorant Gringos who frequent Taco Bell have no idea what to order.\n\nI was shocked, my relatives who live 3 miles from here for the past 15 years never tried this place before. \n\nI was ready to throw a spicy carrot slice at them.
