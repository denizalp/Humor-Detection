Finally an Asian restaurant in LV that appears to be clean and with good food! I have to give the location alone 5 stars because it's in Henderson (outside of the Galleria mall) which is in my neck of the woods.  There was quite a bit of a wait our first time but then we learned our lesson the second time and beat the dinner rush on a Friday night by arriving just before 5:45 pm.\n\nDon't let the fact that there are no visible hoods above each table fool ya! It doesn't get holy smokey in there because they've forked the dough on some really super powerful venting system! Now the service, well they are beyond fully staffed and definitely didn't skimp out in this area because we never had to wait for anything. You sit down and BAM!...your sides are there.  There is a waiter who checks on you often and takes your ongoing orders, and another person who clears your table from the plates and changes your grill.\n\nFood...well it's an AYCE dinner for $19.99 which is a heck of a bargain! From the 4 -5 variety of side dishes, rice paper and\/or radish paper, appetizer and meat variety...there is quite a selection. We loved the crispy squid legs from the appetizer menu, finding ourselves ordering it throughout the night. The miso pork belly, bulgogi, Cajun shrimp head on, and calamari were are choices which were all equally tasty. Now for dessert they offer a n ice cream macaron for an addition $3.95....and oh so worth it! I had the coffee flavor while the hubby had the green tea.\n\nDefinitely a fave in my book!
