I'll set the scene: My best friend and I standing outside The Buffet, wondering if we could really justify spending that much for said buffet. Two lovely women approach and ask if we're thinking about going in. Us: \"Yes!\" The lovely ladies: \"We have two tickets that we won, and we're on our way to the airport, so want to pretend we're together and get a free dinner?\" Us: \"Yes!\"\n\nSo my friend, also African-American, and myself followed our two new, caucasian 'Aunts' into The Buffet for our free dinner. The Wynn Buffet...bringing America together since 2015! \n\nAnyway, had we paid, I'm pretty sure I'd still think just as highly of it. I can't say that it was the best (I'm still searching for that), but it was definitely good...might I say great? Okay, I'll say it, it was pretty great!\n\nThere's something for everyone, even my friend who swore he didn't like prime rib but made more trips to the prime rib table than ought to be allowed. I, for one, ate my weight in prime rib AND sushi, so I can't judge.
