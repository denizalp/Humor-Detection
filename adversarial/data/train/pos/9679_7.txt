This was my first time attending Yelp Goes Gatsby. However, I've been to other 1920s-themed events and they are always a lot of fun. \n\nThere were a lot of Yelpers here but there was also ample space. The ballroom would have been enough by itself but there were also several vendors in the hallway. It was great to see so many local business come together to support a great cause. I didn't get to sample everything because there was just so much. However, the bites from the Hilton, The Cellar, Verde, and the samples from the beverage vendors were all quite tasty. \n\nI loved the effort that everyone put into making this come off as a 20s party. Many of the vendors were dressed in period attire, there was a Charlie Chaplin lookalike, cigarette girls (handing out candy cigarettes), swing music, and even swing dancing lessons. Of course. we Yelpers also got in on it and rocked some gangster and flapper threads.\n\nThis event was phenomenal. I even ran into a few people that I know from outside the Yelposphere so that was an added bonus. Can't wait to do this again!
