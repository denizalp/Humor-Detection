Show up at 5:54 and the car wash is closed.... When it closes at 6 complete bs I drove 30 min thru traffic to get my car cleaned I drive for work and need a clean car so now I need to go pay for a wash when I already pay monthly... Pretty garbage if you ask me now tomorrow I'm gonna cancel this and never return. Note it takes 6 min to run the car thru.... You have the perfect name for your establishment TERRIBLE! That's the service I get at 90% of your gas stations considering I.drive 5000 miles a month in this city that's a good chunk of Change you won't see from me and I'll be passing on the knowledge to the 100s of other drivers we have.
