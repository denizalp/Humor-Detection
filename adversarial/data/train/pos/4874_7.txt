Guy walks into a bar.  That is also a guitar store.  That is also a live music venue.  That is also the only place I've ever seen that is a solid combination of all three. (Never been to McCabe's in Santa Monica, but this is along those lines, on a regional, i.e. smaller, scale.)   Right on Main, just across from and down the hill a bit from Kent Stage.  They don't have a real sign up, just yet, having moved their location slightly, but it is easy enough to find.\n\nThe middle of the store is a sweeping, wooden bar, behind which you'll find a whole bunch of beers.  Turn around after you've been served a cold one, and spy a small stage, then a long wall filled with sweet, locally grown guitars, all from the bench of Woody James.  The Les Paulmosts are pretty damned sweet, for a fraction of what the Kalamazoo animals put out.  When I have a few hours I'll return for a strum and a wheedle and report more fully.\n\nAmps, drums, a whole bunch of fun stuff.  The day we were there I rough-estimated about two hundred or so years of experience at work in the store and on the adjacent tech bench\/lutherie.  \n\nLive music a couple times a week, nearly always free, on the stage.  Cold beer, any old time.  New and used guitars and amps just begging for a new home.  A blessedly small quantity of rock memorabilia on the walls.  Have another beer, then take a second, more loving look at that Gold Top.  How many guitars do you need?  One more.\n\nOh, and their \"OHIO\" logo is evocatively sweet:  Peace signs on the ends, a rifle with a daisy in its barrel in the middle.
