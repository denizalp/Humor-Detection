So we went to this place for new year's based on multiple great reviews.  Made a reservation for 6pm, no issue.  However when we arrived, we were informed that it was a fixed menu, which honestly was pretty over priced. This was not told to us at the time of reservation.  We asked if we could just order off the regular menu since the place was pretty empty, answer was no.\n\n Decided to stay anyways due to great reviews on food quality.  The fixed menu was not good, I would give it 0\/10.  Poor choices all around for almost every course of 8.  They didn't even include a roll!  We had to order additional rolls beyond what we were served just to get something decent. \n\nI will say the rolls we ordered were pretty good, but the overall experience was just really bad.  If I was a jerk I would call my credit card company to reverse the charge since it was just such a poor experience.
