Stopped in for a quick bite, we were in the area and starving lol. Babette was our server and she was amazing! She was very friendly, funny, attentive and more. Quick on refills, recommend newer items on the menu and let us know that day was $3 pizookie. Food came out fast and tasted great. Highly recommend this location and ask for Babette you won't be disappointed!
