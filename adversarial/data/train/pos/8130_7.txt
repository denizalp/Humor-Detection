To give you a little background, I LOATHE carryout.  If I'm going to put on pants and leave the house, I want to be taken care of, not turn right around and drive home to eat and then have to clean up after myself.  Don't get the enjoyment of carryout.  Husband loves it.  HATE it.\n\nThat said, Thai Thai is the only Thai restaurant from which I'll eat in Charlotte.  They used to have a brick and mortar in what became a sketchy section of town (which is when I started with them), so they moved to this location and are now only carryout.\n\nTheir food is heaven.  We have a standard order:  lots of fresh spring rolls (vegetarian and full of noodles and vegetables and mint leaves with a peanutty dipping sauce that makes me have bad thoughts), tofu tod (deep fried tofu for the hubby with an even peanuttier dipping sauce), pad thai (no onions, no tofu, extra broccoli for me and no eggs for the hubby).  Mmmmmm\n\nWhen you call, you will be talking to Pim, who is a treasure.  I'm sure her husband, the cook, is also lovely, but I don't interact with him.  Pim will remember you and the vagaries of your order (see above) and is always super perky without being annoying.  Some other reviews mention that she has sometimes been a little optimistic about wait times, but I've recently heard her tell people on the phone \"be over an hour\", so she's getting more realistic.  If you'd like a Thai place in Charlotte that can get you food quickly, I can recommend several, but there's a reason Thai Thai has the wait it does.  THE FOOD.\n\nLOVE THEM.  Sorry.  I'll quit yelling.  You gotta go.  If only they'd get tables...sigh...
