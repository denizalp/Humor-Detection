I wish I could give this place zero stars. My friend and I spoke with the owner about the sign on the door, which overtly targets a particular group of people in a discriminatory fashion. The hostess first tried to say this is in line with other places such as grocery stores, which do not allow people to wear hoodies. This is a LIE and is completely ridiculous (As are most excuses for prejudice and discrimination). The owner then tried to say customers don't want to see someone's underwear while eating. Since he tried to act like this was about modesty for the good of customers, we asked what his policy was on women wear extremely low cut shirts. He joked he would give them a discount. So the owner feels the need to express racist and sexist views. I will not be patronizing this restaurant.
