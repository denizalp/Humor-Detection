I've been here twice.  Once late at night when I was pregnant and very sick with the flu and dehydrated.  And last night for a throbbing backache.  \n\nAnyway, both times it was a good experience.  From the front desk to the back of the office they were great;  The front desk asked for minimal paperwork to be filled out, they got me back immediately, everyone was really friendly and showed genuine concern, and they were all very efficient through the whole process.  I was in and out of there in less than an hour BOTH times.    The cost isn't bad either.  I paid $110 for an exam, a urine test and a script for antibiotics last night.  That wasn't too bad at all.\n\nThe first time I went they even called me on my cell a couple of days later to check on me and see if I was feeling better.  I thought that was really nice of them.\n\nWhile the place is a 'tad' small, it is very clean.  It isn't brand spanking new, but it is well cared for and really not all that old.\n\nI am impressed.  I will definitely be back a third time.\n\nThis beats all the other urgent care facilities I've ever had the unfortunate circumstance to use.  This one is a gem.  :)
