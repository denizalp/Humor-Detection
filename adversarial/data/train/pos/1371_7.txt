I stopped by to try this newer spot while they had a BOGO promotion going on. You could pick any drink on the menu and then for the free drink we had to pick 1 of 2 specific drinks. The music was a bit too loud for me making to hard to have a regular conversation at times. Decent amount of seating and the employees were friendly enough. The drinks for me though were very basic. With all the coffee and tea places in town, Chatime will need to step up their game. \n\nChatime Roasted Milk Tea ($4.25 for large size) - This was suggested by the guy who took my order. He says nobody else in town is doing it, a common phrase I here at the different boba shops I have been to, which makes me wonder lol. Anyway, this drink lacked flavor and I didn't like it. \n\nPearl Milk Tea ($4 for regular size) - This was the free drink I had as part of the promotion and it was more enjoyable than the previously mentioned drink. Basic, but better than the roasted milk tea. The boba was a bit hard and not enjoyable. \n\nThey also have smoothies and juice on the menu along with the milk and fruit teas.
