I wasn't super impressed. I thought the decor was sorta cool looking, but it smelled funny inside the restaurant... perhaps that's what healthy smells like. The menus were wrinkled dirty pieces of paper printed out on an HP inkjet, stapled together awkwardly and reused ten too many times. \n\nI didn't see much of anything on the menu that sparked my interest, but I got a burger anyway. I could tell it was quality meat and the bread was tasty but dense and thick. I sampled some sweet potato fries and though I'm not a fan, they actually tasted like sweet potato. It would seem that this place at least tries to live up to its image and the food here is quality. \n\nThose positives aside, I was almost set to give this place a 1 or 2 because the kid that served us was sort of a dick. He wouldn't look me in the eye or take my order - we had to chase him down to order something. Maybe he just rubbed me the wrong way. Perhaps he thought I was an asshole too. Hell, he probably grabbed on his balls and then touched all over my burger - which would make it extra funny to him that I said it tasted good. \n\nHowever you slice it, we went through our glasses of tap water down to chewing on the last bits of ice and he never once offered to refill them. He also just sucked at his job. Though there was a table of 6 hot young girls that seemed to be getting ample attention. Hmm...\n\nI left a lousy tip - something I pretty much never do... I usually even tip well when the service sucked. Might be in case I go back and don't want to get my food covered in balls. I don't plan on returning to this place. \n\nLocation-wise, it's a gorgeous spot off a not-too busy street. I still haven't figured out where I'm supposed to park, so I park illegally across the street at the motel.\n\np.s. I tried to get through this entire review without using the word pretentious to describe this place - aww crap, guess I sorta just did.
