I usually don't give half ratings, but Circus Circus is really a 3.5 - I've never stayed here myself, so I don't know how nice their rooms are, but I've heard it's a super good deal compared to other Vegas hotels.  \n\nCONS:\n- Lobby\/main entrance area is almost always filled w\/visitors packed in like sardines\n- People sleep in the lobby\/main entrance area like they're homeless...\n- Terrible ambiance, it always feels dirty and unsafe\n- Clowns suck\n\nPROS:\n- Great place for kids (Adventuredome and that place upstairs with carnival games)\n\nWhenever I'm in Vegas, I have to stop by Circus Circus, just because it's tradition.  My parents started bringing me here at the age of 4, just to play the carnival games.  I still remember that one time I made my father spend so much $ to win me this *Nsync poster.  I finally got it (the last one too) and a girl came up to me and offered me $100 for it.  I told her no - which I completely regret now :(  Another time, I brought my cousin with me to Adventuredome and we rode that big ship that swings back and forth.  It was my first time and I thought it was so fun, we rode it 3 times.  After the 3rd, she got off and threw up all over the place.  Good times!\n\nAs dirty and unsafe Circus Circus may seem, this place will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nP.S.  To all the people who don't understand why there are so many children in this hotel\/casino, NEWS FLASH, it's pretty obvious.  Las Vegas is pretty much a 21+ vacation destination, but what about families who have kids?  That's where Circus Circus comes in.  They target the people under 21 and they make bank off of that.  Use your brain, people.  No one comes here 'cause it's a beautiful hotel with sophisticated people (as much as I'd hate to admit, the Wynn for example), people come here for literally the \"circus\".
