I like Dick's Last Resort.\n\nI like to go in a group.  From experience I believe the atmosphere is cool and the food is mostly cool.  I think the wings are great.  The burger is good. The steak sandwhich not so much.  \n\nDick's is one of those fun for groups type of restaurants you should visit when you and the crew have been walking and drinking tiredlessly up and down the Vegas strip.  I  think everyone working there and acting like a dick is a lot better than going to other places where the food sucks and they are not ACTING like dick's but they are dick's.
