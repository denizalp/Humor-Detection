I will start with the negative, we were there to see Tiesto, it was $100 men and $40 women $140 for my wife and me. We were having a good time and met another couple, my wife and her new friend who had just got married decided to dance on the back part of a sofa, the part were everyone else was dancing. They were there having a good time, when a D-bag manager or pr guy decided to come over to the table in front, he hit on them but when he noticed that we were there as couples he told them to get down from there and in a rude way said \"you are regular people\". I do not know what that means, but we paid to get in and I was paying $30 for a beer and a small cup of vodka and cranberry. I do not know if I am regular people because I am Mexican, dark skin or not a high roller.   He was there like a good D bag drinking from the table bottle and bringing single girls. What ever he does to try to get laid it's cool but when someone that is supposed to be an authority and represent a high-end club calls the costumers \"regular people\". Something is wrong. \n\nI am sharing a picture in case you see him be aware he does not like \"regular people\" in his club, you need to spend $10,000 and get a table so he can hit on drunk girls and then you will not be \"regular people\". \n\nOne of the high points of the night was the guys that work in the bathroom, always nice, always smiling and never expecting or asking for a tip. They would always ask if you need anything else, if you were having fun and if you were ok. They do not get enough credit for the difficult job they have. \n\nThe music was great and the sound was good too. We liked the Tiesto blacelets they passed out. Also the line outside was very organized, there was a lot of people but the line was moving and the security people were not rude.
