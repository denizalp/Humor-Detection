Used to be a regular no maybe not.  Went In somewhat late and the server was going to sit us.  I asked about the all you can eat and the chef said that we were 1 minute too late. All that is fine except he was kind of a dick about it like he didn't want to be bothered.  I could have ordered everything we wanted at once and not bothered him and his precious schedule.  If you want to close early do that.  Don't keep your doors open if you don't want customers.  Won't be back as there are way too many options.  I loved the food but if you don't want money you succedded.
