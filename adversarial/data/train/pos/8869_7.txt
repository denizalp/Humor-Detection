I live close to this bakery and barely went  the second week in December.  As I entered there was two other women paying for their items in front of me.  I waited patiently but then asked how much a dozen of tamales were since I was really craving one...she replied $22.00.   She then continued to help the two other women who had purchased a few items. I noticed she also was  handing both of these women new calendars for the upcoming 2016 year.  Upon her serving me I asked her for just one tamale(since TO MYSELF  I thought $22 was quite expensive for a dozen and wanted to sample one first).  She gave me 1 tamale with a napkin and I then asked her for a fork so I could eat in in my vehicle immediately.  Acting cold like I was asking for too much she handed me one. I was curious to see if she was going to give me a 2016 calendar as well since she had given the other 2 ladies before me...she gave me my fork and nothing else.  I thanked her for her help and the tamale, she did not reply as I  exited the small bakery.  The tamale was good not excellent but not worth $22.00 a dozen either.  I could not believe her rude customer service her arrogance and how she did made me not want to ever return to her bakery.\nShe was quite rude and did not issue me a calendar.  Why?  Because I did not order more than 1 tamale?  I wasn't dressed up enough?  Clean enough, pretty enough?  She didn't like the way I looked?  I don't know but I was not given a calendar, even to keep me as a customer or given a response when I thanked her generously for her trouble giving me 1 with a fork.   I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS RUDE WOMAN'S BAKERY FOR THE SIMPLE FACT SHE WAS RUDE.  I MAY HAVE RETURNED AT ANOTHER TIME OR DAY FOR AN OVERPRICED DOZEN OF TAMALES, BUT WITH HER RUDE ATTITUDE AS IF SHE DOES NOT NEED CUSTOMERS, I WILL DO HER THE FAVOR AND NOT RETURN AND URGE MY FRIENDS, CO WORKERS, ETC., NOT TO GO TO OR BUY FROM TO EL FENIX BAKERY ON CENTRAL AVE., SIMPLY BECAUSE I DO NOT APPRECIATE BEING TREATED RUDE AFTER BUYING FROM YOUR BUSINESS.  THAT IS THE ONLY REASON I WILL NOT RETURN AND ADVISE MY ASSOCIATES NOT TO AS WELL. MAKING YOUR CUSTOMERS FEEL DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AFTER VISITING YOUR STORE BECAUSE OF THEIR PURCHASE OR WHATEVER REASON SHE HAD, IS THE REASON I WILL NOT OVERSPEND MY MONEY IN HER STORE NOW OR EVER.  DO NOT GO PEOPLE THIS PLACE THINKS THEY'RE THE ONLY BAKERY IN TOWN WHO MAKES TAMALES OR SWEET BREAD, I BEG TO DIFFER.
