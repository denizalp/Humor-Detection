This maybe the best bar in Mayfield. \nHere is why:\n\n1st off it is a total dive bar.\nNone of the riff raff associated with dive bars.\nHalf the juke box is Sinatra and Rat-pack.\n1.50 drafts\nHave decent food on the weekends.\nBest place for a night cap after you have been annoyed by all the chachis at the Fox, Boneyard, and or Panini's!\nCouples not ashamed to dance at the bar!\nFriendly bartenders.\nPictures of Mayfield from 50 or more years ago.\nBars that were once houses rock!\nBeef Jerky\nPlace to get a great buzz on for 10$\n\n\nYou get the picture!\nIf you are in the east side burbs and want to hit a dive bar, it does not get any better that this.  I challenge you to name a better place in this vicinity!
