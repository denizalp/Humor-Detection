For everyone's sake of a possible future trip to Sushi Ken, let me just tell you now: dont.\n\n1 star for location--close to home\n1 star for clean water glass and not bad tasting tap water\ntotal= 2 stars.\n\nNotice there are no stars for their food.\n\nI read a number of reviews before coming here and so many people raved about this being the best Japanese food in the valley...well, i can assure that does NOT include their sushi.  That's all i got (they should probably change their name btw!) and it truly was just bad. Yes, it was edible, but hardly.\n\nAnother reviewer mentioned that when getting his rolls he didn't pay attention to them making the rolls because he was eating his miso soup and edamame...well i fell prey to this as well. The first part of my spicy tuna roll was pretty good, but the pieces were overly large (4 of them) compared to the other 4...When i finally reached the other 4 pieces i noticed the consistency changed: the rice was hard and chewy and the tuna was dry and just not appetizing. I also ordered a California roll...the crab was dry, the avacado was brown and again, the rice was hard.\n\nNow, Sir who is \"making\" my sushi rolls RIGHT in front of me....how many times did you have to sneak each piece over to complete my order without me seeing\/knowing? I saw you make my to-go order fresh--as i watched you the entire time. Not cool.\n\nDo yourself a favor and try another sushi place. I can't speak for anything else but their sushi, but i would NOT recommend this place to one single person. Not even a person i hated. And to be quite honest, i feel as though i should take a star away for as awful as i feel right now--i didn't even finish 2 rolls. There is no reason for me to feel this way....just saying.
