Our dinner was disappointing, we were looking forward to this dinner and expecting a special treat, especially because the dry aged ribeye steaks are displayed on a glass case and they look delicious, they were seasoned ok, but there was no wow factor, it just tasted like an outback steak and to top it off it was chewy. My husband cooks better steaks from Publix than Gallagher's cooks its dry aged steaks. Also drinks took a while to come out, and the sides didn't make up for it, the mac and cheese was bland and I didn't care for the consistency, overall very disappointing, I wouldn't go back.
