You have to take labyrinth lounge like you do cough syrup; it's something you would have gone to as a student and unless you're looking to relive being a student or are a student you may feel like you just had cough syrup, with out the cough.\n\nThe location is fairly easy to find as long as you remember that the short form of labyrinth is lab.  Then its very easy to find. \n\nThe interior actually reminds me of many of the student bars in London, Ontario.  The brick walls and dimmed lighting almost makes me disappointed not to see some men, smoking cigars and playing poker in the corner.  The bar is perfectly positioned right at the entrance and the patio is large enough that I could envision it being a definite place to check out.\n\nI was here thanks to meeting up with everyone who took on the October 30days of reviews challenge.  My second yelp event and I have to say I had a good time meeting some new faces.  Definitely a crowd that could make any location or event into a good time.\n\nAs the bar was mainly dedicated to the yelp event,  the service was great and surprisingly the selection of alcohol  was not too bad either.  The food was mainly pub style so no big surprise here.\n\nAt the end of the day though I realized something.  I can give a location 1-5 stars but the experience  you have  and the bias you develop will be based on the people, both patrons and staff, you interact with.  And by those standards the lab was a 5 star tonight :)
