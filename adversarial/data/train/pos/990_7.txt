My experience here wasn't as bad as some of the others here, but it was adequate. Nothing spectacular, mind you, but okay.\n\nPros-\n- Location. For me, it is a convenient pit stop on the way to work. Easy to pull in, grab, and go.\n\nEhh-\n- I opted for the #18(Provolone, Roast Beef, and Turkey), and it tasted pretty good. Not as good as Capriottis, Jimmy Johns, Firehouse, or Beach Hut....but definitely better than Subway. Basically it was okay.\n- customer service was okay. again, nothing to set its self apart from other sub chains,  but adequate. The girl who grabbed my bread was nice, but kept coughing...which is something you just love to take in as they grab the bread for your sub. The other guys were very nice though.\n- priced a little on the high side, if you ask me. For less than a buck more, I can enjoy something from Capriottis! Only Subway is cheaper, though...as far as sub chains in the area go...\n\nCons-\n- portion sizes(especially as it pertains to meats) seem kinda skimpy \n\nI have only had Port of Subs maybe 3 or 4 times in my life, and it just does not impress me at all. Nothing was terrible or offensive, but with so many great options in the immediate area, I don't see myself coming here all that much.\n\n2 stars.\n\nMeh. I've experienced better.
