\"Please be advised that I will no longer be able to treat you as a patient.  To get the type of dental care you are looking for, I feel you would be better served at another dental office.  The termination of our physician\/patient relationship will be effective 30 days from the date of this letter.  The office will be available for emergency treatment only, so that you have adequate time to find another dentist.\" \n\nThe above verbiage is the entire body of the letter I received from Dr. Gabriel's office last month.  I also scanned the letter and uploaded it as a photo.  The letter is dated 10NOV2014, and I received it in the mail on 22NOV2014.  So much for those 30 days, huh?\n\nI don't know why I was essentially fired as a patient; this is a first for me, and I certainly didn't see this coming.  The letter offers no explanation, so stating the following is only speculation...\n* Perhaps the Front Desk didn't appreciate my calling out the lack of proper privacy policy in my original Yelp review.\n* Perhaps they weren't fond of my challenging the charge for \"fluoride varnish,\" which apparently is rarely covered by insurance companies and which wasn't brought to my attention prior to application. \n* Perhaps the hygienist didn't like me much.  I got that impression during my cleaning but opted not to reference the hygienist's grouchy--that's a relatively nice word; another word comes to mind--disposition in my first review.\n* Perhaps I'm too high-maintenance of a patient.  This office may just prefer patients who quietly come and go and don't ask questions.\n\nWho knows.\n\nAlso, not long before the letter was received my husband called and scheduled his first appointment at this office.  We have a unique last name, so I can't help but think the Front Desk knew about my situation and yet let my husband schedule his appointment anyway.  Needless to say he cancelled and won't be a patient here.  Nor will the other individual I referred.\n\nI sure will \"be better served at another dental office.\"\n\nWill I be filing a formal complaint through my insurance provider?  You bet.
