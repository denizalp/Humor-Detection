The location is pretty ideal, near a busy park (sunset park)and one of my favorite coffee shops in Vegas (sunrise coffee). We were excited to give this place a try. \n\nThe decor is nice and the seating is very comfortable. They have a few TVs on some of our favorite channels so that was a big plus. The waitress was very nice and quick. \n\nThe menu is pretty standard, and veggie options were pretty good. We ordered the vegan curry and fried basil rice with no egg and just veggies. They both came out relatively quick. The curry was a pretty small portion and we were both confused about how a veggie curry could be more expensive than the meat and fish curries...(minus one star) the mushrooms were really cold. Which was weird, because everything else was steaming hot. The curry is standard mild spice so make sure you ask for more heat if you like it spicy. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't super great. Over all, they have some awesome lunch specials that both of us would be willing to go back and try, but as for dinner and the price, go to komol or Nitayyas. They are also still waiting on their beer and wine license, And since it's a bar and bistro, I'm knocking them a star for that. My boyfriend liked the Thai coffee though. Give them a try and make your own opinion.
