Great spot for a picnic, or entertain young kids- if they're still into this sort of thing. I remember going to watch planes land and take off in a similar lot during my own childhood. It's not the most fun you can have without taking your clothes off, but it's somewhat educational. Use your phone to answer your kids' questions about lift and drag and crash rates, and tune your radio to hear the control tower messages.
