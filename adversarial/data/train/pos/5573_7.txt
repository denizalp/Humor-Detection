Finally my own 'Kitchen Nightmare'. I found plastic in my pancake roll with beef. Pulling out the long plastic strand--which was in between the layers of the pancake--felt like pulling out an ingrown hair... disgusting. Who knows what else was rolled in there? This was just unforgettable and unforgivable. \n\nI really wanted to like The Red. The decor was modern and you order on a tablet which updates the price as you select your food. Even the pancake with beef tasted pretty decent until I noticed the white plastic sticking out of my food. They did take the item off my bill, but frankly, the meal was ruined as I questioned what could be lurking in my other dishes. \n\nChinese restaurants often have a stigma of being unclean and having questionable quality standards. This doesn't have to be the case; there is no excuse to overlook hygiene in the kitchen. It saddens me greatly as what I experienced at The Red (and ironically this review) will further compound this negative impression on Chinese establishments. \n\nI personally will not return to The Red, but I hope the management team can improve cleanliness of the kitchen.
