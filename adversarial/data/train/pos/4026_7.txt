Meet Kale:  Your new friend with benefits,   ;D\n\nAfter a good work out, it's always nice to have a smoothie.  I'm not about that whole protein shake thing so give me that sweet unhealthy stuff.  I want sugar and loads of it.  Slap on a fun name like Peanut Butter Cup and I'm sold.  Peanut butter has protein, so I'm doing this work out thing right... right?\n\nSo this is a decently clean TSC. Service is ridiculously faster here than any other TSC I've been to. Drinks are still like $5.99 so if you want to make your smoothie at home, your buck will probably stretch more.  It's a super clean establishment considering some of the other TSCs I've been to looks like they never bus their tables or even pick up any stray napkins lying about.  I still haven't tried their food so I have no comments on that.  The staff here is actually friendly and informative!\n\nAll in all, this is a pretty good location.  It's in a quiet plaza next to the cheesesteak place so try to resist the smell of cheese and meats and enjoy a cold smoothie instead.  It's better for you, dang it!
