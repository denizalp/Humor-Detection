IQ Living is quite different than the other stores and business on the Danforth. \n\nGreat to browse around and check out the cool office and kitchen gadgets. Maybe you can find a nice and unique house warming gift? \n\nI was carrying my yoga mat on my shoulder so as my usual clumsy self, I really worry that I might knock things off the shelves when I was browsing around.... \n\nI definitely be back again to check out the cool things IQ Living carries!
