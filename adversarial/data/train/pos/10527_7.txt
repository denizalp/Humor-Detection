I've absolutely fallen in love with Modern Milk. Their prenatal yoga classes are absolutely fantastic; I'm addicted! I never liked yoga before I was pregnant, but the environment is so warm and supportive and the instructors give such a great (but appropriate) workout. I leave feeling so refreshed and more prepared for childbirth each time I leave. \n\nI also appreciate the friendliness of the staff and instructors and the cute boutique items they stock in the shop. Their class prices are also incredibly reasonable and make it easy to attend regularly.
