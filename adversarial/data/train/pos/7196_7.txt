Wine, wine, and more wine! How can you not love a wine tasting event!!!\n\nI was so excited about getting into this event since I love wine! Capital Grille is fancy! lol. We got to try 6 different wines that were paired up with little light bites. We started off with the white wines. I'm more of a red wine person but  I really liked the Riesling wine for this one. It was the sweeter one out of the three. However, as far as the food, I lovedddddd the scallops! For the red wines, my favorite type of red wine is Pinot Noir. & theirs was amazing!!!! For the food, my favorite was the Filet Mignon. It was just perfect and melts in your mouth. Yum! lol. \n\nNot only did we get spoiled with wine, but we got some Yelp goodies to take home with us! So much fun with my fellow Elites! Thank you so much Lindsey for another great event as always and thank you to Capital Grille for having us!!! =)
