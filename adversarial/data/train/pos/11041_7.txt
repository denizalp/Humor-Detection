I've passed by this firearm store many times since their grand opening, and purposely did not go in because I tend to spend hundreds of dollars on \"toys\" either by purchasing new equipment or by pimping out my current firearms. When I opened the door a beeping alarm went off and it startled me because I thought I opened the wrong door. Thankfully the owners were used to it and didn't seem to care much about the noise. Just like most gun stores there was the usual firearms displayed on the walls behind the counters, cases, ammo, magazines, and holsters in between the isles. Upon entrance, a very tall, bald, employee with a goatee asked me if I needed any assistance. I thought he was attractive, in a dangerous militia sorta way. Haha...\nI was there to look at tactical flashlights and they had a selection of SureFire brand. I was hoping there were other brands, but there wasn't. I did like that he recommended another brand called Fenix that was much cheaper and just as reliable as SureFire. He informed me that some tactical flashlight brands are now being powered by AA batteries. This is awesome because it gets expensive replacing 123A batteries at $9-15 a pop! I have a couple of Streamlight brands but just like when I purchased my fitness tracker, I like to do some research before spending more $$. I walked around some more and we chatted a little bit about tactical stuff and I was glad I stopped in. They are much cheaper than Lock & Load and American Shooters put together. They were very well stocked in the \"toys\" I seem to be looking for and if I wanted to purchase them right then and there it was available, unlike having to be put on an INFINITY WAITLIST. (see my American Shooters review). My birthday is coming up soon, and this place is will be on my wish list!
