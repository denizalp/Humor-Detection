Okay... you all know I love Caribou because of the free refills and wi-fi. I was a bit hesitant to go to this one because of a previous review stating they were lacking in outlets for us coffee shop office types... Well holy electric company! This place did it up!!! I'm surprised the tables themselves didn't have outlets.. so I was stoked! \n\nOkay, I had my bagel in hand from Bruegger's, ordered my latte and found a corner table where I could lay out all my goodies... \n\nThe coffee wasn't the problem... the outlet availability wasn't the problem... the problem was the uninterested and non-helpful staff. WTF people... \n\nI asked it they could turn down the BLARING music a bit as there were only four of us in there studying\/working. The two girls didn't even try to be polite, they just looked at me and said, \"NO\"... bitches really? And then they just turned around and continued their \"who I wished I got laid by\" conversation of the weekend haps... really girls? Trust me, no one wants to know if you were lucky in love or just laid over the weekend. \n\nSo i hightailed it out of there and headed to Starbucks. I left my coffee and took my bagel... Customer service is so important for a business... and I like a smiling professional face! \n\nWill I give this location another go... I do not know as I am pretty stubborn (Scorpio baby and all).\n\n\nThey accept AMEX
