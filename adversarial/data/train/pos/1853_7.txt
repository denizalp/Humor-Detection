Their DJs may be good but their doormens and bouncers are a joke. I'm 25 and I came to Vegas on my birthday weekend to celebrate and decided to go to XS through a friend's promoter. When the doorman checked my ID he told me to 'smile' because i smiled in my drivers license picture that I had taken a year ago (for an updated picture in situations like these). Apparently my smile didn't match my picture so he asked me a bunch of questions like my birthday which of course I know clearly but when I was asked what my high school graduation was I accidentally gave the year of my college graduation (keep in mind I was half drunk from pre-gaming with friends and I was nervous that they even asked), which then led the doorman to tell me I had to be pulled aside to be verified by a manager. I was pissed. I didn't have a debit card with me to verify my name because I was using a giftcard visa to use on my trip. I tried pulling up my facebook, my emails, my instagram to verify my identity but the manager spent like 2 minutes looking at my ID then looking at my face then back at my ID. He eventually gave me the okay and let me in but my mood was shot to hell by then and I left the club within 30 minutes of entering. During this whole debacle one of the girls in our group was not let in because they didn't believe her ID was hers even though she had her birth certificate with her. Yeah XS is known to be a strict place but jesus you can't kick someone out just because you think they don't look like their picture. I'm never coming back here again.
