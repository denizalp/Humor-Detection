I've been frequenting this spot for about 7-8 years and I have to say that that the level of food quality is declining. \n\nThis used to be a great spot to take everyone because I was sure they would love the food and ambiance but in recent years the ambiance has remained in tact and the menu\/chef has declined. Beware, the surrounding area is pretty scary at night. \n\nThe sushi appetizers are all absolutely delicious: namely aunt leis roll and the sunrise. You can't go wrong. \n\nEntrees are iffy...the menu has changed. The butterfish is the best on the menu but the tempura sea bass is HORRIBLE.  Very poor execution. So bad that it was the first and only dish that I've returned in my life at any restaurant. It's oily and covers the flavor of the fish (waitress specifically recommended it stating that it's surprisingly not oily). I've also had the poached, somewhat dry lobster. Guests of mine have had non fish dishes and I've heard mixed reviews. \n\nAs far as cocktails go, the Hawaiian martini is amazing and the desserts are all top notch if you have room. (Order early as they take a while to make). \n\nOne note: the waitstaff is always impeccable and helpful. They are trained well in always satisfying the customer (waitress that recommended the returned sea bass was overly apologetic to the point that I felt bad).
