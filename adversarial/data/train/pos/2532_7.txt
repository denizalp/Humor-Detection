Kabob Grill. I was entering the Twilight Hunger Zone when I visited. You've been there. You missed lunch, it's still 2 hours until dinner and you are hungry!\n\nSolution= heavy appetizers. Hummus plate and Baba Ganoush. The Hummus was super creamy, heavy on the tahini and was presented nicely with pickled veggies = delicious. The Baba Ganoush was even better - beefy, smoky eggplant goodness = highly addictive and very filling. The pita come wrapped in little baggies to keep them fresh.\n\nOur waiter had oodles of personality and joked around a bit.\n\nQuick disclosure Efes tastes like Budweiser - just be aware when you order it. \n\nSo, I can't speak for any of the dinner plates, but apps only. I did think the prices were on the high side but we were ordering from the dinner menu. Maybe it's cheaper at lunch.
