Come here if you want to be talked down to like a child.  The eye candy behind the counters are obviously there for looks and not because of their extensive knowledge of firearms (but that's okay....just don't come expecting very much help).\n\nOverall.....VERY VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Wish I could leave a negative star rating.
