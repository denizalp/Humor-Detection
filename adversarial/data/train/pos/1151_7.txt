Ok let me start off by saying I have eaten at the clarendon kitchen before it was thankfully demolished. My gf got such bad food poisoning she was barfing in a Harkins Loyelty cup on the freeway, because she couldnt make it to pull over. After emtying it several times out the window to refill it, she had a cold sweat for the rest of the night.\n\nI think she lost like 4 lbs and she is super tiny to begin with so by the next day she was skeletor... So naturally I was jealous, not really, but kinda.. no I kid, but seriously... \n\nSo enough background on the horror this spot was. \n\nAt first we were leary but when we arrived it was completely open and gutted, you could see the kitchen which for a germy like me that is a beautiful thing. \n\nThe menu is small and slightly hard to read at first. \n\nWe ordered the guacamole before I realized it was 7 bucks. When we got it it looked like the chunks would be too big for my gf liking (because I micro manage how she eats) after one bite this shit was definatly the best guac Ive had, for real. I heard about the mandarines which I actually hate, so I was a skeptic.. no it was delicious. \n\nI got beef tacos which were melt in your mouth. \nthe veggie was pretty good but had mushrooms, I fucking hate mushrooms. Those sick ass little horse pissed on poop bi products. \nAside from the mushrooms it was very tasty, i would get them again minus the poopy shrooms. \n\nOh the best part is they serve the coke in a can and its a buck... finally someone gets that its a joke to charge 2.50 for a fucking soda.\n\nAwesome job, Ill be coming back to try some breakfast or hang out and try that beer you doctor up. \n\nIf you ever ate at clarendon kitchen , dont be scared its nothing like that nightmare !!!!
