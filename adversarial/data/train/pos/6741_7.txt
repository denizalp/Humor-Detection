I still consider myself new to beers.  We came here with a group.  The place is small and the sign is not very noticeable.  You blink and you miss it, and so did we; we had to go around the block and try again and found a parking spot.  It is in a small almost craftsman style home.  Everyone loved their beers.  I only tried one and it was really nice.  I don't remember the name, because I asked the owner?? what he would recommend to someone who drinks lighter beers.  He served me one that was perfect.  They offer some panini from Noble Eatery, but you can also bring your own.  We ended up bringing some calzone from a nearby place.  Too bad it is really far for us, but if I am in the area, I will definitely come back.
