How long did it take to get nachos? Twenty to thirty minutes.\nWHY? That makes no sense. I can make nachos in one minute. Tortilla chips, cheese, other crap, BAM, NACHOS!\n\nYou'd think after taking so long for the appetizer, they would get the main course service dialed in. Wrong. It took over half an hour to get our food. The most annoying part was they kept saying that there was \"a bit\" of a wait. 10 minutes is a bit of a wait. 15 is a bit of a wait. Over forty minutes is a damn long wait.\n\nThe food was good, but honestly for how expensive it was I was expecting better. The biggest kick in the face at this place was when we asked the manager, after having waited for so long, when our food was coming out. He said: \"would you like to see it? I can show it to you.\" Not pleased with that. I should have said, \"no I don't want to see it, I want to eat it and that's the problem!\" Unfortunately I think I actually said, uhhh....yeah...I want to see it?\n\nPass.
