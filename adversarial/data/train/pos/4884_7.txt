I like Panda Express and believe they can be as healthy as you want your food to be. Some of their dishes have 500 to 700 calories per serving, but others have a much healthier alternative with 150 to 210 calories. I usually substitute all or half of my rice for steamed veggies. The veggies fill you up without the calories. It's up to you how healthy or not you want to be.\n\nThe service at this particular location was quick. We were greeted right away with a warm smile. I was out the door in about 5 minutes. \n\nI can say that the tables and floor were clean here. Cup lids, straws, napkins and utensils were all stocked.\n\nPanda Express is another 'fast food' organization I would like to see start moving away from GMOs and into Organic ingredients.
