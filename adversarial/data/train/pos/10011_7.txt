It was my husband's 40-something birthday, and he was craving Italian. We didn't have a reservation, but it was Sunday night so we thought we'd take our chances. We checked out the line at Girasole, and, of course, it was too long...so we found ourselves across the street at Up.\n\nWithin the first few minutes, we were starting to regret our decision. They were out of half of the items on the menu and the beer list. Some things on the specials board were still left over from lunch--and likewise unavailable.  Our snooty waiter told us repeatedly that we couldn't make ANY modifications to the menu. At first we had only asked for the sauce on the side. SERIOUSLY?!? Even McDonald's can put the sauce on the side! The only other thing was that my husband wanted a side dish of pasta of the pasta that was already on the menu. We pleaded with the waiter: we'd pay any price. Also, it was his birthday!\n\nWhen the dish came, it had no sauce instead of sauce on the side. Oh, well. They came through with the pasta. Well, I should hope so--how hard is a side of pasta with sauce that is already on the menu?\n\nI had the 1\/2 chicken. It arrived looking juicy and delicious. I opened it up. Ugh. 1\/4 of it was undercooked!!! Let's all say it together: salmonella. I sent the thigh and leg back. Of course, when it re-arrived, it was no longer juicy or appetizing. The breast was actually quite good, but it was overshadowed by the undercooked dark meat.\n\nMy daughter had the tuna. Yes, dear waiter, my daughter likes raw fish. We can read, thank you. It was delicious, actually. I would like to have tried to sauce that was supposed to have been served on the side! Anyway.\n\nMy husband had the meatball sub, and said it was good. The pasta was pasta. The fries were fries. Nothing to write home about.
