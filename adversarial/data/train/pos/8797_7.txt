YUM!  sushi was the perfect thing to eat after getting my teeth cleaned down the street.  soft food that won't hurt your slightly sore teeth\/gums.\n\nsmall place...probably only seats 50 people (including the sushi bar).  service was excellent.  probably not a place to come to if you're staying on the strip (as it's about 20 mins away), but i have family here and i love that they take me to the off-the-strip places.\n\nall you can eat lunch for $21.95.  came here with my cousins and i let them do all the ordering.  there were two large full pages of sushi, rolls, specialties and sides to choose from.  we didn't get any rolls, because of the \"too filling\" factor.  i liked that the cooked items such as tempura and calamari came in servings of 4 pieces so it was enough for each of us to have one and move on to the next item.  the sides (cold salads) are a very good accompaniment.    \n\ni never find the quality of fish to be that spectacular at AYCE places, but sushi mon was quite good!  the white tuna (that i'd never had before) melted in my mouth!    \n\nend your meal with the plum ice cream.  with many pieces of actual plum in it, it's so yummy!  then again, since it's AYCE, get the red bean and green tea too!\n\n(ROTD #4)
