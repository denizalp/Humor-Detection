The Barley House sucks.  Period.\n\nThis has been my Barley House experience all 5 or so times I've been there on a weekend night.\n\nStep 1... See a large crowd outside of The Barley House\n\nStep 2... Friends say \"Hey!  Barley House looks packed, let's go there!\"\n\nStep 3... Walk in and look around.  See the entire place packed with guys, no dance floor, and no room to order at the bar.\n\nStep 4... Say to your friends \"Umm... I gotta hit the bathroom.  Want to do that first, then get a drink?\"\n\nStep 5... Friends agree and you shoulder past 50 feet of sweaty guys leaning over the bar.  Half them briefly glance out of corner of their eye see if a hot girl is in your group, then go back to trying to order a Bud Light.\n\nStep 6... Go into restroom.  Chuckle for 5 seconds about the pictures above the urinals.\n\nStep 5... Awkwardly accept a hand towel from a bathroom attendant\n\nStep 6... Meet up with your friends at the back of the bar.\n\nStep 7... All collectively agree that it's \"really hot in here\" and you'll \"just do one drink then head out\"\n\nStep 8... Spend 5 minutes waiting to flag down a bartender\n\nStep 9... Order a very simple drink or beer (they can't do complex drinks right... even if they're a special I've found out)\n\nStep 10... get one of those $5 or $8 test-tube shot glass drinks from a server walking around (which actually are pretty good).\n\nStep 11... Finish your drink and leave.\n\nSo if that sounds like fun, then give the Barley House a shot... if not try Liquid or Drop Bar Instead.
