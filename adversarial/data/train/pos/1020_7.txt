Rob is a carpet cleaning monster!!  He showed up to clean the 4,000 square feet of carpeting at my office at noon on Christmas Eve Eve (23rd) and he worked like a machine until the old, faded carpet looked brand spanking new!  It was hours and hours of hard work and he did it efficiently and with a smile!  The sludge that he pulled out of our office carpets was easily the most distressing thing I've seen in a long time.  So gross!!\n\nRob left me with a bottle of cleaning solution for touch ups and even gave me a bottle of solution for the occasional accidents my two cats have at home too!  (Thank you!)  Later he called me to follow up on my satisfaction and offered to come back if anything wasn't perfect.\n\nThe price was absolutely reasonable and he didn't try any silly pricing games with me either.  I knew the price per square foot going in and the price stayed that way when I went to pay.  \n\nHow many carpet cleaners can you say the same about?  That's what I thought...\n\nIf you need your carpets cleaned, I mean REALLY cleaned, not just kinda cleaned and you don't want any BS pricing games then you have to call Rob.  In fact, I plan on scheduling him to come clean my house carpets as soon as I finish some home improvement projects.  See you soon, Rob!
