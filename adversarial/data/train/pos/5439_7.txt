First time having Venezias was a surprisingly nice experience. I expected chain store take out box pizza. What I got was a finely crafted New York style pizza, and yes, you could fold the rather large slice over and eat it like New Yorkers do. The toppings were generous and evenly distributed. The crust was soft and thin not chewy. It had a nice tasting sauce that worked well with the toppings. The pizza could have had a little more cheese to suit me. I will be ordering this pizza in the future if not dining in at the restaurant.
