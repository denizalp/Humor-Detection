This Paradise Bakery is one of the few spots to grab a healthy salad in the fast food Bell strip through Surprise. Their cookies are excellent and their salads are great.\n\nOne of the employees even loaned my an iphone 6 charger which really saved the day.\n\nGreat service\nGreat food\nNice ambiance\n\nCaveat....get here early on weekdays and on Saturday's and Sundays this place is a human zoo! \n\nDoes anyone work in Surprise?
