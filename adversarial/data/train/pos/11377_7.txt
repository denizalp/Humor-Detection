Made my order and the friendly Cane'nette, gave me a quick once over and asked about the military, then proceeded to tap her register including (subtracting) the military discount. She then advised me to mention it on all future visits. That's bonus points right there. \n\nCane's has one of the simplest menus going but what's on the menu is what everyone's here for. Light batter fried chicken tenders and delicious thin crinkled fries. If that's not your thing, don't bother.  Most (disclaimer No.1) people who like fried chicken strips, really really like Cane's and then there is everybody else.\n\nWhen you order there is going to be a wait because they prepare your food at that time. Nine times out of ten (disclaimer No.2) it's presented to you hot so be careful for the sake of your mouth. \n\nServed with a thick piece of Texas toast - light crunch on the outside and soft in the middle. Order the 4 piece strips and you get coleslaw to boot. \n\nPlenty of seating inside and a drive-thru for the grab and go crowd. Note for the car clans, there's going to be a wait in line because just like inside, it's made when you order.  Turn on your radio and relax.
