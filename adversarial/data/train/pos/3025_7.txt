Amazing. \n\nAmazing I've been here 5 months and never heard a peep about this place. \nAmazing that happy hour starts at 3.... 3! That's when I wake up most days. \nAmazing staff.\nAmazing but odd but quirky but charming but warm interior. \nAmazing it's in Fitchburg. Sorry Fitchburg but the rest of my meals there have been lackluster.\n\nAnd Veranda takes the title of Best Mussels I Ever Ate. This isn't an official contest sanctioned by Yelp or anything, just something random I made up right now, but it bears repeating... Veranda in Fitchburg has the Best Mussels I Ever Ate. They're huge... HUGE, and they're served in a simple Chablis and butter broth. What's Chablis you ask? Well here's a funny story...\n\nIt was my junior year in college and my friend and acting classmate Mary and I decided it would be fun to buy a new wine every Sunday (because we were legal) and read a bit about it in this book she received as a gift about wine. Being college students we wanted to get the most bang for our buck so we walked out of Meijer with a jug of Chablis. We poured two glasses, nuzzled up on the couch, and flipped to the white section and to the C's to begin learning. \n\nChampagne\nChardonnay\nChenin blanc\n\nWait a minute... what happened to Chablis? Apparently our book decided Chablis wasn't worth mentioning. Apparently neither to most wine drinkers, bartenders and residents of Chablis. That was the end of our weekly wine tasting. However, in this instance I'm happy to report it made for some bomb broth. \n\nMy dinner date and I also shared some charcuterie, I'll tell you a story about charcuterie later. That was phenomenal as well. And so was the bruschetta starter where you can select 4 from a list of 8 or so. 8 different sorts? It's true. \n\nAll in all it was an awesome evening and I can't wait to get back there for more!
