I would never have set foot into a Macaroni Grill - which I went to only once in New Jersey before most of you young Yelpersnappers were born - had it not been for one of those \"have a free dinner on us\" presentations that try to suck your money out of you.  We went because the hosts claimed they weren't selling anything.  And, hey, you can't beat free.\n\nSo I was pleasantly surprised when we were led to a comfortable table in a kinda private part of the restaurant, where we were given set menus to choose our dinners from.  I verified later that these were regular menu items, not some rubber chicken specials thrown together Ã  la tour groups.\n\nA nice salad was followed by our entrees, Shrimp Portofino for me and the Grilled Salmon for my husband.  I was surprised by the abundance of meaty shrimp in the pasta dish, together with spinach and fresh mushrooms, and both were perfectly cooked.  The only flaw was the complete absence of the touted pignoli.  When I asked our wonderful waitress about it later, she said she'd noticed it, too, and had asked the chef if they were in the dish.  \"He said 'yeah, two.' \"  Two pine nuts?  I must have missed 'em, and they didn't make an appearance in the leftover pasta I had the next night.\n\nThe salmon was awesome.  I would have ordered it - it was highly recommended by the waitress - except the menu said it came with \"sun-dried tomato orzo,\" and I'm not wild about sun-dried tomatoes.  But when I tasted it, I couldn't believe how fantastic it was, and now I want to go back and order the salmon.\n\nEven the coffee - freshly brewed just for me - was excellent, and I'm really picky about my coffee.  \n\nMy dessert was the pitcher of milk accidently spilled on me by the otherwise-terrific waitress, on a brand-new shirt, of course.  But that wasn't enough to mar a serendipitously delicious dinner.  The pine nuts, on the other hand...
