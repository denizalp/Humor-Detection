Poop on a plate!\n\nThis is the kind of place where your food is probably prepared in advance and frozen, then reheated for you to \"enjoy\" and deploy.  \n\nMy plate was packed with a sloppy, soggy assortment of enchilada's, each stuffed with a bland mystery meat. I couldn't decide if I should eat them or just skip the middle man and dump em' right in the shitter. \n\nAnd to think I gave this place a second chance. Never again!
