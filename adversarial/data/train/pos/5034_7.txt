The folks here are one of the most professional and friendly service people I've ever dealt with. They would go out of their way (within their control) to make the customer happy.  However, typical of Service Departments at dealerships, they do charge an arm and leg for some things that can be done elsewhere. \nI've learnt my lesson a few times, and for some reason, I fail to ask the right questions before it's too late. \n\nThe dealerships also offers good promotions, and worthwhile to take advantage of. \n\nI came here the first time, with an appointment for an annual maintenance.  For some reason, my appt wasn't booked in when I showed up at 830am that morning. I ended up going to work, and someone came to pick up my car (2 guys in a VW van) , then come pick me again in the afternoon to get my car. \n\nThe 2nd time I was here, was to take advantage of their Free Winter Tire checkup promotion. In the end, they found that I had to replace my wipers - which was fine. This is my first car, I don't know mow much these things should cost - and I've learnt now to ask the right questions. I probably could have saved $20. \nIt was $20 for labour and $18 for each wiper. But given I made them check my car for free, I guess they wanted to find something, but next time I will go do this myself elsewhere. \n\nI also got a free Snow Brush in my car as a present, and they washed the exterior.
