It is my favorite spot for lunch with my co-workers. With their new wide expansion, they opened in several new locations. Hence, you do not need to drive far to find one.\n\nAt first, i love and really love their decor. The metallic yellow with the black and white mood and feel, modern design, eclectic style, fresh atmosphere make this pizzeria a great destination for an enjoyable lunch. \n\nThe service is always fast. \nThey even offer delivery is some of their locations.\n\nTheir menu is small, wich give the  opportunity to try all their pizza. Every time I try one. I am always happy with their crunchy authentic pizza , not very big. It is perfect for lunch. \nThey have the sweet ones with fig, they also have the salty ones with salami. \nAll their pizzas come with arugula salad or Cesar salad. \n\nLately, I've been going for the Calzone. The melting mozzarella with the italian sausage is mouth watering. Pair it with a good red wine and you will defenetly spend a great time at one of the fastest growing pizza place in montreal.
