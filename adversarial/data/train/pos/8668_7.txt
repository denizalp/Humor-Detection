3.5\n\nSlow service\nWaitress spilled my Guiness on me\nShe was cute but she was talking with her hands.....it was bound to happen and i knew it!!!!! i purposely moved my Guinness so she would not knock it and took a sip, stupidly i put the drink back...2 secs later BAM LOL she was cute though so she was lucky but we never got cutlery to eat our goat cheese app, it took her awhile to take our order.  Once we ordered we got the food in good time.\nthe wings were tasty but there's no wing night there??? hello!! \n\nall in all not bad, i would go for the wings again.
