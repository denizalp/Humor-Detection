How many times have I bemoaned the lack of good barbeque in Las Vegas? \n\nWhy is it so hard to find good barbeque here? Oh, that's right - most barbeque places are JUST PLAIN LAZY!\n\nI understand barbecue takes time, hours and hours in fact. But as long as there are places in this world like Franklin Barbecue in Austin, TX, where Mr. Franklin smokes his brisket for 16 hours before serving, not one single place in this town is going to get a break with their \"how do I get this done quickly?\" methods.\n\nNow listen, I really like Big Ern. I have met the man and he is a genuinely nice man. I will honestly say that I think he does put a lot of heart into his cooking. His barbeque is pretty good, and I have stopped in on several occasions. \n\nI will say that when it comes to barbeque, Big Ern is kicking everybody's but here in Vegas. I love you for that Big Ern - I really do, but your just not there yet. \n\nAs for the rest of you barbeque wannabees in Vegas - pack up and go home, before I step it up and show you all what real barbeque tastes like.
