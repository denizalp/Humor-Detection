Love the set up of Lake Wilcox Brewing's Brewery Pub!\n\nBright and spacious! Just so enjoyable to have a drink right at the bar or in one of the communal tables.\n\nHave a sampler flight or even a pint in their tap room. Here you will find their usual beers which are available at LCBO. I personally would recommend giving their Small Batch Limited Release which changes regularly a try.\n\nAnd the best part is to pick up some cans and fill up a growler right here directly at source. You cannot get more local than this! And there is not too many local brewery in the area.\n\nCheck their instagram feed for the most updated specials and events. BTW there is usually freshly shucked oysters available on Saturday from the Cannon Oyster Co and lunch service from Thursday to Sunday.
