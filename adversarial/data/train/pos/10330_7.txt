I gotta say they have the worst service in town!!! I went there with my friends yesterday for CNY dinner. We had to wait a long time for each of dish that we ordered to come out. Not only the wait of the dish, they even forgot the food that we order till we finish the dinner of the day!!! They even forgot the water that we asked as well. Worst thing is, by the time we paid, THEY CHASED US FOR MORE TIPS!!!!! Yes, you heard me right!! They literally came up to us and ask us for more tip FOR THEIR POOR SERVICE EVEN WITHOUT ANY APOLOGIES FOR THEIR  NEGLIGENCE ! I swear to god I'm not coming back here ever again.
