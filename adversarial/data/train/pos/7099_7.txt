I have not been to Mon Ami Gabi for about 10 years.  I don't remember it being too great, but I thought I would give it another try last week.  I was traveling in Vegas for work, and having dinner solo that evening.  I went in around 8:30pm and sat at the bar.  The first thing I noticed was the numerous servers standing around, and just chatting with each other.  They were definitely overstaffed.\n\nI got the bartenders attention, and ordered a glass of Bordeaux.  I was bothered that she served it to me in a small white wine glass.  I noticed that other patrons were served in Bordeaux glasses, but she elected to just quickly give it to me.  She even opened a new bottle, and did no offer me a taste.\n\nThis was basically how the entire meal went for me.  I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt, and she definitely gave the attention to an older gentleman wearing a suit at the end of the bar. I usually don't weigh service as an issue at restaurants, but I do take offense when I am ignored for wearing a t-shirt, or if nobody says goodbye to me when i leave.  I definitely had an experience with both of these at the restaurant.\n\nTo eatm I had the filet and a side salad.  Both were mediocre, and nothing fantastic.  If I was rating the food alone, this would be a 3 star dinner.  However, the service clearly makes me drop Mon Ami down by at least a star.  In my opinion, for the price, 2 stars is very generous.  I suggest passing and trying another french bistro (Bouchon or DB Brasserie).
