First, The customer service here from the minute you walk in is inviting and friendly.  Our waitress was very attentive and made sure we were ok throughout our meal . \n\nOn to the food , I came here with coworkers because they thought you could do a lettuce wrapped burger option but they don't , bummer  bc I'm sure most come here for the sandwich\/burger menu items .\n\nI ended up ordering the southern salad with avocado , came with tomatoes and a mixture of black beans, corn , & pinto beans . No red onion though .... hmmmmmmmmmmmmm And to add chicken it was a $4up charge.  I don't think avocado should even be in the description of this salad it was two slivers on the top kinda like a garnishment.  I ordered extra beforehand bc i love avocado , honestly it was the reason I got the salad bc i thought there would be enough . The avocado was brown and even with my extra slivers it was less than a quarter of an avocado half and I wish I would've known they charged $1.50 for extra that's more than a whole avocado at Harris teeter , but does anyone actually come here for the $9 salads well $10 In my case .\n\nOther orders included:\n\n-Fried chicken and waffle sandwich with chips ,-He said it was ok, the chips were chewy \n-Fried Fish . She loved it and she said the handcut fries were good as well. \n\nAll in all if you're a sandwich, burger , beer , milkshake enthusiasts I'm certain there will be a yummy option for you here . I'm just a gluten free avocado lover that couldn't indulge .
