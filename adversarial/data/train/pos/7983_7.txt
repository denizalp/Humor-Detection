This poke place is among many that opened on rainbow last year. It is in the same plaza as goodwill. I've been to this establishment twice and the second time was just as good as the first. \n\nPoke poku is similar to the other poke places in the way that it's a chipotle style way of ordering. I ordered a small bowl & that came with 2 scoops of protein. She pulled out the bowl & I thought to myself, \"wow. That is so small. How am I supposed to get full off of that...\" to my surprise, I could barely finish it. They really pack on the protein & the fix-ins! So the reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because of their shrimp tempura & soft-shell crab. I think it's great that the shrimp tempura isn't extra & you can just add it to your bowl, BUT when I tried it the first time I came here... it was horrible. It was cold & stale & not edible. I learned the second time I was here, but my friend got the soft shell crab & he made the same comments. I think they should really fix that. \n\nThe service here though is A1!! Will come back but probs not for the fried stuff lol.
