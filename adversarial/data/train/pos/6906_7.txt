Mmmmmm Coffeeeeeeeee.... was my first thought when I walked in here and got the whiff of coffee that hit me. It smelled amazing the minute I walked in. \n\nI always need my morning cup of joe before I even start my day. Thanks to yelp and the discussion thread that Lindsey started I really wanted to try this place out since it is so close to my work. \n\nI've heard a lot of good things about the White Russian Mocha so I had to try it out and I definitely wasn't disappointed! It was delicious and the staff there was also very friendly and welcoming. I really will have to come back here to try the rest of their menu and their other coffees. My only negative about this place was that it was a little hard to find. I drove around for a while before I actually found it because it is kind of tucked away in the back of the shopping center. \n\nI'll definitely be back here on my days where I don't have time to make my morning coffee. Thank you fellow yelpers for the recommendation as always. =)
