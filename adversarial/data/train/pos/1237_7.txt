Atmosphere is Dark & Sexy which made me stood out from the crowd as I'm neither Dark or Sexy. I'm the guy that is pissed because I got teased by fake Hookah that doesn't have Tobacco. It's like a Nicotine Patch or those Fake Cigarettes. Obviously laws restrict having indoor Sheesha but it's a nice way to get someone back on the wagon. \n\nIt was a good experience overall and now I understand why my Friend commented some Persians have full-scale bellies. Eat an enormous meal and then lay down and smoke it up while enjoying sugary Teas. Now that's the lifestyle we should adopt and love. I want to take a before-and-after photo of me and my Persian friend now. :D \n\nGol o' Bolbol(Saffron Ice Cream w\/Rosewater Faloodeh $6.00), Koma Chai Chai(Persian Tea $4.50) and Hookah were all very complementary to this relaxing environment after our dinner from across the street. \n\nHowever I guess I missed out on how to rest properly because that WOODEN back of the benches was uncomfortable to most of my body parts even 5 cushions didn't work and I don't have enough body fat yet to cushion myself. The Hookah extensions kept knocking over someone's glassware on the table.\n\nNow it makes me want to smoke in lying down on the seats while watching a sports game and snooze away.  It was almost to that level of comfort and enjoyment.  The only staff there was amazingly friendly gentleman that did everything for us.\n\nThanks Bijan for sharing this with us.
